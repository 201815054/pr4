(Reuters) - Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman pocketed at least $610.5 million in 2020 from dividends and compensation, more than any other private equity executive and up 20% from last year despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory filings showed. 
The majority of the windfall stemmed from Schwarzman's 19.3% stake in Blackstone. Its distributable earnings jumped 16% year-over-year in 2020 as the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as real estate and private equity capitalized on the capital market's rally following the Federal Reserve's moves to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic.
Schwarzman, 74, received $86.4 million in compensation and $524.1 million in dividends from his Blackstone shares, a regulatory filing showed on Friday. His net worth is currently pegged by Forbes at $22.3 billion.
Blackstone President Jonathan Gray, Schwarzman's No. 2, took home at least $216.1 million in 2020, consisting of $123.2 million in compensation and $92.8 million in dividends from the company's shares he owns, the filing showed. Gray, 51, has a net worth of $4.5 billion, according to Forbes.
""Executive compensation at Blackstone is directly tied to investor and shareholder performance,"" a Blackstone spokesman said in a statement, adding that most of it reflected realized performance fees from investments and long-dated stock grants.
Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc Chairman Leon Black, who agreed to relinquish his role as the company's CEO by July following an investigation of his ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, collected at least $185.2 million in 2020, another regulatory filing showed.
Black, 69, received $423,687 in compensation, $182.3 million in dividends from his Apollo shares and $2.5 million from his personal investments in the firm's funds. His net worth is pegged at $8.5 billion, according to Forbes.
Marc Rowan, Apollo's incoming CEO, pocketed at least $92.6 million, comprising $72.3 million in dividends and $20.3 million in distributions from his fund investments. Rowan's compensation as an Apollo co-founder and senior managing director was not reported. He is estimated by Forbes to be worth $3.9 billion.
KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc co-founders and co-Chief Executives Henry Kravis and George Roberts collected at least $81.3 million and $85.4 million respectively, primarily from their holdings in the firm, a regulatory filing showed.
Kravis, 77, received $42 million in compensation and $39.3 million in dividends from his KKR shares, while Roberts, also 77, took home $42 million in compensation and $85.4 million in dividends from his KKR shares. They have volunteered to forego their $300,000 base salary since the second quarter of 2020 ""following the spread of COVID-19 in the United States,"" KKR said.
Kravis is worth $7.2 billion and his cousin, Roberts, is worth $7.4 billion, according to Forbes.

Washington, D.C-based  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc has not yet filed regulatory reports containing information on the compensation and dividends of its chief executive, Kewsong Lee, and its founders David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello.

Investing.com – The Dow jumped Monday, led by financials on positive vaccine news and stimulus progress, while tech stocks look to put last month's wobble in the rear view mirror.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.1%, or 657 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.9%. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine received approval from the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend, with about 20 million doses expected to be rolled out this month and 100 million by June. The approval provided a boost to the pace of vaccinations across the U.S., stoking expectations for a stronger reopening just as progress continues to be made on the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill.
The $1.9 trillion fiscal package, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks, was passed by the House of Representatives over the weekend. It is destined for a vote in the Senate.
The vaccine optimism and hopes over further stimulus being rolled out sooner rather later triggered a rally in financials with airlines also garnering investor attention.
Financials were also in favor, with  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) up more than 3%, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) rallied 6% as Jane Fraser took up the reins on Monday.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said Citi assets are more valuable as a sum of parts rather than a whole, as there is ""significant hidden value and trapped capital,"" in the business.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) was up 0.5% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AAL) were up more than 1%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose 5% after United Airlines said it would buy 25 additional Boeing 737 Max planes and take delivery of other orders earlier than previously planned.
Tech, meanwhile, found its footing after a recent wobble as sharp uptick in U.S. bond yields that led to the recent rout in tech steadied.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led big tech higher, while jump in  semiconductor stocks  also added gains to the sector. Apple said all its stores have been reopened in the U.S. for the first time since lockdowns began last year.  
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)  traded higher on the day.
In other news, stay-at-home stocks also rebounded, with  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) up about 9% ahead of its quarterly results due after markets close. Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) and DocuSign  (NASDAQ:DOCU) were up sharply. "

LONDON (Reuters) - Twitter said it would apply warnings to tweets that contain misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines and implement a strike system of enforcement that could see users permanently banned for repeat violations.
The social media network started promoting public health information before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. It also aimed to remove demonstrably false or misleading content about the virus that had the highest risk of causing harm.
Since introducing its COVID-19 guidance, it said it had removed more than 8,400 tweets and challenged 11.5 million accounts.
With more and more people now looking for authoritative public health information about vaccines as programs were rolled out across the world, it said it would expand the guidance.
Katy Minshall, Twitter's head of UK public policy, said the company recognised the role it played in giving people credible public health information.
""We continue to work with health authorities around the world - including (Britain's health service) the NHS  - to ensure high visibility access to trusted and accurate public health information on our service, including about COVID-19 vaccines,"" she told Reuters. 
""Today we will begin applying labels to tweets that may contain misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines, in addition to our continued efforts to remove the most harmful COVID-19 misleading information from the service.""
She said the approach built on existing work to guard against false claims about the safety and effectiveness of inoculation.
Vaccines are at the centre of government plans to fight the pandemic that has caused more than 2.6 million deaths to date.
There have been concerns, however, that public distrust of the shots could jeopardize the success of vaccination programs. 
Surveys and data show varying levels of willingness to receive a shot according to country and demographic group. 

In Britain, where more than a third of adults have received at least one vaccine shot, authorities are working to overcome hesitancy among some ethnic groups.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Major sovereign bonds rallied across the globe on Monday and the U.S. 10-year yield backed off from its recent high after a surge that shook up global markets last week. 
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields eased for a second consecutive session on Monday after climbing to a one-year high last week as Federal Reserve officials continued to downplay runaway inflation concerns, though a round of solid economic data curbed the decline. 
Other central banks, meanwhile, suggested they are unlikely to tolerate a rise in yields.
TD Securities in a research note said it sees a year-end forecast of 1.45% for U.S. 10-year yields.
""We believe that any further rise in rates will significantly tighten financial conditions and could therefore be self-limiting,"" TD wrote.
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said on Monday there is no indication that inflation expectations are moving beyond a reasonable range. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia on Monday made larger-than-expected asset purchases while European Central Bank policymaker François Villeroy de Galhau said the recent rise in bond yields was unwarranted and the ECB needs to push back using the flexibility embedded in its bond purchase program.
In Australia, 10-year bond yields tumbled as much as 22 basis points after the Reserve Bank of Australia announced a larger-than-usual 4 billion Australian dollars ($3.1 billion)worth of bond purchases, its second such move in as many days.. But Aussie bond yields were last slightly up at 1.671%. ""This development may well be having a positive demonstration effect in terms of bolstering confidence that central banks are likely to push back against yield moves which they worry may be unwarranted,"" Rabobank analysts led by Richard McGuire told clients. Many markets had already shown signs of calming on Friday and sentiment held up on Monday, with sovereign bond yields in Asia, the United States, and the euro area all starting the week lower. The outperformance of Australian bonds, in terms of prices, which were poised for their best daily performance since the COVID-19 market rout last March, underscored market analysts' impression that verbal intervention by central banks would not be enough to drive yields much lower after sharp rises.
Monday's moves were also explained by a rally in eurodollar futures, which investors use to bet on future interest rate moves, Rabobank analysts said. They showed an unwinding of some of the moves last week that priced in a Federal Reserve rate hike in early 2023. <0#ED>
Eurodollar futures on Monday have fully priced in a U.S. rate hike by June 2023, from March 2023 last Friday.
In the United States, Treasuries underperformed and by midday the benchmark 10-year yield was down at 1.447%.
U.S. five-year bond prices posted the biggest gains, with yields down 5 basis points at 1.123%.
""Treasury prices are rising due to heavy futures-related buying, short-covering and decent buying in mortgages, which is spurring lower yields in five-year and seven-year paper,"" said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global in New York.
Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, noted that this was likely the end of this ""taper tantrum,"" presenting opportunities ""for investors faced with dislocated markets."" 
In the euro area, where analysts say the move higher in bond yields has been less justified than in the United States, Italian 10-year yields fell to 0.664% and German 10-year yields were down by as much as 7 basis points, both set for their biggest daily falls since June 2020.. 
Weekly data showed the European Central Bank, which verbally intervened last week to stress it was watching the rise in bond yields, slowed its net bond purchases during the previous week. However, a spokesman said the drop was explained by much higher redemptions.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 02:20PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court questions patent tribunal's constitutionality,"By Andrew Chung
(Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday signaled they may rein in the power of in-house judges serving on a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tribunal who have the ability to cancel patents in a case involving a dispute between surgical device makers. 
Justices raised questions during arguments in the case about the constitutionality of the agency's selection of the judges and grappled over how to address the issue. Their ruling, due by the end of June, could jeopardize the work of a tribunal called the Patent Trial and Appeal Board that adjudicates the validity of hundreds of patents annually.
The case arose from a fight between privately held Florida-based medical device company Arthrex and British-based rival Smith & Nephew (LON:SN) PLC. The justices are considering the U.S. government's appeal of a 2019 lower court decision that the board's judges were appointed in a way that violates a U.S. Constitution provision intended to ensure accountability for powerful government officials.
The tribunal, created by Congress in 2011, is an administrative court run by the patent office. It takes a second look at patents issued by the agency and often cancels them, much to the dismay of some inventors.
Arthrex challenged the constitutionality of the judges after the board in 2018 invalidated part of the company's patent for a surgical device for reattaching soft tissue to bone. Smith & Nephew had requested the review of Arthrex's patent. 
At issue is whether the agency's more than 250 patent judges were appointed in violation of the Constitution's so-called appointments clause, which requires certain high government officials - known as ""principal officers"" - to be named by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
Other ""inferior officers"" with lesser authority may be appointed and supervised by department heads, who are themselves named by the president. A president can fire principal officers at will, but patent judges, as members of the civil service, have certain job protections including from unrestricted removal.
Some of the justices on Monday indicated that the level of supervision over patent judges and their decisions seemed insufficient because neither the president nor his subordinates can reverse their decisions. 
""These are multimillion, sometimes billion-dollar decisions being made not by someone who's accountable in the usual way that the appointments clause demands,"" conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. 
Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts raised similar concerns but suggested that, because the patent judges are judges, they need more leeway to resolve factual disputes over patents and ""you don't want the politically accountable people to have the authority to overturn those."" Roberts also said reviewing each of the judges' decisions would be impractical. 
Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor voiced support for the tribunal's structure, saying principal officers are policymakers, not mere adjudicators like patent judges. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized patent court, agreed with Arthrex that the tribunal's judicial appointments ran afoul of the appointments clause. But the Federal Circuit said the constitutional defect could be cured by removing job protections, rendering the judges inferior officers. 
Arthrex has argued that the Federal Circuit's solution did not fix the problem and that the tribunal's structure remains unconstitutional. 

In recent years the tribunal's reviews have become a quick and cheap way for companies that are prime targets for infringement suits, such as such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, to try to invalidate patents. Litigation before the tribunal is seen by many companies as a more efficient alternative to resolving cases in federal court.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 02:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Six-week sprint got Indian-made AstraZeneca vaccine approved in Canada,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - Problems at AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's European production site in January kicked off a six-week push to get a version of its COVID-19 vaccine made at an Indian facility approved by Canada's drug regulator, according to the Canadian pharmaceutical company that filed the application.
Last week, when Health Canada approved AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, it also cleared a version of the shot made by the Serum Institute of India (SII). SII filed the application with a Canadian partner, Verity Pharmaceuticals. 
Some 500,000 doses made by SII, the world's largest vaccine producer, are set to arrive in Canada on Wednesday, a surprise boost for Canada's lagging vaccination drive.
Health Canada's relatively fast approval was underpinned by SII and Verity's four years of working to bring a cancer treatment to Canada. 
""It's been a lightning six weeks,"" said Verity's Chief Executive Howard Glase in an interview. ""The health regulators have really outdone each other ... They've really put in 24- hour days.""
After Friday's approval, Canada said it agreed to buy 2 million vaccine doses from Verity and Serum by mid-May, enough to vaccinate as much as 2.7% of its population. Only about 3.6% of Canadians have received at least one vaccine dose in Canada, according to volunteer-run data project COVID-19 Tracker Canada. 
With no local COVID-19 vaccine production, Canada trails many developed nations in inoculations as the world works toward vaccinating enough people to halt the pandemic that has claimed more than 2.5 million lives globally.
The SII shipment comes weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau that India would do its best to supply Canada with vaccines, a sign of improving diplomatic relations that soured after Trudeau expressed concern over India's farmer protests late last year.
ALL-NIGHTER
In January, AstraZeneca warned European customers it would fall short of its first-quarter vaccine supply commitments because of production issues.
It was after this that the British drugmaker called on Serum to make doses for Canada, and AstraZeneca and Canadian government officials approached Verity, Glase said.
Verity had been working with SII on a product called BCG, a tuberculosis vaccine that can also treat some bladder cancers. Canadian patients had endured years of shortages, so Verity applied to import a supply made by SII. That application was approved with conditions in December 2020, regulatory records show.
As part of that process, Verity brought Health Canada inspectors to SII more than a year ago, Glase said. That meant it did not have to visit again to approve the vaccine manufacturing site.
Separately, Britain's drug regulator inspected SII's manufacturing operations last month. The UK and Canadian regulators have a mutual recognition agreement that makes their manufacturing site approvals equivalent.
Health Canada and Verity's staff put in long hours to get the approval done, working through the night to get the document describing the vaccine's properties and intended uses, known as a product monograph, translated, proofed and approved in the early hours of Friday morning, said Glase. Health Canada confirmed that staff worked through the night. 
SII, whose CEO recently publicly assured Canada it would soon receive vaccine supplies, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when it secured export permit approvals from the government to ship to Canada.

So far, Canada has received about 2.4 million doses of the vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc. The government has said shipments should increase sharply in the second quarter.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 01:27PM ET</span>",AstraZeneca sells stake in vaccine maker Moderna for nearly $1 billion,"(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) sold its stake in rival COVID-19 vaccine maker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) for roughly $1 billion over the course of last year as the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker cashed in on the meteoric rise in the U.S. company's shares. 
London-listed AstraZeneca recorded $1.38 billion in equity portfolio sales last year, with ""a large proportion"" of it coming from the Moderna sale, according its latest annual report.
Shares in Moderna, which went public in 2018 at $23 per share, surged more than five times last year after it began working on a COVID-19 vaccine based on a new mRNA technology that won U.S. approval in December.
Its shot relies on synthetic genes to send a message to the body's immune system to build immunity and can be produced at a scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines like AstraZeneca's.
Last week, Moderna said it was expecting $18.4 billion in sales from the vaccine this year, putting it on track for its first profit since its founding in 2010. 
AstraZeneca began investing in Moderna in 2013, paying $240 million upfront and by the end of 2019 had built up its stake to 7.65%. (https:// That would be worth about $3.2 billion based on Moderna's 2020 closing stock price of $104.47, Reuters calculation showed. AstraZeneca's vaccine being developed with Oxford University has not been authorized in the United States and uses a weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus to deliver immunity-building proteins to the body. In December, U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co said it had sold its equity investment in Moderna, but did not disclose the details of the sale proceeds. Asset manager Baillie Gifford on Monday disclosed in a separate filing it now held 11% passive stake in Moderna as of Feb. 26.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 01:20PM ET</span>",Greensill Capital in trouble as Credit Suisse suspends funds,"By Tom Bergin and Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital could file for insolvency within days, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) earlier said it had suspended $10 billion of funds that backed the London-based company's lending operations. 
Greensill, backed by Japan's Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group, has appointed Grant Thornton for advice on a possible restructuring, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter, and is in talks to sell its operating business to private equity giant Apollo. 
Greensill and Grant Thornton declined to comment, while Apollo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Earlier on Monday the asset management arm of Credit Suisse said it was halting redemptions from its supply chain finance funds over concerns about being able to accurately value them. 
Credit Suisse's funds invested in supply chain finance securities created by Greensill that were backed by short-term loans the UK firm had made to companies to help them spread out the time they have to pay bills.
In a note to investors, Credit Suisse Asset Management on Monday said that ""a certain part of the subfunds' assets is currently subject to considerable uncertainties with respect to their accurate valuation"".
Greensill spokesman James Doran said in response to the funds' closure that it was ""in advanced talks with potential outside investors in our company and hope to be able to update further on that process imminently"". 
Greensill was founded by former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banker Lex Greensill in 2011. Its lending model is usually seen as a relatively low risk investment, but Greensill also provided finance to certain borrowers which did not have the usual type of supply chain arrangements used for this type of loan, publicly available accounts for borrowers show. 
Nonetheless, Credit Suisse marketed the funds as 'low risk' investments partly on the basis, saying in January that almost all the money was insured. Credit Suisse on Monday declined to identify the insurers or confirm if the cover was still in place.
Any insurance that is in place does not cover all losses.
In accounts filed in January, Greensill said the insurance policies carried first loss clauses which meant it faced potential losses of up to $1.04 billion in the case of defaults.
Greensill told Reuters in January the probable loss was only $59 million.
GUPTA LINK 
The WSJ on Monday reported that Credit Suisse was trying to reduce its exposure to Greensill Capital because of concerns over Greensill's exposure to metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta.
Almost since its inception, Greensill has had a close association with Gupta's UK-based metals and energy group GFG Alliance, helping to raise billions to help fund Gupta’s acquisition of plants around the world. 
However pressure has grown on Credit Suisse to cut the funds’ exposure to GFG-related credits since the near-collapse of fund manager GAM Holding AG in 2018, following a shuttering of funds related to the purchase of Gupta bonds structured by Greensill.
GFG declined to comment on Credit Suisse's statement or the WSJ report. Previously it said it had met all its obligations attached to its bond issues.

In 2020 Greensill sued Reuters for libel over a 2019 article in which Reuters said Greensill had issued a false statement in relation to a Gupta bond. Greensill withdrew the action after losing an early court ruling.

12,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 12:55PM ET</span>",English health authority says vaccines 80% effective at preventing hospitalisations in over-80s,"LONDON (Reuters) - The  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines are more than 80% effective at preventing hospitalisations from COVID-19 in those over 80 after one dose of either shot, Public Health England (PHE) said on Monday, citing a pre-print study.
PHE said the real world study, with data generated from Britain's vaccine rollout, also found that protection against symptomatic COVID in those over 70 ranged between 57-61% for one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine and between 60-73% for the Oxford-AstraZeneca one four weeks after the first shot.
""These results may also help to explain why the number of COVID admissions to intensive care units among people over 80 in the UK have dropped to single figures in the last couple of weeks, which is something I know that we all welcome,"" health minister Matt Hancock said at a news conference.
""This is seriously encouraging.""
PHE added that evidence for the Pfizer vaccine suggested it leads to an 83% reduction in deaths from COVID-19. There was not equivalent data on mortality effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which began to be administered at a later date.
PHE Head of Immunisations Mary Ramsay said that while more work needed to be done to understand the impact on vaccines in reducing transmission of the coronavirus, the effect of the rollout was already apparent.
“This adds to growing evidence showing that the vaccines are working to reduce infections and save lives,"" she said.
""While there remains much more data to follow, this is encouraging and we are increasingly confident that vaccines are making a real difference.""

Another PHE official said that more work needed to be done to establish the efficacy of vaccines against the so-called Brazilian variant of the coronavirus.

13,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",Richest 100 Americans Would Pay $78 Billion Under Warren Tax,"(Bloomberg) -- The 100 richest Americans would hand over more than $78 billion of their personal fortunes under a wealth tax proposed Monday by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and other progressive lawmakers.
Dubbed the Ultra Millionaire Tax Act, the bill would require households with a net worth of more than $50 million to pay a 2% tax on their wealth annually, with an additional 1% surtax for fortunes exceeding $1 billion. Warren’s proposal is unlikely to go anywhere in a narrowly divided Congress.
Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, would face an extra tax charge of at least $5.4 billion in 2021 if the bill became law, while Elon Musk would pay $5.2 billion, according to a Bloomberg analysis. The measure would cost Bill Gates an additional $4 billion and Mark Zuckerberg would have to fork over $2.9 billion to cover the tax.
In 2020, the richest 100 Americans added $598 billion to their wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The tax would capture 13% of that increase. The bill includes anti-avoidance provisions such as more stringent reporting requirements and a 40% exit tax for wealthy Americans who renounce their citizenship.
While President Joe Biden has proposed higher taxes on corporations and the rich, he and some Democrats in Congress don’t support a wealth tax. Opponents of the idea argue it would be difficult to administer and ultimately would be held unconstitutional by a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices.
About 100,000 families and roughly 1,000 billionaires would end up paying the proposed tax, according to an analysis by University of California at Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. They estimate it would raise about $3 trillion over a decade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles pleaded guilty on Monday to charges it conspired with company executives to make illegal, lavish gifts to United Auto Workers (UAW) leaders and undermined workers’ confidence in collective bargaining.
The U.S. unit of the Italian-American automaker, which is now part of Stellantis NV, said in January it reached agreement with U.S. prosecutors to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the Labor Management Relations Act and pay a $30 million fine. 
U.S. District Judge Paul Borman said at a court hearing he accepted Fiat Chrysler's guilty plea and set a June 21 sentencing date.
Fiat Chrysler also agreed to three years of probation and oversight by an independent compliance monitor to ensure it follows federal labor laws.
The Justice Department said Fiat Chrysler conspired to make more than $3.5 million in illegal payments to then-UAW officers from 2009 through 2016.
In December, the UAW agreed to independent oversight to resolve the corruption investigation, which ensnared two former UAW presidents.
Federal prosecutors in Detroit charged 15 former UAW officials as part of its investigation, and former presidents Gary Jones and Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB) both pleaded guilty to embezzling union funds. Williams is scheduled to be sentenced April 16.
Several UAW officers, including the two former UAW presidents, admitted embezzling millions of dollars in total for personal benefit, using funds to purchase expensive liquor and cigars and to pay for golf outings and related equipment, and expensive hotel stays.
The investigation led rival automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) to sue Fiat Chrysler last year, accusing company executives of bribing UAW officials to secure labor agreements that put GM at a disadvantage.
Borman in July dismissed GM’s lawsuit, which Fiat Chrysler called “meritless.""

On Thursday, a federal appeals court will hear GM's effort to revive the lawsuit. In January, GM said Fiat Chrysler had finally admitted ""after years of denials - that it engaged in a longstanding pattern of corruption.""

19,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 11:18AM ET</span>",Investors Poured Record $86 Billion Into Equity ETFs in February,"(Bloomberg) -- When faced with a spike in Treasury yields and a tech sector pullback that erased $1 trillion from stock prices, exchange-traded fund investors decided to pour more money into equities.
Despite the recent turmoil in the bond market, the S&P 500 Index extended a rally from its March 2020 lows to more than 70% and ETFs tracking stocks notched their best month of inflows on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Traders added almost $86 billion to those funds in February.
The striking figure underscores investors’ unflinching bullishness amid prospects for additional fiscal stimulus and the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, alongside continued support from the Federal Reserve. At least for now, that’s overshadowing any concerns about the recent surge in Treasury yields and the pressure that puts on already elevated equity valuations, especially in the tech industry.
“Investor psychology has shown a bias toward optimism,” said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager for GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta. “The animal spirits, if you will, are and have been at play in the past 11 months in this rally. There’s a lot of liquidity still out there, and it has found a home.”
The February intake beats even November’s haul after vaccine breakthroughs ignited a massive cash infusion into equities, with about 95% of stock funds posting gains. Vanguard Group’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) led the way in February, luring over $11 billion -- the most on record -- although much came through a single-day $8.7 billion inflow early in the month.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) also experienced a record month after an intake of $8.4 billion, while Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) came in third place, with $3.5 billion.
“Despite the volatility, where else can investors park money?” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs for WallachBeth Capital. “Bond yields have rallied so much, investors would shy away from fixed income because of the price depreciation. Equities ETFs would be the only possible substitute.”
Meanwhile, flows to fixed-income funds paled in comparison to their equity peers, taking in only $10.4 billion -- the lowest since March. The $46 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) had its worth month of outflows ever, losing $3.5 billion as short interest spiked.
Another fund that was recently under pressure was Cathie Wood’s popular ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), whose biggest holding is electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. The product, which surged almost 150% last year, had its worst week of outflows ever. Still, it took in a net $2.4 billion in February.
“They have a really fervent investor base and people who believe in these companies and this big future growth style,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. “A week of underperformance is not going to break the back of these investors. It would take a lot more than that to discourage flows from going in.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators on Monday said they have opened an investigation into nearly 1.9 million Toyota RAV4 sport-utility vehicles over potential fire risks.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the preliminary evaluation looking at 2013-2018 RAV4 vehicles comes after 11 reports of fires. 
The agency said that some drivers experienced stalling prior to the fire in half of the instances where the vehicle was in motion. The 12-volt battery was identified as the area of origin in a majority of incidents reviewed, the agency said.
""Toyota is aware that NHTSA has opened this investigation and we are cooperating with the agency,"" said Toyota spokesman Ed Hellwig.
The RAV4 is Toyota's best-selling vehicle in the United States.
The NHTSA said that improper battery installation or previous front-end collision repair was a factor in fire reports. But the agency said that, despite these external influences on the battery retaining method, the number of vehicle fires reported with the battery as the area of origin is larger than for other similar vehicles.
The agency said the investigation has been ""opened to better understand the contributing factors and frequency of vehicle fires originating from the battery region of the subject vehicles"". 

One report said that a RAV4 caught fire in Lyons, Colorado, after the owner of a 2017 Toyota RAV4 hybrid was driving 50 miles per hour when the check-engine light came on and then white smoke emerged from beneath the hood.

U.S. airlines have parked and retired aircraft as the coronavirus pandemic sapped demand but are beginning to position their business for a recovery as more vaccines are distributed across the country and globally. 
""With a number of our aircraft nearing the end of their lifecycle and the growth opportunities that we know will exist in the COVID-19 recovery period, this agreement will help us to grow as demand returns,"" Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella said in a memo.
In addition to the new Boeing order, United said it has moved up delivery of 40 previously ordered MAX aircraft to 2022 and 5 to 2023, meaning it will have 94 new aircraft in its fleet over those two years.
Altogether, it has 188 orders for the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded in March 2019 after two deadly crashes. Regulators in the United States, Europe and Britain are among those who have approved the jet's return to flight.
Its total financial commitments related to buying new aircraft or spare engines or other aircraft improvements totaled about $24.3 billion as of February, 2021, it said in a regulatory filing.
United has 52 Boeing 777-200 aircraft which were grounded last week after an engine failure soon after one of its flights took off from Denver, prompting some potential scheduling headaches for the airline in the months ahead. 

Shares in Boeing and United jumped in early trading, with Boeing up 4.7% at $221.91 and United up 3.8% at $54.72.

22,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 09:47AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Higher as Bond Jitters Ease; Dow up 510 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply higher on Monday after the easing of jitters in bond markets over the first signs of inflation in the post-Covid economy. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 510 points, or 1.7%, at 31,442 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 1.6%. All three indexes had retreated last week amid fears that the Federal Reserve and other central banks could be stampeded into cutting monetary policy support for the economy, due to inflationary pressures. The jitters that sent bond yields to their highest in over a year were in turn fed by higher commodity prices and the prospect of heavy U.S. Treasury issuance after the administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed through the House of Representatives. 
Underlying price pressures appeared to be still bubbling in the U.S. manufacturing sector, as the Institute for Supply Management's monthly report showed the index for prices paid by manufacturers rising at the fastest rate since 2008, reflecting in many cases supply chain constraints triggered by the pandemic. Comments from various sectors quoted by the ISM signaled an increasingly problematic situation for some sectors, notably chemicals, which stand to be affected for weeks by the closure of Gulf Coast refineries in February due to the cold snap.
""Things are now out of control. Everything is a mess, and we are seeing wide-scale shortages,"" the ISM quoted one respondent in the electronics sector as saying.
The ISM's main index rose meanwhile to its highest since September 2018, when Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on China with the imposition of broader tariffs on imports from the country.
Supporting the tone was the approval for emergency use against Covid-19 of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single-shot vaccine. The drug should accelerate the spread of immunity through the U.S. population and facilitate the quick reopening of the economy. J&J stock rose 1.7%, but appears still to be in a downward trend after authorization was fully discounted by the market in the previous weeks. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock was an early gainer, rising 5.6% after United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) bolstered an order for 737 MAX planes. That accounted for some of what has now become a familiar pattern of outperformance by 'value' stocks over the tech-focused growth stocks that dominated last year's rally. 
Another big gainer was  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock, which rose 5.6% after the oil and gas major said it has appointed activist investor Jeff Ubben and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s former chief financial officer Michael Angelakis to its board.
On a day when most of last week's losers were correcting upward, notably Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, one of the last week's big winners, Airbnb stock, fell 4.7% after a reported downgrade from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 09:35AM ET</span>",Analysis: Emerging markets feel the heat of the 'bondfire',"By Marc Jones and Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Just when developing economies were ready to bask in the post-COVID rebound in global growth, in sweeps a bond market blaze to scorch them again.
Most major investment banks were predicting a stellar 2021 for emerging market assets as long as one crucial snag - global borrowing costs rising too fast - was avoided. Well guess what, they are on a tear.
February saw their steepest monthly gain since Donald Trump's shock 2016 U.S. presidential election win and, though the move comes from record low levels, for emerging markets now carrying nearly $80 trillion worth of debt it has been painful few weeks. 
The widely-tracked JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) is having its worst start to a year for a quarter of a century, currencies have recoiled and MSCI's EM stocks index has just suffered its biggest weekly drop since peak COVID panic last March.
The carnage has been described as a bond bonfire by ING analysts and prompted some of those bullish investment banks like JPMorgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to curtail their bets.

Rising developed market bond yields sting emerging markets in two main ways. 
Firstly they push up borrowing costs. BofA estimates emerging markets will sell over three quarters of a trillion dollars worth of debt this year - $210 billion by governments and over $550 billion by corporates. Higher rates mean adding to government debt ratios that soared 15.5 percentage points across the top 60 emerging markets last year and have left 13 such countries with debt-to-GDP in excess of 100%.
Secondly, it cuts the premium existing emerging debt offers investors compared to ultra safe and liquid U.S. Treasuries. 
If the risk-reward calculation no longer adds up, money managers can quickly sell as was seen during the 2013 'taper tantrum' when the Federal Reserve's hints at ending its easy-money policies triggered an estimated $25 billion emerging asset selloff in just two months.
The effects of that episode were particularly severe in the ""Fragile Five"" of Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey that had built-up large current account deficits that were funded by short-term capital inflows.
Graphic: US yields and EM capital flows - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakvermzxpr/US%20yields%20and%20EM%20capital%20flows.PNG
BOOM TIME
This time, investors are worried about at least some of those.
""Brazil and South Africa are countries whose combination of persistent weak growth, rising public debt, very steep yield curves with very high long-term real interest rates has become a big source of concern,"" said David Lubin, Citi's managing director and head of emerging markets economics. ""Mexico might also be on that list.""
Still, the alarm bells aren't ringing as loud now.
For one reason, U.S. ""real"" yields, adjusted for inflation, remain low by historical standards, at about negative 80 basis points which keeps emerging market assets looking attractive. 
By comparison, during the original taper tantrum, ""real"" U.S. 10-year yields rose steeply from negative 75 basis points at the end of 2012 to positive 50 basis points by mid-2013.
And despite the huge rise in debts, last year's recessions have helped to mostly eliminate current account deficits, limiting many emerging markets' reliance on capital inflows and acting as a shock absorber against rising U.S. yields.
A punchy recovery in global growth and fast-rising commodity prices should further help developing economies and even dig some out of a hole.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) last week cranked up its pan-EM growth forecast for the year to 7% from 6.1%, led by upward revisions to China, India and Mexico, and with $1.9 trillion of U.S. stimulus now coming most institutions are doing the same. 
""We could be at the door of a big, big economic boom,"" said head of Barings' sovereign debt and currencies group Ricardo Adrogué. ""Some of these countries that seem hopeless today could actually be ok"".
Graphic: Emerging market borrowing costs are rising again - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwzzxmvw/Pasted%20image%201614343263456.png
FRAGILE FRONTIERS
Others will not be so lucky though. 
Ethiopia is about to become a test case for the new G20 'Common Framework' debt relief plan which stipulates private creditor debt must also be restructured, meaning the government has to default.
Others are expected to follow. S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) warned last week Belize was ""virtually certain"" to default in May. Laos and Sri Lanka have key payments in June and July, while JPMorgan lists 16 at-risk countries from Cameroon to Tajikistan sitting on a combined $61.4 billion of debt.
Tellimer's senior economist Patrick Curran has dubbed the new group of vulnerable countries the 'Fragile Frontiers'. It includes Jamaica, Tunisia, Ecuador, Sri Lanka, Belarus, Ethiopia, Laos, Bahrain and Oman. 
Adding to the risks, not all emerging markets have started rolling out COVID vaccines yet. In Africa, for example, only a minority of countries are currently vaccinating and more variants are still breaking out.
Countries like Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, Mauritius, Montenegro, Jordan and Fiji where tourism accounts for close to 10% of GDP will wonder whether vaccines will come quickly enough to save their busy seasons this year.
""Virus mutations are a real thing I worry about,"" said Raza Agha, head of emerging markets credit strategy at Legal & General Investment Management. ""There's already been several and there's no way of predicting how many more there will be.""

Chief Executive Sebastien de Montessus said his priority now is to show shareholders he is committed to organic growth in six core gold mines across Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Burkina Faso.
""Some people say, 'he did two M&A deals, this is an M&A junkie'. No. I'm just trying to do the right thing for our shareholders,"" de Montessus, who took over the CEO role in 2016, told Reuters.
While Endeavour's deal to buy Semafo created the biggest gold producer in Burkina Faso, the company's overall valuation on a 12-month forward price-to-earnings basis has fallen since the acquisition closed last July, Datastream I/B/E/S estimates show.
Its later purchase of Teranga, which added a large mine in Senegal and a bigger footprint in Ivory Coast, came partly from a desire to boost its valuation ahead of its London listing by diversifying its portfolio into other countries. 
But Endeavour shares fell in the months after the Teranga deal was announced, partly reflecting investor unease about an acquisition at a time high gold prices were inflating valuations across the sector. 
The deal was ""a step too far for a lot of shareholders"", said portfolio manager Jon Case at Sentry Investments in Toronto, adding investors had wanted Endeavour to integrate Semafo first. ""For a lot of people, it was too soon."" 
Karim Nasr, CEO of top Endeavour investor La Mancha, which will hold a 19% stake in the company after a new $200 million investment closes this quarter, said there is ""no need"" for more M&A at the group. 
""As shareholders we would like to see the company delivering on cashflows and starting to produce good capital returns."" 
GROWTH TARGET 
De Montessus said that growth from here will be driven by assets the company already owns, with management targeting output of 1.4 million-1.5 million ounces this year - more than double 2019's level. 
Endeavour has forecast exploration spending will climb 40% to $70 million-$90 million this year, and remain at that level. It aims for one major discovery this year, the CEO said, and hopes to launch a new mine in Mali or Ivory Coast in 2022.
The company will shed some non-core operations as it pushes to consolidate its assets. It has previously received informal approaches for its Karma mine in Burkina Faso, de Montessus said, though no official sales process is underway.
Security in Burkina Faso - where 39 workers were killed in a 2019 ambush of a Semafo transport convoy, and where a conflict between government forces and Islamist insurgents is worsening - is a priority for the group. 
De Montessus said Endeavour has increased spending on security ""significantly"", investing $6 million to $10 million across its Burkina Faso mines. 
The group has a dedicated security unit led by ex-French military personnel, and has drones above each site watching for potential threats. Endeavour is also building an airstrip at the Wahgnion mine it acquired from Teranga in Burkina Faso, de Montessus said, as part of its policy of avoiding employees travelling on roads.
Vincent Rouget, analyst at Control Risks, said attacks on the mining industry have tended to occur in transit, as it is easier to stage a roadside ambush than an assault on a mine site. 
""The challenge is how to protect your operations from external threats while at the same time not shutting yourself off from the community completely,"" said Rouget. 
Endeavour has set itself apart from peers in West Africa by having most of its technical team in Abidjan and executives spending more time on-site, a banker who declined to be named said. 
""There's a lot of lifestyle gold companies in West Africa,"" he said, referring to well-paid executives based far from operations. ""Companies like Endeavour are shaking that up.""
With mining executives working on the ground in ""sometimes very difficult environments"", de Montessus said complaints from some investors that executives in the sector are overpaid were ""nonsense"". 

Shareholders have consistently approved his pay, which is reviewed against the peer group and decided by the board, he said.

The retirement was voluntary and not a result of any disagreement or on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices, the company said.
Nelson, who joined Beyond Meat in December 2015, will retire on May 5, but will remain as a consultant until May 5, 2023. 
The company's shares have jumped six fold under Nelson's watch since the IPO, but he has courted controversy after being named in a fraud claims lawsuit filed by Don Lee Farms, a former Beyond Meat supplier. 
Beyond Meat has counter-sued Don Lee Farms, according to food industry magazine Food Navigator, with a trial date set for June. 

Don Lee Farms did not immediately respond to e-mailed requests for comment, while Nelson was not immediately available to comment on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).

Thousands of U.S. meatpacking workers became infected with the coronavirus last year, with outbreaks of the disease temporarily shutting slaughterhouses in the spring and tightening supplies for consumers.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>",Analysis: SPACs turn to 'stonks' as amateur traders take on more risk,"By Joshua Franklin and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - For Jonny Coreson, $4 billion is worth $5 billion. 
The 32-year-old test prep business owner from Denver invested $100,000 in shares of veteran hedge fund manager Bill Ackman's special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd, after they soared 25% in December with no imminent deal in sight. This valued the blank-check acquisition firm at $5 billion, when on paper it was worth only the $4 billion it had raised in an initial public offering in July. 
""There weren't very many options for retail investors to get into the stock before its IPO. If I'm paying a 25% premium on the opportunity to ride Ackman's coattails, to me it's worth it,"" Coreson said. He said his other bets on SPACs had paid off and that he had doubled a $25,000 investment in CM Life Sciences, which agreed earlier this month to merge with digital healthcare company Sema4. 
A spokesman for Ackman declined to comment.
An army of amateur traders that has fueled a rally in heavily shorted stocks, or ""stonks,"" such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), has discovered the arcane world of SPACs. They are hearing about their obscure stock market tickers on social media, from TikTok to Twitter, and placing risky bets.
Although all stock investments involve risk, many companies going public by merging with a SPAC take risk to another level because they often are years away from generating revenues when they go public.
Churchill Capital IV Corp has provided the most vivid example of the pitfalls. Its shares had risen as much as 548% from its IPO, for a market valuation of almost $17 billion, following a Reuters report last month that it was nearing a deal to merge with luxury electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors at a roughly $12 billion valuation. 
But the shares dropped 42% last week, wiping out over $8 billion in market value, after the deal was announced with a last-minute private investment that diluted stock market investors.
""It happens with every SPAC -- buy the rumor, sell the news. Once the volatility goes away in a few weeks and months, I'll be buying more again,"" said one of the investors, James Goff, a 27-year-old machine operator from Bremen, Georgia. He said he sold most of his shares in Churchill Capital IV before they nosedived on the deal's announcement.
A spokesman for Churchill Capital IV declined to comment.
As the speculation intensifies, so is the risk that amateur investors are willing to accept. Many used to snap up SPAC shares only after rumors about a potential merger appeared in the press. Now, they are driving up the shares of SPACs with no idea of a potential deal. SPACs do not tell investors in advance which company they will merge with, and are typically awarded up to two years to clinch a deal. 
Some 25 SPACs have seen their shares rise more than 10% on their first day of trading so far this year, when no deal was in sight, compared to seven SPACs in all of 2020, according to Dealogic data. In 2019, the largest first-day trading gain was just 3%. Demand in the IPOs routinely exceeds supply by more than 10 times, investment bankers working on the deals say. 
Graphic: SPAC bubble leads to day one trading pops - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakperrngvr/Pasted%20image%201614357963864.png
Demand for the $500 million IPO in January of Liberty Media Acquisition Corp, a SPAC backed by Formula One owner Liberty Media Corp, exceeded the size of the offering by 20 times, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Liberty Media Acquisition did not respond to a request for comment. 
Many amateur traders complain that only Wall Street funds can buy at the IPO, relegating mom-and-pop investors to buy shares during a first-day rally.
""I have not seen my brokerage having SPACs IPO available unfortunately,"" said Heath Augustover, an amateur trader and government worker in New York who has invested in SPACs for more than a year.
LOSING PROPOSITION
The perils for investors are increasing as more SPACs come to market. Some 189 SPACs have raised $60 billion so far this year, more than half the $83 billion total for all of 2020, itself an annual record. Were they to maintain this pace, SPACs would raise more than $300 billion this year. 
To be sure, there is a floor on investors' potential losses in SPAC shares. If a SPAC does not find a deal, it has to buy back its shares at the original IPO price.
But investors can lose most of their money if they bought in at the peak of a rally. Some investors who have held on to shares after a deal closed have seen the value of their stock drop below the SPAC IPO price, as was the case with healthcare services provider MultiPlan Corp and wholesale mortgage lender UWM Holdings Corp, 

""What's fueling the increase in pre-merger share prices is this guess that the post-merger share price is always going to rise, regardless of the deal. That makes sense only if we are in a bubble,"" said Michael Klausner, law professor at Stanford University who has studied SPAC performance.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 07:16AM ET</span>",Texas electricity firm files for bankruptcy citing $1.8 billion in claims from grid operator,"By Gary McWilliams
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Texas's largest and oldest electric power cooperative on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection in federal court in Houston, citing a disputed $1.8 billion bill from the state's grid operator. 
Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc is one of dozens of electricity providers facing enormous charges stemming from a severe cold snap last month. The fallout threatens utilities and power marketers who collectively face billions of dollars in blackout-related charges, executives said.
Unusually frigid temperatures knocked out nearly half of the state's power plants in mid-February, leaving 4.3 million people without heat or light for days and bursting water pipes that damaged homes and businesses. Brazos and others that committed to provide power to the grid and could not, were required to buy replacement power at high rates and cover other firms' unpaid fees. 
The state's grid operator, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), on Friday said $2.1 billion in initial bills went unpaid, underscoring the financial stress on utilities and power marketers. More providers likely will reject the bills in coming days, executives said. 
""The municipal power sector is in a real crisis,"" said Maulin Patani, a founder of Volt Electricity Provider LP, an independent power marketer that is not a member of the Brazos coop. ERCOT should suspend the service charges to halt further defaults, he said in an interview on Sunday. 
The city of Denton, in north Texas, last week sued ERCOT in a state court to prevent it from charging it for fees unpaid by other users of the grid. Denton Electric could face tens of millions of dollars for fees that were not collected from others, the suit claimed. 
Debt analyst Fitch Ratings last week also warned of potential downgrades to all Texas municipal power firms that use the state's grid. Costs from the storm ""could exceed the liquidity immediately available to these issuers,"" Fitch said. 
ERCOT triggered the squeeze when it pushed up spot-market rates to $9,000 per megawatt hour (mwh) over more than four days and levied huge fees for services. The service fees were 500 times the usual rate, according to industry executives. 

Brazos Electric coop executive Clifton Karnei, who sat on ERCOT's board of directors until last week, signed the Brazos coop's bankruptcy submissions. Through its 16 utility company members, Brazos provides electricity to more than 660,000 customers across the state of Texas.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>","Bond jitters putting markets in 'completely new light', BIS says","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The swift rise of borrowing costs on global bond markets over the last month could completely alter the outlook for financial markets, according to the central bank for the world's central banks, the Bank for International Settlements.
In its latest quarterly report, the Swiss-based BIS also noted how wild retail trading-driven swings in stocks such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) recently had helped whip up volatility.
The big shift however has been in the U.S. Treasury markets that tend to propel global borrowing costs on the sense that unprecedented stimulus will ignite inflation if COVID-19 vaccines allow economies to fully reopen this year.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. yields climbed above 1.6% last week, extending this year's near 70 basis-point jump that has jacked up sovereign borrowing costs in Europe, Japan and elsewhere.
""The recent market jitters confirm that the back-up in bond yields and reflation trade are casting the financial market outlook in a completely new light,"" said Claudio Borio, Head of the BIS' Monetary and Economic Department.
""People just saw low rates for as far as the eye could see, whereas now they have started having doubts about how long these conditions would last.""
Economists have drawn parallels to the 2013 taper tantrum, when bond yields rose dramatically after then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke told lawmakers the Fed could take a step down in its pace of purchases of assets that had been buoying markets.
Borio said the key to whether markets would have another lengthy tantrum was firstly dependent on whether world growth did accelerate quickly, and then also what the major central banks did in response to rising bond yields.
Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave assurances last week the bank was not about to dial down stimulus. ECB President Christine Lagarde has delivered a similar messages, but the United States has just agreed a new $1.9 trillion stimulus package.
Central banks ""will have to work out what the implications of that (rising bond yields) for their objectives and respond accordingly,"" Borio said, referring to mandates to curb inflation and keep financial markets from running out of control.
On the wild stock market moves this year, he said it was typical of retail investors getting involved during periods of euphoria.
""Whenever a taxi driver starts talking about what is happening in the stock markets it means something significant is going on,"" Borio said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply higher Monday, boosted by more positive Covid vaccine news, progress in the U.S. stimulus package and Treasury yields dropping from last week’s highs.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 280 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 Futures traded 36 points, or 1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 145 points, or 1.1%.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s Covid-19 vaccine was authorized for use in the United States over the weekend - the third approved drug, following ones from Pfizer/BioNTech, and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
However, the two earlier vaccines require two doses. This is a single-dose application, could start being used as early as Tuesday, and is likely to dramatically speed up the number of Americans vaccinated in the coming weeks, bringing the full reopening of the economy nearer.
Adding to the optimism was the passage of President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill through the House of Representatives. The Senate will now consider the legislation this week.
Wall Street suffered its worst week in four months last week, with the major indices closing near one-month lows. This selloff was prompted by bond yields climbing sharply, suggesting markets were starting to factor in an earlier rate hike from the Federal Reserve. 
However, bond yields have stabilized Monday, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield currently trading around 1.43%, well off the 1.60% level that it briefly touched last week.
Meanwhile, earnings season is wrapping up, but retailers will still be reporting, with  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) due to publish figures on Tuesday, followed by Costco (NASDAQ:COST) on Thursday. As far as Monday is concerned, numbers are due from insurer Lemonade (NYSE:LMND) and video communications company Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), both after the close.
The economic data slate Monday includes February’s final read for Markit’s U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index and the more widely-followed survey from the Institute of Supply Management. However, the main focus will be on Friday’s nonfarm payrolls release, with the employment market seen as the Federal Reserve’s key gauge of growth. 
Oil prices pushed higher Monday, with traders expecting future demand growth on the back of the U.S. stimulus package passing its latest hurdle.
On the supply side, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is due to meet later this week. These top producers will likely discuss the option of allowing significantly more oil into the market given the recent price rises.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $62.12 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1% to $65.08. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,743.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.2043.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",China moving 'step by step' in recertifying Boeing 737 MAX,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's aviation regulator said on Monday its major safety concerns with the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX had to be ""properly addressed"" before conducting flight tests but it was studying a plan with U.S. planemaker for clearing aircraft to fly.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) conducted comprehensive and in-depth technical scrutiny of the Boeing 737 MAX, the agency's vice head Dong Zhiyi said, giving the regulator's stance on the plane which China grounded in early 2019.
The U.S. and several other regulators have already cleared the plane to fly again.
""We'll conduct flight tests in a planned and step-by-step way once our major safety concerns are properly addressed,"" Dong said, adding that cooperation between FAA and Boeing had been positive.
China was the first country to ground the 737 MAX in March 2019 following two fatal crashes. At the time, more of the planes had been operating in China than anywhere else in the world. China makes up about a quarter of MAX sales.
The CAAC has outlined three principles for the jet to return to service, including certified design changes, proper training for the pilots and specific findings into the crashes.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lifted its flight ban on the aircraft in January. It was followed by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and several others. 

Australia said on Friday it would lift a ban on flights.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",Asian equities face outflows in February due to rise in U.S. bond yields,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Foreigners were net sellers of Asian equities for a second consecutive month in February, hit by a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, which prompted investors to book profits in regional equities.
Overseas investors sold a net combined total of $3.5 billion in South Korean, Taiwanese, Philippine, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, and Indian stocks last month, data from stock exchanges showed.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped last month on expectations of higher inflation due to a big stimulus package to revive the economy.
U.S Treasury bonds are considered safer and hence their higher yields tend to dissuade global investors from putting money in risk assets such as Asian equities.
The MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares gained about 1.4% in last month, its smallest gain in four months. The index was trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 17.42 at the end of January, the highest since September 2009.
Graphic: Foreign investments in Asian equities - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpoeeogpd/Foreign%20investments%20in%20Asian%20equities.jpg
Among the regional markets, Taiwan and South Korea witnessed the biggest net sales, with outflows of $4.4 billion and $1.8 billion respectively.
Philippine, Vietnam and Thailand also faced some outflows last month.
Renewed virus outbreaks also depressed manufacturing activity in some parts of the region, which affected the sentiment last month, analysts said.
Six out of the nine reporting economies in the region posted a decline in manufacturing activity in February, said Oxford Economics in a report.
""But we expect a broad-based pick-up in growth momentum over the course of the year, supported by vaccine rollouts, staggered policy normalisation and an improved global backdrop,"" it said.
However, Indian equities lured an inflow of $3.5 billion, helped by a growth-focused and high-spending federal budget unveiled at the start of February.

India's economy expanded by 0.4% year-on-year in the October-December quarter, returning to growth after shrinking for two straight quarters, government data showed last month.

After Asian stocks rallied overnight, European share indexes opened higher, with the STOXX 600 up 1.7% at 0837 GMT. London's FTSE 100 up 1.8% and Germany's DAX was up 1.3%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.5%, recovering from the previous session's multi-week low.
The much-anticipated $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday, and now moves to the Senate.
In the bond market, key yields fell from their recent highs.
The U.S. 10-year treasury yield was down around 4 basis points at 1.4118% at 0837 GMT, having dropped from Thursday's one-year high of 1.614%.
Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was down around 5 basis points, also below last week's spike.
(Graphic: Germany 10-year, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprddzype/Germany%2010-year.png)
Market participants have become wary in recent weeks that, when economies re-open from their coronavirus lockdowns a combination of massive government stimulus and pent-up consumer demand will cause inflation to accelerate.
""There is little doubt in my mind that central banks will eventually lean quite hard against a sustained rise in yields,"" wrote  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid in a note to clients.
""They simply can’t afford to see it happen with debt so high.""
Factory activity data for February is also in focus this week, with European PMIs due throughout the morning.
Manufacturing in Japan grew at its fastest pace in more than two years in February, as strong orders led to the first output rise since the start of the pandemic.
SLOWER PACE
But China's factory activity grew at a slower pace than in the previous month, missing market expectations, after COVID-19 related disruptions earlier in the year.
Helping sentiment was news that deliveries of the newly approved Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) COVID-19 vaccine should start on Tuesday.
""The outlook for equity markets remains positive for most of 2021,"" wrote Berenberg economists Kallum Pickering and Holger Schmieding in a note.
""Although yields will likely rise further to at least 2.0% for the US 10 year Treasury and 0.0% for German 10 year Bunds by the end of 2021, the increase in yields will lag behind the improvement in the outlook for nominal GDP growth and corporate earnings,"" they said.
""We expect clear forward guidance by the Fed that it will not taper its asset purchases until the labour market has healed and a faster pace of ECB asset purchases if necessary.""

Investing.com - European stock markets surged Monday, boosted by healthy manufacturing data in the region, a semblance of calm in global bond markets and more positive news of Covid-19 vaccines.
At 5:05 AM ET (1005 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.5% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 1.7%.
European PMI data came in ahead of expectations, climbing to 57.9 in February from 54.8 last month, with the dominant German manufacturing sector expanding at an impressive rate. This suggested that this important sector has weathered the current mobility restrictions throughout the continent in a better shape than the first lockdowns.
The equivalent news out of Asia was mixed earlier Monday, as Japan's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in over two years in February, while Chinese factory activity grew at the slowest pace in nine months. 
Government bond yields have stabilized at the start of the week after last week’s sharp gains, lessening the pressure on stock markets as rising yields made equities look less attractive to investors.
Yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year notes traded last at 1.40%, below last week's peak of 1.61% as investors had worried that rising inflation could drive major central banks to tighten monetary policy more quickly than expected.
Helping the tone has been the passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill through the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday, it now heads to the Senate, and Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine receiving American authorization over the weekend.
Turning to the European corporate sector, travel & leisure stocks jumped, with British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) leading the way, up over 5%, as investors look for a summer reopening of holiday travel.
 Danone  (PA:DANO) stock rose 2.3% after the French dairy giant prepared to sell its $1 billion stake in China’s Mengniu and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock climbed 1.7% after The Times newspaper reported that the drug maker has sold its 7.7% stake in  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) for more than $1 billion.
Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) stock rose 3% after the computer goods maker lifted its fiscal 2021 outlook, helped by pandemic-driven work-from-home phenomia.
Oil prices pushed higher Monday, with traders expecting future demand growth on the back of the U.S. stimulus package passing its latest hurdle.
On the supply side, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is due to meet later this week. These top producers will likely discuss the option of allowing significantly more oil into the market given the recent price rises.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% higher at $62.66 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.9% to $65.63. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.1% to $1,747.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2051.

The pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 1.6% by 0811 GMT following strong gains in Asian stocks despite weaker-than-expected manufacturing activity data out of China.
The European equities benchmark fell to a near one-month low on Friday as investors grew fearful that rising inflation due to another large U.S. stimulus package and the re-opening of the global economy could drive major central banks to tighten monetary policy.
The German DAX rose 1.3%, while France's CAC 40 and UK's FTSE 100 gained 1.5% each. 
Miners, up 2.2%, were the top sectoral gainers, while travel & leisure and retail stocks jumped over 2%. 

British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) was the top gainer on STOXX 600, jumping 5.4% after Peel Hunt upgraded the stock to ""buy"" on expectations of a rebound in travel demand during summer.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Monday, boosted by progress in the passage of a huge U.S. stimulus package, a semblance of calm in global bond markets and more positive news of Covid-19 vaccines.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.8% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.5%.
Sentiment has turned positive in equity markets around the globe, and Europe is no exception, as government bond yields have stabilised after last week’s sharp gains. Stocks had been under pressure as rising yields made equities look less attractive to investors, particularly the richly valued high-growth stocks which have powered a lot of the sharp gains from last year’s lows.
Yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year notes traded last at 1.40%, below last week's peak of 1.61%, while yields on European government bonds have also retreated from Friday’s highs.
Helping the tone has been the passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill through the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday, it now heads to the Senate, and Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine receiving American authorization over the weekend.
Back in Europe, there is a raft of manufacturing PMI data due for release later Monday, which will provide clues as to how this sector is holding up as large parts of the continent are still locked down to combat the spread of the coronavirus. 
The equivalent news out of Asia was mixed earlier Monday, as Japan's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in over two years in February, while Chinese factory activity grew at the slowest pace in nine months.

The lender that held former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s bank accounts, said the settlement will hurt its earnings for the year ending March 2021. It will set aside provisions in the final quarter of the fiscal year, which will translate to a proforma loss of 93.89 sen a share, and will skip the final dividend, according to a filing.
The payment is a “sucker punch” and a “huge negative surprise especially when we thought AMMB has laid the past behind them when they settled the 54 million ringgit fine by Bank Negara Malaysia back in 2015,” Chan Jit Hoong, an analyst at Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd., said in a report Monday.
He downgraded the stock to hold from buy and slashed his target price to 2.95 ringgit from 4.05 ringgit. Maybank Kim Eng analyst Desmond Chng also cut his recommendation on AMMB to hold from buy. The shares slid more than 2% on Friday and are down 13% so far this year.
Read: Malaysian Bank That Highlighted 1MDB Scandal to Pay $699 Million
The 1MDB scandal set off investigations in Asia, the U.S. and Europe, and led to the ouster of Najib in 2018. Authorities spent years tracking funds that allegedly flowed from 1MDB into ornaments of wealth.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). last year admitted its role in the biggest foreign bribery case in U.S. enforcement history, reaching multiple international settlements in the billions of dollars to end probes into its fund-raising for 1MDB.
The payment is for “all outstanding claims and actions in relation to the AmBank Group’s involvement in the 1MDB matter,” Malaysia’s finance ministry said in a statement on Friday, referring to a unit of AMMB. The statement didn’t specify AMMB’s wrongdoing in the 1MDB scandal that it was penalized for.
There are adequate capital buffers to absorb this settlement without an immediate need to raise additional equity capital, AMMB said. While it is highly liquid, it will seek to raise tier 2 debt capital to fund working capital.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2021 11:45PM ET</span>",Biden urges workers to 'make your voice heard' as Amazon employees vote on union,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden defended workers' rights to form unions and warned against intimidation of workers in a video posted on Twitter on Sunday night, as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees in Alabama vote on whether to unionize.
Biden didn't mention Amazon, but specifically referenced ""workers in Alabama"" in the video and a tweet introducing it. He said every worker should have a free and fair choice to join a union, and no employer could take that away. ""It's your right...So make your voice heard,"" he said. 
""Unions lift up workers, both union and non-union, but especially Black and Brown workers,"" Biden said in the video. ""There should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda. No supervisor should confront employees about their union preferences.""
Amazon, America’s second-biggest private employer, has no unionized labor in the United States, and workers at its fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, would be the first if they vote in favor. Such a decision could encourage workers attempting to organize at other Amazon facilities.
A spokeswoman from the Retail, Wholesale & Department Store Union (RWDSU) said there had been many reports of various ""various intimidation tactics used by Amazon on this campaign and during the voting period.""
Amazon, which has long avoided unionization, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company has trained managers to spot organizing activity. A website advocating Amazon workers shun unions, doitwithoutdues.com, warned the Bessemer employees, “why pay almost $500 in dues? We’ve got you covered* with high wages, health care, vision, and dental benefits.” 
The last attempt by Amazon workers to unionize was in 2014.
A top adviser to Biden and officials from the RWDSU discussed the union's drive to organize Amazon workers at the Bessemer site after the inauguration, Reuters reported earlier this month. 
On Sunday, RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum welcomed what he called Biden's ""clear message of support"" for the Amazon workers seeking to bring the first union to an Amazon warehouse.
""As President Biden points out, the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is by organizing into unions. And that is why so many working women and men are fighting for a union at the Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama,” he said in a statement.
Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO federation of unions, also hailed Biden's tweet: ""@POTUS is right: Every worker should have the free and fair choice to join a union.""
Biden has vowed to increase union membership in the United States after years of steady declines.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the union membership rate in the private sector was around 6.2% in 2019, compared to around 20% in 1983.

Operating income for fiscal 2022, measured under non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP), is expected to be between $750 million and $800 million, the Swiss-U.S. company said. That's down from the $1.1 billion it now expects for fiscal 2021, a fraction up from a previous estimate of $1.05 billion.
Sales for fiscal 2022, measured in constant currency terms, will be about flat - plus or minus 5%. For fiscal 2021, Logitech raised its sales growth forecast to about 63% in constant currencies, up from the 57-60% range it previously expected. 
In January, Logitech reported a more than three-fold jump in quarterly adjusted operating income, benefiting from the pandemic-driven boost in demand for work-from-home products and gaming accessories.
Sales at the company, which makes mobile speakers, keyboards, mice and video conferencing devices, increased 85% to $1.67 billion in the third quarter, which has traditionally been the company's biggest sales period.

The company also said on Monday its expectations of long-term sales growth in constant currency have increased to 8% to 10%, up from high-single digits and that its non-GAAP operating margin target has improved to between 14% and 17%, up from 11% to 14%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - When Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd stopped using Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank Ltd as its stock transfer agent last year, the lender slapped it with a roughly $4 million termination fee, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The break fee - 2,000 yen ($19) per shareholder - is a little-known practice among Japan's biggest trust banks when they lose a client in the shareholder record-keeping business, multiple insiders say. 
The bank that takes the new client typically pays the fee. Insiders say this arrangement keeps a profitable business in the hands of a few big trust banks because newcomers balk at the cost. One departing client was told the charge was an ""industry custom"".
Japan's three largest trust banks, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Trust and Banking Corp and Mizuho Trust & Banking Co Ltd, control at least 97% of the market, according to an internal bank document.
Details of the fees, including the amount and the expectation that the new bank pay, as well as Honda's experience, are reported here for the first time.
Some executives at listed companies privately express frustration over the practice, which they say illustrates banks' abuse of their considerable power in corporate Japan.
It's not clear why banks' break fee amounts are identical. The fees varied until the late 1990s, when weakened lenders were consolidating, one of the people familiar with the matter said. 
""It's not right to charge 2,000 yen for doing nothing. Any way you look at it, it's a barrier to entry and in violation of anti-trust laws,"" said one executive at a major manufacturer. He and other sources declined to be identified because the information isn't public.
Transfer agents keep records of a company's shareholders, process dividend payments and count votes at annual general meetings. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust shouldered Honda's fee when it took over records of the automaker's roughly 210,000 shareholders, according to the two people familiar with the matter.
Honda said it couldn't comment on the content of contracts. 
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Mizuho Trust said they charge administrative fees when a client leaves. All declined to comment on the amount of the fees or on specific transactions. 
Mizuho Trust said that contracts differed from client to client, and that there are cases in which it discusses the break fee from a former transfer agent when negotiating a contract. It said that the fees were appropriate and that its business complied with the law.
Mitsubishi UFJ Trust said there was no legal issue with the fees because the trust banks had not agreed on them together.
A spokesman for the Japan Fair Trade Commission declined to comment.
A representative for the regulatory Financial Services Agency (FSA) said: ""Contracts in the private sector are at the discretion of each company"".
'INDUSTRY CUSTOM'
Trust banks came under scrutiny last year after Sumitomo Mitsui Trust and Mizuho Trust separately revealed widespread failure to count all valid votes at annual general meetings over the last two decades. Both have apologised and pledged to revise practices.
Banks don't always make break fees explicit in contracts, one of the people familiar with the matter said. 
Mitsubishi UFJ Trust said that in general, administrative fees are determined after discussions with the client. Mizuho Trust said there are cases where it spelled out the fees in contracts.
Another executive, at a midsize listed firm, said his company refused to pay when switching transfer agents years ago.
""There was no clause for specific break fees in our contract but the bank demanded it, saying it was an industry custom,"" the executive said. ""I told them it doesn't make sense."" 
His company never paid the fee and the bank gave up trying to collect it, he said.
For decades, the transfer agent business was labour intensive because stock certificates and other records were handled manually. But digitalisation has helped streamline it, making it more profitable, industry insiders say.
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust's transfer agent business, which includes two small subsidiaries, had a 49% profit margin in the last financial year, compared with 39% for the bank overall, according to regulatory filings.
At Mitsubishi UFJ Trust, it was 60% for the business, nearly double the bank's overall margin of 31%. Mizuho Trust doesn't give a breakdown for the business. 
ANTI-MONOPOLY LAWS
When a client moves, the banks just need to retrieve and forward their database records, according to the two executives, one of the people familiar with the matter and another industry insider. 
Although the volume of data depends on the number of shareholders a company has - some of Japan's biggest firms have 700,000 or more - the records are supplied electronically by the Japan Securities Depository Center, a common platform for stock transfers.
Mitsubishi UFJ Trust said other data needed to be prepared and transferred, including dividend payment records.
""If the break fees cannot be rationally explained and serve as an obstacle to newcomers, the practice could be against anti-monopoly laws,"" said Yasuo Daito, a lawyer specialising in antitrust issues at Nozomi Sogo Attorneys at Law. 
But if larger banks' services are simply better than those of potential challengers, then a violation of anti-monopoly laws would be less likely, Daito said. Investor-relations firm IR Japan Holdings in 2012 became the first new market entrant in four decades. It now has a 1% share. 
IR Japan said it doesn't charge break fees. It declined to comment on the practice.

Poynton's departure is the latest in a string of executive exits at the casino operator that is one-third owned by billionaire Packer, after an inquiry accused it of money laundering and governance issues.
The representative of Packer's private company had been on Crown's board since 2018. After a regulator rebuked Packer's control over the board, Poynton said last month he was ending his arrangement with Packer and would stay as an independent director.
But on Monday Crown Executive Chair Helen Coonan said the regulator, the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA), considered it appropriate that Poynton step down ""due to a perceived lack of independence arising out of his past relationship"" with Packer.
Poynton agreed to resign ""despite no adverse findings by the commissioner in the ILGA inquiry in relation to his suitability, integrity or performance"", Coonan said.
Three Australian states have either held or said they would hold inquiries into Crown since Australian media reports accused the company of doing business with tour operators with ties to organised crime.
Crown initially denied the allegations but admitted at the Sydney inquiry in 2020 that some of the claims were true.
Separately, the Fair Work Ombudsman said it was investigating Crown after the company self-reported that it had underpaid its staff.
Several of Australia's biggest companies, including Woolworths, Coles and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) have been hit by underpayment scandals in recent years.

Crown shares were up 1.6% by 0045 GMT as the broader market gained over 1.5%.

(Reuters) - Cybersecurity startup Axonius has raised $100 million in a private funding round led by New York-based growth equity firm Stripes at a valuation of $1.2 billion, the company said on Sunday.
    The latest funding came less than a year after Axonius' last raise and brought Axonius' total funding to $195 million, signaling strong investor appetite in cybersecurity firms that have seen strong demand during the global pandemic. The company plans to announce the raise on Monday.
    New York-based Axonius develops an end-to-end device management platform to help its enterprise customers track computers and systems that connect to their networks.
    The four-year-old firm saw explosive growth last year as companies around the world increased cybersecurity spending in an adaption to a remote working environment during the COVID-19 outbreak.
     Axonius said it booked more than $10 million in annual recurring revenue last year, triple its 2019 revenue, counting Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN), Landmark Health, and the U.S. federal government as its clients.
    ""The pandemic has from a business perspective definitely increased the priority and the urgency of organizations with cybersecurity,"" chief executive Dean Sysman said in an interview. ""The funding also shows we're financially and strategically positioned to be independent for the long haul.""
    The proceeds will be used for building out new features on the platform, looking for acquisition targets and expanding into new geographies such as Asian markets, said Sysman.
    Other backers of Axonius include Bessemer Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) Ventures Israel.
    Rapid adoption of remote working, coupled with frequent cyberattacks and transition to the cloud, has fueled investors' interest in cybersecurity firms. Funding in the cybersecurity industry reached an all-time high of $11.4 billion last year, a nearly 50% increase from 2018, according to CB Insights.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Initial deliveries of the newly approved Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) COVID-19 vaccine should start on Tuesday, senior Biden administration officials said on Sunday, saying they hoped to boost lagging vaccination rates among minorities.
The officials acknowledged that vaccination rates among Black and brown Americans were ""not where we ultimately want them to be"", but said measures had been put in place to boost those numbers, and sought to assure minorities that the vaccines were safe. Federal officials were also closely monitoring distribution to ensure it was equitable, they said.
""Even though we know the data are not complete, we do see these early patterns that suggest Black and brown Americans largely are getting vaccinated at rates lower than the representation in the general population,"" said one of the officials.
The officials gave no data on the disparities, but KFF, a health policy and research organization, has found that people of color are getting smaller shares of vaccinations as compared to their share of the population. In Alabama, for instance, Black people account for 27% of the population and 31% of the deaths from COVID-19, but only 17% of the vaccinations.
The U.S. officials said they respected the concerns raised by some Black Americans given a history of past disparities and ""egregiously unethical conduct"", including the Tuskegee study in Macon County, Alabama, in which federal health officials denied black men treatment to study syphilis from 1932 to 1972.
But they underscored the importance of everyone who was eligible to get vaccinated as soon as possible, to get control of the pandemic, and said great efforts had been made to ensure that Black and brown people were adequately represented at every stage of the vaccine process.
""It is critical for people to understand the safeguards that are in place around this clinical research, but also the diversity and representation at the level of the scientist, at the level of the policymakers and those who are reviewing these data, as well as the clinical trial participants,"" said one of the officials.
Up to 400 community vaccination centers were being put into areas with large minority population, and officials would use mobile units to reach more people, they said, adding that flexible hours of operation also would be critical.
""We have directed states to manage distribution of all (three) vaccines in a fair and equitable way, and we will continue to monitor that closely,"" a second official said.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine involves only one shot, not two, and may be easier to distribute since it does not require a freezer, but federal officials said all three vaccines should be made available evenly across communities and the country.

DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) has asked banks to extend by a year a $10 billion loan it raised last May, two sources familiar with the matter said, suggesting that rebounding crude prices are not pushing the oil giant to reduce debt for the time being.
The sources confirmed a report by Loan Pricing Corporation, a fixed-income news provider owned by Refinitiv.
It is at the banks' discretion whether to extend the loan, but lenders will likely agree in order to maintain a good relationship with Aramco in the hope of receiving future business, LPC said citing a banker.
One of the sources, who confirmed the report, echoed that, saying: ""It's Aramco. Why not?""
Aramco declined to comment.
LPC cited a banker as saying it was possible Aramco would try to push down pricing by arguing that market conditions have improved since May, when oil prices were much lower and there was much uncertainty about the pandemic.
The loan started at 50 basis points over LIBOR, a rate that steps up as more money is drawn from the facility, one of the sources told Reuters, adding Aramco could try to reduce pricing by 10 to 15 bps.
Brent crude futures settled at $66.13 a barrel last week. In May last year they were trading at around $30 a barrel, as global demand plunged due to the coronavirus crisis. 
Sources told Reuters last year that Aramco would use the loan to back its acquisition of a 70% stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, a deal worth almost $70 billion.
LPC had previously reported, citing a banker, that the loan would be repaid with the proceeds from a bond sale by the fourth quarter of 2020. That did not happen, even though Aramco raised $8 billion in a multi-tranche bond deal in November.
Saudi Aramco's profits plummeted last year, but it stuck to a promised $75 billion annual dividend, most of which goes to the Saudi government.

HSBC said this month that Aramco's prospects look more positive and promising for 2021, hinting at declining net debt and a possible dividend hike.

The fundraising should be completed in two to three months and another round is planned at the end of the year, Rimac told the trade journal. 
Porsche owns a 15.5% stake in Rimac Automobili and could raise its stake to just below 50% in a deal that would also include the transfer of Volkswagen's supercar brand Bugatti to Rimac, Automobilwoche said.
Volkswagen and Rimac were not immediately available for comment on Sunday.
Porsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume said earlier this month that intense discussions on Bugatti's future were ongoing and that Rimac could play a role as the brands were a good technological fit, adding that a decision was expected in the first half of 2021.
Rimac has developed an electric supercar platform, which it supplies to other carmakers, including Automobili Pininfarina.
""Supercars have a limited market, the market for components is much bigger. That is why we are planning to expand our company,"" Rimac told Automobilwoche.
That includes plans to more than double Rimac Automobili's workforce by early 2023 to 2,500 from 1,000 currently, he said.

57,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2021 04:45PM ET</span>",Warren Buffett's $10 billion mistake: Precision Castparts,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett makes mistakes too.
The 90-year-old billionaire on Saturday admitted he ""paid too much"" when his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc spent $32.1 billion in 2016 to buy aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, its largest acquisition.
Berkshire wrote off $9.8 billion of Precision's value last August, as the coronavirus pandemic sapped demand for air travel and the Portland, Oregon-based unit's products.
In his annual letter to investors, Buffett said he bought ""a fine company - the best in its business,"" and Berkshire was ""lucky"" to have Precision Chief Executive Mark Donegan still in charge.
But Buffett said he was ""simply too optimistic about PCC's normalized profit potential."" 
Precision shed more than 13,400 jobs, or 40% of its workforce, in 2020, and only recently has begun to improve margins, Berkshire said.
""I was wrong ... in judging the average amount of future earnings and, consequently, wrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business,"" Buffett wrote. ""PCC is far from my first error of that sort. But it's a big one.""
Two years ago, Buffett admitted he ""overpaid"" for Kraft Foods when Berkshire and private equity firm 3G Capital merged it in 2015 with their H.J. Heinz Co to form Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co.
And in his 2008 annual letter, Buffett called his 1993 purchase of Dexter Shoe his ""worst deal"" ever, saying he had bought a ""worthless business"" and compounded his error by using Berkshire stock rather than cash to fund the acquisition.
""I'll make more mistakes in the future - you can bet on that,"" he wrote.
Tom Russo, a longtime Berkshire investor, welcomed Buffett's candor.

""I admire Warren for taking personal responsibility for Precision Castparts,"" he said. ""Few managers are willing to admit their responsibility rather than pass on blame.""

58,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>","Buffett upbeat on U.S. and Berkshire, buys back stock even as pandemic hits results","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's enthusiasm for the future of America and his company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc has not been dimmed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Buffett used his annual letter to investors to assure he and his successors would be careful stewards of their money at Berkshire, where ""the passage of time"" and ""an inner calm"" would help serve them well.
Despite the disappearance last year of more than 31,000 jobs from Berkshire's workforce, Buffett retained his trademark optimism, buying back a record $24.7 billion of its stock in 2020 in a sign he considers it undervalued.
He also hailed the economy's capacity to endure ""severe interruptions"" and enjoy ""breathtaking"" progress.
""Our unwavering conclusion: Never bet against America,"" he said.
Tom Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and longtime Berkshire investor, said: ""He's a deep believer in his company and the country.""
The letter breaks an uncharacteristic silence for the 90-year-old Buffett, who has been almost completely invisible to the public since Berkshire's annual meeting last May.
But while touching on familiar themes, including Wall Street bankers' avarice for dealmaking fees that benefit them more than companies they represent, Buffett did not dwell on the pandemic, a prime factor behind Berkshire's job losses.
He also did not address recent social upheavals or the divisive political environment that some companies now address more directly.
""The letter highlighted the innovation and values that have become the backbone of America, and that's perfectly acceptable,"" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research with a ""hold"" rating on Berkshire.
""Given the reverence that investors have for him, the letter was striking for what it omitted,"" she added. ""A new generation of investors demands a degree of social awareness, and that companies like Berkshire set out their beliefs, standards and goals.""
Buffett also signaled a long-term commitment to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), where Berkshire ended 2020 with $120.4 billion of stock despite recently selling several billion dollars more.
He called Apple and the BNSF railroad Berkshire's most valuable assets - ""it's pretty much a toss-up"" - other than its insurance operations, and ahead of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. ""The family jewels,"" he called those four investments.
PROFIT RISES EVEN AS JOBS ARE LOST
Berkshire on Saturday also reported net income of $35.84 billion in the fourth quarter, and $42.52 billion for the year, both reflecting large gains from its stocks.
Operating income, which Buffett considers a more accurate measure of performance, fell 9% for the year to $21.92 billion.
The stock buybacks have continued in 2021, with Berkshire repurchasing more than $4 billion of its own stock. It ended 2020 with $138.3 billion of cash.
Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has more than 90 operating units including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and See's candies.
Its workforce declined 8% from a year earlier to about 360,000 employees. Bigger drops were reported at BNSF, which shed 5,600 jobs, and See's, where employment fell 16%.
The pandemic hit no Berkshire business harder than Precision Castparts Corp, which shed 13,473, or 40%, of its jobs.
Berkshire bought the aircraft and industrial parts maker in 2016 for $32.1 billion, Buffett's largest acquisition, and took a $9.8 billion writedown as the pandemic decimated travel and punished Precision's aerospace customers.
""I paid too much for the company,"" Buffett wrote. ""I was simply too optimistic about PCC's normalized profit potential.
""PCC is far from my first error of that sort,"" he said. ""But it's a big one.""
Berkshire said some businesses are beginning to recover form the pandemic.
""Certainly 2021 is going to be a much stronger year, dependent upon the speed of vaccinations and the opening of the U.S. economy,"" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co with a ""buy"" rating on Berkshire.
Buffett also said Berkshire's annual meeting will be held in Los Angeles rather than Omaha, allowing 97-year-old Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, a Californian, to rejoin him and answering about 3-1/2 hours of shareholder questions.
Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, 58, and Ajit Jain, 69, who are widely considered frontrunners to succeed Buffett as chief executive, will also be available to answer questions.

Buffett said he hopes Berkshire will in 2022 resume its annual shareholder weekend in Omaha, which normally draws around 40,000 people - an ""honest-to-God annual meeting, Berkshire-style,"" he wrote.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Texas's grid operator on Friday shut Griddy Energy LLC's access to the state's power network for unpaid bills and shifted its 10,000 customers to other utilities, as new signs of a financial crisis rose after a state-wide blackout. 
Griddy was the power marketer that sold consumers electricity at wholesale rates, which rose to $9,000 per megawatt hour as cold weather struck the state last week. Unable to cope with demand, utilities cut power to 4.3 million residents as temperatures fell below freezing. 
Grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) ""effectively shut down Griddy,"" the electricity marketer said in a statement on its website. Requests for further comment were not returned.
ERCOT separately said $2.1 billion of its service bills went unpaid from utility and other grid users on Friday, another sign of the devastation from high electricity rates during the cold snap.
Griddy's statement said it accounted for ""a tiny fraction"" of ERCOT's unpaid bills. 
ERCOT was transferring about 10,100 Griddy customers to others on Friday. Retail power providers that do not pay invoices within 72 hours can have all their customers reassigned. 
The grid operator's handling of the severe weather fueled a firestorm of criticism from residents and state officials who blamed ERCOT for lack of preparation for the severe cold. ERCOT called on utilities to cut power to protect the grid, which left 4.3 million people without heat or light and led to billions of dollars in damages. 
ERCOT will likely face more shortfalls in coming days, said Patrick Woodson, chief executive of power marketer Green Energy Exchange. His firm is among nine companies protesting multimillion dollar blackout fees levied by ERCOT. 
“The price of surviving the first wave of these high bills is you get hit with additional costs in the second wave,"" said Woodson. ERCOT spreads unpaid fees among remaining grid users. 
The grid operator said it will cover $800 million of the shortfall by borrowing from internal accounts, and will draw an undisclosed amount from grid users with credit balances. An ERCOT spokeswoman did not reply to requests for comment. 
Vistra Corp., the largest retail electric provider in the United States, said its TXU unit in Texas ""volunteered to take on significantly more customers"" expecting a wave of transfers after the outages. 
""There often are opportunities to acquire retailers after events of volatility. As always, we will continue to be opportunistic when looking to purchase smaller customer books,"" spokeswoman Meranda Cohn said in an email. 

Seven of ERCOT's 15 directors resigned this week and a nominee withdrew. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has said public anger was justified and blamed ERCOT for not acting faster to keep generators from going offline.

64,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 08:25PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors weigh new stock leadership as broader market wobbles,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A shakeup in stocks accelerated by the past week's surge in Treasury yields has investors weighing how far a recent leadership rotation in the U.S. equity market can run, and its implications for the broader S&P 500 index.
Moves this week further spurred a shift that has seen months-long outperformance for energy, financial and other shares expected to benefit from an economic recovery, while a climb in Treasury yields weighed on the technology stocks that have led markets higher for years.
The two-track market left the benchmark S&P 500 down for the week, and sparked questions about whether it could sustain gains going forward if the tech and growth stocks that account for the biggest weights in the index struggle.
So far this year, the S&P 500, which gives more influence to stocks with larger market values, is up 1.5%, while a version of the index that weights stocks equally is up 5%.
""That just tells us the gains are less narrow, more companies are participating, and I think that's healthy,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson.
The focus on market leadership comes as investors are weighing whether the S&P 500 is due for a significant pullback after a 70% run since March, with the rise in long-dormant yields the latest sign of trouble for equities as it means bonds are more serious investment competition. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note this week jumped to a one-year peak of 1.6% before pulling back.
Economic improvement will be in focus in the coming weeks, including the monthly U.S. jobs report due next Friday, as will the country's ability to ensure widespread coronavirus vaccinations, especially as new variants emerge.
Tech and momentum stocks helped drive returns in 2020 ""when everyone was locked down and all they had was their computer,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management. ""Now it seems with the vaccines, the stimulus and the prospect of reopening that we are looking out toward a recovery phase.""
The shift in the market this week is building on one that was fueled in early November, when  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine news generated broad bets on an economic rebound in 2021.
Among the moves since that point: the S&P 500 financial and energy sectors are up 29% and 65%, respectively, against a nearly 9% rise for the benchmark index and 7% rise for the tech sector. The Russell 1000 value index has gained 16.5% against a 4.3% climb for its growth counterpart, while the smallcap Russell 2000 is up 34%.
""You definitely are seeing the reopening trade that has pretty much come alive here,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management.
Despite the gains, there remains ""plenty of room for the reflation trade to run from a valuation perspective,"" Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a report this week. RBC is ""overweight"" the financials, materials and energy sectors.
Rising rates tend to be favorable for more cyclical sectors, David Lefkowitz, head of Americas equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note, with financials, energy, industrials and materials showing the strongest positive correlations among sectors with 10-year Treasury yields.
Still, how long the market's reopening trade lasts remains to be seen. Investors may be reluctant to stray from tech and growth stocks, especially with many of the companies expected to put up strong profits for years.
Any setbacks with the economy or with efforts to quell the coronavirus could revive the stay-at-home stocks that thrived for most of 2020.
And with a GameStop-fueled retail-trading frenzy taking hold this year, banks and other stocks in the reopening trade may fail to draw the same attention from amateur investors as stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments.

""There isn't the pizzazz to those stocks,"" Meckler said. ""There rarely is a potential for stocks to make the kind of moves that big tech growth stocks have made.""

The Securities and Exchange Commission acted because none of the companies have filed any information with the regulator for over a year, it said in a statement. This is the regulator's third and largest wave of suspensions in response to social media activity. 
Retail interest in certain stocks, most notably  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), has surged in a social media frenzy, leading to volatile trading.

SoftBank, the new owner of the office-sharing firm, did not disclose terms of the settlement. Media reports earlier this week indicated the deal includes a nearly $500 million cut in Neumann's payout from SoftBank.
The legal tussle between SoftBank and Neumann started in 2019, when SoftBank agreed to buy around $3 billion in WeWork stock belonging to Neumann as well as current and former WeWork employees. SoftBank later contested its obligation to purchase the shares.
Under the new settlement, SoftBank will purchase around half the shares it had originally agreed to buy, a source familiar with the talks had told Reuters on Monday.
The settlement is also expected to clear the decks for WeWork as it reportedly pursues a public listing by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).
""This agreement is the result of all parties coming to the table for the sake of doing what is best for the future of WeWork,"" said Marcelo Claure, executive chairman of WeWork and CEO of SoftBank Group International.

SoftBank, which poured more than $13.5 billion into WeWork, was pulled into the legal dispute with directors at WeWork after backing out of the $3 billion tender offer agreed when it bailed out the office-sharing firm following a flopped IPO attempt.

(Reuters) - Relatives of victims of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX crash in Ethiopia that occurred five months after an Indonesian Lion Air disaster are stepping up pressure on the American planemaker and the federal government, according to a court filing and a letter to U.S. lawmakers.
Families have called for testimony from Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun, his predecessor and other current and former employees as part of their legal case in Chicago, court documents show.
Separately, the families urged lawmakers in letter to demand that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration turn over internal emails and documents spanning the Lion Air crash and one month after the Ethiopian crash. Together, 346 people died.
The letter was sent to members of the House and Senate transportation committees on Friday, including committee head Representative Peter DeFazio and aviation subcommittee chair Representative Rick Larsen.
A Congressional official said: ""I can confirm that this week Chairs DeFazio and Larsen re-upped their request to DOT (Department of Transportation) for FAA records that have gone unfulfilled to date."" 
A Senate report in December detailed lapses in aviation safety oversight and failed leadership in the FAA. It found that FAA leaders obstructed that report as well as a DOT watchdog review of the regulator's oversight, the results of which were released on Wednesday. 
""There is serious unfinished business,"" the families said in the letter, reviewed by Reuters.
Boeing has mostly settled civil litigation stemming from the Lion Air crash, but still faces over 100 lawsuits in Chicago federal court related to the second crash.
The plaintiffs' lawyers are focusing on what Boeing knew about the causes of the first crash and why the plane continued to fly. They want to schedule depositions of Calhoun and Muilenburg between May 3 and June 18.
Those victims' families also want to know what FAA management, which in November lifted a 20-month safety ban of the MAX, understood about the first crash.
Boeing's board faces a separate investor lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, where a complaint unsealed this month alleged breach of fiduciary duties and gross negligence by failing ""to monitor the safety of Boeing's 737 MAX airplanes.""

Last month, Boeing reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department over the 737 MAX crashes, including a $243.6 million fine.

(Reuters) -  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) closed 6% lower on Friday as an early rally fizzled but the stock finished the week 151% higher in a renewed surge that left analysts puzzled. 
The video game retailer's shares closed at $101.74 after retreating from a session high of $142.90. The weekly rocket ride higher came despite a broader market selloff that sent the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) down 2.5% over the same time. 
Analysts have struggled to find a clear explanation, and some were skeptical the rally would have legs. 
""You might be able to make some quick trading money and it could be a lot of money, but in the end, it's the greater fool theory,"" said Eric Diton, president and managing director at The Wealth Alliance in New York. The theory refers to buying stocks that are over-valued, anticipating a ""greater fool"" will buy them later at a higher price. 
Analysts mostly ruled out a short squeeze like the one that fueled GameStop's rally in January, when individual investors using Robinhood and other apps punished hedge funds that had bet against the stock, forcing them to unwind short positions. Many GameStop buyers took their cues from online investment forums on Reddit and elsewhere. 
Short interest accounted for 28.4% of the float on Thursday, compared with a peak of 142% in early January, according to S3 Partners.
Options market activity in GameStop, which has returned to the top of the list in a social media-driven retail trading frenzy, suggested investors were betting on higher prices, higher volatility, or both. 
Refinitiv data showed retail investors have been buying deep out-of-the-money call options, which have contract prices to buy far higher than the current stock price.
Many of those option contracts were set to expire on Friday, meaning handsome gains for those who bet on a further rise in GameStop's stock price.
Call options, profitable for holders if GameStop shares hit $200 and $800 this week, have been particularly heavily traded, the data showed. GameStop's stock traded this week as high as $184.54 on Thursday, far below the $483 intraday high it hit in January.
""The actors are looking to take advantage of everything they can to maximize their impact and the timing is important,"" said David Trainer, chief executive officer of investment research firm New Constructs. ""The options expiration will contribute to their strategy on how to push the stock as much as they can and maximize their profits."" 
Bots on major social media websites have been hyping GameStop and other ""meme stocks,"" although the extent to which they influenced prices was unclear, according to analysis by Massachusetts-based cyber security company PiiQ Media. [nL1N2KW2TW] 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday suspended trading in 15 companies because of ""questionable trading and social media activity."" GameStop was not among them.
The 15 companies were in addition to six stocks it recently suspended due to suspicious social media activity.
Robinhood said it has received inquiries from regulators about temporary trading curbs it imposed during a wild rally in shorted stocks earlier this year.

Other Reddit favorites were also lower on Friday, with cinema operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) down 3.4%, headphone maker Koss off 22.4% and marijuana company Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) down 2.9%.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said on Friday it recorded an additional $390 million in operating expenses in the 2020 fourth quarter after a U.S. federal judge ruled it was not entitled to recoup money it mistakenly wired to lenders of Revlon Inc last year. 
As a result, Citigroup revised its fourth-quarter earnings to $1.92 per share down from $2.08, according to a filing. 
In August, an ""operational error"" caused Citigroup to send $893 million of its own funds to the cosmetic company’s lenders, appearing to pay off a loan not due until 2023, when it intended to send only a $7.8 million interest payment. 
To date, $389.8 million had been repaid to he bank at its request, but some lenders have held on to the funds leading the bank to wage a legal battle against a group of hedge funds to recover the remainder.
This month, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said the transfers were complete transactions not subject to revocation and declined to force the defendants to return the funds. Citigroup is planning to fight the decision. 
""I do believe that we have good grounds for an appeal, and we're going to pursue that,"" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said an industry conference on Thursday. 
The unprecedented blunder was the latest misstep involving internal controls at Citigroup, which federal regulators fined $400 million in October over longstanding deficiencies. 
Shortfalls in Citigroup’s internal controls were a factor in Chief Executive Mike Corbat’s planned early retirement this month.

Jane Fraser will take over the reins of the company on Monday.

(Reuters) - Retail brokerage Robinhood said on Friday U.S. regulators were looking into its temporary trading curbs on so-called meme stocks earlier this year as shares of companies like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) soared during a social media-fueled short-squeeze.
The brokerage, whose trading app surged in popularity over the past year, also said in a regulatory filing https:// detailing the probes that it set aside $26.6 million for a potential settlement around trading outages in March 2020, as well as its options trading policies.
Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood was at the heart of a mania that gripped retail investors in late January following calls on Reddit thread WallStreetBets to trade certain stocks that were being heavily shorted by hedge funds.
The flurry of activity drove up prices of the shares until Robinhood, along with several other brokers, restricted buying of the stocks, including GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc, angering many of its customers.
The company later lifted the curbs and said the move had been necessary due to a surge in clearinghouse collateral requirements.
Robinhood, which is expected to go public this year with a valuation of $20 billion, has more than 13 million users with a median age of 31, according to its most recent figures.
The company's app outages in March came as markets whipsawed in reaction to the coronavirus pandemic.
Robinhood said it was in settlement talks with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority over the outages, as well as its options trading policies.
The company said it has received inquiries from the SEC, FINRA and the New York Attorney General's Office, among others.
Representatives for FINRA and the SEC declined to comment.

The SEC and other regulators are also examining incidents of unauthorized takeovers Robinhood customer accounts, the broker disclosed.

71,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 04:55PM ET</span>","Texas power crisis could cripple small marketers, unravel market deregulation","By Gary McWilliams
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Retail power marketers in Texas are appealing multi-million dollar bills from last week's blackout that they say could cripple them and unravel Texas' nearly two-decade-old experiment as the most deregulated U.S. electricity market.
Wholesale prices, which last year averaged $26 a megawatt hour, soared to $9,000 per MWh for days as grid operators tried to quench a severe shortage that left up to 4.3 million residents shivering in the dark last week. The state's total bill for electricity over seven days rose by $45 billion from the prior week, lawmakers said on Thursday. 
""The state will likely experience the largest number of failures of retailers ever seen,"" said Patrick Woodson, chief executive of Green Energy Exchange. ""Competition will all but cease to exist."" His firm will survive, he said, despite service charges hitting nearly $19 million, up from $37,000. 
Some consumers also face enormous bills. During the freeze, some 40,000 consumers who had monthly plans pegged to wholesale prices got bills of up to $9,500 as generators froze and prices soared. State officials have said they will help consumers. The state has about 6.4 million residential electric accounts.
WITHERING COMPETITION 
Texas in 2002 deregulated its power system, splitting generation from transmission lines and from retail sales. It spawned 100s of marketers offering fixed, variable and indexed rate plans and fuel choices. Fallout from the outage will accelerate consolidation, experts said. 
The industry split initially led to modest fees to marketers and generators for maintaining the state's grid. But those fees were tied to wholesale price of electricity and jumped last week along with the cost of power. That saddled retail marketers with tens of millions of dollars in bills for services that ordinarily cost a few thousands. 
The enormous jump in fees resulted from the grid operator failing to lower wholesale priced when supplies became adequate, said Brandon Young, chief executive of Young Energy LLC, which has about 32,000 customers providers said.
""Our ancillary services costs alone for that one week are greater than our entire energy costs for all of 2020,"" said Young. 
The head of grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has said it left the wholesale price at $9,000 per MWh to financially motivate power generators to remain on the grid. ERCOT CEO Bill Magness said late Thursday he and other officials hope to address the fees. 
ERCOT has not relaxed its order requiring companies to pay fees within 72 hours to avoid have their customers reassigned to big utilities. 
APPEALING FOR REPRIEVE
Natural gas utilities and power generators buying the fuel for their gas-fired power plants will likely have to borrow money to cover the cost of the gas when prices skyrocketed.
Atmos Energy (NYSE:ATO) Corp and One Gas Inc spent over $2 billion each to buy gas as prices hit a record high of nearly $24 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), from $2.30 per mmBtu. The borrowing costs would wind up in consumer bills, analysts said. 
Nearly a quarter of the 100 Texas power companies receiving the high power and services bills could end up transferring all their customers to rivals. 
Consolidation could leave more than 80% of deregulated Texas retail customers with giants Vistra Corp and NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG), consumer advocates and industry executives said. Both have been buying up rivals in recent years. 
Nine companies this week appealed to the state regulator to cancel or delay the fees, which are due 72 hours after invoices are received. Pulse Power, which has 100,000 customers, said it lost $2,000 per customer during the week, according to a filing with the state. 
Freepoint Commodities, another power marketer, sought a waiver for charges of more than $20,000 per MWh over five days, saying the requirement for immediate payment ""will be devastating."" It plans to dispute the charges, said associate general counsel Simona Patru, who declined further comment in an email. 
CUSTOMER SWAP
For consumers, the loss of these mostly small marketers and potential funneling of their customers to a handful of big utilities will reduce plans available and raise prices, said consumer advocates.
""Prices can go up too easily with a lack of competition,"" said Tim Morstad, associate state director for consumer advocacy group AARP Texas. ""That’s where this train is heading.""

Texas has called on the state's largest utilities, including Vistra Corp's TXU, to accept customers from other providers. TXU told the state it would accept more than 1.3 million new customers.

Investing.com – An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration on Friday recommended approval of emergency authorization for Johnson & Johnson's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for a third vaccine to enter the fray and help lead the fight against the pandemic.  
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) rose 1.6% in aftermarket hours
The FDA could grant that emergency use authorization over the weekend. It comes just days after the agency said the vaccine was 66.1% effective in preventing moderate-to-severe Covid-19 cases after 28 days. 
The efficacy of the drug differed across geographies amid new variants. It was 72% effective in the U.S., 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa. While the vaccine was less effective at preventing illness in South Africa, it was still highly effective at preventing severe disease. The pharmaceutical giant's vaccine results, released on late-January Jan. 29, initially drew a lukewarm reaction from market participants following the 90%+ efficacy levels of other vaccines including  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s mRNA vaccines. 
Analysts, however, welcomed the late-stage initial clinical results and highlighted that JNJ's vaccine, with an 85% effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalizations/death, two primary drivers of the lockdowns and restrictions, would play a key role in reopening of economies.

Investing.com – The Dow slumped Friday, snapping its three-week win streak as a tepid rebound in tech and a sea of red across energy and financials soured investor sentiment.

A fabulous February in which the major indexes hit record highs turned sour in the final days of the week. Cyclicals like energy and financials, the darlings of the February, despite a wobble on Friday ended the month sharply higher.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The CEOs of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and other airline officials met virtually with White House officials Friday to discuss tackling aviation pollution and urge U.S. support for greener aviation fuel.
United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) made clear the carrier was fully committed to confronting the climate crisis and sought White House support for ""incentives for sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture in the forthcoming economic stimulus proposal,"" the airline said in a statement.
White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, economic adviser Brian Deese and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg took part in the meeting, including discussion of using biofuels to power air travel and reduce carbon emissions. Reuters first reported the planned meeting.
U.S airlines and renewables companies have been lobbying the Biden administration to back a big increase in subsidies for lower-carbon aviation fuel, arguing new incentives are needed to help fight climate change and will also make their recovery from the pandemic much greener.
The White House said in a statement the officials were ""optimistic to hear airline leaders share information about the industry’s ongoing and future efforts to address climate change, and they offered the administration’s support to strengthen and advance the airlines’ climate goals.""
Currently, Airlines for America (A4A), the industry trade group, uses only about 1.5 million gallons of green plane fuel in the United States a year, out of a total commercial jet fuel market that exceeds 620 million barrels.
The price of sustainable aviation fuel can be three or four times higher than traditional jet fuel, making it uneconomical without government support, A4A told Reuters earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines has agreed to pay $49.5 million to resolve criminal charges and civil claims relating to fraud on Postal Service contracts for transportation of international mail, the U.S. Justice Department said Friday.
""United defrauded the U.S. Postal Service by providing falsified parcel delivery information over a period of years and accepting millions of dollars of payments to which the company was not entitled,"" the department's acting criminal division chief, Nicholas L. McQuaid, said in the announcement.
As part of the agreement, the Justice Department agreed not to prosecute the case.
The airline said in a statement USPS ""is a valued customer for United, and we are glad to have remedied these procedures and look forward to serving the Postal Service in the future.""
The Justice Department said between 2012 and 2015, United defrauded the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) by submitting false delivery scan data.
The government said United submitted automated delivery scans based on aspirational delivery times. The government said some individuals at United sought ""to hide the automation practices included efforts to revise the falsified delivery times to make the automated scans appear less suspicious to USPS.""
The government said United had removed the principal manager of the criminal scheme and hired outside legal and accounting advisors to review and consult on the company's government contracting compliance.
United also agreed to strengthen its compliance program and to submit yearly reports to the Justice Department detailing the status of remediation and implementation of United’s compliance program and internal controls.
The government cited United’s prior history, including a 2016 non-prosecution agreement relating to potential criminal bribery violations arising out of United’s establishment and operation of a non-stop route between Newark and Columbia, South Carolina.

In 2019, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) paid $22.1 million to settle Justice Department claims it falsely reported the times it transferred possession of U.S. mail to foreign postal administrations or other intended recipients.

The interim rule, which will allow Commerce to monitor transactions of governments including China’s, was first proposed by the previous administration in January -- days before Joe Biden’s inauguration -- and follows an executive order former President Donald Trump signed in 2019. The department said Friday it’s accepting public comments on the plan through March 22, the same day it becomes effective.
Former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the interim rule listed the governments of China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and Cuba as adversaries.
The rule is “intended to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting vulnerabilities” in the information and communications technology-services supply chain, Commerce said in an emailed statement Friday. “Trustworthy information and communications technology and services are essential to our national and economic security and remains a top priority for the Biden-Harris administration.”
Technology companies including International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp. say the rule, if implemented in its current form, would damage the economy.
“By the Commerce Department’s own estimate, this rule would impose many billions of dollars in new compliance costs on millions of U.S. firms, including countless small businesses,”  IBM  Regulatory Affairs Vice President Christopher Padilla said. “Such a massive, overbroad, and economically damaging Trump-administration rule should not be on autopilot.”
There is widespread concern in the business community about the breadth of the rule and the precedent it would set in giving the agency blanket authority to interfere in transactions.
Earlier this month, the biggest trade associations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, warned the Biden administration of the negative impact the rule could have on the economy and asked it to halt its implementation.
“The net impact of these negative consequences could undermine the much-needed economic recovery from the pandemic that is a priority of the administration and a central feature of the Biden-Harris American rescue plan,” the groups wrote in a Feb. 4 letter.

In two separate reports, they raised concerns ranging from regulatory risk to alleged false claims by the company about its business.
SOS, formerly a consumer-lending company called China Rapid Finance, could not be immediately reached for comment outside business hours in China.
SOS shares have nearly doubled in value this year since it outlined plans to invest in cryptocurrency on Jan. 13, benefiting from a rise in institutional support for bitcoin and other digital assets.
""Stocks tied to blockchain have been on the run lately, swept up in the euphoria of bitcoin breaking all-time highs. $SOS has ridden this wave,"" short-seller Hindenburg said in a tweet.
The short-seller said it visited the address listed as headquarters in the company's regulatory filing and found it to be a hotel.
One of the allegations made by Culper is that SOS has not actually purchased the cryptocurrency mining rigs that it said it did.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq rebounded Friday as bargain hunting traders swooped in to buy beaten down tech stocks following a slump a day earlier.
The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.82%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.23%, or 385 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.11%.
Tech rose nearly 2% as investors took advantage of the recent slump in big tech, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) leading the gains.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remained in the red, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were also higher.
The rebound in tech followed the worst one-day loss since October for the tech-heavy Nasdaq on Thursday. Rising U.S. Treasury yields, which have since abated, dented demand for growth stocks that have longer payback periods.  
The rise in yields has been exacerbated by a growing inflation jitters, with the 5-year forward breakeven rate, a measure of long-term inflation expectations, ""rising from a low of 0.86% at the onset of the crisis to 1.94% as of Feb. 25,"" Stifel said.
While another round of stimulus will likely boost prices, massive inflationary implications is not necessarily a foregone conclusion. Against the backdrop of tepid recovery and elevated joblessness, some consumers are more likely to ""save than spend any additional stimulus funds received [and] could more likely lead to stagnant, or at the very least, very minimal price pressures over the next 12-24 months,"" Stifel added
The rebound in tech, however, failed to spill over into other corners of the markets as cyclicals traded in the red.
Energy was among the steepest decliners, paced by drops in  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI), TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI) and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), with the latter down 9% despite better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
Other quarterly results, meanwhile, were mixed.
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) fell 5% after its missed Q4 estimates and guided margins to be flat in fiscal 2022.
 Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) reported earnings that beat expectations, but revenue missed Wall Street estimates in Q4 as comparable store sales slipped 2% on the prior-year period.
Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB)'s maiden quarterly report as public company drew much investor fanfare as company's beat on the bottom line sent its share price soaring 15%."

S&P's move follows rosier outlooks from rating agency counterparts Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch over recent months, and it was announced along with a review of ratings of several major European banks. 
The bank embarked on a restructuring in 2019, closing some businesses and shedding thousands of staff in an effort to return to profitability. In 2020, the bank posted its first full-year profit since 2014.
""Our positive outlook acknowledges the huge progress made and the bank's likely resilience to the current adverse economic conditions,"" S&P said. It rates Deutsche at 'BBB+', below many of its competitors.
S&P added that ""the benefits of restructuring will emerge over the next 12-24 months"" and ""lift Deutsche Bank's performance more into line with higher rated European peers"".
S&P lowered Deutsche's outlook to negative last year amid uncertainty around the coronavirus crisis.
Credit ratings are critical for any company but especially for a bank such as Deutsche, which, like all financial institutions, is a big issuer of debt securities.
Higher ratings can result in lower funding costs, helping Deutsche return to more sustainable profitability. 

""Once again, we have won recognition, from a key stakeholder, for disciplined execution of our transformation,"" Deutsche's finance chief James von Moltke wrote in a memo seen by Reuters.

84,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 01:20PM ET</span>",Ardagh Metal to sell largest-ever green junk bond,"By Yoruk Bahceli
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Ardagh Metal Packaging (NYSE:PKG) will sell green bonds worth about $2.8 billion on Friday, the biggest green issuance in the high-yield market to date, as a part of its plan to merge with a blank-check firm backed by billionaire Alec Gores. 
Sub-investment-grade firms rarely issue green bonds, which fund environmentally-friendly projects. Just $12 billion was raised by such companies last year, according to Dealogic, a far cry from 2020's overall green issuance of $270 billion, according to Climate Bonds Initiative.
The issue from Ardagh Metal Packaging, which is being spun off from Luxembourg-based global packaging group Ardagh Group, is triple the size of French recycling services group Paprec's 2018 deal, the previous largest. 
Ardagh Metal's four-part deal was upsized from the $2.65 billion-equivalent initially offered, according to a lead manager memo seen by Reuters. It will sell dollar- and euro-denominated paper, raising the equivalent of about $1.15 billion via secured notes and about $1.65 billion-equivalent through unsecured notes. 
Ardagh Metal was valued at $8.5 billion in the Gores-backed merger.
Azhar Hussain, head of global credit at Royal London Asset Management said the deal's scale was ""significant"" for the high yield market, adding it could allow investors to gauge whether the 'greenium', or pricing benefit companies get from issuing a green bond, extends to the high yield market.
Unlike the vast majority of high-rated issuers that make up the green bond market, investing in junk debt generally requires more credit work given the higher risk of default and relative difficulty obtaining information about some issuers.
Spain's Abengoa, which issued the first junk green bond in 2014, showed that green investors weren't immune to default risk when it filed for bankruptcy in 2016.
GREEN DOWN THE LINE
In an investor presentation seen by Reuters, Ardagh Metal did not identify any immediate green use for the cash raised. It will provide the vast majority of the proceeds from the bond sale and new equity issuance to parent Ardagh, which will retain an 80% stake in the business, Ardagh said in a statement. 
Ardagh in turn will use the funds to repay debt, pay potential dividends to its shareholders and other corporate purposes.
Within three years, the company plans to allocate funds equivalent to the bond proceeds to projects eligible for its green financing framework, which addresses areas like procuring recycled aluminium and using renewable energy.
""That's a little bit unusual, because normally there would be a more clear-cut identification of specific projects,"" said Thomas Thygesen, head of strategy and research, climate and sustainable finance at SEB. 
Other companies, which target broader, company-wide sustainability goals rather than funding specific projects tend to issue sustainability-linked bonds instead, where interest payments rise if targets are missed.
Even so, Thygesen saw Ardagh's deal as a sign of progress towards a mature green bond market that can fund a wider range of corporate capital needs. 

""Ultimately, we're hoping that this will turn into a complete market where you can do all the things related to your capital structure if you have the right ambitions and the right commitment.""

87,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 11:05AM ET</span>",London could lose out to New York under draft EU finance deal: document,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The City of London's finance industry would be worse off than rival New York under an early draft for a cooperation agreement in financial services between Britain and the European Union, a document, seen by Reuters, showed.
Britain's financial services industry has been largely cut off from the EU, its biggest customer, since a Brexit transition period ended on Dec. 31 as the sector is not covered by the UK-EU trade deal.
Trading in EU shares and derivatives, for example, has already left Britain for continental Europe.
Both sides are committed to agreeing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) by the end of March on regular, informal talks about financial rules and market supervision.
An early draft of this document, seen by Reuters, has less substance than a deal the EU agreed with the United States in 2016, industry officials said.
""This is the start of a negotiation - the Commission proposed text is clearly more limited than the UK ambition,"" said Chris Bates, a financial services lawyer at Clifford Chance.
Brussels can grant direct market access for foreign financial companies if it deems their home market rules are as robust as the EU's own standards, a system known as ""equivalence.""
A person familiar with Britain's negotiating position said the UK focus is on making sure the MoU provides transparency and appropriate dialogue when it comes to adopting, suspending and withdrawing equivalence decisions.
Currently, the EU can in theory scrap equivalence decisions with just 30 days' notice.
Under the U.S. deal with the EU, equivalence is treated as ""outcomes-based"".
Britain has called for EU equivalence also to be outcomes based, which would ensure that the focus would be on whether financial rules in Britain and the EU produce the same result.
But there is no mention of outcomes-based equivalence in the draft EU-UK memorandum.
The EU text is deliberately more unambitious that the U.S. agreement and does not reflect even the current depth of relationship with bilateral MoUs already signed between individual regulators in Britain and the EU, one financial sector source said. 
But industry officials also said that even the draft document now circulating would be a start in rebuilding trust between both sides.
""It is important to establish some framework for a regulatory dialogue even if there are low expectations of any movement on new equivalence decisions any time soon,"" Bates said.
The financial industry wants Britain to include a provision for consultations with industry as part of the regulatory dialogue, the first source said. 
""The MoU is on the lighter side of what the City wants,"" a second financial sector source said, adding that this might make little difference given that Britain is likely to get only limited equivalence.
The European Commission declined to comment on the document. The UK finance ministry had no immediate comment.
Brussels has already made it clear that even an agreed MoU will not automatically lead to more EU access for London's finance industry beyond time-limited permission to clear EU derivatives trades.
The EU executive is meeting with banks on Friday to ask how they can justify continuing to clear derivatives in London.

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said this week that Britain would resist any EU attempts to arm-twist banks into shifting trillions of euros in derivatives clearing from Britain to the bloc.

LONDON (Reuters) - A London High Court judge on Friday found  Barclays  (LON:BARC) guilty of ""serious deceit"" over how it negotiated a financial lifeline with Amanda Staveley during the credit crisis in 2008, but denied the businesswoman damages and dismissed her claim. 
Judge David Waksman said the decision would be a grave disappointment to Staveley's PCP Capital Partners group, which has claimed around 836 million pounds ($1.16 billion) in compensation during an acrimonious court battle.
""...while PCP has succeeded on liability, it has failed on causation and loss with the result that the overall claim fails,"" he said, noting Staveley was a ""tough, clever and creative entrepreneur"" who Barclays had sought to disparage.
The civil case revolved around how the bank secured billions of pounds from Qatar and Abu Dhabi-backed investors 13 years ago, allowing it to secure its independence - and the jobs of its bosses - by avoiding a state bailout.
A Barclays spokesman welcomed the judge's decision. But Staveley said she would be taking advice on an appeal.
""In spite of Barclays' efforts to question my character and credentials, the court has recognised my abilities as a businesswoman and the truth of my account of events,"" she said.
""The judgment confirms what I have said from the outset and repeated in my evidence; a senior executive at Barclays repeatedly lied to me when seeking private investment in the bank during the 2008 financial crisis.""
PCP, which led a 3.25 billion pound, Abu Dhabi-backed investment into the bank, alleges it was induced to fund Barclays on much worse terms than Qatar - despite assurances it would get the same deal.
It alleged Barclays paid Qatar 346 million pounds in hidden fees and handed the Gulf state a $3 billion loan that almost matched Qatar's investment.
Barclays countered that it had struck separate, commercial agreements with Qatar and that PCP's case was ""wrong at every stage"". Qatar has said so-called Advisory Services Agreements, under which it received payments from Barclays in 2008, were genuine and had provided for potential substantial transactions.
Barclays had dismissed Staveley as a ""thoroughly unreliable witness"", who used ""embellishment and invention"" and whose modus operandi was to ""duck and weave"".
But Waksman said the then 34-year-old secured an ""excellent deal"" for Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
""The truth is that this was a case where the corporate investment arm of a major bank facing almost unprecedented pressure had to deal with a persistent and determined counterparty (Staveley) who had ... the trust of some major players in the Middle East business world,"" he said. 
Barclays, one of the few British banks to avoid a bailout in 2008, escaped criminal charges over the 2008 fundraising in 2018 and three former executives were cleared of fraud last year in a case brought by the Serious Fraud Office.
But the bank still faces a regulatory ruling over the 13-year-old episode. The Financial Conduct Authority in 2013 proposed a 50 million pound fine over how the bank disclosed its dealings with Qatar. The watchdog declined to comment on Friday.

The global No.2 after Toyota by cars sold, Volkswagen is spending tens of billions of euros to reinvent itself as a leader in the market for electric vehicles, where Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has stolen a march on established rivals.
""Last year, the Volkswagen Group succeeded in containing the effects of the pandemic on its business and laying important strategic foundations for its transformation at the same time,"" finance chief Frank Witter said on Friday.
Deliveries and sales, which were both hit by the pandemic in 2020, are seen up significantly this year, the company said, without being more specific. In 2020, sales fell 11.8% to 222.9 billion euros ($270.2 billion), while deliveries dropped 15.2%.
The operating margin is seen at the upper end of its 5.0-6.5% target range, Volkswagen said, up from 4.3% last year.
""The financial results now available are far better than originally expected and show what our company is capable of achieving, especially in a crisis,"" Witter said.
""We intend to carry over the strong momentum from the significantly better second half into the current year.""
Shares in Volkswagen turned positive on the news and rose as much as 2.4% to a fresh 13-month high.
While the company has emerged from the hit to demand caused by the pandemic, a shortage of crucial semiconductors caused it to adjust production through February, joining other carmakers around the world that have suffered similar problems.
Despite the profit drop, Volkswagen recommended keeping its dividend to shareholders stable for 2020 versus 2019, when it paid 4.86 euros per preferred and 4.80 per ordinary share, beating analysts' estimate of 3.35 euros for preferred shares, according to Refinitiv data.

93,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 09:48AM ET</span>","Wall Street Turns Choppy After Higher Opening; Nasdaq Flat, Dow Down 270 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets were choppy in early trade on Friday, reversing early gains after economic data that showed no meaningful increase in short-term inflation pressures.
The price index for U.S. personal consumer expenditures, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, just a fraction above expectations in January. In year-on-year terms, it remains at a historically low level of 1.5% growth.
The figures sparked something of a rotation back into growth names over value ones, a reversal of the trend seen over most of the week. However, selling quickly returned to the fore as the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slumped to a six-month low.
By 10 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 273 points, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite, which has borne the brunt of the week’s selling, was flat, completely reversing an early gain of 1.3%.
Separately, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock lost another 1.2% after Bloomberg data showed outflows of over $500 million from fund manager Cathie Wood's suite of ARK funds which have invested heavily in Tesla, Bitcoin and other names synonymous with the tech-focused rally of the last year. The redemptions put pressure on ARK to liquidate some of its holdings. On Thursday, Bloomberg had reported on Thursday that Tesla had become the latest carmaker to be hit by a global shortage of semiconductors, temporarily idling its Fremont plant in California.
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock also fell 4.3% after a disappointing outlook in the software provider's quarterly update late on Thursday.
Overall sentiment had been lifted at the start of the day by figures showing that personal income in January rose by 10%, above expectations for a figure of 9.5%, as a fresh round of stimulus payments approved in the dying days of the last Congress hit consumers' accounts.  The numbers indicated that the damage to household balance sheets from the surge in unemployment last year will be contained. Personal spending also increased, by a more restrained 2.5%.
The numbers come at the start of a day on which the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus package. One element that has been pulled from that package is the proposal for a $15/hour national minimum wage, which Senate officials said couldn't be decided under Budget Reconciliation provisions. That is now likely a dead letter, given the opposition from Republican Senators.
In other moves, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock rose 3.7% after its fourth-quarter update showed a faster-than-expected rebound in bookings, something it said expects to continue as the first phase of the travel sector's reopening benefits the private rental sector more than the hotel sector. Virgin Galactic stock slumped 14% after the space tourism company said it had delayed its next test flight until May, and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) stock fell by 4.6% after it said it expected the reopening of restaurants nationwide to slow its growth in the coming months.

Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm hired by Nikola to conduct a review in connection to allegations of fraud by short-seller Hindenburg, was also assessing if the inaccurate statements violated any statute, the filing said.
The law firm would also continue to assess the accuracy of other statements made by Nikola, including in its current regulatory filings.
Nikola is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with Hindenburg's allegations.
The short-seller's report claimed that Milton, who has since resigned as chairman, had made false claims about the company's proprietary technology to form partnerships with large automakers. Nikola had publicly rejected all accusations.

Milton was not immediately available for comment.

Traders and brokers had criticised the NSE over the lack of information after the four-hour shutdown on Wednesday, saying it had hurt investors.
Because the exchange did not swiftly update on when the exchange would reopen, brokers began closing intra-day equity positions on another exchange, leading to sharp losses for some investors.
The NSE had announced that the exchange had shut at 11:40 a.m. local time because of a telecoms problem. It announced market re-opening at about 3:17 p.m., by which time many brokers had closed their investors' open positions.

""This communication was done only after there was visibility and clarity on resumption of services and any prior communication would not have been appropriate,"" the NSE said in a statement on Friday.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. Treasuries' selloff give European stocks an edge,"By Julien Ponthus and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
(Reuters) - The selloff in U.S. Treasuries may finally give the bourses of Frankfurt, Paris or Milan a decisive edge for 2021 after five straight years of underperformance against Wall Street. 
What has changed from the previous years is that the 10-year U.S. yield, at roughly 1.5%, now matches the dividend yield of the S&P 500.
That means a risk-free U.S. government bond yields as much as the average Wall Street stock's dividend.
By contrast, European yields are nowhere near U.S. levels although they also have risen to 12-month highs. Despite the selloff, French 10-year yields are flirting with 0% and Germany's are still well below the -0.2% bar. 
Any euro zone 10-year government bond, including Greece at about 1.1%, is safely under the 1.8% dividend yield of the EURO STOXX.
The 'there is no alternative' narrative, or ""TINA"", the acronym coined to describe how equities were the only game in town, no longer applies to U.S. markets but is arguably still very much in play in Europe.
Graphic: Dividend yields versus bond yields - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/yzdpxwwdzvx/Pasted%20image%201614333089215.png
U.S. equities are also expensive, trading at 22.3 times their forward 12-month earnings versus an historic average of 16 times.
With government bonds getting more attractive, the risk premium investors are willing to pay for stocks is likely to steadily shrink. 
Still, major asset managers such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) like U.S. stocks for their long-term earnings growth potential. 
With the U.S. Federal Reserve and government stimulus going full force, the U.S. economy is expected to recover more rapidly and strongly than Europe.

Another structural trend might also boost the attractiveness of European stocks: the reflation trade triggered by the vaccine breakthrough and the stimulus boost expected from the new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. 
Equity portfolio managers have begun to shift towards stocks that typically benefit from rising rates, growth and inflation, like banks and energy groups, and away from those like tech that have prospered in a low-growth, low-interest-rate environment.
European indexes have long suffered from their lack of big technology stocks such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which have been investors' darlings in the past decade.
But a stock market cycle fuelled by growth and inflation could transform Europe's cyclical overweight weakness into a competitive edge.
Year to date in dollar terms, the pan-European STOXX 600 and the S&P 500 are neck and neck with a rise of about 2%.

An AmBank spokesman had no immediate comment. 
AmBank Group has been under scrutiny over its role in the alleged theft of $4.5 billion from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund former prime minister Najib Razak set up in 2009.
Last year, Najib was found guilty of corruption and money laundering charges over the transfer of millions of dollars linked to a 1MDB unit into his Ambank accounts between 2014 and 2015. He denies wrongdoing and has filed an appeal. 
As part of the settlement with AmBank, Malaysia's securities regulator will require AmInvestment Bank Berhad to take corrective measures, including putting in place systems and processes to strengthen its due diligence framework, the finance ministry said. 
""Resolving this through the court system would have cost a lot of time, money and resources,"" Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz said in a statement. 
""With this settlement, the payment of the monies will be expedited, instead of being held up by lengthy court battles, and can be utilised to fulfil 1MDB’s outstanding obligations.""
The government said in November 1MDB was still $7.8 billion in debt following the scandal. 
In 2015, the Malaysian central bank gave AmBank a 53.7 million ringgit fine by for breaching certain financial regulations.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 08:25AM ET</span>","Increase equity exposure, suggest global funds amid selling frenzy: Reuters poll","By Tushar Goenka and Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The bull-run in stocks has at least another six months to go, according to Reuters polls of fund managers, who recommended increasing equity exposure to levels not seen in over a year, despite a frenzied sell-off in financial markets in February.
A rout in bond markets sent yields flying with the return on the 10-year Treasury note rising to a one-year high this month, driving distressed selling in global equities and leading to heavy losses from all-time highs.
But the Feb. 10-25 poll of fund managers and chief investment officers in the United States, Europe and Japan - with a total of more than $4 trillion assets under management - showed equity allocations accounted for 49.5% of the model global portfolio, the highest in over a year. 
Global funds also recommended cutting bond holdings to 39.8% from 40.1% in the previous month, the first time in two years the suggested average fixed-income allocation has accounted for less than 40% of the model portfolio. 
""The explanations to the run-up in global stocks to record highs since the pandemic have been tenuous and so are the reasons for the whiplash in bonds and the carnage in equity markets in February,"" said a chief investment officer at a large U.S. fund management company. 
""Looking beyond the short-term noise, we acknowledge the reflation trade for what it is: better economic growth prospects amid dovish and jobs-first rhetoric from central banks - which is widely positive for stock markets, despite the recent surge in yields on inflation worries."" 
Graphic: Reuters funds Poll: Global stock markets outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/dgkvlzzxevb/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20Global%20stocks%20markets%20outlook%20asset%20allocation-%20Feb%202021.PNG
Government bonds have become the focal point of markets, after trading showed positioning for higher inflation internationally, even after U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank officials tried to talk down rising yields. 
While higher bond yields could make stocks appear relatively less attractive on lofty valuations and a diminishing dividend advantage, the latest poll marks the fourth consecutive month of recommendations in favour of equities. 
""The recent choppiness of equity markets while yields drift up adds to investors' nervousness. But, we believe drivers of the yield move are crucial,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, fund Manager at Legal & General Investment Management. 
""As long as rising yields are driven by a combination of higher inflation and better growth prospects, it is positive for markets. There is little long-run return potential in bonds which makes long-term expected equity returns, albeit lower than normal, still quite attractive."" More than three-quarters, or 19 of 25 asset managers in response to an additional question said the broad run-up in global stocks would continue for at least another six months, including nine respondents who said longer than a year. 
That echoes findings in a separate Reuters poll of around 300 equity strategists who expect the broad trend of stock market gains to continue this year.
""Without doubt, monetary and fiscal support has been a major driver (of stocks). In the near-term, there is little evidence of this support to fade - actually the opposite seems to apply, especially in the United States,"" noted the investment team at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments Partners. 
But more than 70%, or 18 of 25 fund managers in response to another question said corporate earnings would take longer than six months to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, including 12 who said longer than a year. 
With earnings still some way below pre-virus levels, hefty stock valuations make equities sensitive to rising bond yields - taking away some of their allure, especially high-flying tech stocks. 
""While historically a pickup in inflation has been positively correlated with the performance of equity markets as a whole, below the surface things could be more nuanced,"" said Kevin Thozet, member of the investment committee at Carmignac. 
""Such an environment would likely benefit reflationary equities. But it could be different for the other part of the market and notably those where valuations are very high."" 

Underscoring the caution over lofty equity valuations, all-but-one of 25 respondents answering another question said a significant correction - commonly defined as a fall of 10% or more - in stock markets in the next six months was likely.

99,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 08:10AM ET</span>",Bond markets left smarting from worst rout in years as reflation goes global,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - From the United States to Germany and Australia, government borrowing costs on Friday were set to end February with their biggest monthly rises in years as expectations for a post-pandemic ignition of inflation gained a life of their own.
Australia's 10-year bond yield and Britain's 30-year yields were set for their biggest monthly jump since the 2009 global financial crisis. Long-dated New Zealand yields were flirting with their biggest monthly surge since 1994.
The move, which began in the U.S. Treasury market at the start of the year on prospects for a huge fiscal boost and economic recovery, has spread globally.
Even after a Friday respite from this week's brutal drubbing, Australia's 10-year yield is up 70 basis points in February and New Zealand's 10-year yield is up almost 77 bps.
(Graphic: Australia's 10-year bond yield set for biggest monthly rise since 2009: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpyoogmpg/AU2602.png)
Australia's 10-year bond yield has soared almost 40 bps this week alone to 1.8%, its biggest weekly jump since 2013 . 
And as three-year bond yields moved above their 0.1% target, the Reserve Bank of Australia on Friday made an unscheduled offer to buy A$3 billion ($2.35 billion) of three-year bonds, on top of a similar amount on Thursday, to calm markets.
""Given how expensive bonds have been, meaning yields have been depressed, it was expected that when the selloff came it would move at great speed,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
""This is a move driven by the U.S. and that has fed out to other markets, but large elements of the selloff in recent days are not just about the improvement in growth fundamentals but technical factors, too."" 
(Graphic: Monthly change in bond yields: US, UK, Germany: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplzzwepb/febyields2602.png)
For the United States and some European markets, the bond selloff was on the scale of late 2016, when Donald Trump's election as U.S. President last triggered so-called reflation bets. 
U.S. 10-year bond yields, up more than 35 bps this month and near one-year highs above 1.45%, are set for their biggest monthly jump since November 2016. 
Britain's 10-year bond yield, up 45 bps in February, was also set for its biggest monthly jump since 2016. Thirty-year yields headed for their biggest monthly leap since 2009 after rising 48 bps. 
Rising government bond yields pose a challenge for central banks trying to steer economies through the COVID-19 crisis. They feed through to the real economy by raising the rates at which banks lend and consumers borrow, thereby tightening financial conditions.
Japan, which targets long-dated bond yields at around 0%, has seen 10-year yields rise almost 10 bps this month to 0.15%. That puts it on track for the biggest monthly gain since March 2020, the peak of the COVID-19-induced market turmoil.
In the euro area, where German Bund yields were set for their biggest monthly jump in three years, the European Central Bank has said it is monitoring the rise in rates closely. 
""Seen from a fundamental angle, the ultra-low yields of 2020 made much less sense than the less depressed yields to which markets are heading now,"" said Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding.
Schmieding said 10-year U.S. yields were likely to rise to 2% by the end of the year as investors price in strong growth and a rebound in underlying inflation. German Bund yields could reach 0%, ""with risks tilted to the upside.""

Danone said in a statement sent to Reuters its board of directors and management team welcomed ideas from all shareholders, but did not answer calls for a new CEO. ""Understanding shareholder priorities is a top priority of the senior management team and the board of directors"", the maker of Activia yoghurts said. French daily Le Monde said Danone's board of directors was due to meet on March 1. Danone didn't confirm the meeting. Artisan, which has a 3% stake in Danone, called for a split in the roles of CEO and chairman, echoing Bluebell's demands. ""The roles of CEO and chairman should be split to reflectmodern-day corporate governance. Governance standards also require that prior leadership leave the board. And logic demands more consumer goods experience on the board of directors,"" wrote Artisan. ""A new, non-financial CEO with consumer goods experience and a track record of success should be installed as soon as possible to restore Danone to the elevated status it deserves within the French business establishment."" Artisan has previously urged Danone to sell underperforming brands, such as Asian water label Mizone. 
In recent months Faber had taken steps to try to ward off activist investors, announcing in November a plan to cut 2,000 jobs, trim product ranges and sell some assets, including the group's business in Argentina and its Vega plant-based brand.

102,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 07:22AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Mixed; Big-tech Stocks in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Friday, amid cautious trading after the previous session’s sharp drops as investors start to readjust their interest rate expectations.
At 7:20 AM ET (1220 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.2%. 
Wall Street closed sharply lower Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1.8%, pulling back from a record high; the S&P 500 losing 2.5%, its worst day since Jan. 27; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 3.5%, its biggest one-day sell-off since Oct. 28.
Friday’s selloff marks a sharp turnaround for equities which rallied for the most of January and February, with climbing bond yields suggesting markets are starting to factor in an earlier rate hike from the Federal Reserve, despite recent dovish comments to the contrary. 
Fed fund futures have now almost fully priced in a rise to 0.25% by January 2023, and the thought of an eventual end to virtually free money has weighed on stocks, particularly the high-growth variety which have very stretched valuations. 
This means the popular big-tech stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will remain in focus Friday, after they all suffered sharp falls on Thursday.
Away from this, so-called meme stocks also look likely to be in focus after GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock soared almost 60% on Thursday even as the broader markets fell. It has posted another 10% gain premarket. However, other stocks popularised by chat rooms, like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Blackberry (TSX:BB) and Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS), all moved lower premarket Friday.
The economic data slate will center around the personal income release for January, which is expected to go up 9.5% after the 0.6% gain in December, and January’s personal spending, which is seen increasing 2.5% after falling 0.2% in December. Both numbers come out Friday at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
Oil prices fell sharply Friday, as rising U.S. Treasury yields supported the greenback, making U.S.-dollar priced oil more expensive while top producers could increase supply next week.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is due to meet next week. Concerns are growing that this rise in prices will tempt the producers to add supply to the market.
Baker Hughes rig count and CFTC positioning data are due later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $62.39 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.5% to $65.10. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,760.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% lower at 1.2115.

104,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 06:50AM ET</span>",Analysis: Global bond rout turns up the heat on central banks,"By Swati Pandey and Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Central banks in Asia struggled to smother a selloff in global bonds on Friday, piling pressure on their bigger peers to do more, as spooked investors sold assets to cover deepening losses and rushed out of crowded positions in stocks.
The erratic trade evoked memories of last March and comes as the pandemic recovery enters a delicate phase, with financial markets moving swiftly to price in an end to the cheap money that had lit a fire under world stocks for a year. 
Australia's central bank launched a surprise bond buying operation to try and staunch the bleeding, calming cash markets but barely taming the fear, evident in more liquid futures trade.
The Bank of Korea promised as much as $6.3 billion in new bond buying before the end of June, but the currency kept crumbling for a two-day fall of more than 1.5%.
And as selling spread to gold, stocks, commodities and emerging markets' currencies, investors were turning to the biggest central banks to step in and to hurry up.
""It's pretty clear that central banks now need to put a leash on the bond market,"" said Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at fund manager Perpetual in Sydney.
""I think that would be much more constructive than just sitting there and hoping it all goes away,"" he said, adding focus was in particular on whether the Bank of Japan or the U.S. Federal Reserve would step up bond buying at longer tenors. 
Bonds, normally considered a safe bet, sit at the heart of financial markets because they determine the cost of capital which serves as a reference point for all other asset pricing.
The rout is being driven by the speed of the recovery and expectations of higher inflation, even as major central banks predict benign consumer prices and cheap money.
But it also has the potential to choke the recovery and upend markets as investors liquidate profitable trades to pay for losses on bond holdings.
A rise in bond yields means a fall in bond prices, or a capital loss. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are on their way to a monthly gain of nearly 40 basis points, their steepest such rise in more than four years. [US/] 
Ten-year sovereign yields in Australia and New Zealand, where virus recovery is proceeding fastest, have climbed 71 basis points and 77 basis points respectively, hammering investors. 
Even the risk-taking Japanese were rushing for cover from their own and foreign markets, sending the Nikkei to its biggest drop in almost a year and the yen sharply higher. 
STARTING A FIGHT?
Although bonds fought to stabilise on Friday, traders reported strains on liquidity.
""Absolute carnage,"" said one bond trader in Sydney. ""You need a very large risk tolerance to trade this, which I don't have.""
In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan said it wanted to keep the nation's yield curve low.
""It's important now to keep the entire yield curve stably low as the economy suffers the damage from COVID-19,"" Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told parliament.
""The BOJ has no intention of pushing up (10-year bond yields) above its target of around 0%.""
Two European Central Bank policymakers said the bank was monitoring yields but not moving to control them, which seemed to pare Thursday's losses in European bonds but not much more.
Some investors think the ECB will eventually step in but analysts at Swedish bank SEB said the ECB's reluctance may be because it doesn't want to be cornered into buying more than what's comfortable.
""Starting a fight against the market would require the ECB to win no matter what, otherwise the bank's credibility is on the line,"" they wrote.
MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares excluding Japan slid 3.4% to a one-month low on Friday, the sharpest one-day percentage decline since March 2020.

TUNE IN TUESDAY
The RBA will hold its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday and markets are widely expecting it to reinforce its forward guidance as well as address the market dislocation.
""You've got to expect the rhetoric to be firmer,"" said Westpac analyst Sean Callow. ""They've got to say more than they normally do about financial markets, otherwise they'll look completely out of touch.""
The difficulty, however, facing both the RBA and the U.S. Federal Reserve is that the bond selloff is supported by an economic backdrop that has improved significantly with coronavirus vaccines being rolled out successfully.
Inflation is also being powered by anticipation of actual consumption, particularly of key industrial commodities such as oil, copper and iron ore, which have scaled milestone highs led by infrastructure spending from governments around the world.
Macroeconomic data out of the United States has also been encouraging, with a surprisingly sharp fall in jobless claims on Thursday and the central bankers have already said they are nowhere near close to winding back their support. 
Even so, Fed officials have stopped short of stepping in, with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic saying on Thursday he was not worried about the bond sell-off.
Stock futures in the small hours on Friday pointed to steadier equities trade in the United States, but if that changes, investors may expect a response.
""In the U.S., I think it's too early (for the Fed to step in),"" said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer for the Asia Pacific at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s asset management arm DWS in Hong Kong.
""I think if you had a 10-15% fall in equities, I think (U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell) would worry about it because he would then worry about that impact on the economy.""

105,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",Nissan says makes breakthrough with engine in reducing CO2 emissions,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co said on Friday it has reached a breakthrough in achieving a 50% thermal efficiency with its in-development e-POWER hybrid technology, which could lead to a further reduction of car CO2 emissions.
This new thermal efficiency level would improve fuel consumption by 25% over the 40% thermal efficiency level in the upcoming e-POWER engine, the company said.
""Nissan's latest approach to engine development has raised the bar to world-leading levels, accelerating past the current auto industry average range of 40% thermal efficiency, making it possible to even further reduce vehicle CO2 emissions,"" the company said in a statement.
Nissan did not disclose when the e-POWER technology with 50% thermal efficiency would be launched. 
Toshihiro Hirai, senior vice president of the powertrain and EV engineering division at Nissan, told reporters on Friday that the automaker is maximising the thermal efficiency of e-POWER in order to reduce CO2 emissions while driving.
The e-POWER, first introduced in Japan in 2016, uses a gasoline engine to charge a battery that powers the vehicle.
""It took 50 years to increase thermal efficiency (of conventional engines) from 30% to 40%,"" Hirai said. 
""But with e-POWER, we can increase it to 50% in several years. That has been the target for the engineering community,"" he said, describing that level as the ""ultimate, challenging goal"".
To achieve this, Nissan said it strengthened in-cylinder gas flow and ignition, which burns a more diluted air-fuel mixture at a high compression ratio.
""Without building up these fundamental technologies, we are unable to attain carbon neutrality,"" said Hirai.
The automaker said last month that all of its new models in key markets would be electrified by the early 2030s to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

Nissan has also said it expects sales of more than one million electrified vehicles per year by the end of fiscal 2023.

106,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>","Analysis: After Brazil ructions, a rethink for investors in emerging market state firms","By Karin Strohecker and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Brazil's shake up of state-run oil firm Petrobras has caused shockwaves at home but may also prompt some bond investors to rethink their $1 trillion-plus exposure to other government-controlled companies across emerging markets. 
From China's Exim Bank to Mexican oil giant Pemex or South African utility Eskom, companies wholly or partly government owned make up half of the $2.4 trillion market in emerging market corporate debt.
Such state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are generally in high demand from investors, first as their bonds carry a yield premium over sovereign's debt and second, because of the perception of state backing.
But Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's abrupt sacking of Petroleo Brasileiro SA's chief executive last Friday in favour of an army general ""reminds investors of the risk inherent of investing in SOEs or quasi-sovereigns,"" said Eric Ollom, head of EM corporate debt strategy at Citi. 
Petrobras shares plunged wiping out a 100 billion reais ($18 billion) in market value in two days and its bonds tumbled after Bolsonaro announced the CEO change in a social media post, following a spat over fuel price policy.
Emerging SOE debt - concentrated in financials, commodities and energy -- comprises around a fifth of the EMBI emerging debt benchmark compiled by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Governance, like at Petrobras, is just one of the concerns.
Graphic: IMF top non-financial SOEs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwzrryvw/IMF%20top%20non-financial%20SOEs.PNG
Utilities and power companies can be subject to politically motivated pricing directives, while financial disclosures and productivity can lag the private sector. 
Profitability can take a backseat to political priorities such as creating employment or winning elections.
""First and foremost, investors need to figure out and understand where does this SOE fit into the agenda of the political and socio-and economic landscape of the country... its social importance as employer or as a contributor to the budget,"" Sergey Dergachev, a fund manager at Union Investment, said.
He still likes Petrobras but is taking a wait and see attitude for now on a company that regularly catches the limelight. In 2018 the government stepped in to lower fuel prices in response to a crippling nationwide truckers’ strike, while last week's CEO dismissal came after right-wing populist Bolsonaro said recent fuel price hikes were hurting the Brazilian people.
Other investors such as Citi's Ollom are more sceptical, noting Petrobras bond spreads versus the sovereign blew out to multi-month highs of near 100 bps, from 30 bps. The move also hit Brazil's currency and its sovereign bonds. 
""If we keep getting bad news, we could maybe get a more permanent repricing,"" Ollom said. 
DECOUPLING? 
Investors aren't yet rushing to sell out of emerging market SOEs more broadly though. 
And close government ties can be a boon. 
Mexico just extended a $3.5 billion lifeline to state oil firm Pemex to shore up finances and crude output. Government backing allows Pemex to run a net debt leverage of 8.5 times - well above many other oil firms. 
Debt overhauls are rare at SOEs, though recently Chinese bond markets have been spooked by a wave of SOE defaults and Argentina's YPF this year was forced to overhaul its debt.
""The 'backing' of governments behind debt obligations could represent possible 'coupon buffers' and a signal of stability,"" said Guillaume Mascotto, head of ESG and investment stewardship at American Century Investments.
Nonetheless, the risk of state interference poses a dilemma for investors, especially for asset managers focusing on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) impact of their holdings, Mascotto said. 
Corruption poses another headache. State-owned companies in nations with ""high levels of perceived corruption"" are one third as productive as their private sector peers, according to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund.
Emerging market assets were roiled by the fallout from the pandemic last year, which sparked billions of dollars in outflows. Bonds from fully state-owned companies moved broadly in lockstep with sovereign debt.
Around 90% of SOEs hold credit rating scores in line with their sovereign. Most divergences where the SOE is rated below the sovereign are investment-grade firms, where default probability differentials are negligible, calculates asset manager GMO. 
The Petrobras shock may however test that close link. 
If investors start questioning the ability and or willingness of the sole shareholder -- the government -- to support a company, yield spreads between the sovereign and the SOE could decouple. 
""Increasing leverage on sovereign balance sheets might amplify this development,"" Thede Ruest, portfolio manager at Nordea, said.
The feedback loop can work both ways.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Monday struck Brazil's sovereign bonds off its 'like' list, citing fiscal concerns and potential spillovers after Bolsonaro's push.
Investors' growing ESG focus is another source of pressure, said Ruest, who avoids quasi-sovereigns. 
""Higher funding costs, as well as a global push to redirect capital towards business models supporting the U.N.'s SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), might make refinancing more difficult for many of those issuers,"" he said.

107,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 06:13AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Europe Bounces Back Nervously From U.S. Shock,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe's stock markets bounced back unconvincingly from an early shock on Friday, as a greater weight for cyclical stocks and reassurances from the European Central Bank gave a measure of support. 
By late morning on the continent, the Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.5% at 409.70, on course for its first weekly drop in four. It had recouped some 60% of a drop at the opening that took its lead not only from Wall Street, but also from a sharp sell-off across Asia, where some indices lost more than 3%. 
While the short-term direction remains largely at the direction of U.S. markets when they open later, no major support levels appeared to have been breached so far. Partly, that seems down to a relative degree of confidence that inflation is not about to take off in Europe. The Eurozone economy still had plenty of slack in it before the pandemic struck - a point rammed home over the last 24 hours by ECB chief economist Philip Lane and director Isabel Schnabel - and the level of fiscal and monetary stimulus being proffered around Europe is still of a different order of magnitude from that in the U.S. 
European stocks are arguably relatively well positioned to withstand the current sell-off in the States, not least because they failed to keep pace in the last two years as valuations ran away from reality. In addition, Europe's stock indices are heavily weighted to industrials and financials. German chemicals giant BASF (DE:BASFN) rounded off a solid week of earnings on Friday for cyclicals with predictions of a significant rebound in profits this year. The dominance of technology stocks that depend on heroic assumptions of free money forever to justify their prices simply does not exist. There is simply less froth to knock off European markets. 
Thirdly, the sell-off in the U.S. remains very much a phenomenon of the financial markets, rather than reflecting any change for the worse in the real economy. The reopening trade remains valid. If anything it has been bolstered by the European Union's agreement last night at a summit to work together on a scheme for 'vaccine passports' that should make it easier for cross-border tourism to take place later in the year (the devil will be in the details, however). Conspicuously, the tourism-sensitive Spanish and Greek indices were the two best performing among EU markets as a consequence, with the IBEX 35 staying in positive territory and the Athens General Composite losing only 0.2%.
For now, analysts in Europe are mostly confident that this is not the beginning of some 2013-style 'Taper Tantrum' with its own self-fulfilling dynamics, in which higher rates choke off a nascent economic recovery.
""We see a return of bond yields from ultra-low to still low levels as a consequence of, rather than an obstacle to, a strong economic rebound and solid gains in corporate earnings in most of the world,"" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist with Berenberg Bank, in a note to clients on Friday. ""The huge fiscal stimulus in the U.S. and the less headline-grabbing but still significant fiscal expansion in Europe, the combination of pent-up demand for consumer services with huge excess savings on both sides of the Atlantic, the need to replenish inventories and the positive outlook for global trade are an exceptionally potent mix.""
His year-end forecast of a 2% yield on the U.S. 10--year note and 0% on its German counterpart implies continued outperformance by European bonds in the meantime, albeit the risks to both are ""tilted to the upside”, he noted.

109,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>",Airbus exploring hybrid-electric aircraft technology,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is working on hybrid-electric propulsion among the options for reducing jetliner emissions, the European planemaker said on Friday. 
It disclosed the initiative in a document projecting more than a million tonnes of equivalent CO2 emissions over the life of each current-generation jet, as it became the first planemaker to report so-called ""Scope 3"" emissions. 
Until now, Airbus has mainly publicised hydrogen as the preferred energy source for future airplanes, pledging to introduce the first hydrogen-powered commercial plane in 2035. 
But on Friday it said it was also working on hybrid-electric alternatives. 
""The company's work in electric flight has laid the groundwork for our future concept of zero-emission commercial aircraft,"" Airbus said, adding it is ""now exploring a variety of hybrid-electric and hydrogen technology options"". 
Although experts say hydrogen could power relatively small planes to start with and galvanise green investments, it poses challenges because of its volume and the need for a new infrastructure. Rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) has downplayed the idea. 
Several industry sources say the leading option for a future replacement to the best-selling 150-seat A320, likely to enter service in the 2030s, involves hybrid-electric power, with hydrogen only likely to power such large airplanes later. 
Engine makers are actively exploring open-rotor engines with visible blades using a mixture of traditional turbines and electric propulsion for future replacements to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, industry officials told Reuters. 
Asked to comment on its hybrid-electric plans, an Airbus spokesman said: ""Only a combination of technologies, including hydrogen, will help us aim for zero emission."" 
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury has urged the industry to push itself harder on research and redefining operations. 
In 2019, Airbus inaugurated a facility for testing alternative propulsion systems and fuels in Europe. 

It is also using a Daher-Socata TBM 900 turboprop to analyse distributed propulsion with the standard engine supplemented by by wing-mounted, electricity-driven motors, the Airbus spokesman said.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>","Analysis: Hedge funds worry about market fallout from Tesla, ARK and spiking yields","By Maiya Keidan
(Reuters) - Some hedge fund managers are getting concerned about the money that has flooded into high-flying stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the popular ARK fund as bond yields spike and growth stocks take a hit.
The popularity of stocks like Tesla helped Cathie Wood's $26.6 billion ARK Innovation ETF become the top-performing actively managed U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar last year. 
But even as shares of Tesla plunged this week and Wood's fund fell, she increased the fund's bet on the automaker. The ARK Innovation ETF is down 15% this week and Tesla is down 13%, along with declines in other high-flying technology stocks. 
Growth names have been hit by higher bond yields while assets like bitcoin that have bubbled up have also pulled back.
Tesla was also hurt by a report of a temporary factory closure.
Wood's fund also owns a number of internet, social media and technology names, such as Twitter and Snap (NYSE:SNAP). 
""ARK believes that this week, which has had significant volume, multiple standard deviations above average, has shown that the ETF structure and markets work, providing ample liquidity and tight spreads,"" Tom Staudt, ARK's chief operating officer told Reuters via email. Still, some investors have concerns.
""Cathie Wood runs a very high-risk, high-beta tech portfolio, and to load up on Tesla right off its highs seems a little premature,"" said Peter Bortel, general partner at Bortel Investment Management, who said he put a short position on Tesla on Wednesday. 
""I've been meditating on the short for the last couple of weeks,"" Bortel added. 
Investors yanked $465 million from Ark Innovation on Monday, according to Refinitiv data. More such redemptions would prompt Wood's fund to sell liquid holdings to manage the squeeze in the near-term before looking to unwind its illiquid holdings.
""I do worry that funds like ARK could be forced to sell, devastating certain stocks where they are a big holder,"" said Rob Romero, portfolio manager at Connective Capital, based in California. 
Spiking bond yields, which saw 10-year Treasury note yields touching the highest level in a year at 1.614%, are causing particular pain for high-growth names. 
The S&P 500 technology sector, among the sectors that powered the market's rally in 2020, is down 4.5% this week.
David Greenwald, associate portfolio manager at Toronto-based Waratah Capital Advisors, said his firm has been ""broadly cautious"" of high-momentum technology stocks given the rapid increase in Treasury yields year-to-date.
Growth stocks like technology with longer duration cash flows can be sensitive to rising yields as those flows are discounted at higher rates.
""Many of these momentum stocks trade at valuation levels well above historical norms, which have been justified by the low-rate environment,"" said Greenwald. ""To the extent rates continue to rise, we would expect these stocks to continue to underperform the broader market.""
Andy Pauly, managing partner at Warwick Investment Management, said ""rapidly growing companies that are being priced on cash flows 10-20 years in the future are vulnerable to rising yields.”
That has been seen in the sharp divergence between growth and value stocks this year with the S&P 500 growth index nearly unchanged in February, sharply underperforming the value index, up more than 7% on optimism of a post-pandemic reopening of the economy.
Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital, which invests with some of Wall Street's largest hedge funds, said hedge funds didn't have too many growth or momentum stocks in their portfolios because they knew that ""sooner or later ... a lot of the global growth names are going to struggle."" 

""The larger, more well-established firms are well aware of this bias, well aware of this risk, have spent an inordinate amount of time making sure they're not overly exposed,"" said Gayeski.

(Reuters) - European stocks fell on Friday as investors booked profits in high-flying technology shares due to concerns over rising inflation and interest rates on the back of a jump in bond yields.
The benchmark European stock index was down 0.6%, paring earlier losses but still on track to record its first weekly fall this month. London's FTSE 100 slipped 0.2% and Germany's DAX lost 0.1%, both well off session lows.
""Equity markets across the U.S. and Europe are quite expensive now and with bond yields constantly rising, the fixed income market is proving to be more attractive than the riskier equity market,"" said Roland Kaloyan, a strategist at SocGen.
""Investors are actually looking at the pace at which yields drop and the current speed is quite concerning for equity markets.""
Asian markets fell to a one-month low, while the dollar rose from a three-year trough as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a one-year high, sparking fears the heavy losses could trigger distressed selling in other assets. [MKTS/GLOB] [FRX/]
Euro zone government bond yields, however, stabilised on Friday, although Germany's benchmark yield was still headed for its biggest monthly jump since 2016.
Technology stocks bore the brunt of this week's sell-off after powering the global stock market recovery last year as assurances from European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde and other policymakers failed to stem the rise in yields.
Still, the benchmark STOXX was tracking its best monthly gain since November, helped by a rotation into energy, banking and mining stocks on expectations of a pickup in business activity following vaccine rollouts.
Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings have also reinforced optimism about a quicker corporate rebound this year. Of the 194 companies in the STOXX 600 that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 68% have beaten analysts' estimates, according to Refinitiv.
""As recovery hopes gain ground with the economy re-opening and vaccines coming up, coupled with earnings being relatively positive, the near-to-mid-term outlook for equities seems positive with yield movements still a part of the equation,"" said Keith Temperton, an equity sales trader at Forte Securities.
Germany's Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) gained 0.3% after it reported forecast-beating fourth-quarter results as its merged U.S. unit T-Mobile continued to drive growth.

British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) gained 3.2% even after it recorded a 7.43 billion euro ($9 billion) loss last year and warned it could not say when normal flying conditions would return.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks fell on Friday, with Asian shares down by the most in nine months, as a rout in global bond markets sent yields flying and spooked investors amid fears the heavy losses suffered could trigger distressed selling in other assets.
MSCI's Emerging Markets equity index suffered its biggest daily drop in nearly 10 months and was 2.7% lower, while European shares opened in the red, with the STOXX 600 down 0.7%, recovering from heavier losses earlier in the session.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was 0.9% lower and heading for its worst week in a month.
Asia saw the heaviest selling, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sliding more than 3% to a one-month low, its steepest one-day percentage loss since May 2020.
For the week the index is down more than 5%, its worst weekly showing since March last year when the coronavirus pandemic had sparked fears of a global recession.
""It is not the beginning of a correction in equities, more a logical consolidation as price to earnings ratios were excessive,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""What is reassuring is that Q4 2020 earnings were good and earnings per share suprisingly good and that means down the road we should get back to growth.""
Friday's carnage was triggered by a whiplash in bonds.
The scale of the sell-off prompted Australia's central bank to launch a surprise bond buying operation to try and staunch the bleeding.
The European Central Bank is monitoring the recent surge in government bond borrowing costs but will not try to control the yield curve, ECB chief economist Philip Lane told a Spanish newspaper.
On Friday 10-year German government bond yields were down nearly 4 basis points at -0.267% and French and Austrian bonds were back in negative territory.
Yields on the 10-year Treasury note eased back to 1.4530% from a one-year high of 1.614% on Thursday.
""Bond yields could still go higher in the short term though as bond selling begets more bond selling,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP (OTC:AMLTF). 
""The longer this continues the greater the risk of a more severe correction in share markets if earnings upgrades struggle to keep up with the rise in bond yields.""
Markets were hedging the risk of an earlier rate hike from the Federal Reserve, even though officials this week vowed any move was long in the future. 
Fed fund futures are now almost fully priced for a rise to 0.25% by January 2023, while Eurodollars have it discounted for June 2022.
Even the thought of an eventual end to super-cheap money sent shivers through global stock markets, which have been regularly hitting record highs and stretching valuations.
""The fixed income rout is shifting into a more lethal phase for risky assets,"" says Damien McColough, Westpac's head of rates strategy.
""The rise in yields has long been mostly seen as a story of improving growth expectations, if anything padding risky assets, but the overnight move notably included a steep lift in real rates and a bringing forward of Fed lift-off expectations.""
Japan's Nikkei shed 4%, its biggest single-day fall since April, and Chinese blue chips joined the retreat with a drop of 2.4%.
EMERGING STRAINS
Overnight, the Dow fell 1.75%, while the S&P 500 lost 2.45% and the Nasdaq 3.52%, the biggest decline in almost four months for the tech-heavy index.
Tech darlings all suffered, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) the biggest drags.
All of that elevated the importance of U.S. personal consumption data due later on Friday, which includes one of the Fed's favoured inflation measures.
Core inflation is actually expected to dip to 1.4% in January, which could help calm market angst, but any upside surprise would likely accelerate the bond rout.
The surge in Treasury yields caused ructions in emerging markets, which feared the better returns on offer in the United States might attract funds away.
Currencies favoured for leveraged carry trades all suffered, including the Brazil real, Turkish lira and South African rand.
The flows helped nudge the U.S. dollar up more broadly, with the dollar index rising to 90.390. It also gained on the low-yielding yen, briefly reaching the highest since September at 106.42. The euro eased a touch to $1.2144.
The jump in yields has tarnished gold, which offers no fixed return, and dragged it down 0.1% to $1,767.81 per ounce, having earlier fallen to its lowest since June 26. 
Oil prices dropped on a higher dollar and expectations of more supply.[O/R]

U.S. crude fell 1.5% to $62.57 per barrel and Brent also lost 1.3% to $66.02.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 04:40AM ET</span>",BA-owner calls for COVID health passes after record $9 billion loss,"By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) is counting on digital health passes to help spur a travel recovery this summer, after the pandemic pushed it to a record 7.4 billion euro ($9 billion) loss last year, when it ran just a third of normal flights. 
Tighter travel restrictions over the last two months have threatened to ruin Europe's critical summer season and leave some airlines needing more funding, analysts have warned.
But after taking on new loans, IAG said it had 10.3 billion euros of liquidity and was well set to ride out the crisis.
""We've got very strong liquidity going into 2021 ... so no, we will not need additional funding,"" finance chief Steve Gunning told reporters on a call. 
European airlines hope travel restrictions will soon be eased to allow them to make money again. Britain on Monday laid out plans for travel markets to possibly reopen from mid-May, prompting a flood of bookings.
IAG chief executive Luis Gallego said if the UK plans went ahead, it would be a ""positive summer"", but digital health passes were needed to unlock the market.
""Health passes are going to be the key to restart the aviation and the travel,"" said Gallego, who is six months into the job, calling for a digital system that could include test results and proof of vaccination.
Several countries are considering health passports to help revive travel, but are worried about risks to civil liberties. However, Britain's Heathrow airport warned this week that dealing with a big rise in passengers would not be possible with current paper-based checks.
IAG shares were up 4% at 194 pence in morning trading. They have jumped 13% in the last five days, after Britain's announcement on a travel restart, but over the last 12 months have lost half their value. 
CASH BURN
The pandemic has already crippled airlines like Norwegian Air, and left major players such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa relying on state support. 
While a recovery is now in sight, there is still much uncertainty. 
IAG, which also owns Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, said it could not give profit guidance for 2021, and asked how many flights it might run this year, Gallego said: ""To be honest nobody knows what's going to happen."" 
For January-March, IAG said it expected to fly about 20% of 2019's capacity, compared to the whole of 2020 when it flew at 34% of capacity.
IAG's focus for now is on cutting costs to reduce cash burn. Weekly cash burn fell to 185 million euros in the first quarter, down 30 million from the previous quarter.
Last October, IAG secured shareholder backing for a 2.74 billion euro capital hike and Goodbody analysts said it might have to call on investors again.
""With further losses expected this year ... another rights issue can't be ruled out in the medium term,"" they said. 
IAG's operating loss before exceptional items, its preferred measure, came in at 4.37 billion euros, slightly better than analysts' consensus forecast for a 4.45 billion loss.

No Australian airlines operate the 737 MAX, but Virgin Australia has 25 of the planes on order. Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd and Fiji Airways operated them on flights to Australia. 
The Boeing 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 after two deadly crashes. Crawford said it was unclear when those airlines would resume flights to Australia given the disruption by COVID-19 to international air travel. 
Singapore Airlines and Fiji Airways will also need approval to resume flying the 737 MAX from their national aviation regulators and from other authorities where they need to use airspace. 
Singapore's aviation regulator did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Singapore Airlines said it would continue to work with and be guided by regulators on 737 MAX operations. 
A Fiji Airways spokesman said it was still working with other regulators in the region, including those in Fiji and New Zealand, before returning the 737 MAX to service.
New Zealand's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it had worked closely with counterparts in Australia and Singapore on the return of the 737 MAX in New Zealand.
""The CAA will not issue a blanket approval for the Boeing 737 MAX to fly into New Zealand but will work with any future operators on a case-by-case basis to clear flight operations into New Zealand,"" the CAA said, noting Fiji Airways was still restricting international flights due to COVID-19.
Regulators in the United States, Europe, Britain, Canada, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates are among those that have already approved the 737 MAX's return to flight following technical modifications and additional pilot training.
Japan lifted its restrictions at the end of January following decisions by counterparts in the United States, Europe, Canada and Brazil, an official at Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau said on Friday.
Japan has no local operators of the 737 MAX and the decision was not announced publicly at the time.
China was the first country to ban the 737 MAX from its airspace in 2019 and it has not indicated when it will lift the ban.

Boeing said on Friday it was working with regulators and customers to return the 737 MAX to service safely worldwide.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Ant Group is in talks with other shareholders in its new consumer finance unit to bolster the firm's capital as the fintech giant prepares to fold in its lucrative micro-lending businesses, people familiar with the matter said. 
It would need additional capital of 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion) to meet regulatory requirements, said one of the people who has direct knowledge of the plans.
Ant plans to bring most of its micro-lending businesses into the unit - equivalent to roughly 1 trillion yuan ($155 billion) in outstanding loans - a move which will allow it to maintain operations nationwide and expand more easily, said two sources.
The plans reflect intense regulatory pressure on Ant to rein in some of its operations and subject them to rules and capital requirements similar to those for banks. That pressure scuppered Ant's $37 billion IPO last year and has seen it formulate plans to shift to a financial holding company structure.
Ant has two lucrative micro-lending businesses: Huabei, which operates like a virtual credit card, and Jiebei, a short-term consumer loan provider. Both based in the southwestern city of Chongqing, they form the bulk of its credit business which accounted for close to 40% of Ant's revenue in the first half of 2020.
But under new draft rules published by China's central bank in November, Huabei and Jiebei would have to limit their operations to Chongqing unless they obtain new national licences - a potentially lengthy and uncertain process.
That would not be a problem if the micro-lending businesses were part of the consumer finance arm. 
Another major benefit of shifting the businesses to the consumer finance unit is that consumer finance firms can lend up to 10 times their registered capital while online micro-loan firms are only allowed leverage ratios of 2-3 times.
The new consumer finance firm, called Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance Co Ltd, was set up in August 2020 but still has not gained its business licence, three sources said.
""Regulators won't easily greenlight the launch of the business before it fully complies with the capital adequacy rules,"" said one of the people.
The sources were not authorised to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.
Ant, an  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding affiliate, declined to comment. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Micro-lending - loans for small purchases such as smartphones, cameras and white goods - is hugely popular in China.
Ant and other tech platforms such as Tencent-backed WeBank and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc have become powerful third-party intermediaries who draw in borrowers, take as much as a third of lending profit margins while the banks they partner with passively supply the credit.
Ant owns 50% of the consumer finance unit, which it plans to develop into China's biggest consumer lending player.
Hong Kong-based Nanyang Commercial Bank holds a 15% stake while Taiwan's Cathay United Bank holds 10%. Other co-founders include battery maker CATL and Alibaba-backed intelligent transport services firm China TransInfo Technology.
If the other shareholders are reluctant to provide additional capital, Ant plans to bring new investors, two of the people said.
Several shareholders want more clarity on the consumer finance unit's listing prospects, they added. 
Shareholders are also hoping their stakes in the unit will be converted into shares in Ant's financial holding company, which is likely to go public, the people said. 
Most of the other shareholders did not respond to requests for comment. CATL referred queries to Ant.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Friday, continuing the global selloff after a sharp rise in bond yields weighed on sentiment.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.3%.
Losses in Europe have been led by resource and technology stocks, amid concerns that lofty valuations will be placed under extreme pressure if funding conditions tighten significantly.
Miner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) stock dropped 1.1% and oil major BP (NYSE:BP) dropped 1.8%, while tech stocks ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) and  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) all fell more than 1%
In corporate news, IAG (LON:ICAG) stock rose 2.6% after the owner of British Airways pointed to U.K. plans for travel markets to possibly reopen from mid-May as a positive sign, even as it posted a loss of 4.37 billion euros ($5.31 billion) for 2020.
Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) stock rose 0.1%, outperforming the wider market, after the German telecommunications giant reported a sharp rise in net profit and soaring revenue in its fourth quarter. 
BASF (DE:BASFN), one of the world's largest chemicals companies, also reported better-than-expected figures and sounded an optimistic note about the outlook this year for its biggest customer, the auto industry. Its stock still fell 0.9%.
The global weakness started on Wall Street overnight, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered its worst day in nearly four months, dropping 3.5%. This selloff continued in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei ending almost 4% lower and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropping over 3%.
Overnight, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly crossed the 1.6% level to trade at its highest level in more than a year. Higher long-term rates raise the opportunity cost of holding assets that are only expected to generate free cash flow in the future.
German January import prices surprised on the upside earlier Friday, but both French consumer prices and fourth-quarter GDP came in below expectations. The European Central Bank has said it expects to look through any short-term increase in CPI, given the underlying problems still facing the Eurozone economy.
Oil prices fell sharply Friday, as rising U.S. Treasury yields supported the greenback, making U.S.-dollar priced oil more expensive.
Despite this drop, both Brent and WTI are up strongly this week, with gains of around 3.8% and 5.9%, respectively, up about 20% this month.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is due to meet next week. Concerns are growing that this rise in prices will tempt the producers to add supply to the market.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $62.86 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $65.38. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,764.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2149.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 03:36AM ET</span>",Left out? Israeli vaccine refuseniks fear exclusion as economy reopens,"By Rami Ayyub and Steven Scheer
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel has led the world in COVID-19 vaccinations. Now it faces another challenge that other countries will have to grapple with: how to balance public health and the rights of the unvaccinated.
Its decisions will affect every walk of life - from schools to work, and culture to worship.
Half of Israelis have received their first shot, and the country began reopening its economy this week after a year of lockdowns and remote working.
But several activities have been deemed off-limits to the unvaccinated, angering those who cannot get the jab for health reasons, or refuse it as a matter of principle.
Some employers already plan to ban unvaccinated workers from the office, which rights groups fear could cost them their jobs. Unions have suggested workarounds, such as COVID-19 tests every 72 hours.
""I'm already at peace with the fact that I won't be invited to certain events or allowed into areas of entertainment,"" said Hila Bar, a business owner who is sceptical of medical science and does not plan to get vaccinated.
""So I won't go,"" she said. ""And I won't patronise certain businesses either - not because I don't want to, but they do not want my business.""
Israel, where the vaccine rollout is fast but not mandatory, is a world leader in inoculations. Other countries are likely to scrutinise its early experience to see how it addresses mostly unanswered questions about balancing individual rights with obligations to public health.
""Whoever does not get vaccinated will be left behind,"" Health Minister Yuli Edelstein warned in recent weeks.
Edelstein has made clear that newly introduced perks for the vaccinated - including access to theatres, gyms, and resort areas along the Dead Sea - are incentives to get inoculated.
But some advocates and employers are concerned that parliament has not passed any new laws regulating workers' return to offices or offering protections for the unvaccinated, saying it will force employers to devise their own rules.
Early discussions around guidelines and legislation point to employers, authorities and courts putting public health concerns before individuals' demands.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Mobileye (F:0ME) unit, in Jerusalem, says unvaccinated workers will not be allowed to come to the office as of April 4, but can work from home if their assignment allows.
The company estimates around 10% of its 1,500 employees will not get vaccinated. If they must come to the office, they will need to provide a negative PCR test taken within the prior 48 hours.
""It is our responsibility to make our offices a safe place – the greater good of our employees and their families trumps any other consideration,"" Chief Executive Amnon Shashua wrote to employees in an email seen by Reuters.
CIVIL RIGHTS
A landmark study released on Wednesday showed the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine being used in Israel cut symptomatic cases among Israeli recipients by 94%.
But some officials privately estimate that 10% of Israelis over 16 - around 650,000 people - do not intend to get vaccinated.
Even asking employees to share their vaccine status could violate medical privacy rights, some advocates say, with potential ramifications for civil liberties that may eventually be challenged in Israeli courts.
""The question is how do we reopen the market, the economy, and life, without harming people that cannot or would not get vaccinated,"" said Sharon Abraham-Weiss, executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI).
""It's the vulnerable people, those that are not unionised, or temp (workers) or others who would bear the burden,"" she said, while calling for legislation.
Business leaders have also called for new laws. The health ministry did not comment when asked if legislation offering job protection to the unvaccinated was being drawn up.
Some large trade groups have begun drafting policy guidelines for members, including the Manufacturers Association of Israel, which represents 1,800 companies employing almost half a million workers. 
The group's members are ""not chasing people in the street to stick some syringes in their shoulders and force them to vaccinate,"" though they are doing everything they can to encourage it, the group's president, Ron Tomer, said.
But according to a legal opinion commissioned by the group and reviewed by Reuters, members may ask employees if they were vaccinated as a ""safety measure"" to prevent infecting others rather than as a request for personal medical information.
Employers should take reasonable steps to allow unvaccinated staff to work from home or in separate bubbles, but those who cannot do so can be sent on unpaid leave, or, as a last resort, fired, the opinion says.
""If you don't want to take the injection, it's OK ... the employee (has a right) to protect his privacy. But on the other side there are rights of the public, the employers, the clients - the people that we give services (to),"" the opinion's author, prominent employment attorney Nachum Feinberg, told Reuters. 
Offering a potential workaround, Israel's largest labour union, Histadrut, suggested that unvaccinated workers who cannot work at home present negative coronavirus tests to their employers every 72 hours.
'MATTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH'
Israel on Sunday launched a ""Green Pass"" system granting certain privileges to citizens who have had both doses of the vaccine or have recovered from COVID-19. 
In one of its first real-life applications, only those carrying a government-validated certificate were allowed to attend a small open-air concert in Tel Aviv this week.
And parliament on Wednesday passed a law allowing the health ministry to give municipalities the names of residents who have not had a shot.
ACRI has opposed the legislation, arguing it violates privacy rights.
The law faculty at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem argued in a position paper that regulating vaccination ""is a matter of public health, and not a private medical issue"". 
Existing Israeli laws grant the health ministry the legal authority to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated, and even to obligate vaccination in certain cases, the position paper says.

""Those who fulfil their obligation to vaccinate should not be asked to bear the cost of others choosing not to,"" said David Enoch, a professor in the philosophy of law at Hebrew University.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",Airbus reports emissions data amid climate pressure,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus on Friday joined a growing list of companies outlining the environmental impact of their products, as aviation aims to reshape itself after the coronavirus crisis.
Major companies are under increasing pressure from investors and climate change activists to report the emissions that result when customers use their products, known as ""Scope 3"".
Airbus says it is the first planemaker to do so.
It says it is driving aerospace toward zero-emission flying with plans for a commercial aircraft powered by hydrogen by 2035, which it reaffirmed on Friday.
But environmentalist groups say that flying itself needs to be curbed to have a meaningful impact on climate change.
Airbus estimated lifetime emissions for jets built in two dramatically different years: 2019, which saw record deliveries on the back of an order boom, and 2020, when the pandemic sent aviation into crisis and forced Airbus to slash output by 40%.
For the 863 jets it delivered in 2019, Airbus estimated lifetime emissions of 740 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent based on an average aircraft lifespan of 22 years. That includes 130 million tonnes related to the production of fuel burned in flight.
In 2020, it delivered 566 aircraft with estimated lifetime emissions of 440 million tonnes, including 80 million for fuel.
Airbus also published carbon intensity data suggesting an ""average efficiency"" of 66.6 grammes of CO2e per passenger-kilometre in 2019, improving to 63.5g in 2020.
A senior Airbus official said the data included conservative assumptions for synthetic fuels, whose use is expected to grow.
Intensity-based targets measure greenhouse emissions relative to industrial output, meaning absolute emissions can rise even if the headline intensity figure falls.
'DRASTIC ACTION'
Aviation produces 2.5% of human-induced CO2 emissions and 12% of CO2 from transport, the industry says. It has pledged to reduce net carbon emissions to 50% of 2005 levels by 2050.
""The scale of the emissions disclosed underlines the need for governments to take drastic action to rein in the climate impact of flying,"" said Andrew Murphy, aviation director for Brussels-based environmentalist group Transport & Environment.
Airbus did not provide data for non-CO2 emissions, which some scientists deem at least as much of a threat as CO2. But it said it was working on initiatives that have been promoted to help address this, including improved air traffic management.
Airbus also reported emissions from its factories, giving a glimpse of a multinational network linked by boats, trucks, barges and huge cargo planes.
Its own CO2 emissions decreased by about 20% last year amid the pandemic, and Airbus purchased 21% less water in Europe. It also produced 25% less waste and potentially damaging vapours.
Airbus aims to consume 20% less energy and emit 40% less CO2 from its more than 70 sites by 2030, compared with 2015.

French jet engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) on Thursday issued some Scope 3 emissions for business air travel and waste, and pledged to expand this to the use of its engines later in 2021.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. contributed the most to losses in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which dropped as much as 3.2%. A gauge of the region’s technology stocks tumbled more than 4%, also the most since March.
Friday’s selloff marks a sharp turnaround for equities which rallied for the most of January and February, pushing the Asian benchmark to a fresh record high. Equity benchmarks in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan slumped more than 3% each this Friday.
“This rise in risk-free rates serves as a trigger to investors who have been looking for a reason for an equity market correction,” said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “The Asian tech sector and outperformers of the past 12 months may also mirror the sharper correction of their US counterparts.”
The slump called to mind the painful episode for the region between May and June 2013 when the U.S. Federal Reserve suggested it would start slowly tapering its quantitative easing program and rattled global stocks. Asian shares were especially hard hit then, plunging 13% from a high hit in May, versus a 6% peak-to-trough decline in the S&P 500.
On the positive side, central banks in Asia’s emerging economies added $467.7 billion to their foreign-exchange reserves last year, the most since the 2013 temper tantrum. That provides Asia with an important buffer against a recent jump in global bond yields.
Bloomberg JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asia Dollar Index, a trade and liquidity weighted index of Asian currencies, has gained more than 8% from a March low.
“An analogy to the taper tantrum in 2013 and its impact on Asian markets versus the U.S. is misplaced,” said Thomas Poullaouec, head of multi-asset solutions at T. Rowe Price. “In 2013, Asian markets as well as emerging markets in general were a primary target of the rising yields given their vulnerability in their financing needs.”
Poullaouec said that Asian countries are no longer as fragile as they were perceived in 2013, adding that the stocks that will be hit by higher yields will be those “in the most expensive part of the market” including growth names.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 02:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China's Huawei, reeling from U.S. sanctions, plans foray into EVs - sources","By Julie Zhu and Yilei Sun
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Huawei plans to make electric vehicles under its own brand and could launch some models this year, four sources said, as the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, battered by U.S. sanctions, explores a strategic shift.
Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is in talks with state-owned Changan Automobile and other automakers to use their car plants to make its electric vehicles (EVs), according to two of the people familiar with the matter.
Huawei is also in discussions with Beijing-backed BAIC Group's BluePark New Energy Technology to manufacture its EVs, said one of the two and a separate person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The plan heralds a potentially major shift in direction for Huawei after nearly two-years of U.S. sanctions that have cut its access to key supply chains, forcing it to sell a part of its smartphone business to keep the brand alive.
Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist by the Trump administration over national security concerns. Many industry executives see little chance that blocks on the sale of billions of dollars of U.S. technology and chips to the Chinese company, which has denied wrongdoing, will be reversed by his successor.
A Huawei spokesman denied the company plans to design EVs or produce Huawei branded vehicles.
""Huawei is not a car manufacturer. However through ICT (information and communications technology), we aim to be a digital car-oriented and new-added components provider, enabling car OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to build better vehicles.""
Huawei has started internally designing the EVs and approaching suppliers at home, with the aim of officially launching the project as early as this year, three of the sources said.
Richard Yu, head of Huawei's consumer business group who led the company to become one of the world's largest smartphone makers, will shift his focus to EVs, said one source. The EVs will target a mass-market segment, another source said.
All the sources declined to be named as the discussions are private.
Chongqing-based Changan, which is making cars with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, declined to comment. BAIC BluePark did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Shares of Changan's main listed company Chongqing Changan Automobile rose 8% after Reuters reported the discussions. BluePark's shares jumped by their maximum 10% daily limit. 
GROWING EV MARKET 
Chinese technology firms have been stepping up their focus on EVs in the world's biggest market for such vehicles, as Beijing heavily promotes greener vehicles as a means of reducing chronic air pollution.
Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), including pure battery electric vehicles as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, are expected to make up 20% of China's overall annual auto sales by 2025. 
Industry forecasts put China's NEV sales at 1.8 million units this year, up from about 1.3 million in 2020.
Huawei's ambitious plans to make its own cars will see it join a raft of Asian tech companies that have made similar announcements in recent months, including Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Foxconn.
""The novel and complicated U.S. restrictions on semiconductors to Huawei have slowly been strangling the company,"" said Dan Wang, a technology analyst with research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.
""So it makes sense that the company is pivoting to less chip-intensive industries in order to maintain operations."" 
In the United States, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc are also developing auto-related technology or investing in smart-car startups.
Huawei has been developing a swathe of technologies for EVs for years including in-car software systems, sensors for automobiles and 5G communications hardware.
The company has also formed partnerships with automakers such as  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and SAIC Motor to jointly develop smart auto technologies.
It has accelerated hiring of engineers for auto-related technologies since 2018.
Huawei was awarded at least four patents related to EVs this week, including methods for charging between electric vehicles and for checking battery health, according to official Chinese patent records.

Huawei's push into the EV market is currently separate from a joint smart vehicle company it co-founded along with Changan and EV battery maker CATL in November, two of the sources said.

123,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 02:09AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Sharply Lower; Rising Yields Weigh,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening firmly lower Friday, continuing the global selloff after a sharp rise in bond yields weighed on sentiment.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.4%.
The global weakness started on Wall Street overnight, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered its worst day in nearly four months. The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.5%, as a sharp spike in U.S. government bond yields on inflation fears sounded a warning for riskier assets that have benefited from the Covid-induced ultra-easy monetary policies.
This selloff continued in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei ending almost 4% lower and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropping over 3%, and is set to push into Europe as the week draws to an end.
Overnight, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly crossed the 1.6% level to trade at its highest level in more than a year. This is hitting investor appetite for the more richly valued areas of equity markets, and growth stocks in particular. Higher long-term rates raise the opportunity cost of holding assets that are only expected to generate free cash flow in the future.
Turning to the European corporate sector, Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) is likely to be in the spotlight after the German telecommunications giant reported a sharp rise in net profit and soaring revenue in its fourth quarter. BASF, one of the world's largest chemicals companies, also reported better-than-expected figures and sounded an optimistic note about the outlook this year for its biggest customer, the auto industry.
Elsewhere, Spanish infrastructure company Ferrovial (MC:FER) announced a 25 million euro share buyback.
German January import prices surprised on the upside earlier Friday, and the focus will turn to French and Spanish consumer prices later in the session.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 01:16AM ET</span>",Banks weigh up home working - the new normal or an aberration?,"By Lawrence White, Iain Withers and Muvija M
LONDON (Reuters) - As the finance industry prepares for life post-pandemic, commercial banks are moving quickly to harness working from home to cut costs, while investment banks are keen to get traders and advisers back to the office.
HSBC and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) are getting rid of as much as 40% of their office space as an easy way to make savings when bank profits have been crunched by the pandemic.
But there are concerns that remote working does not benefit everyone. Junior staff miss out on socialising and learning opportunities and there are also risks home working can entrench gender inequality.
At investment banks, where long hours in the office were the norm pre-pandemic, bosses say they want most people back where they can see them. 
HSBC plans to almost halve office space globally, as it aims to squeeze more use out of the remaining space and increase the number of staff per desk from just over one to closer to two.
Britain's biggest domestic lender Lloyds plans to shrink its office space by a fifth within three years. Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) will cut a third of its space within four years, while Metro Bank said it would cut some 40% and make more use of branches.
""We've had a period where flexible working has been tested in full, with about three quarters of people not based in offices as we used to call them, and the business has performed remarkably well,"" Andy Halford, Standard Chartered CFO, said.
But major investment banks take a different view, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive David Solomon pouring cold water on the potential of remote working.
""It's not a new normal. It's an aberration that we're going to correct as soon as possible,"" he told a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) conference on Wednesday. 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) CEO Jes Staley, who last year said he thought the days of 7,000 employees trudging into its Canary Wharf headquarters were numbered, is also unwilling to commit for now to large office closures.
The Barclays boss has said the bank had ""no plan"" to make a major real estate move as Britain's prolonged third lockdown had shown the strains of working from home.
Nick Fahy, CEO of online lender Cynergy Bank, said working over screens often could not compete. ""You might have a disagreement on this, that or the other but actually over the coffee machine or over a glass of wine or a bit of lunch, issues can be resolved."" 
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
Some banks have acted quickly because they are used to flexing workforces in line with economic cycles, particularly in investment banks, Oliver Wyman principal Jessica Marlborough said.
But some are waiting on analysis of staff productivity changes before making final decisions, while others were mindful junior staff may still prefer going into offices, she said.
Banks are also concerned women may lose out from the shift to remote working. 
""We thought the pandemic would be a big leveller for women. But actually what we're starting to see is it's extremely challenging to get women to move jobs in a pandemic,"" Marlborough said.
""Banks were making progress in hiring a more balanced workforce in terms of gender and other metrics, but they're actually struggling now (as banks are finding) they (women) are less likely to seek out a new job."" 
Union leaders said part of the reason was that some women are juggling more childcare responsibilities during the pandemic.
Dominic Hook, national officer for UK union Unite, said banks must ensure working from home is voluntary, use of surveillance tools is limited, and employers respect staff hours so work does not spill into evenings and weekends.
""Our concern is that it won't actually be a choice and that banks will pressure staff to work from home,"" Hook said.
There are also concerns hybrid working will favour employees who visit the office more regularly, as they can spend more time in person with colleagues and managers, said Richard Benson, managing director at Accenture (NYSE:ACN) Interactive.
The staff most likely to go back to the office are traders, bank executives said, while back-office functions such as finance, risk management and IT will spend more time working remotely. 
In Germany,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it had been challenging to adapt home office spaces for traders and expected many will want to return, but not all. 
""We will pay more attention to the personal circumstances at home. Dealers also have children or parents in need of care. We have become more sensitive,"" said Kristian Snellman, Deutsche Bank's head of investment banking transformation for Germany and EMEA.
The trend to shed offices predated the pandemic as many banks made cuts after the 2007-09 financial crisis. Some have already made moves as a result of the pandemic, such as NatWest, which shut its tech hub in north London last summer. 
Retained offices are being remodelled, with desks removed to make way for collaboration and break space such as coffee areas, gardens and libraries, property consultancy Arcadis said.
""It's not just about adding a ping pong table and table football and hoping it will work, it's about making sure people get downtime,"" said Sarah-Jane Osborne, head of workscape at Arcadis. 
David Duffy, CEO of Virgin Money (LON:VM), said the bank is among those planning to strip out office cubicles.

""The world of large-scale populations returning to a tall skyscraper building to come in and do their e-mail in the office doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 12:20AM ET</span>","Analysis: Investors jumping the gun as TIPS, futures flag early Fed tightening","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors may be getting ahead of themselves as they price in a move by the Federal Reserve to pivot away from an ultra-easy monetary policy sooner than most expected just weeks ago.
Two key market indicators - rising yields on U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and eurodollar futures - are suggesting a tightening of Fed policy is looming on expectations of a strong economic recovery in the second half as COVID-19 vaccine rollouts gather pace.
But those expectations may prove premature if U.S. jobless numbers remain stubbornly high and the Fed's patience after the 2008 global financial crisis is anything to go by.
Yields on TIPS have climbed across the curve so far this year, from five-year to 30-year debt. U.S 30-year TIPS yield, for one, turned positive last week and on Thursday hit 0.214%, its highest since March last year. Since early January, that yield has increased by more than 60 basis points.
U.S. 10-year TIPS yield has risen more than 40 basis points since the beginning of the year. On Thursday, it touched -0.844%, the highest since July 2020.
Typically purchased when investors believe higher inflation is on the horizon, TIPS prices rose during the pandemic. Their yields are ""real,"" i.e., the relevant Treasury bond interest rate, minus inflation, and went negative for all maturities.
The so-called TIPS breakeven inflation rates are a gauge of investor inflation expectations. Those are the calculated difference between the TIPS yield and the nominal Treasury yield and have also been rising.
The 5-year TIPS at 2.38% is higher than the 10- or 30-year, suggesting the market thinks any rise in inflation would be of short duration. All are slightly above the Fed's 2% target for average inflation over time and well above the 1.4% that inflation is currently running.
""The higher TIPS yield is suggesting that the market has become a bit nervous about a faster pace of economic recovery and, hence a faster exit by the Federal Reserve from monetary accommodation,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities in New York.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, however, said on Tuesday it was nowhere near tightening U.S. monetary policy or scaling back its massive securities buying program to support the market.
Interest rates will remain low and the Fed's $120 billion in monthly bond purchases will continue ""at least at the current pace until we make substantial further progress towards our goals ... which we have not really been making,"" Powell said in a testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee.
Analysts said, however, the situation could be a lot different in the second half of the year when the vaccine distribution becomes more widespread and the fiscal stimulus package creates jobs and fuels more consumer spending.
The beginning of tightening cycles tends to move slowly and markets typically make bets ahead of the Fed, said Rob Robis, chief global fixed income strategist at BCA Research in New York.
""You may start hearing conversations about tapering asset purchases in the second half of the year especially when the vaccine rollout goes well and the economy shows 4%-5% growth numbers,"" Robis said. ""There are a lot of things out there that can make the Fed nervous about its current policy setting.""
EURODOLLAR FUTURES BETTING ON EARLY RATE HIKE
Eurodollar futures, which track short-term U.S. interest rate expectations over the next few years, are pricing in a U.S. rate hike by March 2023. This pricing has been pulled forward from late-2023 in the past few weeks, and going back to last August, as late as mid-2024.
Other rate sentiment barometers such as fed funds futures do not suggest just yet a shift toward tightening in 2023.
That said, just because the futures market has been suggesting a hike in 2023 and some analysts are betting on a move away from an easy monetary policy sooner rather than later, doesn't mean it will happen.
The Fed was on hold for seven years after the global financial crisis in 2008. Throughout that period, market participants had predicted a rate increase within the next 12-18 months, yet the Fed only resumed hiking rates in 2015.
""I don't believe the Fed will take any action to remove the punchbowl in 2021,"" said Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners. ""I believe they will remain exceptionally accommodative until the 10 million unemployed workers are back on the payroll.""
Padhraic Garvey, global head of debt and rates strategy, at ING believes though that the current recession feels different and overall there are clear risks the Fed could taper its asset purchases by the end of the year even though the U.S. central bank repeatedly said it's not doing so.
The general market consensus was for the Fed to start reducing asset purchases in 2023.
Garvey noted the Fed could taper in a ""soft"" fashion much as the Bank of Canada did, moving purchases out the curve, consequently containing long-end rates.

""Without stepping into the whole pandemic vaccine health arena, we are optimistic that there would be a boom in the economy,"" said Garvey.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 12:10AM ET</span>",Analysis: Hyundai bought chips when rivals didn't; its assembly lines are still rolling,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor has so far avoided a chip shortage that has plagued global automakers, largely maintaining its stockpile of chips last year and even accelerating purchases towards the end, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
The shortage has forced production cuts worldwide, including at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), prompting Germany and the United States to ramp up efforts to resolve the shortage.
Other than Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), which said this month it had enough chip inventory to last it about four months, Hyundai and its sister firm Kia Corp are the only global automakers to have maintained a stockpile of low-tech chips that helped them keep up production.
If it doesn't ease soon, though, the shortage could hit Hyundai too, as tight capacity on factory floors starts pressuring production of even high-tech auto chips, said two of the people, who are familiar with the company's purchases.
The South Korean automaker kept buying chips even as rivals cut orders to reflect diminished demand because of the pandemic.
Analysts said past events that roiled Hyundai's supply chain and forced it to halt production have shaped this more conservative take on inventory, a departure from automakers' typical just-in-time approach.
""Like other automakers, Hyundai also planned to cut production at the beginning of the year because of COVID-19,"" said one of the people with direct knowledge of Hyundai's purchases.
""But procurement read the trend of the semiconductor industry cutting auto chips production and said, 'if we don't buy them as well, we'll be in trouble later on,'"" said the person, referring to a rush of buying by gadget makers that sucked up most chipmaking capacity.
Chipmakers who supply auto companies outsource most of their production to contract manufacturers like Taiwan's TSMC, which analysts say often prioritise orders from electronics clients who account for nearly all their revenue.
Hyundai still bought fewer chips in 2020 than it did in 2019, said one of the sources with direct knowledge of auto chip production. But it sharply increased buying in the quarter that ended in December, the person said.
The people declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to media.
The fact that Hyundai's domestic market was relatively solid through the pandemic most likely influenced the company's plans, analysts said, as did its experiences with China and Japan.
Hyundai took lessons from a diplomatic spat with Japan in 2019 that affected supplies https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-japan-laborers-chip-analys-idUSKCN1UR3LZ of chemicals at South Korean chipmakers, and in early 2020, when the coronavirus was spreading in China, production was halted in Hyundai and Kia's plants because of shortages of a part from China. 
A spokeswoman told Reuters Hyundai was collaborating with its suppliers to maintain stable production.
RISING CONCERN
Since Hyundai kept buying from chipmakers and global auto parts suppliers such as Bosch and Continental before the shortage worsened, they also managed to keep costs down.
""This has allowed Hyundai to first, secure auto chips, and second, buy them when they were cheaper,"" said Kim Jin-woo, analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. 
Hyundai also has more local suppliers than rivals.
These suppliers - including Telechips, which contracts fabrication out to Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) - are likely to prioritise Hyundai, from whom they get much of their revenue, analysts said.
One person with direct knowledge of Hyundai's purchasing decisions said the company has diversified suppliers for at least one chip since late last year. 
In a statement on Thursday, Hyundai said it plans to halt operations at one South Korean factory for five days in March to adjust inventories of some models.
A union official told Reuters the company was trying to save chips by adjusting production of its weaker-selling Sonata model. Sonata in South Korea sold 67,440 units last year versus 145,463 units of Hyundai's most popular sedan Grandeur. 
According to an internal document seen by Reuters, Hyundai expects the shortage to ease in the third quarter, and Kia said last month that since October it had been reviewing its supply chain to prevent production disruption. 
""We would not say we are prepared for the next three to six months, but we could tell you that we are not seeing any immediate production disruption,"" Kia said on an earnings call last month. 
Still, there is rising concern at Hyundai, two of the three people said. The company is checking inventory more frequently and trying to lock down supply contracts earlier, one of them said.
The union official said Hyundai had told the union this week that Hyundai ""had secured a lot of chips"" but that the situation was becoming ""a bit difficult"".

""Clients are trying to pull all they can, while suppliers are being strategic about which order they meet,"" said the source with direct knowledge of auto chip production. ""It's going to get worse before it gets better.""

128,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 10:23PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Down, Bond Selloff Enters “More Lethal Phase”","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Friday morning, with global bonds starting to stabilize from an aggressive selloff that drove steep losses in U.S. shares.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 2.29% by 10:11 PM ET (3:11 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI slumped 2.67%. In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 1.88%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.18%. The city expects its first batch of the  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)/ BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.62% while the Shenzhen Component was down 1.31%.
The selloff saw Benchmark Treasury yields plunge back below 1.5% as the Asian session opened on Friday, after the ten-year Treasury yield rose as much as 23 basis points to 1.6% overnight. The surge gathered pace as holders of mortgage securities being forced to offload government bonds.
The ten-year U.S. yield adjusted for inflation climbed to its highest level since June 2020 and sounded a warning for riskier assets that benefitted from the ultra-easy monetary policy brought on by COVID-19.
“The fixed income rout is shifting into a more lethal phase for risky assets … the rise in yields has long been mostly seen as a story of improving growth expectations, if anything padding risky assets, but the overnight move notably included a steep lift in real rates and a bringing forward of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s lift-off expectations,” Westpac head of rates strategy Damien McColough told Reuters.
As hopes for a global economic recovery from COVID-19 continue to grow, investors are shifting from COVID-19 era winners to those poised to benefit from an end to lockdowns. However, crowd-pleaser  GameStop Corp .  (NYSE:GME) saw its shares double at one point during the previous session before ending 19% higher.
Investors continue to bet on that recovery, but some are increasingly worried that rising inflation could see central banks withdraw their monetary policy support. The worries continued even as the Fed stressed that there are no plans to tighten policy prematurely and that the rise in Treasury yields reflect optimism.
“It’s all about interest rates … tech has been a relative outperformer. As it led on the way up, it will likely lead on the way down too,” Schwab Center for Financial Research vice president of trading and derivatives Randy Frederick told Bloomberg.
Earlier in the week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reassured investors that the central bank would continue its ultra-easy monetary policy and would overlook the short-term rise in inflation in his testimonies before Congress earlier in the week. However, the market has almost fully priced in a first-rate hike by the end of 2022."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in Kia Corp rose as much as 8.1% on Friday after a South Korean online news site said there was still potential for the automaker to form a partnership with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Shares in Hyundai Motor Co and its affiliate Kia were roiled earlier this year after Hyundai initially confirmed early stage talks with the tech-giant on autonomous electric cars, but later said they were no longer in talks.
Online site Chosun Biz said on Friday that Apple and Kia had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) last year and had agreed to pursue cooperation in eight sectors, including electric vehicles. It said negotiations on electric vehicles had not been completely cancelled. 
""Even if the negotiations on electric vehicles fail, there are many items that can be negotiated in other fields, so we are still optimistic about the possibility of partnership between the two sides,"" Chosun cited an unnamed source familiar with negotiations between Hyundai and Apple as saying.
Aside from electric vehicles, Kia and Apple are also discussing cooperation in ""last mile"" mobility, or transport to complete a final short distance to a destination after using another means of transportation, Chosun said. 
A Hyundai Motor Group spokesperson and Apple had no immediate comment. 
Analysts said the wording of Hyundai's statement earlier this month, that it was not in discussions with Apple about developing ""autonomous vehicles"", had left open possibilities of cooperation in other fields. 
""The media report on Kia-Apple cooperation does not negate Hyundai's statement earlier this month, since the statement was limited to a certain item,"" said Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities. 
""The 'last mile' mobility mentioned in the article is similar to Kia's plan to strengthen its purpose-built vehicle business, which Kia said during its investor day event earlier this month,"" he added. 

The rise in Kia shares was in sharp contrast to the wider market's 2.6% drop as of 0221 GMT. Kia was among only about 90 gainers, versus nearly 800 losers, on the KOSPI.

Shares of Tesla fell 8% during the day after Bloomberg reported that production of Tesla's less expensive sedan, the Model 3, had been temporarily suspended, raising questions about whether it had enough supplies to keep the assembly line moving.
Several automakers, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, are hit by the shortage of chips, forcing them to scale down production.
""Fremont shut down for two days (parts shortages) & restarted yesterday,"" Musk said in a Twitter posting.
A person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters that at least some workers had been told they could take off Wednesday and Thursday, while another person said some employee parking lots appeared to have fewer people than usual on Thursday.
Electric vehicle news source Electrek quoted Musk as telling employees that production of Model 3 and the Model Y small SUV would speed up to full production over the next few days.
""We are experiencing some parts supply issues, so we took the opportunity to bring Fremont down for a few days to do equipment upgrades and maintenance,"" Musk said in an employee email, according to Electrek.
Musk also said that the company was scaling up production of its more expensive Model S and Model X lines, which would soon go back to two shifts, he said, according to Electrek.
The company could not be immediately reached for comment.
Tesla said last month that it might face a temporary impact from a global semiconductor shortage and logistics disruptions at ports.
""This is an industrywide problem rather than anything Tesla-specific. But this episode provides a very useful reminder that EV manufacturing is subject to periodic supply chain bottlenecks, whether related to chips, or batteries, or other components,"" Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said by email.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), which supplies chips that control self-driving capabilities to Tesla, last week said it had suspended its factory in Austin, Texas as a winter storm caused power outages. The Tesla chips are made in the Texas factory, the automaker said two years ago.
Samsung (KS:005930) declined to identify its customers for the factory. 
It was unclear how much volume or revenue Tesla would lose due to the production halt. The Fremont plant has an annual production capacity of 500,000 Model 3s and Model Ys combined.

Tesla last week reduced the price of its cheaper variants of the Model 3 and the Model Y, the latest in a series of price cuts at a time when legacy automakers are trying to fight back with new models.

The two companies will initially focus on the development of hydrogen retail infrastructure in Japan, both for passenger vehicles and new commercial vehicles such as trucks and busses, it said in a statement.
The objective is to expand retail infrastructure and develop competitive hydrogen supply offer for passenger and commercial end-users in collaboration with local authorities, allowing a rapid ramp-up of hydrogen mobility in Japan, it said.
The move comes after the Japanese government laid out the green growth strategy in December under which it aims to eliminate new gasoline-powered vehicles by the mid-2030s to help achieve Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's October pledge to eliminate carbon emission on a net basis by mid-century.
The government's ambitious goal included a plan to boost its annual hydrogen demand to 3 million tonnes by 2030 from about 2 million tonnes now, and 20 million tonnes by 2050. 

Hydrogen is mainly used in oil refining and to produce ammonia for fertilisers but future demand is expected to come from broader segments including transport, building and power generation.

(Reuters) - Wireless carrier AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) said on Thursday it will sell about a third of its stake in satellite TV unit DirecTV to buyout firm TPG Capital in a deal that values the business at $16.25 billion, well below the $68 billion it paid for the asset less than six years ago.
The newly created New DirecTV, which includes DirecTV, AT&T TV and U-verse video services has $6 billion in debt and will be jointly run by AT&T and TPG following the transaction. 
Over the years, the satellite TV unit has lost subscribers to popular online streaming options like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Video. 
The spinoff will help AT&T consolidate its balance sheet while it continues to invest in core areas including building out 5G, fiber and streaming service HBOMax.
""We certainly didn't expect this outcome when we closed the DirecTV transaction in 2015, but it's the right decision to move the business forward consistent with the current realities of the market and our strategy,"" AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey said on a call with analysts.
Since becoming CEO last July, Stankey has been reviewing the telecom conglomerate's assets as it tries to cut a debt pile of $147.5 billion. In December, it sold animation streaming service Crunchyroll to  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) in a $1.18 billion deal.
TPG emerged as the preferred bidder for the DirecTV asset in January, as Reuters exclusively reported. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021.
DirecTV has about 17 million subscribers and lost 617,000 subscribers in the latest quarter. TPG, which will own 30% of the asset, believes it can leverage its expertise to slow down the cord-cutting trend by investing in customer experience and providing premium video content. 
In the fourth quarter, AT&T wrote down its premium TV business, which includes DirecTV, by $15.5 billion.

(Reuters) -  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares rallied on Thursday, finishing with double-digit gains despite a sharp retreat from session highs and leading a surprise resurgence of so-called ""stonks"" championed online by passionate retail investors. 
GameStop shares, which doubled their value on Wednesday, hit $160 at Thursday's open before being halted after several minutes of trading and fell to around $129 before the second halt. The stock closed for the day at $108.73 for an 18.5% gain, after soaring almost 90% at the session peak. 
Other ""stonks"" or ""meme stocks"" popular on sites such as Reddit's WallStreetBets also saw their rallies fade. Headphone company Koss Corp closed up 16.8% gain after rocketing nearly 61% during the session. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) ended down nearly 9% after jumping more than 15% during the session. 
Analysts were puzzled by the rally that came even as the benchmark S&P dropped 2.4%. Some ruled out a short squeeze like the one in January that battered hedge funds that had bet against GameStop and were forced to cover short positions when individual investors using Robinhood and other trading apps pushed the video game retailer's shares as high as $483.
""The power of the “three R’s” (Robinhood, Retail, Reddit) are back in play,"" said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Mirabaud Securities. 
The number of GameStop shares shorted stood at 15.47 million, analytics firm S3 Partners said Thursday, with short interest accounting for 28.4% of the float, compared with a peak of 142% in early January. 
Wednesday's late day rally added $664 million in mark-to-market losses for investors betting against GameStop, and short sellers were down $10.75 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses midday Thursday, according to S3.
Some analysts said the rally may be partly fueled by a fear of betting against GameStop. 
“There are not a lot of people who are just sitting there, ‘oh yeah, let’s for fun, let’s just short GameStop and get my head ripped off.' The investors learn.,” said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading, on the Benzinga podcast.
Some investors may be jumping on the GameStop bandwagon hoping to reap gains similar to turbo-charged advances of January and then sell the stock, said David Starr, vice president of quantitative analysis at Simpler Trading.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>","Beyond Meat clinches coveted deals with McDonald's, Yum Brands","By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) said on Thursday it has signed multi-year supply deals with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp and Taco Bell owner  Yum! Brands Inc  (NYSE:YUM), underscoring consumers' appetite for vegetable-based alternatives and Beyond Meat's leading position.
But its shares lost early gains as the company reported sales and a loss that widely missed analyst expectations for the second quarter in a row.
The plant-based meat industry has developed a frenzied following in recent years, and companies like Beyond Meat and rival Impossible Foods are among top players competing aggressively for deals with major food chains. A deal with McDonald's, in particular, is highly coveted in the industry.
Beyond Meat said its three-year global deal with McDonald's would make it the world's biggest restaurant chain's ""preferred"" supplier for the patty in its new McPlant burger. The two companies will also develop other menu items like plant-based chicken, pork and eggs. Beyond Meat said it will also create a plant-based menu for Yum! Brands' KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell menus.
Given that both McDonald's and Yum! typically work with multiple suppliers, it is likely that Impossible Foods and other rivals still have a shot at working with the two fast-food chains.
""The use of the word 'preferred' there is intentional on the McDonald's side,"" Beyond Meat Chief Executive Ethan Brown said. 
The maker of the Beyond Burger also supplies Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN) and Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN). 
SLOW SALES GROWTH, HIGHER COSTS
Coronavirus lockdowns have hurt sales of Beyond Meat's burgers, meatballs and sausages over the past two quarters. The company said it expects the recovery in its restaurant business to lag that of the broader food service sector.
""We're starting to see a little bit of stabilization in food service,"" Chief Executive Ethan Brown said.
Beyond Meat reported an increase in net sales of 3.5% to $101.9 million in the period ended Dec. 31, missing analysts' forecast of $104.8 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The El Segundo, California-based company booked $3.7 million in COVID-19 expenses as it had to write off inventory associated with food service products that could not sell.
Beyond Meat's loss widened to $25.1 million, or 40 cents per share, from $452,000, or 1 cent per share. Excluding items, Beyond Meat's loss was 34 cents per share, handily missing analysts' estimate of 13 cents per share.

The company did not update its suspended outlook, saying the impact of COVID-19 made it difficult to forecast demand.

(Reuters) - Food delivery company DoorDash Inc expects fewer customer orders in the back half of the year as the vaccine rollouts embolden more people to venture out to restaurants and cafes, after nearly a year of staying indoors.
San Francisco-based DoorDash's shares fell 12% in extended trading after it also posted a bigger quarterly loss in its first results as a public company following its blockbuster initial public offering in December.
The company, which competes with Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) Inc and Postmates Inc, saw sales boom from consumers ordering food and grocery online as government-ordered restrictions and fear they would contract the coronavirus kept them at home.
DoorDash said the vaccine rollouts and consumers returning to stores would coincide with the seasonally softer second and third quarters.
""We're assuming that as the vaccine gets fully rolled out ... consumer behavior will start reverting back to peak COVID levels,"" Chief Financial Officer Prabir Adarkar told analysts.
The company forecast 2021 marketplace gross order value between $30 billion and $33 billion and in the range of $8.6 billion to $9.1 billion for the current quarter. In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, they rose 227% to $8.2 billion. 
First-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are expected to take a hit from recently imposed caps on fees it collects from restaurants and the passage of Proposition 22, a law that classifies its drivers or ""dashers"" as contractors. 
Fourth-quarter revenue rose more than three-fold to $970 million. But net loss widened to $312 million from $134 million a year earlier.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 05:30PM ET</span>","Municipal bond yields rise, swept up in Treasuries surge","By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Municipal bond yields were following U.S. Treasury yields higher after valuations between the two markets reached unsustainable levels, analysts said on Thursday. 
Earlier this year, the $3.9 trillion market where states, cities, schools and other issuers sell debt had been resisting a steep sell off in Treasuries that lifted yields, putting the historically close correlation between the two markets out of whack.
Now, munis are catching up, with the 10-year yield on Municipal Market Data's (MMD) benchmark triple-A scale, which started 2021 at 0.720%, climbing 45 basis points since Feb. 12. It closed up 5 basis points at 1.14% on Thursday. 
The iShares National Municipal Bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) fell on Thursday to its lowest level since November at 115.14. The largest muni ETF, which reached an 11-month high of 117.95 on Feb. 11, was last down 0.43% at 115.30. 
Flows into municipal bond funds plummeted to $37.68 million in the week ended Feb. 24 from net inflows of nearly $2 billion in the prior week, Lipper reported on Thursday.
""Munis were holding up extremely well to the rest of the bond market and the last week and a half we've seen a reversal in that,"" said Andrew Richman, senior fixed income strategist at Sterling Capital Management. ""The relative value finally got so bad (munis are) starting to move up in the yields right now.""
The ratio of top-rated 10-year, tax-exempt bonds to comparable taxable Treasury yields hit an all-time low of 54.7% on Feb. 16, according to Daniel Berger, senior market strategist at MMD Refinitiv, who said ratios that low were a key reason for the recent move higher in muni yields. The ratio was 76.2% on Thursday. 
""Munis got incredibly rich to Treasuries,"" Berger said, adding that ""a little more supply this week"" was another factor. 
Low supply of new debt in January amid high demand from investors heavy with cash from coupon and principal payments helped keep muni yields from following Treasuries higher. The prospect of an income tax hike and new stimulus funding for states and local governments under a Democrat-controlled White House and Congress also held yields in check. 
Improving economic data, inflation concerns, and fears of a supply surge to finance massive new fiscal stimulus, have sent the 10-year Treasury yield soaring from 0.930% on Jan. 4 to over 1.6% on Thursday. 

Muni yields are typically lower than those of comparable Treasuries because interest income earned on munis is exempt from federal and sometimes state taxation.

SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co will pay $6.6 million to U.S. regulators as part of a settlement over quality and safety-oversight lapses going back years, a setback that comes as Boeing wrestles with repairs to flawed 787 Dreamliner jets that could dwarf the cost of the federal penalty.
Boeing is beginning painstaking repairs and forensic inspections to fix structural integrity flaws embedded deep inside at least 88 parked 787s built over the last year or so, a third industry source said. 
The inspections and retrofits could take up to a month per plane and are likely to cost hundreds of millions - if not billions - of dollars, though it depends on the number of planes and defects involved, the person said.
Boeing shares extended losses in the final hour of trading, closing down 5.6%, after Reuters first reported the settlement with the Federal Aviation Administration over the planemaker's failure to comply with a 2015 safety agreement.
The penalties include $5.4 million for not complying with the agreement in which Boeing pledged to change its internal processes to improve and prioritize regulatory compliance and $1.21 million to settle two pending FAA enforcement cases.
""The FAA is holding Boeing accountable by imposing additional penalties,"" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement. 
Boeing paid $12 million in 2015 as part of the settlement.
The planemaker is strengthening processes and operations ""to ensure we hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards of safety and quality,"" a spokesman said by email, adding that settlement ""fairly resolves previously-announced civil penalty actions while accounting for ongoing safety, quality and compliance process improvements.""
Boeing engineers are working to determine the scope of inspections, including whether jets can be used as-is without a threat to safety, two people said. Boeing has not told airlines how many jets are impacted, another person said. 
The FAA has been investigating instances of oversight lapses, debris left inside finished aircraft, and managers putting pressure on employees handling safety checks for the FAA, people familiar with the proceedings said.
The FAA has also wrapped into a single investigation three separate 787 defects arising over the last year that have triggered the invasive inspections, the people said. 
Boeing told the FAA in August 2020 about the latest flaw, involving structural wrinkling in the interior fuselage skin where carbon-composite barrels that form the plane's lightweight body are melded together.
The defect went unnoticed for months or longer because computerized safeguards that crunch data looking for quality flaws had not been programmed to look for the gaps, a third industry source said. 
DELIVERY TARGET
The 787 production problems have halted deliveries of the jet since the end of October, locking up a source of desperately needed cash for Boeing.
The fuel-efficient 787 has been a huge success with airlines, which have ordered 1,882 of the advanced twin-aisle jet worth nearly $150 billion (74.7 billion pounds) at list prices. 
But the advanced production process and sprawling global supply chain caused problems over the years.
As of February, Boeing had fixed the 787 production process causing the wrinkling defect, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
However, planes rolled off the assembly line with the flaw for more than a year, at least, continuing even after the flaw was discovered in August 2020. 
""It's difficult to see a definitive fix that is agreeable by the aviation authorities and all going forward,"" Boeing customer Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp's CEO John Plueger told analysts on an earnings call Feb 22. ""I don't think that we're there yet.""
Boeing has been working on the three potentially-hazardous defects as it charted plans to consolidate final 787 assembly in South Carolina starting next month, at a sharply-reduced rate of 5 787s per month.
One senior supply chain source said they will have to cut rate again, but another person close to the company said there was no discussion of an imminent cut.
Boeing said last month it expects to resume handing over a small number of 787s to customers later this quarter. 
It has an ambitious internal plan to deliver 100 of the jets this year, one person said. Analysts say deliveries are not expected to recover to 2019 levels until at least 2024.
'OPEN-HEART SURGERY'
But before any jet is delivered, it must go through invasive inspections and costly repairs. 
First, technicians must pull out the passenger seats, open up the floor paneling and use specialty tools to measure whether defects invisible to the naked eye are present, according to three people with direct knowledge of the process. 
The repair work - already underway at Boeing factories in Everett, Washington and North Charleston, South Carolina - is even harder.
In the bowels of the jet, technicians have to remove multiple specialty fasteners on both sides of the inner fuselage skin, then install newly produced ""shims"" that fill out gaps and remove the structural dimpling. Workers then replace all the fasteners, re-paint, and re-install the interior, they said.

""It's like open-heart surgery,"" one of the people said. ""They'll be retrofitting the fleet for potentially several years.""

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) will launch new features and products faster to refresh its business after years of stagnation, the company said on Thursday, aiming to double its annual revenue in 2023.
The stock rose 3.9% to close at $74.71, after hitting an all-time high of $80.75.
""Why don't we start with why folks don't believe in us,"" said Chief Executive Jack Dorsey at the start of Twitter's virtual investor day presentation. ""It comes down to three critiques: we're slow, we're not innovative, and we're not trusted.""
The social media network outlined plans including tipping and paid subscriptions to ""super follow"" some accounts, to attain at least $7.5 billion in annual revenue and 315 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU), or those who see ads, by the end of 2023.
The ""super follow"" feature, which lets users charge followers for access to exclusive content, will launch this year, a spokesman said.
The site, typically used to broadcast short messages to a wide audience, is also working on building more ways for people to have conversations, it said.
This includes hosting live audio discussions using its 'Spaces' feature, which is being tested with about 1,000 users, and letting people share longer-form content using Revue, a newsletter publishing service Twitter acquired last month.
It is also considering allowing ""communities"" to be created for particular interests.
Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter's head of consumer product, said creators would be able to customize communities, including setting and enforcing ""social norms"" beyond Twitter's rules.
At the virtual event, Twitter's policy chief Vijaya Gadde also reiterated the company's support for an open internet. Dorsey said any changes to Section 230, a U.S. law that shields online companies from liability over content posted by users, must be made carefully.
Internationally, Twitter faces challenges in India, a rapidly growing market with plans to require that social media companies erase certain content and coordinate with law enforcement.

Twitter had previously refused to delete content connected to farmers' protests in India.

Last week, the companies had asked the U.S. health regulator to relax requirements for their COVID-19 vaccine to be stored at ultra-low temperatures, potentially allowing it to be kept in pharmacy freezers.
""Alternative temperature for transportation and storage will help ease the burden of procuring ultra-low cold storage equipment for vaccination sites and should help to get vaccine to more sites,"" Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said.

In December, the FDA granted emergency use authorization to the vaccine and current label to be stored at temperatures between -80ºC and -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF), meaning it has to be shipped in specially designed containers.

Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) shares were flat in after-hours trading after falling 9% on Thursday.
The company reported a loss of $11.24 per share on revenue of $859.3 million, compared with Wall Street estimates for a loss of $8.81 per share on revenue of $745.4 million. 
The miss on the bottom line was the result of charges related to its IPO, including $2.8 billion of stock-based compensation expense.
Gross booking value fell 31% to $5.9 billion year-on-year, while average daily rates averaged approximately $128 in Q4 2020, an increase of 13%.
""For revenue, the year-over-year decline in Q1 2021 is expected to be less than that of Q4 2020, as we continue to see gradual improvements in guests’ willingness to book stays. Year-over-year comparisons for revenue are not affected to the same degree by the increase in 2020 cancellations,"" the company said.
Looking ahead, the company talked up expectations for a ""significant travel rebound,"" underpinned by an ongoing vaccine rollout that will lead to the easing of restrictions.  
""Looking forward to 2021, we are preparing for the travel rebound. As the vaccine is rolled out and restrictions lift, we expect there will be a significant travel rebound.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - ByteDance has agreed to a $92 million class-action settlement to settle data privacy claims from some U.S. TikTok users, according to documents filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Illinois.
ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns the short video app that has more than 100 million U.S. users, agreed to the settlement after more than a year of litigation.
""While we disagree with the assertions, rather than go through lengthy litigation, we'd like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community,"" TikTok said Thursday. The settlement still requires court approval.
The lawsuits claimed the TikTok app ""infiltrates its users' devices and extracts a broad array of private data including biometric data and content that defendants use to track and profile TikTok users for the purpose of, among other things, ad targeting and profit.""
The settlement was reached after ""an expert-led inside look at TikTok's source code"" and extensive mediation efforts, according to the motion seeking approval of the settlement.

Separately, in Washington the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Justice Department are looking into allegations that TikTok failed to live up to a 2019 agreement aimed at protecting children's privacy.

Technology fell 3%, resuming its recent slump after reprieve a day earlier, as the United States 10-Year jumped to a more than one-year high briefly topping 1.6%. Fears about rising inflation muddied the outlook for high-flying growth stocks. But with real rates, which takes into account inflation, still ""negative,"" the overall environment for equities remains supportive, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income, Rick Rieder told CNBC in an interview earlier Thursday.
Investors in growth stocks like tech, with high valuations, usually have to wait longer to recoup their investments, which is unattractive in an inflationary environment, where money today, is worth more than money in the future.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were sharply lower.
Twitter, however, traded against the trend, rising 4% after the social media company set out plans to boost monetizable daily active users to 315 million by 2023 and double revenue in that year.
In a further sign that high-growth stocks have lost their shine, stay-at-home market darlings like  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) were nursing heavy losses, down more than 5% each.
The sharp pace of the uptick in rates has also sparked a jolt of volatility, pointing to underlying investor uncertainty, exacerbated by a renewed short-squeeze in shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME), which ended the session up 19%. The CBOE Volatility Index index, or VIX, jumped 35%.
Consumer stocks were also deeply in the red on disappointing quarterly results, with  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) and Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) down 9% and 7%, respectively.
Cyclicals like energy, financials and industrials, which tend to move in tandem with an improving economy, were not spared as recent took some parts of the sector into overbought territory.

154,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 03:50PM ET</span>","Meme Stocks, Personal Income, Tech Wreck: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- CBOE Volatility Index spiked 40% on Thursday amid a wave of selling that sent the major averages plunging.
Investors sold their tech shares and sold United States 10-Year U.S. bonds, sending the latter to their highest yield in more than a year. Risk-off dominated the markets. 
Until now, investors had cheered positive news about vaccines and a decline in the spread of coronavirus as a sign the reopening trade was back on. Those trends have not gone away -- the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s one-dose vaccine candidate for emergency use in the next couple of days.
As millions more vaccines spread out across the country, investors are warming to shares of airlines, travel companies, hotels and even movie theaters. The losers? Stay-at-home trades like  Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) and  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM), which both fell on Thursday.
Will investors buy the dip as they have so many times in the recent past? They have one more day in February to make that trade.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Meme stocks have another rally
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) staged another rally on Thursday as the broader markets fell.
Another big day for GameStop followed a doubling in price on Wednesday. It was up another 59% on Thursday and investors will likely be watching to see if it can keep the momentum going through the end of the week. 
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) - another so-called meme stocks - has positive news to point to -- NYC movie theaters reopen next week -- also climbed as much as 10% on Thursday before ending in the red. Its earnings after the closing bell could decide where its stock trades on Friday.
2. Personal income and spending
Personal income in January is expected to go up 9.5% compared to the 0.6% gain the prior month. Personal spending is seen increasing 2.5% for January after falling 0.2% in December. Both numbers come out Friday at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
3. Twitter and tech stocks
FANG names have dulled in the last few weeks despite multiple surges in the Dow that have set multiple records. It could be that with the focus on rising rates and the reopening trade, investors are finding shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google’s Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)richly priced compared to value sectors like energy and financials.
But not all tech stocks are on the out.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)rose 6% on Thursday to a record after it outlined plans to boost monetizable daily active users to 315 million by 2023 and double revenue in that year. "

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should consider revisiting disclosure requirements for public companies and strengthening guidance on board diversity in an effort to address a lack of diversity across the securities industry and in corporate boardrooms, Allison Herren Lee said.
Last year, the SEC declined to consider environmental, social and governance, or ESG, issues when it amended disclosure guidance. Lee and fellow Democratic commissioner Caroline Crenshaw criticized the move at the time. 
Efforts to address ESG issues have been given new life under Lee and the administration of President Joe Biden. The acting chair earlier this week said she had directed the agency to review companies' disclosures on climate risk.
""The most obvious tool in our toolkit is disclosure,"" Lee said in remarks given during a virtual forum for securities industry professionals, inviting comments on whether the SEC should consider requiring diversity assessments from regulated entities. 
Firms under SEC's oversight can voluntarily conduct diversity self-assessments, but participation in the program is ""disappointing,"" Lee said.
Lee said the SEC could also look at ways to better evaluate the impact of SEC rules on gender and racial discrimination and work to bring more diverse perspectives in their public outreach. 

""We should think more broadly and creatively and pursue every opportunity we have to pursue diversity and inclusion,"" Lee said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investment firm Legion Partners Asset Management on Thursday nominated four directors to OneSpan (NASDAQ:OSPN)'s board after having publicly pushed the cybersecurity firm to improve its stock performance and sell assets.
Legion, which owns roughly 6.8% of the stock and has been an investor since 2018, said in a letter that the board has failed to adequately correct the company's low share price and has made only incremental changes to the board.
""We believe more substantive change is necessary,"" Legion wrote to other shareholders on Thursday. Shareholders now need to elect ""strong technology leaders to the Board who will seek to begin a comprehensive strategic review of the Company to determine the best path forward for the Company and all its stakeholders"", the letter continued.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Legion criticized the 10-member board's long-serving directors saying they lacked relevant experience. ""It should not be too much to ask that a modern software company’s board should be led and overseen by individuals with modern software experience.""
The activist investor nominated Rinki Sethi, chief information security officer at Twitter, Michael McConnell, a private investor with board experience, Sagar Gupta, an analyst at Legion who leads TMT investing, and Sarika Garg, a former SAP executive, as directors.
The stock price jumped nearly 4% to trade at $24.96.
Legion first went public with its demands six months ago after holding private conversations. At that time, it also pushed for the board to replace T. Kendall Hunt, who founded the company and had served on the board for more than two decades, as a director. Hunt retired from the board in September. 
Legion has pushed the company to sell its hardware business and said on Thursday ""the segment has become difficult for management to predict, contributing to multiple debacles on earnings calls"".

160,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 03:12PM ET</span>",Texas lawmakers look to lay blame for deadly power blackout,"By Jennifer Hiller and Gary McWilliams
(Reuters) - Texas state lawmakers on Thursday started digging into the causes of deadly power blackouts that left millions shivering in the dark as frigid temperatures caught its grid operator and utilities ill-prepared for skyrocketing power demand.
Hearings are highlighting shortcomings by grid planners, electric utilities, natural gas suppliers and transmission operators that led to billions of dollars in damages and dozens of deaths. Consumer advocates have called for more stringent regulation of utilities and a review of retail marketing plans.
""Who's at fault?"" State Representative Todd Hunter demanded of utility executives. ""I want to hear who's at fault. I want the public to know who screwed up.""
""The entire energy sector failed Texas,"" said  NRG Energy Inc  (NYSE:NRG) Chief Executive Mauricio Gutierrez, who testified at the hearing.
While executives said there were broad failures of leadership and preparation, the biggest was the state's natural gas system, responsible for the largest share of Texas power generation, said Curtis Morgan, CEO of Vistra Corp. Texas is the country's biggest producer of natural gas, but without better ties between gas producers, pipelines and power plants, the state will face future cold weather outages.
""We just couldn't get the gas at the pressures we needed,"" said Morgan, who instructed employees to buy gas at any price but could not acquire enough to run plants.
Up to 48% of the state's power generation was offline at times last week and at least 32 people died, including an 11-year-old boy of hypothermia in an unheated mobile home.
""We owe it to them and every Texan to make sure this never happens again,"" said State Representative Ana Hernandez, noting that hospitals still have supply chain problems and burst pipes, and some people cannot access food and water. ""The impact of this disaster was not only financial.""
Utilities were ordered to cut power to prevent a larger catastrophe, Bill Magness, CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state's grid operator, said on Wednesday. 
Six of ERCOT's 15 directors resigned this week and a nominee withdrew before taking a seat.
ERCOT did not warn residents that the state's power generation would not keep up with demand, even under perfect conditions, despite warnings the week prior from utilities, Morgan said. 
""We did not give people a fighting chance,"" Morgan said.
Governor Greg Abbott on Wednesday said public anger was justified and pledged proposals to increase power supplies and to protect those residents hit with enormous power bills. He blamed ERCOT, saying it should have acted faster to prevent generators from falling offline. 
But Abbott ""hand picks"" members of the Public Utilities Commission that oversees ERCOT, Representative Rafael Anchia said.
RETAIL DEFAULTS AHEAD 
Of the about 100 retail electric providers in Texas, a quarter are at risk of default on multimillion-dollar service charges levied by ERCOT. Some may sell customers to larger firms to cover costs, stifling retail competition, said Mark Foster, an attorney and former special counsel to the state's Public Utility Commission. 
""They call it the blood week,"" Foster said. One of his clients, electricity marketer Young Energy LLC, faces a $19 million bill for services that cost $37,000 the prior month, he said. ""There will be a significant decrease in competition for the consumer,"" he said.
Texas state Senator John Whitmire asked whether ERCOT explored claims that natural gas producers intentionally cut supplies to electric generators to drive up the fuel's price.
ERCOT CEO Bill Magness replied he had no first-hand knowledge.
The ""big missing money"" is not sitting with utilities, who paid historically high prices for natural gas, said Morgan.

""The gas business made a lot of money,"" he said.

The membership-only retailer's move comes as U.S. President Joe Biden plans to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, and a week after rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc raised its hourly wage to an average of $15.
Costco's Chief Executive Officer Craig Jelinek made the announcement at a U.S. Senate Budget Committee hearing on worker wages at large companies.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes dropped on Thursday, with the Nasdaq on track for its worst day in four months, as technology-related stocks remained under pressure following a rise in U.S. bond yields.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit a one-year high of 1.53%, prompting investors to lock in profits on some high-flying growth stocks due to concerns over heightened valuations. [US/]
The Treasury note yield also rose above S&P 500 dividend yield, wiping out historically strong advantage that the stock market yield has held.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) were down between 1.9% and 2.9%. 
""The concern is that we haven't been in an environment of persistently rising inflation expectations so it creates this new dynamic for investors,"" said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors in Newport Beach, California.
""The market is stretched, a lot of forward growth expectations have been baked in and that's creating some of the excuse to blow up steam for some investors who were a little too bullish.""
The S&P 500 technology sector and communication services, among the sectors that powered the market's rally in 2020, were down 3.9% and 2.3%. 
The S&P 500 growth index is nearly unchanged in February, sharply underperforming the value index, which has gained more than 7% on optimism related to a post-pandemic reopening of the economy.
Meanwhile, data showed fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week amid falling COVID-19 infections, but the near-term outlook still remained unclear after winter storms wreaked havoc in the South region in the middle of this month. 
Optimism about more U.S. stimulus and a quicker pace of vaccinations at the beginning of the month have positioned the the Dow Jones index for its best monthly gain since November. 
However, the lack of significant new developments around the fiscal package and the winding down of the earnings season have caused uncertainty in the market. 
""In the beginning of February, the stimulus news was the driving force but now that it has been priced in, there is nothing on the distant horizon for equity investors to be excited about and there is a concern that upside is limited,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management.
At 01:53 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 462.22 points, or 1.45%, to 31,499.64, the S&P 500 lost 81.40 points, or 2.07%, to 3,844.03 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 390.55 points, or 2.87%, to 13,207.42. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc fell 5.5% after a media report that the electric-car maker told workers it would temporarily halt some production at its car assembly plant in California.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc jumped 4.6% after the drugmaker said it was expecting to post $18.4 billion in sales from its COVID-19 vaccine this year.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5.5-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 5.4-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. 

The S&P 500 posted 70 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 252 new highs and 87 new lows.

With effect from July 1, Chalendar, whose mandate was set to end in 2022, will be succeeded as CEO by current Chief Operating Officer Benoit Bazin but will stay on as chairman.
""Benoit has managed, with the success we see today, critical projects like our transformation plan 'Transform & Grow' or the acquisition of Continental Building Products,"" Chalendar said in a statement.
Launched in 2018, Saint-Gobain's restructuring programme reshaped the group's organisation around regional units, helping it comply with local pandemic-related restrictions.
""Over the year as a whole, we unlocked significant savings of 690 million euros, with a strong contribution from 'Transform & Grow' which met its target of 250 million euros in structural gains in 2019-2020 a year earlier than planned,"" Chalendar added.
Saint-Gobain, which makes the bulk of its sales in Europe, benefited from its exposure to renovation, its biggest market, and posted a 2.03 billion euros ($2.47 billion) operating income in the second half, leading to a record operating margin of 10%.
Interest in interior renovation increased in 2020 due to lockdowns, the group said in a call with reporters, noting energy renovation plans in Europe and the United States, both in residential and public buildings, would contribute to Saint-Gobain's growth from 2021.
Last October, the European Commission launched its ""Renovation Wave"" initiative to double the Union's annual rate of energy-related building renovations.
Saint-Gobain, which manufactures and distributes materials in sectors ranging from automotive to health, security or food and beverages, forecast a significant increase in operating income this year.

""In one fell swoop an entire new generation of investors was criticized and this commentary overlooks the cultural shift that is taking place in our nation today,"" the company said via Twitter https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/1364976883411034114.
Robinhood was referring to the wave of retail traders entering the market over the past 18 months as many big brokers eliminated trading commissions, a model Robinhood helped pioneer, and more people stuck at home during the pandemic took up day trading.
Representatives for Robinhood and Munger were not immediately available for comment.
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) stock skyrocketed in late January after amateur investors encouraged each other online to buy the gaming retailer on platforms including Robinhood. This caught some hedge funds in a short squeeze. The shares later fell, exposing many retail investors to losses, but soared again on Wednesday.
Robinhood has more than 13 million users with an average age of 31, according to the company's most recent public statistics.
Many users criticized the brokerage after it, along with several other brokerages, temporarily restricted trading in GameStop and other ""meme"" stocks on Jan. 28, due to increased regulatory collateral requirements.
Robinhood Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev was slammed at a Feb. 18 congressional hearing for what some lawmakers said was his firm's ""gamification"" of stock trading on mobile phones through things like virtual confetti following a big trade.

""We don't believe in gamification,"" Tenev said.

(Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc is set to approve expansions at several of its U.S. copper mines to capitalize on surging demand for the red metal as President Joe Biden moves to electrify the nation's automobiles and combat climate change, Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told Reuters.
The expansions would be a major bet on the U.S. economy - one of the company's largest markets - and also on the rising demand for electric vehicles (EVs), which use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines.
Adkerson also said he has no desire to combine Freeport with Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) Corp or another gold producer and is working to give COVID-19 vaccines to about 25,000 workers at the Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia, which Freeport owns with that country's government. He also is aiming to double the size of the company's board of directors.
Phoenix-based Freeport already produces more than 1 billion pounds of copper each year in the United States, little of which is exported. While the company opened a new U.S. mine last year in Arizona, it could soon greenlight expansions at three mines in the U.S. Southwest, Adkerson said, adding more than 250 billion pounds of copper each year to U.S. output.
""President Biden clearly has a commitment to addressing climate change, and any climate change initiative creates demand for copper,"" Adkerson, who became Freeport's chairman on Feb. 2, said in an interview this week. ""We're very well-situated to address that with the assets we have.""
Biden met with lawmakers on Wednesday to discuss how to secure supplies of electric vehicles and the minerals used to make them.
Just a year ago, Freeport worried about ""our ability to continue operating"" due to the coronavirus pandemic, Adkerson said. With copper prices hovering near $2 a pound last April, the company was forced to make budget and dividend cuts.
Copper is a key barometer of economic health due to its use in manufacturing. In the last six months, copper prices have slowly rebounded to just above $4 a pound and Freeport's stock has more than doubled.
""Now we can turn our attention to focusing on these growth opportunities,"" Adkerson said, adding that any expansions would take several years to bring online. That timeline implies the company remains bullish on copper for the long run.
The option to expand existing mines, rather than building new ones, gives Freeport an advantage over its rivals, Adkerson said. Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Plc, for instance, is trying to build the Resolution Copper mine in Arizona, a project that Native Americans oppose on religious grounds. Adkerson declined to comment on that dispute.
NO TIE-UP
The combination of Freeport's improving sales and stock price has seemingly shooed away potential bidders, including Barrick. Last year, Barrick CEO Mark Bristow expressed interest in Freeport.
At the time, Barrick's market value was twice that of Freeport. Now, given its stock surge, Freeport is worth $20 billion more than Barrick. Bristow told investors last week his first priority now is to expand the assets Barrick already owns.
""I don't believe it makes sense to combine a company like ours with a gold company,"" Adkerson said. ""But I don't criticize Mark (Bristow) for thinking we have good assets."" 
Freeport's commitment to copper, Adkerson said, will remain and the company will avoid lithium, rare earths and other EV metals that are getting more attention on Wall Street. Adkerson, who has been CEO since 2003 and is now 74, said he has no plans to retire. 

""We're on the verge of really great success, and thank God I've got the health and energy to be a part of it,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Airbnb's quarterly results are likely to show the pandemic may have helped the home rental company lure leisure travelers away from big hotels during the global travel collapse of 2020.
Weary of being locked up in their homes for months, travelers hit the road and booked homes and cottages on Airbnb, while avoiding flights and downtown hotels, analysts said.
Airbnb accounted for 18% of the total U.S. lodging revenue in 2020, up from 11.5% in 2019, data from hotel analytics provider STR and vacation rental data company AirDNA showed.
It outperformed the hotel industry and online travel agents such as  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com thanks to its greater offer of 'sun, ski, and suburban' rental homes, Cowen & Co analysts said.

THE CONTEXT
In 2019, about 90% of Airbnb's bookings came from leisure travels compared with about 20%-30% for large hotels chains, including Marriott and Hilton, that rely on business travel to grow their profits.
""Unfortunately, the hotel operators do not have as much supply in locations where people are willing to travel,"" said Jamie Lane, vice president of research at AirDNA.
Lane said with mass vaccinations later in the year, the share of alternative accommodations including Airbnb will drop before continuing to grow at 2%-3% per year once normal travel patterns return.

THE FUNDAMENTALS
* The San Francisco-based company is expected to report gross bookings of $23.10 billion in 2020, down from about $38 billion a year earlier, according to the mean estimate of 12 analysts according to Refinitiv; gross bookings are seen rising by 50% in 2021.
* Analysts' mean estimate for Airbnb's full-year net loss is $3.52 billion, bigger than a loss of $674.3 million a year earlier. Full-year revenue is expected to drop 32% to $3.27 billion.
WALL STREET SENTIMENT
* Of 34 brokerages, 20 rate Airbnb's stock ""hold"", 12 ""buy"" or higher and two ""sell"" or lower
* Wall Street's median 12-month price target for Airbnb is $156​, about 22% below its last closing price of $200.20.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Vice Chair Randal Quarles cautioned Thursday that needed efforts to provide more economic stimulus could obscure risks at banks by helping keep borrowers afloat temporarily.
In prepared remarks, Quarles also said the Fed should take into account how bank risk is impacted by broader developments, like the growing role of nonbank finance, in further honing its annual stress tests of large firms. 
""The Fed must continue to innovate so that stress testing remains effective,"" he said.
Quarles said he backed government efforts to support people and businesses amid the pandemic. But he warned they could mask underlying weaknesses at banks by making it unclear whether borrowers were able to keep up with loans with their own finances or due to government support. He said the Fed must figure out how to measure the pandemic's economic impact on borrowers in its future risk assessments.
Over the longer term, Quarles also said the Fed was considering ways to ""reduce the volatility"" in the annual stress tests without making them easier. Some issues being explored relate to gripes raised by banks around the treatment of interest rate hedges, loss-sharing agreements, and loans that use fair value option accounting, he added.
Quarles also reiterated that the Fed's bank supervisors should use as much data-driven analysis as possible in doing their work. The Fed's top regulatory official is currently working on an overhaul of how the central bank supervises large firms, after years of industry complaints the process is too opaque and subjective.

""I believe that there is room for supervisors to be more transparent about their analytical processes in general, and more forthcoming about the data used as the basis for supervisory judgments,"" he said.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 11:05AM ET</span>","Analysis: Micro-cap stock surge shows investor risk taking, GameStop effect","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of the biggest winners on U.S. stock exchanges so far this year have been their smallest members, partly fueled by the GameStop effect, but their gains could be particularly vulnerable if investors get skittish about equities. 
The Russell Microcap index, whose components have a median market value of about $350 million, has climbed 26% nearly two months into 2021. That gain tops the 4.5% rise for the large-cap S&P 500, whose components' median market value is about $28 billion, and the performance of benchmark small- and mid-cap stock indexes. 
The micro-cap gauge ceded some gains during volatility earlier this week while other indexes held up better. With relatively few shares available to be traded, micro-cap stocks favored by individual investors could be hit hard in a downturn.
“Because they are retail oriented, they are probably going to be a little more vulnerable with the risk-off days versus the risk-on days,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.
Shares of smaller U.S.-based companies, which tend to rely more on domestic business, are generally benefiting from hopes for a rebounding U.S. economy fueled by widespread vaccinations. That economic optimism also lifted micro-cap stocks, according to investors, after the group long underperformed until last year.
A ""speculative fever,"" as one investor put it, symbolized in wild swings of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares, also could be fueling micro caps.
GameStop shares doubled on Wednesday, lifting their year-to-date gain to over 380% and the video game chain's market value to $6.4 billion. That puts GameStop, whose shares are in the iShares Micro-Cap ETF, above the value of some S&P 500 companies.
There has been a ""fundamental basis"" supporting micro caps' strong performance, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. But, he added, ""historically you would say that is one of the riskier parts of the market and the fact that it has moved so aggressively ... is emblematic of high risk appetite.”
More than 80% of the components of the iShares Micro-Cap ETF had posted gains in 2021 as of Tuesday, against over 60% of those in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), according to Refintiv data. 
Among stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, those that started the year with market values of less than $500 million were up an average 34%, triple the gain of those above $500 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Big micro-cap gains this year include a 177% rise for shares of Esports Entertainment Group and a 178% surge for Energous (NASDAQ:WATT) Corp, a wireless charging company. 
""The speculative fever is out there,"" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management, which has run a micro-cap fund for over 20 years. As long as that persists, he said, ""it’s good for this class of stocks that are speculative in their nature.""
Since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine news in early November, the Russell Microcap index has soared 54% against a nearly 12% rise for the S&P 500.
Until then, the micro-cap index had fallen 2% in 2020 against the S&P 500's nearly 9% rise, after lagging the S&P in the prior three years.
“You are coming out of this incredibly long period of historic underperformance going into the pandemic,” Kuby said. “One could argue after that period of underperformance, a lot of them had gotten very inexpensive.”
Small-cap funds, which include micro caps, have seen nearly $23 billion in net inflows starting in November after six months of outflows, according to Lipper data.
“They are cheap stocks, they are getting fund flows, they fit some of the themes that I think people are interested in,” said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
Investors noted that money flowing to micro-cap stocks can create outsized moves because they have relatively few shares available to be traded. Micro-cap stocks have an average free float of about 29 million shares compared with an average of about 600 million shares for S&P 500 stocks, according to Refinitiv data.

“Micro caps are particularly unpredictable,"" said Joel Schneider, deputy head of portfolio management at Dimensional, ""but they do go through periods of very strong performance.”

175,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 10:51AM ET</span>",Carbon offsets gird for lift-off as big money gets close to nature,"By Susanna Twidale and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) - An expected dash by big corporations for offsets to meet their climate targets has prompted financial exchanges to launch carbon futures contracts to capitalise on what could be a multi-billion dollar market.
It's a step change. Carbon offsets, generated by emissions reduction projects, such as tree planting or shifts to less polluting fuels, have struggled for years to gain credibility, but as climate action has become urgent, their market is expected to grow to as much as $50 billion by 2030.
Among the major corporations that say they expect to use them to compensate for any emissions they cannot cut from their operations and products are Unilever (NYSE:UL), EasyJet, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP), which all have climate targets.
Singapore-based digital exchange AirCarbon told Reuters it planned to launch an offset futures contract by the second quarter.
""The entire concept behind carbon trading and offsets is to employ the profit motive in order to push decisions towards climate change mitigating activities. (We ensure) that you find the most efficiently priced offsets,"" William Pazos, co-founder of AirCarbon, said.
The futures market would allow companies to buy a simple credit, effectively a promise to reduce a tonne of emissions but not specifying where that would take place, in contrast to the existing market that offers direct access to particular offset projects.
Advocates, such as AirCarbon, say the resulting liquidity and transparency are positive.
Critics, including some environmental groups and some project developers, say making the market bigger may just make it cheaper for emitters without providing any guarantee it will support the projects most effective in reducing emissions.
""There is a risk in a ... switch from something which has a large proportion of over-the-counter buyers at least taking some interest in what they are buying and its quality to large wholesale transactions that aren’t so easily unpacked,"" said Owen Hewlett, chief technical officer at Gold Standard, one of the biggest carbon offset registries.    
SMALL AND OPAQUE
Carbon offset credits are currently traded in small, bilateral and typically project-specific deals.
    An emitter can buy a credit awarded to a forestry or clean cooking stove project for a tonne of carbon dioxide emissions the project has prevented.
    The buyer uses these credits to offset past or future emissions and the credit is ""retired"", or removed from the system.
    The retail price of an offset can vary from 50 cents for a renewable energy project in Asia to $15 for a clean cook stoves project in Africa to $50 for a plastic recycling project in eastern Europe. 
(Graphic: Carbon offset wholesale prices: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/rlgvdexlgpo/WholesaleOffsetPrices.png)
(Graphic: Carbon offset retail prices: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/ygdvzenwdpw/OffsetPricingB2C.png)
These voluntary deals are distinct from compliance cap-and-trade markets, such as the European Union's Emissions Trading System, based on lawmakers setting a carbon budget and allocating a finite number of allowances, which can be traded by emitters or market players.
The underlying principle echoes the carbon offset market in that those that have emitted too much carbon can buy pollution permits from those with allowances to spare.
    As demand to limit carbon emissions grows, carbon prices in the EU ETS have soared to a record high of over 40 euros a tonne this year.
In the off-exchange, bilateral market for carbon offsets, some say they are struggling to navigate the proliferation of standard setters, registries, verifiers and criteria.
""The market today is very small. It’s difficult to be confident that the product you are investing in is credible,"" said Bill Winters, CEO of  Standard Chartered  bank (LON:STAN) and Chair of a private sector task force seeking to create a multi-billion dollar offset market in the coming months.
(Graphic: How small is the voluntary carbon offset market?: https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/OIL-CARBONCREDITS/oakvexkkmpr/chart.png)
DECISIVE YEAR?
This year in theory should mark the coming of age of carbon markets as decades of U.N. talks on tackling climate change reach a decisive stage.
Delegates at the United Nations climate conference in November in Glasgow, Scotland, are expected to work on designing a market to channel money into offset and emissions removal projects to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the preindustrial average.
    Some players, such as AirCarbon, are eager to launch their financial products sooner. 
    Global exchange CME, home of the main U.S. crude oil benchmark contract, will launch an offset futures contract in March. 
""It is a brand new market for many players,"" CME Chief Executive Peter Keavey told Reuters. ""We can help provide standardised pricing benchmarks and improve price discovery in the voluntary offset market. That's our goal.""
Ahead of the talks later this year on market design, both CME and AirCarbon plan to use standards set under the aviation CORSIA offset scheme, which many environmental campaigners have said are not rigorous enough as they allow the aviation sector to use most types of project to reach its emissions targets.
They say they fear a repeat of problems that beset the offset market of the Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
The market under Kyoto, a precursor of the Paris climate deal, was flooded with cheap credits from industrial gas projects, mainly from Asia. That led to price crashes and made it harder for other projects to attract funding. 
(Graphic: Spot price of Certified Emission Reductions: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yzdpxwqokvx/Pasted%20image%201613645738271.png)
""CORSIA allows a lot of project types and does not have particularly stringent criteria, such as forestry projects with permanence issues and old CDM (Kyoto) credits with little environmental benefit,"" Gilles Dufrasne, policy officer at the non-governmental organisation Carbon Market Watch, said.
Asked about criticisms of CORSIA, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which developed the scheme, said in an email CORSIA had been agreed by a consensus of member states and was ""under constant review"".
Some project developers, brokers and environmental groups also question the wisdom of decoupling carbon units from their underlying project.
They say combining emissions-focused projects with those that might prioritise other issues, such as community engagement, education or biodiversity, could lead to a race to the bottom in terms of price.
    This might make it harder for more capital intensive projects to attract buyers.
More broadly, green groups are concerned companies may place too much emphasis on offsets which, if priced too cheaply, could lead them to focus less on cutting their own emissions.
There are no rules on how many tonnes of carbon a company is allowed to offset a year.
Emitters, such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Unilever and project developers, say the first priority must be to reduce emissions.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 09:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive: LME data to support end to open outcry is misleading, brokers say","By Eric Onstad
LONDON (Reuters) - Two commodities brokers say data the London Metal Exchange is using to support its proposal to shut its trading floor for good exaggerates the increase in the use of electronic platforms during coronavirus lockdowns.
Sucden Financial and StoneX Financial, which oppose the end of so-called ring trading at the 144-year-old exchange, say data used by the LME in a presentation https://www.lme.com/-/media/Files/News/LME-strategic-pathway/2021/LME-Discussion-Paper-on-Market-Structure-2021.pdf?la=en-GB does not take into account electronic trading before floor trading was suspended in March.
The row highlights a long-running battle between modernists and traditionalists over the future of the LME ring, the last open-outcry trading floor left in Europe after other exchanges for everything from oil to stocks to cocoa all moved online. 
The LME data shows the average daily volume of copper traded in the closing price window - which is used to value end-of-day positions - jumped 169% and meant more people participated in price discovery when only digital platforms were available.
However, the data compiled by Sucden and StoneX, which has not previously been published, shows the volume of copper traded electronically in the closing window fell 13%.
They say the discrepancy is explained by the fact their data compares electronic trading under lockdown with ring trading and digital platforms beforehand, while the LME comparison does not include electronic trading before the pandemic struck.
The LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, said the data provided by the brokers was accurate.
""In the paper, we were really clear that we were doing a very specific analysis, looking at the volume directly contributing to the pricing window,"" Jamie Turner, the LME's head of market structure, told a webinar on Thursday.
(Graphic: London Metal Exchange says electronic trading has been a success: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdeadmvo/LME%20presentation%20Electronic%20pricing%20has%20worked.png)
OUT WITH THE OLD?
The LME temporarily suspended its ring - a circle of padded, red-leather benches where traders signal buy and sell orders with hand signals and shouting - on March 23 last year and now wants to make the closure permanent.
The world's oldest and biggest marketplace for industrial metals launched a consultation process last month and argued the forced migration to digital trading was a success.
Michael Overlander, chairman of Sucden Financial, said the LME had provided only a partial picture of closing market activity and their rival data was more representative.
""This data clearly contradicts the LME's claim that volumes used for reference prices have been significantly higher since the ring closed,"" Overlander said.
(Graphic: London Metal Exchange volumes before and after the closure of the open outcry ring: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxwjgxpx/LME%20volumes%20before%20and%20after%20ring%20closure.png)
Copper was not the only metal to show discrepancies. For aluminium, the LME data shows trading jumped 130% while the broker data has a 17% increase. Zinc volumes surged 176% under the LME data but rose just 15% according to the brokers.
Their data shows electronic trading volumes for nickel and tin both fell along with copper in contrast to the LME numbers.
""We very much welcome all views in respect of the proposals put forward in our discussion paper on market structure and would encourage market participants to send us their feedback,"" the LME said when asked for comment about the discrepancies.
The LME compared volumes in the ring during the 127 trading days before it closed, from September 2019 to March 2020, with turnover on its LMEselect digital platform for a similar 127-day period from June to December.
The exchange used data from June to December as it was the most recent period, it wanted the two periods to be the same length, and it also believed it would be more representative because trading was still in transition during April and May.
OVER THE PHONE
Overlander said the LME's proposals did not acknowledge that transferring all trade to its electronic system, which currently handles less than a third of total volume, was a massive job.
Sucden said the bulk of the trading volume takes place in deals between members themselves and members with their clients, often over the telephone, before being cleared through the LME.
Data from the LME's web pages https://www.lme.com/en-GB/Market-Data/Reports-and-data/Volumes/Monthly-volumes showed that over the past 15 months, an average of 30% of volume has gone through the LME's electronic system. 
The LME is unique among exchanges in that it allows users to lock in prices for individual days for up to three months into the future and weekly prices for up to six months ahead.
That means there are hundreds of potential dates to trade and adjust, with much of that activity done over the telephone.
Major ring-dealing broker Marex Spectron, however, was less concerned about a potential ring closure, saying it anticipated such an outcome.
""We ... have been developing our electronic presence with sophisticated algorithmic strategies on LMEselect and our own proprietary liquidity platform,"" it said in a statement. ""We are in a good position to take advantage of this development.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened flat to lower on Thursday as the renewed rise in long-term bond yields again undermined the valuations of technology stocks in particular, while helping bank stocks to new highs for the year.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite was 9 points, or 0.1% lower, with chipmaker NVidia losing 2.1% after a slightly disappointing quarterly update after the closing bell on Wednesday. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock lost 1.2% and Nio (NYSE:NIO) ADRs lost 1.6% as money continued to be redeployed within the electric vehicle sector in the wake of Lucid Motors' merger with the Churchill Capital IV SPAC. 
The S&P 500 was also down 0.1% but the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down only 10 points off the all-time high that it closed at on Wednesday.
The moves came after what appeared to be an improvement in the labor market sector,  as it reacted to the first lifting of lockdown measures in months. Initial jobless claims fell to 730,000 last week, a much sharper decline than expected. 
Standing out in early trading was the continuation of Wednesday's renewed short squeeze in GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock, which rose 30% and 6.4% respectively as options dealers rushed to cover short call positions in an increasingly tight cash market.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock also rose 6.9% after the biotech company said it expects sales of $18.4 billion from its Covid-19 vaccine this year, an upgrade of some 20% from its previous estimate.
Rising bond yields and a steeper yield curve continued to support financial stocks. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 1.2% while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock rose 0.8%. Assurances by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that monetary policy will stay loose for the foreseeable future also kept financial marketplace stocks well bid, with Tradeweb (NASDAQ:TW) stock rising 1.3% to a new all-time high, while Interactive Brokers  (NASDAQ:IBKR) rose 0.9% to a three-year high. Deutsche Bank analysts argued in a note to clients this week that the forthcoming wave of household stimulus checks alone could release over $100 billion for retail investors to deploy in financial markets.
Among the losers were Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock, which fell 6.4% after warnings of a challenging first quarter took the froth of a rally that had seen it gain over 35% since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech made their breakthrough vaccine  announcement in November. Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) stock also fell 6.1% after missing forecasts for its sales in the final quarter of the year."

(Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc said on Thursday it expects COVID-19 vaccine sales of $18.4 billion this year, above the $15 billion in sales forecast by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) for the only other vaccine authorized for emergency use in the United States so far. 
Both vaccines, developed using a technology based on messenger RNA (mRNA), are being distributed at an unprecedented speed as cases mount in the United States, with deaths from COVID-19 surpassing the dire milestone of 500,000.
Moderna, whose shares rose 4% to $150.7 in trading before the bell, has been aiming to ramp up production of the vaccine, its first and only revenue-generating product.
It now aims to produce at least 700 million doses this year and expects to raise production to as much as 1 billion doses by improving its manufacturing process.. 
""2020 demonstrated the power of harnessing mRNA to make medicines,"" Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. 
""I believe that 2021 will be an inflection year for Moderna.""
Moderna expects cost of sales to be about 20% of product sales in 2021, well above the 4% it recorded a year earlier. 
The company also said it had completed enrollment for a mid-to-late stage study of the vaccine in adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17, while a study in children aged six months to 11 years will start in the near-term. 

Moderna's chief medical officer, Tal Zaks, would leave the company in late September, the company added.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",Five things shaping Britain's financial rulebooks after Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is conducting a review of its financial rulebooks and policies to see how it can keep its 130 billion pound ($184 billion) finance sector competitive after Brexit left it largely cut off from the European Union. 
The government is due to issue papers in the coming days outlining its approach to financial technology (fintech) and capital markets, while further down the line it's expected to propose changes to the funds and insurance sectors.
Here are five things set to shape the City of London financial hub following its loss of access to the EU:
BIG BANG DEBATE
Britain's finance ministry is reviewing financial regulation and insurance capital rules, with minister Rishi Sunak raising the prospect of a ""Big Bang 2.0"" to maintain the City's competitiveness, a reference to liberalisation of trading in the 1980s.
But it's unclear how far any deregulation could go given that Britain says it won't undermine global standards.
UK Finance, a banking body, wants a formal remit for regulators to ditch rules that put them at a competitive disadvantage globally. Insurers want cuts in capital requirements to free up cash for green and long term investments.
But the Bank of England says the City must not become an ""anything goes"" financial centre, and that insurers hold the right amount of capital.
Cross-border firms want to avoid Britain diverging from international norms as this would add to compliance costs.
City veterans say Britain should focus on allowing firms to hire globally, and ensuring that regulators respond nimbly and proportionately to crypto-assets, sustainable finance, long-term investing and restructurings after COVID-19.
COPYING NEW YORK
London has fallen behind New York in attracting company flotations and a government-backed review of listing rules is likely to recommend allowing ""dual class"" shares and a lower ""free float"", perhaps for a limited period.
Dual class shares are stocks in the same company with different voting rights, while ""free float"" refers to the proportion of a company's shares that are publicly available. 
The potential changes could attract more tech and fintech companies whose founders typically want to retain a large degree of control.
It could also recommend making it easier for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) - businesses that raise money on stock markets to buy other companies - an area in which New York has also dominated, with Amsterdam catching up fast.
UK asset managers warn that strong corporate governance standards could be diluted by tinkering with listing rules.
BEYOND SANDBOXES
Britain is home to one of the world's biggest innovative fintech sectors, its ""sandboxes"" - which allow fintech firms to test new products on real consumers under regulatory supervision - copied across the world. But Brexit means Britain has to work harder to attract and retain fintechs as they will no longer have direct access to the world's biggest trading area.
A government-backed review to buttress the sector is due to report back on Friday with recommendations that could include cutting red tape for fintechs that want to recruit staff from across the world, and make listing in Britain more attractive.
Other ideas could include helping fledgling fintech navigate government departments and regulators more easily, along with ways of boosting funding for start-ups.
FUNDS ARE THE FUTURE
Britain is reviewing how to make itself a more competitive place for listing investment funds, a core tool for bringing fresh capital into markets.
UK-based asset managers run many funds listed in the EU, but this global system of cross-border management known as delegation could be tightened up by the bloc.
Having more funds listed in Britain would also mean that the shares they hold would be traded in London. Billions of euros in trading euro shares have left the UK for Amsterdam since Brexit due to the bloc's restrictions on where funds can trade shares.
THINK GLOBAL
As the City will get only limited access at best to the EU, industry officials say it makes more sense to focus on getting better access to other markets like Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, while at the same time keeping the UK financial market open to the world, including the EU.
Negotiations between Britain and Switzerland for a ""mutual recognition"" deal in financial rules is the way to go, industry officials say. Better global access would also keep the City ahead of EU centres like Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt.

LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's Stevanato Group, manufacturer of glass vials for COVID-19 vaccines and other healthcare products, is making plans for an initial public offering this year that could value the company at between $4 billion-$5 billion, three sources with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are among the banks appointed for the stock market listing which is expected to take place in New York, two of the sources added.
Spokespersons for Bank of America and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
One of the sources said the healthcare packaging company would look to raise around $500 million from the IPO. 
The company wants to capitalize on strong investor demand for healthcare assets but a final decision on whether to list in New York or possibly Milan has yet to be made, the sources said.
A spokesman for the company declined to comment. 
The Padua-based firm, which is owned by Italy's Stevanato family, makes glass tube containers for the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors and glass cartridges for insulin pen injectors.
It reported core earnings of 111.1 million euros ($135.88 million) in 2019 and a turnover of 570.3 million euros, the company said. 
Its estimated valuation is based on how major peers such as U.S. drug packaging company West Pharma is trading, said one of the sources. West Pharma has a market capitalisation of $20.7 billion. 
Last year, Stevanato signed an agreement with the global Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations - which is a co-leader of the World Health Organization's global vaccine-sharing scheme COVAX - for the supply of 100 million glass vials to hold up to 2 billion doses of a vaccine against the COVID-19 virus. 
Stocks in the healthcare sector have soared since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly of those companies making products to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
New York's Nasdaq exchange is the world's biggest investment hub for biotechnology companies and its biotech index has a market cap of $1.3 trillion dollars.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>",Wanted: More high-tech manufacturing space for a global vaccine push,"By Allison Martell, Carl O'Donnell and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - The number of available COVID-19 vaccine doses is steadily rising, but a shortage of physical space that meets standards for pharmaceutical manufacturing is a major bottleneck to further expansion, according to drugmakers, industry construction experts and officials involved in the U.S. vaccine program.
The production of raw materials, vaccine formulation and vial filling all require ""clean rooms"" with features like air cleaners, sterile water and sterilizing steam designed and in some cases built by specialists.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc on Wednesday announced plans to expand vaccine manufacturing capacity, but said it will be a year before that can add to its production.
With vaccines needed for billions of people to end a pandemic that has claimed more than 2.5 million lives globally, drugmakers have even had to turn to rivals for help to churn out doses. Space at third-party contract manufacturers in the United States is largely allocated, according to one major contract manufacturer and other smaller companies.
A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office report flagged a shortage of manufacturing capacity as a challenge in scaling up vaccine production. 
And the emergence of new coronavirus variants is likely to increase the strain on production capacity. 
Public health experts say global vaccination as soon as possible is critical to curbing the rise of highly contagious additional variants. Many are counting on authorization of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccine this week.
Longer term, tackling COVID-19 may require annual shots to protect against new virus mutations, similar to the flu. Vaccine companies are already designing potential booster shots addressing variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil.
""What's happening now indicates the importance of markedly strengthening the capacity of manufacturing capabilities in the United States,"" said Larry Corey, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who helped design U.S.-backed vaccine trials. ""We should be investing, large scale, in our abilities to manufacture.""
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna can increase output some by speeding fill and finish, said Moncef Slaoui, former chief scientific adviser for the government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program. Making much more vaccine itself is more challenging.
""To change that substantially in terms of drug substance would take ramping up global manufacturing infrastructure. That takes months,"" he said. ""You would have to build, train, validate, and get regulators to visit and approve a site.""
Leading vaccine developers Pfizer and partner BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), J&J,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and CureVac are aiming to make enough vaccine with manufacturing partners to inoculate some 5.2 billion people in 2021, according to a Reuters tally of public statements and media reports. 
China's Sinovac and Sinopharm will likely deliver significant supplies as well, though their 2021 targets are unclear. Several drugmakers have struggled to meet early production targets.
BUILDING FASTER
Building new facilities and even expanding existing manufacturing sites has typically taken years. During the pandemic, some projects have been completed in as little as 6-to-10 months, according to some specialized construction companies involved with Warp Speed.
Emergent BioSolutions , which is making J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines for the United States, cannot add any more equipment to facilities dedicated to those vaccines.
The company is not alone. ""The contract manufacturing network, like our facility, is pretty full,"" said Emergent Executive Vice President Sean Kirk.
Adding new clean rooms that meet good manufacturing practices standards is complex and time consuming, said Phil DeSantis, a consultant and pharmaceutical engineer.
""Building the clean room is probably what we call the critical path,"" he said. ""That's the part that takes the longest."" 
Vaccine makers have sidestepped this in part by retrofitting existing facilities. BioNTech bought a facility in Marburg, Germany, from Novartis in September, and began producing messenger RNA - the active ingredient in its vaccine - in early February. 
When Emergent joined Warp Speed last year, it stopped everything else it was working on at its Baltimore facility to make room for the COVID-19 vaccines.
The U.S. government can use the Defense Production Act to force that kind of reshuffling. Supply orders with a federal ""rating"" under the law must be filled first. But there are limits to what it can do without threatening supplies of other injectable medicines. 
Pfizer last week said it had engaged two U.S. contract manufacturers and would add capacity to formulate vaccines and make raw materials at its own sites, but did not specify whether new clean rooms would be installed.
In adding clean room space to existing sites, drugmakers and their suppliers have leaned heavily on pre-fabricated wall panels and pods that speed the process, according to specialist companies that build those spaces.
G-CON Manufacturing provided pods to some Warp Speed projects. One contract manufacturer dedicated space to COVID-19 vaccines, and then used G-CON pods to add clean room space for a different project for an existing customer, said Chief Executive Maik Jornitz. 
""It was sort of the only way,"" Peter Walters, director of advanced therapies at CRB, which designs and manages construction of the facilities, said of the pre-fabricated systems. 
CRB has worked on more than 20 coronavirus vaccine-related projects. The program has ""certainly redefined, to a lot of the industry, what could be possible,"" Walters said.
Adding more capacity would help the United States tackle COVID-19 variants and future pandemics, said Prashant Yadav, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Center for Global Development.

Investors purchased $31.4 billion in global equity funds in the week ended Feb.24, which was 17% higher than last week, Lipper data showed.
On the other hand, global bond funds saw their lowest inflow in eight weeks on worries over higher inflation levels.

The bond funds had a net buying of $7.36 billion in the week ended Feb. 24, with money flowing mainly into inflation-protection bond funds and shorter-tenor bond funds. 
Investors bought about $4.7 billion worth of funds that invest in U.S. short-term and medium-term bonds, while funds focused on bonds structured to provide protection against inflation, attracted about $1.5 billion, according to the data.

Among equities, tech funds had their lowest inflow in four weeks, hit by rising U.S. yields. Higher yields lower the present value of future cash flows of growth stocks, making them less attractive.
At the same time, financial sector funds saw their highest inflow in six weeks, boosted by higher yields as it benefits banks' net interest margins.

191,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>",Nasdaq Futures Down 120 Pts; Jobless Claims and GDP Data Due,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq set to underperform as investors digest the latest comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ahead of key economic data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 10 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.4%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 120 points, or 0.9%. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell continued his two day semi-annual testimony on Wednesday, this time to the House of Representatives. He continued to emphasize that the U.S. economy has a long way to go towards recovery, particularly in the labor market, and downplayed the threat of persistently high inflation given the slack in the economy.
The U.S. Treasury 10-year yield has topped 1.45% for the first time since February 2020 on expectations that the additional $1.9 trillion stimulus proposed by the Biden administration, along with the Fed's loose monetary policy, will lead to higher prices.
Household stimulus checks alone could unleash a $170 billion wave of fresh retail inflows to the stock market, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) research note published Wednesday.
But higher rates could also hit the technology sector especially hard, as the valuation models for - often unprofitable - growth stocks tend to be reliant on low discount rates.
With Powell having now completed his testimony, attention is likely to turn to a number of important economic data releases. 
The weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). At the same time the U.S. Department of Commerce will release its second estimate for fourth-quarter GDP, while January durable goods orders are also due.
In terms of earnings releases, the likes of  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) and Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) are due before the opening bell, while Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), HP (NYSE:HPQ) and newly public companies Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) are slated to report after the closing bell.
Oil prices pushed higher Thursday, as reduced levels of U.S. production, on the back of last week’s cold snap in Texas, continued to support the market ahead of next week’s meeting of the globe’s top producers.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is due to meet on March 4. They are likely to discuss an easing of oil supply curbs from April given the recent recovery in prices.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $63.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $66.41. Both contracts climbed to their highest levels since January 2020 earlier in the session.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,785.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.2225.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Google pledges changes to research oversight after internal revolt,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google will change procedures before July for reviewing its scientists' work, according to a town hall recording heard by Reuters, part of an effort to quell internal tumult over the integrity of its artificial intelligence (AI) research.
In remarks at a staff meeting last Friday, Google Research executives said they were working to regain trust after the company ousted two prominent women and rejected their work, according to an hour-long recording, the content of which was confirmed by two sources.
Teams are already trialing a questionnaire that will assess projects for risk and help scientists navigate reviews, research unit Chief Operating Officer Maggie Johnson said in the meeting. This initial change will roll out by the end of the second quarter, and the majority of papers will not require extra vetting, she said.
Reuters reported in December that Google had introduced a ""sensitive topics"" review for studies involving dozens of issues, such as China or bias in its services. Internal reviewers had demanded that at least three papers on AI be modified to refrain from casting Google technology in a negative light, Reuters reported.
Jeff Dean, Google's senior vice president overseeing the division, said Friday that the ""sensitive topics"" review ""is and was confusing"" and that he had tasked a senior research director, Zoubin Ghahramani, with clarifying the rules, according to the recording.
Ghahramani, a University of Cambridge professor who joined Google in September from Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, said during the town hall, ""We need to be comfortable with that discomfort"" of self-critical research.
Google declined to comment on the Friday meeting.
An internal email, seen by Reuters, offered fresh detail on Google researchers' concerns, showing exactly how Google's legal department had modified one of the three AI papers, called ""Extracting Training Data from Large Language Models."" (https:// The email, dated Feb. 8, from a co-author of the paper, Nicholas Carlini, went to hundreds of colleagues, seeking to draw their attention to what he called ""deeply insidious"" edits by company lawyers. ""Let's be clear here,"" the roughly 1,200-word email said. ""When we as academics write that we have a 'concern' or find something 'worrying' and a Google lawyer requires that we change it to sound nicer, this is very much Big Brother stepping in."" Required edits, according to his email, included ""negative-to-neutral"" swaps such as changing the word ""concerns"" to ""considerations,"" and ""dangers"" to ""risks."" Lawyers also required deleting references to Google technology; the authors' finding that AI leaked copyrighted content; and the words ""breach"" and ""sensitive,"" the email said. Carlini did not respond to requests for comment. Google in answer to questions about the email disputed its contention that lawyers were trying to control the paper's tone. The company said it had no issues with the topics investigated by the paper, but it found some legal terms used inaccurately and conducted a thorough edit as a result. RACIAL EQUITY AUDIT Google last week also named Marian Croak, a pioneer in internet audio technology and one of Google's few Black vice presidents, to consolidate and manage 10 teams studying issues such as racial bias in algorithms and technology for disabled individuals. Croak said at Friday's meeting that it would take time to address concerns among AI ethics researchers and mitigate damage to Google's brand. ""Please hold me fully responsible for trying to turn around that situation,"" she said on the recording. Johnson added that the AI organization is bringing in a consulting firm for a wide-ranging racial equity impact assessment. The first-of-its-kind audit for the department would lead to recommendations ""that are going to be pretty hard,"" she said. Tensions in Dean's division had deepened in December after Google let go of Timnit Gebru, co-lead of its ethical AI research team, following her refusal to retract a paper on language-generating AI. Gebru, who is Black, accused the company at the time of reviewing her work differently because of her identity and of marginalizing employees from underrepresented backgrounds. Nearly 2,700 employees signed an open letter in support of Gebru. (https:// During the town hall, Dean elaborated on what scholarship the company would support.  ""We want responsible AI and ethical AI investigations,"" Dean said, giving the example of studying technology's environmental costs. But it is problematic to cite data ""off by close to a factor of a hundred"" while ignoring more accurate statistics as well as Google's efforts to reduce emissions, he said. Dean previously has criticized Gebru's paper for not including important findings on environmental impact. Gebru defended her paper's citation. ""It's a really bad look for Google to come out this defensively against a paper that was cited by so many of their peer institutions,"" she told Reuters. Employees continued to post about their frustrations over the last month on Twitter as Google investigated and then fired ethical AI co-lead Margaret Mitchell for moving electronic files outside the company. Mitchell said on Twitter that she acted ""to raise concerns about race & gender inequity, and speak up about Google's problematic firing of Dr. Gebru."" Mitchell had collaborated on the paper that prompted Gebru's departure, and a version that published online last month without Google affiliation named ""Shmargaret Shmitchell"" as a co-author. (https:// 
Asked for comment, Mitchell expressed through an attorney disappointment in Dean's critique of the paper and said her name was removed following a company order.

194,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>","StockBeat: As Powell Provokes Sighs of Relief, AB Inbev Just Provokes Sighs","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The everything rally is back on. Unless you’re AB Inbev, that is.
Shares in the world’s largest brewer fell 5.4% on Thursday, missing out on a broad rally in global stocks, after investors zeroed in on a couple of nasties in the company’s update for the fourth quarter. AB Inbev (BR:ABI) stock was the worst performer in a Euro Stoxx index that was up 0.2%.
They’re now at their lowest level since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech sparked the big reopening trade with their vaccine news in November, and continuing their long underperformance of rivals Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), Heineken (OTC:HEINY) and Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ).
The brewer of Budweiser and Stella Artois actually reported better-than-expected sales for the quarter, with volume growth of 2.7% and revenue growth of 4.5%, pointing to continued success in squeezing more value out of its premium brands.
It also predicted a “meaningful” improvement in both sales and profit in 2021 as the pandemic ebbs.
However, the market was spooked by a sharp increase in input costs in the fourth quarter, and by the company’s warning that an “adverse channel and packaging mix, coupled with transactional FX and commodity headwinds,” will pressure its profit margins in the current year.
The pandemic hit brewers harder than spirits groups last year, given their greater exposure to sales through bars and restaurants. Customers forced to switch to drinking at home were more likely to stock up on wine and spirits than sit down for a multi-beer session with friends on Zoom.
Beer drunk at home comes from cans and bottles, rather than barrels. That means higher packaging and logistics costs per unit sold and lower margins. A high percentage of beer sales goes to the low-wage demographic that has been worst hit by pandemic, making it harder to pass on cost increases.
Such factors, combined with lower overall operating leverage, pushed the group’s cost of sales up by 7.9% in the fourth quarter.
The particular problem with ABI is that it desperately needs to maintain high underlying profitability to service the debt load that it still carries after its merger with SAB Miller. Net debt rose to 4.8 times EBITDA in 2020, the profit measure that ABI’s investors track most closely, from 4.0 times a year earlier. The group’s target is a multiple of 2.
Nor does it help that 44% of the debt on ABI’s balance sheet is in currencies other than dollars, notably in euros. The high share of local currencies in its revenue mix is a natural hedge but the euro is not weakening in real terms the way that the dollar is. The headwinds can be mitigated, but they won’t go away entirely this year.
After Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spent the last two days reassuring Congress that borrowing costs will stay near zero for another three years, highly-indebted companies – facing a global economic upswing – ought to be those breathing the biggest sighs of relief. Unfortunately for ABI, the sighs are of a very different kind."
195,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 05:45AM ET</span>",GameStop Resurgence Extends as Meme Stock Mania Kicks Up Anew,"(Bloomberg) -- GameStop (NYSE:GME) continued its resurgence in U.S. premarket trading, rising as much as 83% after more than doubling on Wednesday in a move that spread to a host of other meme stocks at the center of last month’s day trader-driven frenzy.
The stock rose as high as $167.50 and traded at $135.57 at 4:15 a.m. in New York. Among other favorites of traders populating Reddit forums, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rose 17% premarket after gaining 59% during the first three days of the week, while  Express Inc  (NYSE:EXPR) surged 26%.
GameStop jumped 104% in Wednesday’s cash session, spurred by a final-hour surge that brought its biggest advance since Jan. 29, the day Robinhood Markets restricted trading in it and 49 other stocks at the height of the frenzy. An equally weighted Bloomberg basket of those rose more than 5%, the most since late January.
The activity inflated trading volumes in the meme stocks and caused an outage on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, the hub of the January volatility.
“It seems like the Reddit crowd is still active and when you see a bit of news like that they’re pressing again,” Keith Gangl, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, said in a phone interview. “Though I’m not sure how that’ll last,” he added.
The sudden revival in left-for-dead stocks recalled an episode last month that captured the attention of Wall Street, regulators and eventually Congress, as members of Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum egged on retail hordes in an attempt to take on professional short sellers.
Various explanations circulated as to what spurred the rallies. The GameStop frenzy came after Bloomberg News reported late Tuesday that Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell was pushed out in a disagreement over strategy to make way for an executive more in line with the vision of activist investor and board member Ryan Cohen, the co-founder of online pet-food retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY). His addition to the board in early January underpinned the first flurry of moves in the stock after capturing the attention of WallStreetBets.
The clearinghouse whose demands for increased margin collateral from Robinhood forced the brokerage to restrict trading last month published a white paper Wednesday that laid the grounds for speeding up the stock settlement process. It proposed cutting settlement to one day from two, prompting some chest puffing among the retail crowd on Reddit.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 05:41AM ET</span>","AstraZeneca says it will have no vaccine supply shortfall in second quarter, EU wary","MILAN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) will deliver 180 million COVID-19 vaccines to Europe in the second quarter, including 20 million to Italy, the head of its Italian unit was quoted as saying on Thursday, but EU officials remained wary about supply.
Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing an EU official directly involved in talks with the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, that AstraZeneca expected to deliver less than half the COVID-19 vaccines it was contracted to supply the European Union in the second quarter.
Lorenzo Wittum, CEO and chairman of AstraZeneca in Italy, told daily Il Corriere della Sera that Italy would receive more than 5 million shots by the end of March, fewer than the 8 million previously agreed, leading to a total of 25 million doses by June.
The Italian health ministry on February 12 revised its vaccination plan, lowering its expected doses from AstraZeneca in the second quarter to about 10 million from 18 million seen in a provisional plan in January. 
In a statement on Tuesday the company said it aimed to deliver 180 million doses to the EU in the second quarter, half from factories outside Europe.
""AstraZeneca is behaving like an unreliable second-hand car salesman. Getting reliable data from this company is still a challenge,"" said EU lawmaker Esther de Lange, vice president of the European People's Party, the largest in the EU Parliament, questioning the firm's supply network after the announcement of deliveries from outside Europe.
The EU official involved in talks with the company said AstraZeneca had provided no clarity on which global sites would supply the EU and whether export restrictions and regulatory issues could hamper supply.
The official said the announcements needed to be fleshed out with concrete commitments to be deemed credible. 
A Commission spokesman said on Thursday that the EU was talking with the company to ensure ""timely deliveries of sufficient number of doses.""

Even if AstraZeneca delivered 180 million doses in the second quarter, it would still miss its contractual obligations to deliver 300 million shots by the end of June if it does not ramp up supplies in the first quarter which have been cut to 40 million doses from 90 million, and deliver 30 million doses due from December.

(Reuters) - St. James's Place expects funds under management to surge more than 50% to top 200 billion pounds ($283 billion) by the end of 2025 as low savings rates and an ageing population boost demand for the British wealth manager's services.
The forecast came as the company posted a 75% surge in 2020 pretax profit, with funds under management reaching a record 129.3 billion pounds from 117 billion a year earlier.
After suffering hefty outflows at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, wealth managers have had a strong run as markets bounced back, helped by trillions of dollars in government stimulus steps and optimism over vaccination rollouts.
St. James's Place (SJP) said it made pretax profit of 327.6 million pounds last year, up from 187.1 million in 2019.
It set a full-year dividend of 38.49 pence per share, versus 49.71 pence in 2019, and said the final dividend from 2019 that was withheld during the first peak of the pandemic would be paid as an interim dividend during the first quarter of 2021.
'ADVICE GAP'
Chief executive Andrew Croft said the company was confident of delivering 10% growth per annum in new business.
""We live in a complex world, people needing advice and needing to save for their own retirement, people living longer ... We are at unbelievably low interest rates, some people say it might even go negative,"" he told Reuters.
""There is a very large inter-generational transfer of wealth in the pipeline in the UK as well. There is an advice gap in the UK, there are not enough advisers to meet the demand.""
Still, SJP, which is cutting 200 jobs to simplify its business, said the environment remained challenging due to coronavirus lockdowns, despite moderate growth in new business in the early weeks of 2021.
""There remains difficult months ahead but as COVID-19 restrictions ease, we are hopeful there will be an economic recovery and we will see a return to more normal growth in new client investments,"" it said.

Investing the state's revenues from oil and gas production and managed by a unit of Norway's central bank, the Government Pension Fund Global is one of the world's largest investors in equities, bonds and real estate. 
It holds stakes in around 9,100 companies worldwide and has set the pace on a host of issues in the field of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG).
""We are seeing substantial improvements in companies' reporting on climate change across almost all industries. In 2020, almost 42% of the companies had very good reporting and 24% had good reporting,"" the fund's management arm, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), said in an annual report on responsible investments. 
""In general, we saw better reporting on governance and risk management processes than on strategies and metrics.""
Sector-wise, companies in telecommunications, personal and household goods, and healthcare had the best reporting overall, the fund said.
The reporting of companies in construction and building materials, insurance, oil and gas, and industrial goods and services was ""generally weaker"", it said. 
DIALOGUE
The fund primarily focuses on dialogue with companies to push its priorities. In 2020 fund officials held 2,877 meetings with 1,209 companies, mainly digitally due to the coronavirus pandemic, it said.
It initiated a dialogue with 16 banks on how to manage climate risk in their lending and financing portfolios, the fund said. 
In the report, the fund highlighted that it had addressed bank-financed emissions with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd, the environmental impact of the fashion industry with Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and how to produce cement with fewer emissions at HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG).

LONDON (Reuters) - Aston Martin expects to almost double sales and move back towards profitability this year after sinking deeper into the red in 2020, when the luxury carmaker was hit by the pandemic, changed its boss and was forced to raise cash.
The British company's shares jumped 9% in early Thursday trading after it kept a forecast for around 6,000 sales to dealers this year as new management turns around its performance.
The carmaker of choice for fictional secret agent James Bond has had a tough time since floating in 2018, as it failed to meet expectations and burnt through cash, prompting it to seek fresh investment from billionaire Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll.
The firm made a 466-million pound ($660 million) loss last year, compared with a 120 million pound loss in 2019, as sales to dealers fell by 42% to 3,394 vehicles, hit by the closure of showrooms and factories due to COVID-19. 
For 2021, it expects ""to see the first steps towards improved profitability"" but is still likely to post a pre-tax loss, the carmaker said.
""I am extremely pleased with the progress to date despite operating in these most challenging of times,"" Stroll said. 
Aston said demand for its first sport utility vehicle, the DBX, which rolled off the production line at its Welsh plant in 2020, was strong in a lucrative segment of the market it entered to widen its appeal. 
The model accounted for 1,516 of deliveries to dealers last year and the company expects further growth in its first full-year of sales, including in the key market of China, where rivals such as Bentley are also seeing high demand. 
""We had not even a half-year DBX production in wholesome so probably we are going to see over-proportional growth in China,"" Chief Executive Tobias Moers, who took over in August, told Reuters.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) PLC on Thursday restored its dividend and reaffirmed its long-term profit goals, in a show of confidence about its ability to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic even as its annual profit more than halved. 
The Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused bank however warned that income in 2021 is likely to be close to last year, showing the challenge it faces to meet its modest profit goals in a world of rock-bottom interest rates.
Boosting revenue has been Chief Executive Bill Winters' main headache in recent years, as slowing growth in many of the bank's key markets, a commodities downturn and low central bank rates all conspired to crush income.
The bank's shares fell 5% in London, as investors looked past the restoration of its dividend to the lender's longer-term challenges in growing income. 
StanChart like rival HSBC said it is targeting affluent customers, especially in Asian markets, to try and boost its flagging profit, hoping to earn more fees from wealth management products to offset flat-lining lending returns.
Winters said he has no plans to leave the bank, pushing back on some media speculation he would look to leave soon after six years at the helm.
""I'm here to do a job, and the job is not yet done,"" he told reporters on a conference call. 
The London-headquartered lender also said it would return capital to investors via a 9 cents per share dividend and $254 million buyback, with the total payout being the maximum allowed under temporary 'guardrails' set by the Bank of England.
The central bank last year told Britain's largest lenders to suspend dividend payments and share buybacks for 2020 to help them maintain capital buffers against an expected hit to loan books from the pandemic.
""Having now resumed it, we expect to be able to increase the full-year dividend per share over time as we execute our strategy and progress towards a 10% return on tangible equity,"" Jose Vinals, Standard Chartered's chairman, said.
The bank also said its return on tangible equity, a key profit metric, would climb from 3% to 7% by 2023.
Analysts at Citi said that the 10% target was achievable if StanChart stayed at the top end of its revenue growth ambitions. 
However they described the bank's fourth-quarter results as ""underwhelming"" in the ""context of other UK listed banks, who have largely reported strong results."" 
StanChart's share performance has in recent years been closely tied to global interest rates, as banks struggle to make returns on loans with base rates near zero.

BAD LOANS RISE
StanChart posted a 57% fall in annual profit for 2020, missing analyst estimates, on higher bad loan charges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Its pretax profit was $1.61 billion, compared with $3.71 billion in 2019 and the $1.85 billion average of analyst forecasts compiled by the bank.
Credit impairments last year more than doubled compared with a year earlier to $2.3 billion because of the pandemic, the bank said, but noted that two thirds of these charges were taken in the first half of the year.
However, in common with U.S. and European peers, StanChart saw strong performance from its investment bank, as pandemic-related market volatility in 2020 drove frenzied trading. 
Income in its financial markets division rose 18%, driven by a 53% increase in income from trading interest rate-related products.

StanChart, which has gone further than many other lenders in saying it will make permanent the flexible working arrangements introduced during the pandemic, also said it could cut a third of its office space in the next three to four years.

The spin-off plan, announced earlier this month, should make the unit more agile, profitable and able to develop CO2-neutral drive technologies for trucks and buses, Daimler said in a statement.
Daimler said the truck business had seen a recovery in the fourth quarter, especially in North America and Europe, selling 121,000 units, almost double that of the second quarter, when sales were hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

For 2021, Daimler Trucks forecasts revenue to be significantly above the prior-year level and is aiming for a significant increase in adjusted return on sales to 6-7%, up from 2% in 2020.

Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) stock fell 3.9% after the German pharmaceutical and chemical conglomerate posted a 78% fall in fourth-quarter net profit and cut its dividend by around one third, while  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) stock fell 4.7% after the U.K.-based bank reported a sharp drop in annual profit even as it restored its dividend.
On the flip side,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) stock rose 4.4% after the mining giant enjoyed a strong end to 2020, helped by rising prices of key commodities, and AXA (PA:AXAF) stock rose 2.2% after the French insurer proposed a dividend even as its 2020 earnings were hard hit by the pandemic.
Additionally,  Aston Martin  (LON:AML) stock soared 10% after the carmaker predicted a brighter 2021 after a deep loss in 2020 when it raised fresh funding and changed boss to cope with the year’s difficult conditions.
Global equities were boosted by Fed chief Jerome Powell  calming fears that higher inflation rates could see the central bank tighten monetary policy, reiterating the central bank’s desire to get the U.S. economy back to full employment.
This dovish tone was matched Thursday by European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel, who stated in an interview that raising interest rates too abruptly could jeopardize economic recovery.
Looking at economic data, German consumer confidence improved in March, as shoppers in Europe's largest economy became more upbeat that a lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic could be eased soon. The GfK German consumer climate index came in at -12.9 in March, an improvement from -15.5 the previous month.
Oil prices pushed higher Thursday, as reduced levels of U.S. production, on the back of last week’s cold snap in Texas, continued to support the market ahead of next week’s meeting of the globe’s top producers.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is due to meet on March 4. They are likely to discuss an easing of oil supply curbs from April given the recent recovery in prices.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 02:55AM ET</span>",Munich Re 2020 profit plunges 55% as pandemic takes toll,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German reinsurance group Munich Re expects net profit to bounce back this year after more than halving in 2020 as the coronavirus crisis helped drive claims to a near-decade high.
Major losses in 2020 for the virus and natural catastrophes totalled 4.689 billion euros ($5.71 billion), the highest level since 2011, when the firm had to make payouts for a tsunami in Japan, major earthquakes in New Zealand and the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig.
Pandemic-related claims alone amounted to more than 3.4 billion euros. 
(Graphic: Profit plunge: 2020 marked the most major losses since 2011, https://graphics.reuters.com/MUNICHRE-RESULTS/gjnpwzklrvw/chart.png)
""In spite of the tremendous challenges posed by COVID-19, Munich Re closed out 2020 with a clear profit,"" Chief Executive Joachim Wenning said.
Net profit of 1.211 billion euros compares with 2.707 billion euros a year earlier, and is slightly below a consensus forecast of 1.261 billion euros. 
Munich Re said it expects profit to rebound to 2.8 billion euros in 2021. 
The insurance industry has faced large claims from the pandemic, such as those for cancelled events and postponed events including the Olympics, as well as losses from hurricanes and wildfires in the United States. 
The virus uncertainty prompted the company to refrain from providing a full-year profit target and it will no longer insure against events cancelled due to pandemics.

Munich Re's results, while weaker in the aftermath of the virus, contrast favourably with those of competitor Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY), which posted a full-year loss of $878 million, its first loss since the financial crisis in 2008.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Dow Inc is adjusting its carbon footprint and product slate to adapt to climate change and tap evolving consumption trends tied to the global energy transition, a senior executive said this week.
Dow has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050 by boosting the use of renewable energy, such as wind power in the southern United States, and by improving energy efficiency at its petrochemical plants, Dow's Asia Pacific President Jon Penrice told Reuters on Wednesday.
It is also developing products that help customers cut their own emissions such as sealants that improve heating efficiencies in buildings, materials to lighten electric vehicles and make batteries more efficient, he said.
""We actually see climate change as something that's very likely to happen, high probability and high impact,"" Penrice said.
""It's going to be a big opportunity I think for many, many players in the petrochemical industry.""
GREEN PUSH
Dow launched its MobilityScience platform last year aimed at tapping the ""lightweighting"" push among car manufacturers seeking to increase the range and lower the power needs of electric vehicles (EV). 
""We have global sales today of 3 million (EVs), which is only 4% of the global market, but that's growing extremely fast in Asia Pacific, mainly in China, but also around the rest of the world now,"" Penrice said.
""You have to redesign everything from lighter weight materials, longer-range performance, battery materials, comfort and safety in the car, and overall a lower carbon footprint.""
Dow is collaborating with traditional original equipment manufacturers and EV startups in China, Penrice said.
Dow has also targeted the wind energy sector with materials that toughen wind turbine blades which are now four- to five-times longer than before, and using coatings to make them resistant to icing during winter, he added.
The company is also designing products geared towards a circular economy, such as single-layer food packaging that can be more easily recycled. 
DEMAND RECOVERY
Dow, the third-largest petrochemical producer after BASF and Sinopec (NYSE:SHI), saw strong sales of packaging and home care products last year, boosted by demand for cleaning and takeaway food during the pandemic lockdowns, Penrice said.
That lifted the company's sales to $10.7 billion in the fourth quarter, 4.7% higher than the same quarter in 2019, although annual sales fell 10.5% from a year earlier to $38.5 billion in 2020.
China is expected to remain the main growth engine in Asia, but Japan, South Korea and some Southeast Asian markets could see double-digit increases in gross domestic product from a low base last year, Penrice said.
""We've seen a broader-based recovery now in markets related to things that were very weak last year, like automotive demand which has recovered,"" he said, noting that China's car sales have risen for six months in a row.

Home improvement products such as building coatings, sealants, appliances and furniture have also seen a ""strong boom"" as consumers spend disposable income, he said.

210,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",United 777 plane flew fewer than half the flights allowed between checks: sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A United Airlines plane with a Pratt & Whitney engine that failed on Saturday had flown fewer than half the flights allowed by U.S. regulators between fan blade inspections, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 777 plane had flown nearly 3,000 cycles, equivalent to one take-off and landing, which compares to the checks every 6,500 cycles mandated after a separate United engine incident in 2018, said the sources.
They sought anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly. United declined to comment.
Pratt, the maker of the PW4000 engines, advised airlines on Monday to step up checks to every 1,000 cycles, in a bulletin seen by Reuters. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it was ordering immediate inspections of 777 planes with PW4000 engines before they could return to flight, going further than Pratt.
The engines are used on 128 older versions of the plane, accounting for less than 10% of the more than 1,600 777s delivered and only a handful of airlines in the United States, South Korea and Japan were operating them recently.
Japan and South Korea have also grounded the planes for fan blade checks.
On Monday, the FAA acknowledged that after a Japan Airlines (JAL) PW4000 engine incident in December it had been considering stepping up blade inspections that use thermal acoustic imaging to find signs of metal fatigue.
A risk-assessment meeting was held last week to discuss the issue before the United engine failed on Saturday, one of the sources said, confirming an earlier report by CNN. No decision had been imminent ahead of the United incident, the source added.
A spokeswoman for Pratt, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), said on Wednesday that fan blades would need to be shipped to its repair station in East Hartford, Connecticut, for the latest inspections, including those from Japan and South Korea.
Each engine has 22 blades that must be removed individually and each will take eight hours to inspect, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.
That is the equivalent of 352 hours of work per plane, as each 777 has two engines. Boeing said 69 of the planes were in active service before Saturday's incident, while 59 had been grounded amid low demand during the pandemic.
Pratt did not respond to questions about how many engines it could inspect per month. United has not commented on how long it expects the inspections to take, while JAL and ANA Holdings said the timing was unclear.

 “Our policy is accommodative because unemployment is high and the labor market is far from maximum employment,"" Powell said on Wednesday, as he appeared in front of the House Financial Services Committee.
This dovish tone was matched Thursday by European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel, who stated in an interview that raising interest rates too abruptly could jeopardise economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Wednesday at a record high on Wall Street. Asian markets also strengthened Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei gaining 1.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 1.5%. 
It’s also a busy day for earnings releases in Europe.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) will be in the spotlight after the U.K.-based bank Thursday restored its dividend and reaffirmed its long-term profit goals even as its annual profit more than halved.
The likes of the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, French water management company Veolia (PA:VIE), French insurer AXA (PA:AXAF), German pharmaceutical giant Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) will all be in focus as they report.
Looking at economic data, German consumer confidence improved in March, admittedly from a low base. The GfK German consumer climate index came in at -12.9 in March, an improvement from -15.5 the previous month.
Oil prices pushed higher Thursday, as reduced levels of U.S. production continued to support the market ahead of next week’s meeting of the globe’s top producers.
Last week’s cold snap in Texas, and other southern states, caused U.S. crude production to drop by more than 10%, or 1 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Administration said late Wednesday, while the volume of crude processed by refineries dropped to the lowest level since September 2008.

TOKYO/MIAMI (Reuters) - Global stocks jumped on Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed interest rates would stay low for a long time, calming market fears that higher inflation might prompt the central bank to tighten monetary policy.
Powell's reassurance gave a fresh impetus to reflation trades and boosted risk asset prices while also driving U.S. bond yields back up to one-year highs.
European stocks are expected to open higher, with Euro Stoxx 50 futures and FTSE futures both up about 0.6%.
In Asia, MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index rose 1.5% while Japan's Nikkei gained 1.7%.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.5% to pare more than half of its previous day's losses following the announcement of a stamp duty hike.
In a second day of testimony in Washington, Powell reiterated the Fed's promise to get the U.S. economy back to full employment and to not worry about inflation unless prices rose in a persistent and troubling way.
""Powell said it will take three years for them to achieve its inflation target, essentially reaffirming the Fed will not raise interest rates until 2023,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""A huge amount of cash investors have to work is flowing into the stock market, and that is more than offsetting any negative aspects of higher bond yields.""
The prospects of a prolonged period of low interest rates came as investors expect a huge U.S. fiscal stimulus and a progress in COVID-19 vaccinations to shore up the economy, especially the sectors hit the hardest by the pandemic.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-dose COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, paving the way for its approval for emergency use as soon as this week. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average jumped 1.35% to a record high, outperforming 1.0% gains in tech-heavy Nasdaq, as investors rotated into cyclical shares out of flying-tech firms.
In a possible sign of a fresh frenzy in meme shares, GameStop (NYSE:GME) rose 83.3% in extended trade, building on a gain of 103.9% on Wednesday.
U.S. bond prices stayed under pressure, boosting their yields to the highest level in a year.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to 1.412%, having hit a high of 1.435% on Wednesday.
""I wouldn't say there is a panic in the bond market. But we have a coronavirus package worthy of $1.5, $1.7 or $1.9 trillion. And in addition, there will be infrastructure spending as well. Investors see few reasons to buy bonds aggressively now,"" said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of Japan rates research at J.P.Morgan.
A closely watched part of the U.S. yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes rose to 127.4 basis points, near its 2016 peak of around 136 hit after Donald Trump's surprise election victory.
In the currency market, the safe-haven U.S. dollar languished near three-year lows versus riskier currencies as continued dovish signals from the Fed stoked reflation bets.
The Australian dollar hit a three-year high of $0.7978 while the Canadian dollar also hit a three-year high of C$1.2503 per U.S. dollar.
The euro firmed slightly to touch a one-month high of $1.2183 while the safe-have yen was on the back foot at 105.93 per dollar. 
Investors' strong risk appetite boosted many commodities.
Copper price jumped 3% to its highest level in almost a decade and could log its biggest monthly gains in 15 years.
Crude oil climbed to fresh 13-month highs after U.S. government data showed a drop in crude output as a deep freeze disrupted production last week.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The bull-run in global stocks fuelled by cheap cash and reflation hopes will continue for at least another six months but a rise in bond yields as inflation expectations grow could throw a spanner in the works, Reuters polls found.
Despite severe economic damage from the pandemic, MSCI's global stock index -- which tracks shares across 49 countries -- notched up all-time highs this month, having risen over 70% since hitting rock-bottom in late March amid ample liquidity from central banks and massive fiscal stimulus.
In recent trading sessions, world stocks have pulled back as a rapid surge in global bond yields raises expectations that major central banks could eventually turn less accommodative in a bid to tame inflation.
But even as a gauge of equities slipped this week on hints of rising inflation led by higher oil prices and the strongest copper price in nearly a decade, the Feb. 12-24 polls of nearly 300 equity strategists found the trend of stock market gains was set to continue this year. 
All 17 major stock indexes polled on by Reuters, from Tokyo to Toronto, were expected to end 2021 higher from here, with nine predicted to extend their record-setting rallies.
Fifteen of those indexes have already breached the mid-2021 consensus level and 10 indexes are above the end-2021 median level predicted in the previous poll in November.
In response to an additional question, over two-thirds, or 79 of 111 analysts, said the run-up in global stocks would continue for at least another six months, including 58 who said over a year.
""It's the health-crisis nature of this recession that has led to the greatest monetary and fiscal policy response in history. It's not that people are so bullish about the future but rather they are flush with cash and the excitement of making money,"" said Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""Our advice here is to take pause and observe a bit as these excesses are wrung out; but bear in mind we are at the beginning of a new economic cycle and that usually means a multi-year bull market has begun."" 
With over 65%, or 72 of 110 strategists who responded to a separate question, expecting corporate earnings to return to pre-COVID-19 levels within a year, stock markets from developed to emerging were forecast to rally through 2021. [EPOLL/JP][EPOLL/IN][EPOLL/RU][EPOLL/EU][EPOLL/BR][EPOLL/US][EPOLL/CA]
""In some sectors and markets, corporate earnings are now above their pre-virus levels, whereas in the energy sector and some of the other badly hit sectors they are still below,"" noted Simona Gambarini, a markets economist at Capital Economics.
""That is why we think the next leg-up in equity markets will coincide with a rotation towards coronavirus-vulnerable sectors.""
But concerns were growing for a significant market correction as surging U.S. Treasury yields on rising inflation prospects have triggered caution over pricey equity valuations.
Those fears have already hit shares of high-flying growth companies and top technology-related firms, which were at the heart of a stunning rally that drove major indexes to record levels.
That was also reflected in a market gauge of inflation expectations, the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities' (TIPS) break-even rate, which has risen this month, with the yield on 30-year U.S. TIPS rising above zero for the first time since June.
When asked about the likelihood of a significant correction -- commonly defined as a fall of 10% or more -- in stock markets in the next six months, 87 of 115 respondents said it was ""likely"", including 27 who said ""very likely"".
""Yes, there are those pesky rising long-bond yields that could, like an overlooked reactor vent, be the fatal flaw in the blueprints that blow everything up,"" said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank.
""But let's overlook that systemic risk ... After all, central banks can always adopt yield curve control if needed and take away that market function -- striking it down and seeing it disappear without shoes or underpants left as reminders.""

214,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 01:20AM ET</span>",Southeast Asia's biggest travel app plans regional fintech expansion before 2021 listing,"By Fanny Potkin and Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Traveloka, Southeast Asia's largest online travel startup, plans to launch financial services in Thailand and Vietnam as it eyes a U.S. listing through a blank-cheque company, its president said. 
The 9-year-old Indonesian company, which counts  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) and China's JD (NASDAQ:JD).com among its backers, is seeing a strong rebound in its business after the COVID-19 pandemic pummelled demand. 
The company's president, Caesar Indra, told Reuters in an interview that Traveloka's Vietnam business had surpassed pre-COVID-19 levels, is nearly back to normal levels in Thailand, and is at half of pre-COVID level in Indonesia. ""The worst has happened and now we're well prepared for 2021. Domestic travel is driving recovery,"" he said. 
""The plan is to invest in fintech in a big way to allow more consumers to travel in the region,"" Indra said, adding that the travel business had returned to profitability in late 2020. 
Traveloka, which says it has 40 million active monthly users, is developing ""buy now, pay later"" services for Thailand and Vietnam markets. 
""We recently formed a joint venture with one of the largest banks in Thailand to collaborate in the fintech space,"" Indra said. Traveloka, which has smaller local rivals, is also talking to potential partners in Vietnam, but Indra declined to name the parties. 
Traveloka's two-year old equivalent service in Indonesia, launched after the firm realised that customers would wait until their paydays to book travel, has already facilitated more than 6 million loans, Indra said. 
Last year, Traveloka launched ""Paylater"" credit cards with some Indonesian lenders. It also offers insurance and wealth management services. 
Indra said the business potential was huge in Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, where only 6% of the population of 270 million has credit cards. 
When asked whether Traveloka might buy a bank in Indonesia, like other start-ups, to expand its financial services, Indra said, ""all options were on the table."" 
Traveloka, also backed by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and Indonesian venture firm East Ventures, has grown its local lifestyle services in Indonesia, where it offers restaurant vouchers and a food delivery service, as well as a popular rapid COVID-19 testing.
Indra said the company is Indonesia's largest restaurant review app. 
Traveloka, which has been preparing for a listing, is holding discussions with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, for a U.S. listing. 
""U.S. markets have become more appealing because there's more and more appreciation of Southeast Asia as a flourishing region, and by listing in the U.S, we can also provide an opportunity for U.S investors to become part of Southeast Asia's growth story,"" Indra said. 
Many SPACs, exchange-listed shell companies that raise money through IPOs and merge with firms by enticing them with shorter listing timelines, have approached Southeast Asian startups. 

Bridgetown Holdings, backed by Asian tycoon Richard Li, Provident Acquisition and Cova Acquisition are contenders for Traveloka, with a potential valuation of up to $5 billion for the startup, a source said. The firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment made outside normal U.S. business hours. Indra declined to comment but said an Indonesian listing remained an option.

""Events since the February 1 coup, including deadly violence, have precipitated a need for this ban,"" Facebook said in a blog post. ""We believe the risks of allowing the Tatmadaw (Myanmar army) on Facebook and Instagram are too great.""
The army seized power this month after alleging fraud in a Nov. 8 election swept by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD), detaining her and much of the party leadership.
At least three protesters and one policeman have been killed in violence at rallies.
The U.S tech giant said it would also ban all ""Tadmadaw-linked commercial entities"" from advertising on its platforms.
It said the decision to ban the Myanmar army came due to ""exceptionally severe human rights abuses and the clear risk of future military-initiated violence in Myanmar"", as well as the army's repeated history of violating Facebook's rules, including since the coup.
The military government could not immediately be reached for comment.
Facbook is widely used in Myanmar and has been one of the ways the junta has communicated with people, despite an official move to ban on the platform in the early days of the coup.
Facebook in recent years has engaged with civil rights activists and democratic political parties in Myanmar and pushed back against the military after facing international criticism for failing to contain online hate campaigns.
In 2018, it banned army chief Min Aung Hlaing - now the military ruler - and 19 other senior officers and organisations, and took down hundreds of pages and accounts run by military members for coordinated inauthentic behaviour.
Ahead of November elections, Facebook announced it had taken down a network of 70 fake accounts and pages operated by members of the military that had posted either positive content about the army or criticism of Suu Kyi and her party.

The platform said on Thursday there had been attempts to rebuild army-run networks it had previously removed.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 11:40PM ET</span>","Boeing working with regulators, customers on return of 737 MAX in Asia: executive","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is working with regulators and customers to return the 737 MAX to the skies in Asia, a senior executive said on Thursday, where it remains grounded nearly two years after two deadly crashes even though it has returned in other markets.
""We're continuing to work with global regulators and our customers to return the 737 MAX to service worldwide,"" Boeing Vice President Commercial Marketing Darren Hulst told reporters during a briefing on the Southeast Asian market. ""But we are going to defer to regulators individually for more information on the timing of recertification by domicile.""
Regulators in the United States, Europe, Britain, Canada, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates are among those that have already approved the jet's return to flight following technical modifications and additional pilot training. 
Ten airlines are now operating the MAX with more than 13,500 flight hours since the return to service, Hulst said.
So far, all Asian countries have held off from approving the MAX's return, though Boeing said last month it expected to win remaining global regulatory approvals in the first half of 2021.
China was the first country globally to ban the MAX from its airspace in 2019 and it has not indicated when it will lift the ban. 
Airlines in China, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, India and Fiji operated the MAX before the groundings, with the first crash having occurred in Indonesia in October 2018 followed by one in Ethiopia in March 2019.
Hulst said he remained optimistic about demand for the MAX in the Southeast Asia as part of its broader 20-year demand forecast. It sees demand for 4,400 planes between 2020 and 2039 worth $700 billion at list prices.

That compares to its prior forecast for 4,500 new planes valued at $710 billion between 2019 and 2038, which was made before the coronavirus pandemic led to a plunge in demand for travel.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up Thursday morning, boosted by a bond selloff and reassurance from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that interest rates would remain low.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.66% by 10:38 PM ET (3:38 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 2.53%. In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 1%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 2.11%. Financial secretary Paul Chan handed down the city’s budget on Wednesday, with eligible residents to receive HK$5,000 ($644.77) in digital coupons. Chan also raised the stamp duty for stock transactions to 0.13% from the previous 0.1%.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 1.07% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.78%.
Powell’s comments during a second day of testimony before Congress on Wednesday, helped calm fears that higher inflation rates could see the central bank tighten monetary policy.
He pointed out the long road ahead for the U.S. economic recovery and that signs of prices rising would not necessarily lead to persistently high inflation, telling the House Financial Services Committee, “Our policy is accommodative because unemployment is high and the labor market is far from maximum employment.""
“The dovish influence from the Fed is going to continue to resonate over in Asia. That’s really good for emerging market assets when we’ve got a really good impulse from the Fed,” Axi chief global markets strategist Stephen Innes told Reuters.
On the COVID-19 vaccines front, results from an Israeli study published and peer-reviewed in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday gave investors sentiment a boost. The study showed that two doses of the  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) COVID-19 vaccine cut symptomatic COVID-19 cases by 94% across all age groups, and severe illnesses by nearly as much.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also said on Wednesday that Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) one-dose COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in clinical trials, with emergency use approval potentially coming by the end of the week.
Investors are analyzing the market implications of a faster-than expected recovery, as “the combination of pent-up demand, with the stimulus checks on top of that, could lift inflation,” Barclays’ head of global inflation market strategy Michael Pond told Bloomberg.
However, investors will also have to analyze a new variant of the COVID-19 virus that is on the rise in New York City. The new variant, known as B.1.526, shares some similarities with the more transmissible variant discovered in South Africa and was first identified in November 2020. The NYC variant represented around 12% of all cases by mid-February, researchers at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said on Wednesday."
219,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 09:20PM ET</span>",European stocks set for record highs in 2021: Reuters poll,"By Julien Ponthus and Danilo Masoni
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - A rebound in corporate profits is expected to send European stocks to record highs by the end of 2021, a year during which massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and COVID-19 vaccines will back the recovery of the continent's economy.
A Reuters poll of 24 fund managers, strategists and brokers surveyed over the past two weeks foresaw the pan-European STOXX 600 index reclaiming levels last seen before the 2020 pandemic market crash and climbing to 440 points by year's end.
Based on Tuesday's close of 411.32 points, that would represent a 7% gain for the benchmark which, unlike its Wall Street peers, has struggled to keep up with the rally in global equity markets. 
While the MSCI's global stock index has been regularly reaching records since August, European stocks have failed to return to February 2020 highs.
European economies are reopening only gradually, largely because of the slow roll-out of vaccines, but the poll's forecast for the end of 2021 is 10 points higher than it was in November.
A gradual improvement in corporate profits is expected to help push European shares back up to pre-COVID 19 levels and then scale new highs. 
The fourth-quarter earnings season has been promising so far. Some 68% of results beat estimates, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data. 
Over the last month, analysts have revised their fourth-quarter profit forecasts for companies listed on the STOXX 600 to a decline 16.5% year-on-year from more than 23%. 
""We expect earnings dynamics to continue positively"", said Philipp Lisibach, chief global strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Zurich. ""The vaccine rollout over the course of 2021 will allow business activity to normalize also in sectors that are most severely affected.""
From 2021, European companies are expected to rebound, with profits jumping 38.4% in the first quarter and 78.1% in the second.
Others worry that markets have been overly optimistic in pricing the recovery. 
""It seems market participants are being too complacent and buying into the global economic recovery narrative, even though loads of bankruptcies and rising unemployment rates should be expected,"" said Stephane Ekolo, global equity strategist at Tradition in London. 
With a target of 400 points for the end of 2021, Ekolo doesn't see any upside for the STOXX 600 this year.
Other factors that could affect equity markets are a sudden burst of inflation lifting yields on risk-free government bonds and making stocks less attractive, Ekolo added. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research has warned an inflation surprise would put the upside for European stocks at risk.
Fears central banks might need to tighten their accommodative policies or even just signal their intention of doing so could lead to a burst of volatility.
Going forward, equity portfolio managers will need to balance between stocks that typically benefit from rising rates, growth and inflation, like banks, and those, like tech, that have prospered in a low-growth, low-interest-rate environment. 
According to the poll, the UK's top FTSE 100 share index was expected to reach 7,025 points by the end of 2021, up 6.0% from Tuesday's close. 

France's CAC 40 was expected to gain 4.1% to 6,019 points, Italy's FTSE MIB to rise 7.0% to 24,550 points and Spain's IBEX to rise 4.8% to 8,650 points. Germany's industrials-heavy DAX index was expected to rise 5.7% to 14,650 points.

(Reuters) - ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc said on Wednesday it expects to reach as many as 75 million global streaming subscribers by the end of 2024, with global streaming revenue to rise to more than $7 billion by that time.
""This is a ViacomCBS that is being reimagined for a new kind of marketplace and a new kind of consumer,"" said Chair Shari Redstone.
In a presentation to investors after releasing fourth-quarter results, the company laid out plans for its Paramount+ streaming service.
The home to MTV, Nickelodeon and Showtime is launching the service - an expanded version of its existing CBS All Access streamer - on March 4 with a $9.99 per month ad-free version and in June with a $4.99 ad-supported version.
In its fourth-quarter results, ViacomCBS said it had amassed 30 million global paid subscribers to All Access and other streaming properties, including 19.2 million U.S. subscribers.
Paramount+ will be competing in a crowded streaming landscape dominated by Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), which has 200 million subscribers, and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+, with 94.9 million subscribers.
CBS launched All Access in 2014. The company's 2019 merger with Viacom, a sister company also controlled by the Redstone family, allowed for more content on the service, including films from Paramount Pictures. Paramount+ will have more than 2500 movies.
ViacomCBS hopes to distinguish Paramount+ from other streaming services through an emphasis on live sports and news. It will launch Paramount+ in the United States, Canada and Latin America on March 4; in the Nordics on March 25, and in Australia in mid-2021.
On Wednesday Chief Executive Bob Bakish said that in 2021, Paramount+ will debut 36 original series across different genres.
The company will be bringing back the music documentary series ""Behind the Music"" to Paramount+, as well as ""Frasier,"" the final season of ""Younger"" and a new weekly show hosted by Trevor Noah, among other programming. 
Some new Paramount films will go exclusively to Paramount+ 30 to 45 days after theatrical release, Bakish said. All other new Paramount movies will appear on Paramount+ after their theatrical release, some as early as 90 days.
""Mission: Impossible 7"" will debut in theaters on Nov. 19 and debut on Paramount+ 45 days later. ""A Quiet Place II"" will also come to Paramount+ 45 days after its theatrical release. The rest of Paramount's 2021 film slate will be coming to Paramount+ in 2022.
The company posted lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, as the COVID-19 pandemic delayed content production and cut film revenue, despite steady demand for its streaming services.
Revenue rose 3% to $6.87 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Wall Street's consensus was $6.89 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said not all analysts factored in the pending sale of its publishing division Simon & Schuster, which was agreed in the fourth quarter and was treated as a discontinued operation.
Net earnings attributable to ViacomCBS were $783 million, or $1.26 per share, compared with a loss of $302 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, ViacomCBS earned $1.04 per share, slightly above estimates of $1.02.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 08:15PM ET</span>",S&P 500 to gain 6% in rest of 2021: Reuters poll,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A surprisingly sharp rebound in the economy and earnings will drive further gains in U.S. stocks this year, though the S&P 500 is likely to end 2021 less than 6% up from its current level, according to a Reuters poll of strategists.
The benchmark S&P 500 ended pandemic-hit 2020 with gains of 16.3%, lifted late in the year by optimism over the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and prospects of more U.S. fiscal stimulus.
The index, which is up about 3% so far this year, will finish 2021 at 4,100, a 5.6% gain from its close Tuesday of 3,881.37, according to the median forecast of 50 strategists polled by Reuters over the last two weeks.
The index is expected to be at 4,000 by end-June - though with some strategists warning of a possible surge in inflation, many viewed a correction in stocks in the next six months as likely or very likely.
Progress in distribution of the coronavirus vaccine coupled with President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion package for pandemic relief have boosted the outlook for the economy and earnings.
""There's a systematic underestimation of the economic and earnings forecasts for the last nine months,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities. 
""Everywhere I look, there's upside,"" added Golub, who on Tuesday raised his year-end 2021 target on the S&P 500 to 4,300.
Based on the poll, the Dow Jones industrial average will finish this year at 32,970, up 4.5% from Tuesday's close. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, testifying before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, said coming updates to the Fed's outlook may show the economy expanding ""in the range"" of 6% this year.
At the same time, earnings have been much stronger than expected. U.S. companies are on track to post earnings growth for the fourth quarter of 2020, defying expectations for profits to have dropped due to the pandemic, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. For 2021, Wall Street analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to jump 23.3%.
Asked when earnings would return to pre-COVID-19 levels, most respondents in the poll said it would happen within six months. In the November poll, most respondents said that would happen within a year.
Yet the Fed's accommodative stance along with the federal fiscal support and a sharp rise in benchmark Treasury yields have triggered inflation concerns, and some investors have taken profits in market-leading technology stocks.
Another worry is the risk of higher taxes as the economy accelerates, said Golub, noting that high levels of growth in earnings and the economy ""are not going to be sustained forever.""
Many strategists still favor cyclical stocks, which investors dumped during the early part of the pandemic.
""Higher bond yields aren't turning us bearish on the year,"" Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a report this week. She is overweight financials, materials and energy and has an end-2021 target on the S&P 500 of 4,100. 
""What the increase in yields does do, in our view, is provide another justification for rotation out of defensives and secular growth.""

222,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>",Nvidia sales surge as it struggles to keep gaming chips in stock,"By Chavi Mehta and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp forecast better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter revenue on Wednesday, with its flagship gaming chips expected to remain in tight supply for the next several months.
As people wait for COVID-19 vaccine rollouts around the world, stay-at-home orders have kept demand high for chips that speed up video games. But the Santa Clara, California-based company's gaming chips have also regained popularity for mining cryptocurrency, a trend Nvidia is trying to counter by offering special mining chips in order to free up graphics chip supplies for gamers during a global chip shortage.
While Nvidia was long known for its gaming graphic chips, its aggressive push into artificial intelligence chips that handle tasks such as speech and image recognition in data centers has helped it become the most valuable semiconductor maker by market capitalization. 
It has eclipsed rivals  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Nvidia shares were up 3% at $597.50 in extended trading after the results.
On a conference call with investors, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that a global chip crunch made it hard to keep the company's flagship gaming chips introduced last fall in stock and that the chips would likely remain in tight supply through the fiscal first quarter.
Kress said analysts have estimated that cryptocurrency mining contributed between $100 million and $300 million to Nvidia's sales in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company expects the new mining chips to generate about $50 million revenue in its fiscal first quarter, Kress added.
To discourage miners from using gaming chips, Nvidia will start shipping software with its gaming chips that slows down their ability to mine some currencies and then separately release a mining-specific chip. Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang told Reuters that the mining chips do not need gaming features such as display outputs, which means that chips that might not be suitable for gaming can be used for mining instead.
""The way the use the chips, they don't need a whole bunch of functionality,"" Huang said of miners. 
The company expects first-quarter revenue of $5.30 billion, plus or minus 2%, above analysts' average estimate of $4.51 billion.
Revenue in the quarter ended on Jan. 31 rose to $5 billion from $3.11 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $4.82 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue in the company's gaming segment was $2.5 billion, above analyst estimates of $2.36 billion, according to data from FactSet. Data center revenue was $1.9 billion, above estimates of $1.84 billion according to FactSet data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday, as a selloff in technology-related stocks eased and a rotation into cyclical shares continued after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments calmed inflation worries. 
The Nasdaq index, which traded as much as 1.3% lower earlier in the session, regained its footing by early afternoon and closed up. The Dow hit a record high earlier in the session.
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) stock, which was at the center of volatile moves in late January by shares talked about on a Reddit forum, more than doubled with no obvious catalyst. Volume was more than two times the 10-day moving average.
Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday it may take more than three years to reach the central bank's inflation goals, a sign the Fed plans leave interest rates unchanged for a long time to come.
""What's driving the stock market is the fiscal stimulus, the dovish Fed, the real strong, strong earnings that we're seeing, as well as the fact that we're going to have a third vaccine,"" said Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-dose COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, paving the way for its approval for emergency use as soon as this week. 
Johnson & Johnson rose 1.3% following the news.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 424.51 points, or 1.35%, to 31,961.86, the S&P 500 gained 44.06 points, or 1.14%, to 3,925.43 and the Nasdaq Composite added 132.77 points, or 0.99%, to 13,597.97. All three main indexes were on track to post strong monthly gains, with the Dow and the S&P 500 set for their best month since November.
Investors have focused on rising U.S. yields and their potential impact on growth stocks. Saperstein said higher yields could pressure stocks but would not derail the upward trend.
""I don't believe that the 10-year yield going from 1% to 1.5% is going to alter the calculus of owning large technology stocks,"" said Saperstein.
Value-oriented stocks have enjoyed a bit of a bounce recently, and the S&P 500 Value index rose for a fourth straight day.
The S&P 500 financial sector hit an all-time peak, while other cyclical stocks including industrials, energy and materials also rose. 
The S&P 500 Growth index, which includes most of the high-flying technology-related stocks, has come under pressure in the last few days due to valuation concerns, elevated Treasury yields and an investment shift into more economy-sensitive parts of the market.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) were down 0.4% to 1.1%, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc reversed earlier declines. 
Growth-oriented stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields as their value rests heavily on future earnings, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc gained 6.2% after star investor Cathie Wood's Ark Invest fund bought a further $171 million worth of the company's shares in the wake of a sharp fall in the electric-car maker's stock.
Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos Inc slid 3.7% as it stuck by its 2021 outlook of a $4 billion to $8 billion drop in revenue, even after reporting blow-out fourth quarter results.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.62-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 102 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 282 new highs and seven new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.68 billion shares, compared with the 16.01 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Part of the money, $42.5 million, will go to the Entrepreneurs of Color fund, which provides funds to community development financial institutions (CDFIs) for low-interest loans. These CDFIs work primarily with under-served small business owners in Washington, D.C., Chicago, Detroit and other U.S. cities.
JPMorgan grew its investment into these communities last year as big corporations were forced to respond to growing anger over systemic racism in the United States after the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. In October, JPMorgan said it would give $30 billion over five years to address racial inequality in the United States. https://reut.rs/2ZNfM6K
The $42.5 million commitment to the Entrepreneurs of Color fund is one of the largest contributions, and is more than the total amount of low-interest loans the fund has made in Detroit in the past 5 years. 
Ted Archer, executive director and head of small business and philanthropy at JPMorgan, said JPMorgan is committed to lending more to Black and minority-owned businesses. This money will help strengthen CDFIs so they also can lend to more business owners in their communities, he said.
""We have an important role to play as a lender, but there's more to the financial system than we can provide,"" Archer said. ""We're going to do our part, but that's not enough to ... close the disparity and create jobs, income and wealth in these communities.""

The full $350 million commitment will be distributed over 5 years in the form of low-interest loans, equity investments and philanthropic investments in diverse-led nonprofits in the United States and abroad.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department's inspector general faulted ""weaknesses"" in U.S. government certification of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft that was grounded for 20 months after two crashes killed 346 people, according to a report released Wednesday.
The 63-page report said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not have a complete understanding of a  Boeing Co  safety system tied to both crashes and said ""much work remains"" to address outstanding issues. It also cited ""management and oversight weaknesses.""
The FAA agreed to implement all 14 recommendations in the report and said it ""has already made substantial progress towards implementing reforms that address some of your recommendations.""
Boeing said it has ""undertaken significant changes to reinforce our safety practices, and we have already made progress"" on recommendations outlined in the report.
The report noted ""instances where the same company engineer worked on a particular design and then approved the design” as a Boeing employee conducting certification tasks for the FAA.
The report added FAA needs to do more to ensure personnel conducting certification tasks ""are adequately independent.""
It was the second report by the inspector general's office into the fatal crashes. The first, issued in June, disclosed Boeing had failed to submit documents to the FAA.
In December, Congress passed legislation reforming how the FAA certifies airplanes, especially the long-standing practice of delegating some certification tasks to manufacturers.
The report urges FAA to ""incorporate lessons"" from the accidents into ""implementing a risk-based approach"" in delegating oversight and said reforms ""will be vital to restore confidence in FAA’s certification process and ensure the highest level of safety in future certification efforts.""
The new law boosts FAA oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requires disclosure of critical safety information and new whistleblower protections.
The legislation requires an independent review of Boeing’s safety culture. Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in January into the MAX as part of a deferred prosecution agreement, a form of corporate plea bargain

FAA said it encouraging manufacturers to engage earlier in ""their development process to provide the agency a better understanding of novel features."" It is also working with other civil aviation authorities ""to evaluate certification requirements for derivative aircraft, thus ensuring a consistent worldwide approach to safety and the similar evaluation and treatment of design changes.""

(Reuters) - Minnesota's highest court on Wednesday handed a victory to PolyMet Mining Corp, saying state regulators need not investigate allegations of ""sham permitting"" when considering an air emissions permit for the company's proposed $1 billion copper-nickel-platinum mine.
The Minnesota Supreme Court said the federal Clean Air Act did not require the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to examine objections to the proposed NorthMet mine made by four environmental groups and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa tribe.
Shares of Toronto-based PolyMet, which are listed in Canada and New York, closed up more than 16%.
Wednesday's 6-0 decision reversed a ruling by a state appeals court, which had said the agency should have taken a ""hard look"" at the allegations, including whether PolyMet might have intended to build a larger project.
The Supreme Court said the federal Environmental Protection Agency could act later if the company went too far.
It returned the case to the appeals court to address other issues. The proposed mine is located about 230 miles (370 km) north of Minneapolis, and nearer to the Canadian border.
""PolyMet has engaged in a bait-and-switch scheme to avoid air pollution standards, and we are glad that the Supreme Court ruling allows us to make this case,"" Kathryn Hoffman, chief executive of the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, one of the environmental groups, said in a statement.
Lawyers for the tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for the Minnesota agency said it ""scrutinized PolyMet's emissions calculations and required the facility to have new requirements that protect Minnesota's air. The result was a strong and enforceable air permit.""
Jon Cherry, chief executive of PolyMet, called the decision ""a major step forward in the defense of our air permit.""
The case is In re: Issuance of Air Emissions Permit No. 13700345-101 for PolyMet Mining Inc, Minnesota Supreme Court, Nos. A19-0115, A19-0134.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 05:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. airline CEOs to meet with White House on cutting carbon footprint,"By David Shepardson, Jarrett Renshaw and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executives of major U.S. airlines are set to meet virtually with two key White House advisers on Friday about efforts to reduce carbon emissions and use renewable fuels, five people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The CEOs of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) are among those who have been invited to meet with White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy and economic adviser Brian Deese to discuss environmental issues related to air travel, including using greener fuels to power air travel.
The White House and a spokeswoman for a group representing the airlines declined to comment.
McCarthy told Reuters earlier this month she had started discussions with the utility and automobile sectors about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. She said the talks were part of a broad effort by the Biden administration to engage every federal agency to decarbonize the U.S. power sector by 2035 and the whole economy by 2050.
Last week Reuters reported U.S airlines and renewable energy companies are lobbying the Biden administration to back a big increase in subsidies for lower-carbon aviation fuel. They say new incentives are needed to help fight climate change. 
Air travel contributes around 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the Air Transport Action Group said. That percentage is expected to rise rapidly in coming decades if airlines do not quickly switch to ""sustainable aviation fuel."" 
Such fuel is made from biologically sourced wastes like old cooking oil, animal fat and plant oils. It is much more expensive than traditional jet fuel.
Speaking at an Axios event on the future of green travel, United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said the R&D investments needed to get the whole economy to net-zero emissions will require government support.
United has committed to a multimillion-dollar investment in carbon capture, a technology designed to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as part of a plan to be 100% green by 2050.
Industry trade group Airlines for America told Reuters previously it has also been in contact with the Biden administration’s climate change officials to discuss expanding the sustainable aviation fuel market.
Currently, A4A members use only about 1.5 million gallons of green plane fuel in the United States a year, out of a total commercial jet fuel market that exceeds 620 million barrels annually. (One barrel of jet fuel contains 42 gallons.)
Several other countries have already proposed sustainable aviation fuel mandates or are exploring them as a means of addressing increasing carbon output from air travel. A mandate in Norway came into force in January 2020, while the Netherlands is set to have one in place by 2023.
European requirements are expected to be addressed at the White House meeting.
Globally, more than 250,000 flights have run on sustainable aviation fuel since 2016, while an estimated 10.6 million gallons were produced in 2020, the International Air Transport Association said.

Chicago-based Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has committed to fly with 100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030, it said in January.

(Reuters) - U.S. retail sales could rise as much as 8.2% to more than $4.33 trillion this year as more people get the COVID-19 vaccine and the economy reopens, the National Retail Federation (NRF) said on Wednesday.
The economy is expected to see its fastest growth in over two decades as the rollout of the vaccine to consumers should permit accelerated growth during the mid-year, the trade group said. NRF expects the overall economy to gain between 220,000 and 300,000 jobs per month in 2021.
""We are very optimistic that healthy consumer fundamentals, pent-up demand and widespread distribution of the vaccine will generate increased economic growth, retail sales and consumer spending,"" NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay said in a statement.(https:// Preliminary results show retail sales for 2020 grew 6.7% to $4.06 trillion, above the trade body's forecast of at least 3.5% growth, NRF said. The retail sales numbers exclude automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants. U.S. retail sales are expected to rise between 6.5% and 8.2% in 2021, the NRF said.

The U.S. department store chain said while reporting company earnings on Tuesday that it has invested tremendously in its online business, as virus-wary shoppers have opted to stay home to make their purchases rather than leisurely shop in-store.  “We do anticipate that customers will be increasingly more comfortable in public spaces as vaccine distribution reaches scale,” said Macy's (NYSE:M) Chief Financial Officer Adrian Mitchell. New rounds of stimulus-driven consumer spending in the coming months would also strengthen retail sales, should the U.S. Congress pass the Biden administration's support plan that includes sending a $1,400 check to households. The NRF also said online sales, which are included in the overall number for 2021, were expected to increase between 18% and 23% to between $1.14 trillion and $1.19 trillion. In 2020, online and other non-store sales jumped 21.9 percent to $969.4 billion as consumers opted to stay home and place their orders online to curb the spread of the virus. The trade body's forecast follows other estimates from companies like consumer research firm Customer Growth Partners (CGP). 
Boosted by rounds of stimulus checks and a ""new-found momentum across income levels,"" CGP said earlier this month that retail sales in 2021 will total a record $4.26 trillion, up 8.1% from $3.94 trillion in 2020.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The next ""Star Wars"" series, an animated show about an elite group of clones called ""The Bad Batch,"" will debut on the Disney+ streaming service on May 4, the company said on Wednesday.
Marvel Studios live-action series ""Loki,"" about the villain played by Tom Hiddleston, will premiere on June 11, Disney said in a statement ahead of a presentation of upcoming programming to the Television Critics Association. 
""The Bad Batch"" will follow the experimental clones in a rapidly changing galaxy following the end of the Clone War. The debut date coincides with an unofficial holiday among ""Star Wars"" fans who use the catchphrase ""May the Fourth be with you.""
Disney is adding several high-profile series from its Star Wars and Marvel franchises to help attract viewers to Disney+, which launched in November 2019. The company is refocusing its media and entertainment business around the streaming market dominated by Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
As of Jan. 2, Disney+ had 94.9 million subscribers, helped by the popularity of ""Star Wars"" spinoff ""The Mandalorian"" starring the character known as Baby Yoda and Marvel series ""WandaVision."" 
Marvel is currently filming ""Ms. Marvel"" and ""Hawkeye"" for Disney+ and will begin shooting ""She-Hulk"" in a few weeks followed by ""Moon Knight"" a few weeks after that, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige told the TV critics group.
Marvel is linking the stories told in the streaming TV series to its feature films that play in movie theaters. Wanda, played by Elizabeth Olsen, will next appear in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"" a film scheduled for release in theaters in March 2022.
Some of the Marvel shows created for Disney+ will go on for more than one season, Feige said. He did not say if that would happen with ""WandaVision,"" but he did not rule it out. 

""The fun of the (Marvel Cinematic Universe) is obviously all the crossover we can do between series, between films,"" Feige said. ""It will vary based on the story. Sometimes it will go into a season two. Sometimes it will go into a feature and back into a series.""

Nvidia shares gained 3% in after-hours trade following the report.
Nvidia announced earnings per share of $3.1 on revenue of $5 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.8 on revenue of $4.82 billion.
The data center business grew 97% to a record $1.90 billion for the quarter year-on-year, driven by its Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) acquisition and the ramp of its ampere GPU architecture. In fiscal 2021, Mellanox revenue contributed 10% of total revenue.
Its gaming division generated second-quarter revenue of $1.65 billion, up 67% from the previous quarter and up 26% from a year earlier.
""Our gaming and data center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home,"" it said.
The company flagged bottlenecks throughout its supply chain as chip demand continues to outpace supply. ""Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in gaming.""
Looking ahead top to the fiscal first quarter, revenue is expected to be $5.30 billion, give or take 2%, compared with consensus estimate for $4.53 billion.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>","Wall Street's 'fear gauge' is in a bubble, says J.P. Morgan","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" is in a bubble, according to analysts at J.P. Morgan.
Investor appetite for protective options has kept the Cboe Volatility Index elevated despite muted moves on the benchmark S&P 500, according to the bank. The gap between investor expectations for volatility in U.S. stocks, as measured by the VIX, and actual moves on the S&P 500 is near its highest levels over the past 30 years, said Marko Kolanovic, J.P. Morgan's global head of macro quantitative and derivatives strategy.
In Kolanovic's view, that level of caution is not justified, and the bank expects stocks will keep climbing. The gap between investor expectations and actual market moves, he wrote, is ""indicating a bubble of fear and demand from investors looking to hedge or profit from a hypothetical market selloff.""
The demand for options is twofold, said Matt Amberson, principal at ORATS: some investors are buying puts for protection, while others are choosing to maintain exposure to equities through calls. Both, he said, have helped prop up the VIX.
The VIX has tended to fall in the past when the gap between the fear gauge and realized volatility has grown similarly wide, according to Kolanovic. But the last such gap, in late August, preceded a substantial sell-off in U.S. stocks, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
The rotation to value and cyclical stocks from growth stocks has effectively ""pulled the S&P (500) in two different directions,"" Murphy said. But if that trend changes, market gyrations could pick up, he said, though he also believes the VIX is likely to decline over the coming months. 

""I don't know if you can assume that that rotation would occur forever,"" he said. ""Is two weeks a long enough time frame to think that the market is really calm?""

Investing.com – The Dow closed at a record high Wednesday, as value sectors like energy and industrials continue to gather steam amid expectations that another round of stimulus and the ongoing vaccine roll out will spur a stronger economic recovery. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4%, or 424 points, at a record high of 31,961.86 after hitting an intraday high 31,978.90. The S&P 500 was up 1.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.%.
Energy, up more 3%, led the move higher in cyclical stocks as oil prices shrugged off an unexpected build in the crude stockpiles on expectations of a boost to demand from a stronger recovery.  
Crude inventories increased 1.28 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 5.19 million barrels. The move coincided with a draw in gasoline and distillate stocks as refinery activity slowed during the recent cold snap that battered oil-rich Texas.
 Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were among the biggest gainers, with the latter up 8%.

United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) closed up more than 8%, and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) up nearly 6% on the day.
Positive vaccine news also added to the bullish bets on stocks as the Food and Drug Administration said Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single shot Covid-19 vaccine was safe and effective ahead of vote later this week on whether to grant emergency use authorization, with doses expected to roll out next week.
Tech stocks, which have been abandoned on fears about rising inflation, found some reprieve amid a jump in chip stocks ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s quarterly results due later.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 03:55PM ET</span>",Record redemption in Ark ETF sparks liquidity worries,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - A record half-billion dollar redemption from Ark Invest's flagship fund in a single day has led analysts to highlight the risks arising from the ETF's heavy exposure to illiquid stocks if outflows pick up pace.
A 20% pullback in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares over the past three weeks, the biggest holding of the exchange-traded fund Ark Innovation set up by star investor Cathie Wood has triggered a rush among investors to sell some of their holdings.
But according to some who watch the fund closely, a far bigger problem could be its 15%-plus stakes in a handful of companies whose shares are relatively illiquid and potentially hard to exit when redemptions surge.
These include names such as therapeutic discovery company Compugen (NASDAQ:CGEN) and three-dimensional printing firm  Stratasys  (NASDAQ:SSYS) whose daily share trading is tiny compared to the overall ETF's turnover.
""They won't find liquidity in many of these stocks,"" said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. ""If there's going to be liquidity it is going to come at a price, and it's going to be a price that, in all likelihood, would not be favourable to fund shareholders."" 
For instance, about $100 million worth of shares change hands on average every day in Stratasys, a stark contrast to Ark Innovation ETF's turnover in single-digit billions and Tesla's in tens of billions of dollars.
Investors yanked $465 million from Ark Innovation on Monday, according to Refinitiv data. More such redemptions would prompt Wood's fund to sell liquid holdings to manage the squeeze in the near-term before looking to unwind its illiquid holdings.
That could turn nasty and rekindle memories of British money manager Neil Woodford's flagship fund, which failed in 2019 because of its exposure to hard-to-sell stocks. That left it unable to meet a flood of redemption requests after a phase of disappointing performance and asset revaluations.
""These large stakes are difficult to exit quickly. This movie has played out before, with the leading role played by Neil Woodford,"" said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Mirabaud Securities.
Ark Invest did not return calls seeking comment.
The portfolio risk level of the Ark Innovation ETF, which returned 157% last year, ranks well above average on 10 of the 11 factors in Morningstar's Global RiskModel.
Ark Invest meanwhile shuffled its portfolio on Tuesday by cutting its already-tiny holdings in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Taiwan Semiconductor and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to beef-up its Tesla stake on Wednesday.
The fund, which saw $5.5 billion inflows in 2021, traded nearly flat on Wednesday as Tesla shares stopped falling. 
In 2020, its assets grew nine-fold thanks to small-time investors as actively managed ETFs focused on red-hot themes such as major tech disruptors, space technology and pet care took off.
Investors say Ark's ETF allows funds to invest in specialised niche companies that other large ETFs simply don't take stakes in.
SHORT
The pressure on the fund this week has lured in short-sellers, with 100% of Ark Innovation shares available for shorting out on loan as of Monday, data provider FIS Astec Analytics estimated.
Selling pressure can cause the ETF to trade below net asset value (NAV), which leads to ""redemptions"" as ETF arbitrageurs exchange the fund for the underlying holdings and then sell the underlying holdings, exacerbating the selling pressure on these ETFs.
In a similar episode, during China's 2015 stock market crash, overseas-listed ETFs of Chinese markets traded at significant discounts to their NAVs. 
""ETFs can rapidly gain or lose assets based on the sentiments of their retail investors. These changing flows can act as a self-fulfilling prophecy for ARK,"" Campling added.
Of course, Ark is not the only fund to bet heavily on a very small number of companies. It is among the biggest, however, and many others have adopted a more cautious approach.
Global X, which has $25 billion in managed assets, uses a concept of ""modified market capitalisation"" in its thematic ETFs where no company has more than 8% weight in the portfolio, CEO Luis Berruga says.
""We limit the potential situation in which a company can become a very large part of their portfolio and address some of the potential concentration risks in our portfolios,"" Berruga told Reuters.

The weekly unemployment claims data comes out on Thursday. Analysts are expecting a slight improvement though still-elevated levels of both initial claims and continuing claims. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Charlie Munger on bubbles and speculation
Charlie Munger, the  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb) executive who has long been Warren Buffett’s sidekick, holds court at the  Daily Journal Corp  (NASDAQ:DJCO)’s annual shareholder meeting. It’s sort of a precursor to the annual Buffettpalooza known as the Berkshire shareholder weekend (virtual again for the second year).
On Wednesday, Munger had some things to say about current trends in the market. The ever-popular blank check companies, he said, are a “sign of a bubble.” Commission-free trading apps like Robinhood also are responsible for the speculation in the markets, he said. 
“It’s really stupid to have a culture which encourages as much gambling in stocks,” he told Daily Journal shareholders. “It’s a dirty way of making money.”
2. Economic output revision for the fourth quarter
On Thursday morning at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), the government will release the second print of the fourth quarter economic output. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the reading to be 2.0%, which would be up slightly from the first print of 1.9% in January.
3. Happiest place on Earth once more?
Speaking of reopening trades, Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) stock hit a record high on Thursday around $197 on a couple of positive developments. The company has both a big travel and theme park-related business, which has been hurting during the pandemic, and a studio business that has been lifted lately by its Disney + streaming service.
On Thursday, Bloomberg reported Disneyland, the theme park in Southern California, is bringing back 1,000 cast members, a bullish sign that reopening is ahead. Its “Touch of Disney” limited capacity ticketed experience kicks off at its California Adventure park next month.
Disney also announced it would stream the next part of the Star Wars franchise over Disney+ in May.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve says its Fedwire Funds, Fedcash and some check clearing services have resumed normal operations after a more than three-hour disruption to more than a dozen critical central bank payment services forming the backbone of the U.S. banking system.
The National Settlement Service and the Fedwire Securities Service, which provides issuance, settlement and transfer services for Treasuries and other government securities, have also been restored, the Fed said.
""Our technical teams have determined that the cause is a Federal Reserve operational error,"" the Fed said on Wednesday on its website. ""The Federal Reserve Banks have taken steps to help ensure the resilience of the Fedwire and NSS applications, including recovery to the point of failure.""
Staff first became aware of a disruption to services at 11:15 a.m. ET (1615 GMT), it said. 
As of 2:58 p.m. its website was still reporting an ""alert"" status for several of its service areas. 
The affected services facilitate check clearing and allowing billions of dollars of payments to flow daily through the financial system.
Fedwire Funds is ""the premier electronic funds-transfer service that banks, businesses and government agencies rely on for mission-critical, same-day transactions,"" the Fed says. 
Fedwire Funds in December handled more than 835,000 transactions a day on average, with a daily average dollar volume of $3.4 trillion.

CHIPS, a private-sector alternative to Fedwire run by The Clearing House, continued to operate normally, spokesman Greg MacSweeney said shortly after 2 p.m. ET. CHIPS handles about $1.5 trillion a day, according to its website.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The acting chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday said the market regulator will review public companies' climate risk disclosures and begin to modernize climate guidance that is now more than a decade old.
The agency's staff will review the extent to which public companies address topics related to climate change matters and assess companies' compliance with their disclosure requirements, Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee said in a statement.
The SEC will use the review to update guidance on climate change matters from 2010, taking into account developments of the last decade, Lee said.
Scientists' warnings about risks from climate change have grown over the last ten years, but companies' methodologies for calculating those risks are inadequate and inconsistent, advocates for more disclosure like the Center for American Progress have said.
The board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions separately on Wednesday said it sees an urgent need for globally consistent and reliable sustainability disclosures.

Lee herself has criticized the SEC's lack of clear guidance on Environmental, Social, and Governance - known as ESG - disclosures, saying in August that many market participants use the rubric as a ""significant driver in decision-making.""

The agency, formally known as the Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (FREP), said in a statement on Wednesday that President Edgar Ernst is leaving his post at his own wish, effective Dec. 31.
Ernst has also come under criticism for potential conflicts of interest because he held seats on supervisory boards of major corporations, including real-estate company Vonovia, retailer Metro and tour operator TUI. 
Germany's financial watchdog BaFin called on FREP in February 2019 to investigate Wirecard's accounts, but it had not yet issued results by the time the company collapsed in June 2020.
Ernst earlier this month told a committee of Germany's parliament investigating the Wirecard case that FREP had no chance to uncover malfeasance because it was not equipped with tools to do forensic accounting.

Last month, the finance ministry announced that the head of BaFin, Felix Hufeld, would leave his post.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>","White House to roll out Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses next week, pending authorization","By Jeff Mason and Rebecca Spalding
(Reuters) - The United States expects to roll out three to four million doses of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine next week, pending authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said on Wednesday.
A Johnson & Johnson executive on Tuesday said the company expected to ship nearly 4 million doses of the vaccine once it gained authorization.
The additional vaccine will help President Joe Biden's administration in its goal of ramping up vaccination across the country as it seeks to control the pandemic that has cost more than 500,000 lives in the United States and pummeled the economy.
Zients described J&J's manufacturing as being behind schedule when the new president took over from former President Donald Trump.
""It was disappointing when we arrived. I think the progress is real and we look forward to continuing to work with the company to accelerate ... their delivery and their capacity,"" Zients told a briefing.
The FDA said on Wednesday that the Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, paving the way for its approval for emergency use as soon as this week.
The company has a contract to deliver 100 million doses to the United States by the end of June. Zients said the administration was working to accelerate that timeline.
The Biden administration told governors this week that it would allocate about 2 million doses of the first J&J distribution to states. The remainder will go to federal distribution programs, like the federal pharmacy and community health center programs, Zients said.
CASES DOWN, STORM CATCH-UP 
Zients told reporters that the government had caught up from a backlog of vaccine distribution caused by the winter storm that hit Texas last week.
Administration officials also shared statistics showing that COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the United States were trending down, though the administration is urging Americans to continue to wear masks and practice social distancing.
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said daily U.S. cases in the past week declined to approximately 64,000.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, who serves as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as well as chief medical advisor to Biden, said the NIH had launched a new initiative to study long term effects of COVID-19 and related disorders. 
The White House also announced on Wednesday that it would deliver millions of masks next month to food banks and community health centers to ensure less well-off communities were getting access to a key tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Zients said that effort would cost $86 million.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 02:21PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Baker Hughes, AXA Group, 16 others quit Nord Stream 2 pipeline - U.S.","By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Baker Hughes Co and AXA Group and 16 other companies recently quit work on Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and will not be sanctioned, according to a document the Biden administration sent to Congress last week which was seen by Reuters. 
Russian energy company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and its western partners are racing to build the pipeline to take Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea, and hope to finish it this year. President Joe Biden believes the pipeline is a ""bad deal"" for Europe. 
Many U.S. lawmakers and officials say the pipeline would increase Russia's political and economic leverage over Europe. The $11 billion pipeline, which would double the capacity of its existing duct, would bypass Ukraine through which Russia has sent gas to Europe for decades. That could deprive Ukraine and other Eastern European countries of lucrative transit fees and potentially undermine its struggle against Russian aggression.
The United States, the world's top gas producer, also would like to export liquefied natural gas to Europe as an alternative to Russian gas. 
The U.S. State Department told Congress on Friday it had designated the Russian ship Fortuna and its owner, KVT-RUS, for helping to build Nord Stream 2 under sanctions law that took effect this year. But the two had already been sanctioned by the Trump administration under previous law, and opponents of the project in Congress said sanctioning them again would not stop the pipeline. 
Last week U.S. representatives listed 15 ships that are ""possibly engaged"" in laying pipelines or related activities since Jan. 1 when the latest U.S. sanctions became law, including the Russia flagged vessels, the Ivan Sidorenko, and the Murman.
Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, told reporters this week the fact that the companies quit with sanctions looming ""demonstrates that the legislative goals and our actions are having a good effect."" 
He said the State Department continues to ""examine entities involved in potentially sanctionable activity."" Price has also said ""sanctions are only one"" of many tools in response to Nord Stream 2. 
Baker Hughes, a U.S. oilfield service company, and insurance companies Tokio Marine Kiln Syndicates Ltd and Aspen Managing Agency Ltd, had no comment. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
A few of them, including Norway's verification company DNV GL, and insurers Zurich Insurance, Munich Re, had already said they dropped out after U.S. pressure.
German engineering group Bilfinger said in January it had withdrawn from work on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, on concerns about looming U.S. sanctions.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest outflow on record for Cathie Wood's ARK fund was not enough to stop the firm from increasing its bet on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc after the electric carmaker's stock closed below $700 for the first time this year on Tuesday. 
Wood, whose $26.6 billion ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund (ETF) was the top-performing actively managed U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar last year, bought $171 million of Tesla shares, pushing its weight to about 10% of the fund. 
Shares of the carmaker jumped 4.7% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, helping erase some of the steep losses ARK has suffered over the last week as momentum stocks have pulled back sharply. 
The sell-off triggered heavy trading, with $5 billion of ARK Innovation shares changing hands on Tuesday - more than double the previous session's volume. The fund dipped slightly on Wednesday, pushing its loss to nearly 9% for the week to date.
Investors pulled $465.3 million from the ARK Innovation fund on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv Lipper data. Morningstar said Tuesday was the fund's biggest daily outflow on record. Out of the last 35 trading days, the fund has witnessed only five daily outflows and attracted $5.691 billion in new investor dollars through Feb. 23. 
Bets on companies that have thrived during the pandemic including Tesla, streaming company  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc and payments company  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ), have helped the fund's assets swell from $1.8 billion at the end of 2019 to $27.6 billion through mid-February of this year, according to Lipper. 
Meanwhile, short interest in the fund's shares showed a massive spike, with 100% of the shares available for shorting currently out on loan, FIS Astec Analytics data showed.
Short sellers typically borrow and sell shares they expect to fall in value, hoping to buy them back at a lower price to pay back the loan and pocket the difference.
David Lewis of FIS Astec Analytics said his firm's data on borrowing costs suggests potential buying of the ETF as the price falls.
According to Ark Invest's website, the Tesla share purchases were carried out in three instalments worth about $124 million, $39 million and $8 million. On the same day Ark Invest's funds also sold $126 million of Taiwan Semiconductor's U.S.-listed shares.
Ark Invest now holds a more than 0.5% stake in Tesla for a weighting of 6.6% across all its funds.

The ARK Innovation fund has large positions in so-called momentum stocks, which tend to attract investors based on thematic trends rather than fundamentals or valuation.

While business jet makers like General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream, Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc and Textron (NYSE:TXT) saw a rebound in deliveries during the last three months of 2020, the industry does not expect a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels this year.
Business aviation has recovered faster from the pandemic than commercial airlines, helped by demand from first-time buyers, leisure travel, and wealthy individuals who are looking for private aircraft during COVID-19 because they seat fewer passengers.
""Behaviors are changing. The buyers are no longer asking the questions that they would have normally asked about the aircraft in terms of performance,"" said Mike Amalfitano, chief executive of  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ)'s executive jets division, during an online briefing on the GAMA data. 
""They're focused on how clean it is. They're focused on the air quality."" 
Travel and manufacturing restrictions weighed on industry deliveries, while corporate demand has remained sluggish.
However, Tony Lefebvre, chief operating officer at Signature Flight Support, said he is seeing ""green shoots"" of demand for corporate travel as the COVID-19 vaccine is rolled out globally.
“We are starting to see the return of business flying,” he told the briefing.

Parent company Signature Aviation, a private jet services firm, backed a joint offer earlier this month from former Gatwick owner GIP, Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc and Bill Gates’ investment vehicle Cascade valuing it at $4.73 billion, in a deal that analysts say shows the resilience of the business aviation market.

Investing.com – The Dow hit a record high on Wednesday, as cyclicals continued to shine on the bets over a stronger economic recovery, while rising chip stocks boosted tech.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4%, or 441 points hitting a record high of 31,978.90. The S&P 500 was up 1.15%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.86%.
Energy, up more 3%, led the move higher in cyclical stocks as oil prices shrugged off an unexpected build in the crude stockpiles on expectations of a boost to demand from a stronger recovery.  
Crude inventories increased 1.28 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 5.19 million barrels. The move coincided with a draw in gasoline and distillate stocks as refinery activity slowed during the recent cold snap that battered oil-rich Texas.
 Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were among the biggest gainers, with the latter up 9%.
Forecasting above above-consensus economic growth in 2021, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said performance ""would benefit from improved growth expectations and a continued rotation into economically-sensitive cyclical equities.""
Industrials were also firmer, with airlines leading to the upside on expectations for a surge in travel demand when the economy full reopens and further fiscal support to the aviation industry.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) rose 8%, while Boeing (NYSE:BA) was up 6%, and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) up 5% on the day.
Positive vaccine news also added to the bullish bets on stocks as the Food and Drug Administration said Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single shot Covid-19 vaccine was safe and effective ahead of vote later this week on whether to grant emergency use authorization, with doses expected to roll out next week.
Tech stocks, which have been abandoned on fears about rising inflation, found some reprieve amid a jump in chip stocks ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s quarterly results due later.
But big tech remained sluggish as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remained in the red, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were higher.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, pared some its losses from a day earlier, up about 7% after Ark investment manager Cathie Wood revealed she had bought $120 worth of the electric automaker's shares following a rout on Tuesday.
In other news, Square (NYSE:SQ) fell 5% as the payments company's better-than-expected were overshadowed by weaker performance in its subscription and services business and slowing growth in its cash app despite a boost from bitcoin trading.
""Bitcoin trading strength offset an unusual miss in [Square's] subscription and services based adjusted revenues, Wedbush said.

The kingdom, which opened its doors in September 2019 to foreign tourists by launching a new visa regime for 49 countries, hopes to diversify its oil-dependent economy through tourism and wants the sector to contribute 10% of gross domestic product by 2030. 
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has long pushed the PIF as a central plank in his plan to find ways of driving growth while weaning the economy off its dependence on oil. Crude exports still account for more than half the kingdom’s income.
The Soudah Development Company (SDC) will develop Soudah, a mountainous area located 3,015 metres (9,892 ft) above sea level, and the ancient village of Rijal Alma', into a tourist destination for residents and visitors. It aims to contribute an estimated $8 billion to the kingdom’s cumulative gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030.
The Asir region and its capital, Abha, are a favourite destination for Saudis and foreign residents for its pleasant cool and humid climate, making it ideal for short holidays to escape the desert weather in most of the kingdom.
SDC will partner with the private sector to build 2,700 hotel rooms, 1,300 residential units, and 30 commercial and entertainment attractions by 2030, the state press agency SPA said in a statement. It aims to attract over 2 million visitors annually and create 8,000 direct and indirect jobs for young Saudis. 
While the nascent tourism sector was hit hard by the measures taken by the government to fight the coronavirus pandemic, local tourism campaigns to Abha and other destinations helped to partially attract millions of dollars Saudis used to spend overseas.
To boost the domestic economy, the PIF plans to invest at least 150 billion riyals ($40 billion) annually in the local economy until 2025.

MILAN (Reuters) - Milan prosecutors said on Wednesday they had ordered four major food delivery companies to officially hire more than 60,000 workers and pay a total of 733 million euros ($889 million) in fines after an investigation showed their working conditions were inadequate. 
The investigation, which was launched in July 2019 after a number of road accidents involving the so-called riders, targeted Spanish food delivery app Foodinho-Glovo and the Italian units of food ordering companies Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo, the prosecutors said.
""The vast majority of these riders are employed with occasional self-employment contracts ... but it emerged without a shadow of a doubt that ... they are fully included in the organisation of the company,"" Deputy Prosecutor Tiziana Siciliano said during a briefing.
The investigation also revealed that the workers were managed by an IT platform which ranked the riders according to performance. 
""This system actually forces the rider to accept all orders in order not to be demoted in the ranking and then have less work,"" she added. ""This is the reason why it is impossible to take holidays or sick leave.""
As part of the provision, the companies are also asked to pay riders overdue contributions and provide them with adequate equipment, such as bicycles with lighting or suitable clothing. 
Just Eat said in a statement it had launched an internal investigation to check on the safety conditions of its workers. It added its newly launched business model will help ""introduce a safer, more controlled and direct system with our workers, as employees"". 
Uber Eats, Foodinho-Glovo and Deliveroo Italy said they did not agree with the findings of the Milan prosecutors.
""The online food delivery is an industry that operates in full compliance with the rules and is able to guarantee an essential service,"" they said in a joint statement. 
So-called quick commerce has boomed in the past year as the pandemic forced people to stay at home and shop online, with companies like Glovo reporting a jump in courier services. 
On Wednesday the European Commission took a step towards improving the rights of gig economy workers with the launch of a public consultation to determine their legal employment status and how to improve their working conditions.
The chief prosecutor Francesco Greco added that a separate tax investigation was launched into the Italian unit of Uber Eats.

The number of new daily infections has stagnated over the past week with the seven-day incidence rate hovering at around 60 cases per 100,000. On Wednesday, Germany reported 8,007 new infections and 422 further deaths.
""Because of (variants), we are entering a new phase of the pandemic, from which a third wave may emerge,"" Merkel said. ""So we must proceed wisely and carefully so that a third wave does not necessitate a new complete shutdown throughout Germany.""
Merkel and state premiers in Germany, Europe's most populous country and largest economy, have agreed to extend restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus until March 7. 
Hair salons will be allowed to reopen from March 1, but the threshold for a gradual reopening of the rest of the economy targets an infection rate of no more than 35 new cases per 100,000 people over seven days.
Vaccines and comprehensive testing could allow for ""a more regionally differentiated approach"", Merkel said in the newspaper interview, published online on Wednesday.
""In a district with a stable incidence of 35, for example, it may be possible to open all schools without causing distortions in relation to other districts with a higher incidence and schools that are not yet open,"" she added. 
""An intelligent opening strategy is inextricably linked with comprehensive quick tests, as it were as free tests,"" she said. ""I cannot say exactly how long it will take to install such a system. But it will be in March.""
Merkel described Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, which some essential workers have refused, as ""a reliable vaccine, effective and safe.""

(Reuters) - Officials of Texas' grid operator on Wednesday defended their handling of the state's massive power outage, saying managers prevented a catastrophe while acknowledging the personal suffering during the extreme cold.
Directors of grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) held their first meeting since winter storms that brought subfreezing temperatures for days, cutting power to up to 4.3 million people and causing millions of dollars of damages. 
Six ERCOT directors have resigned and a board nominee declined a seat amid sharp criticism of their performance. 
Sally Talberg, chairman of the board and one of the six to submit a resignation, said ERCOT ""worked tirelessly"" to keep the grid from collapse. She led Chief Executive Bill Magness through a sometimes hour-by-hour review of the loss of power available to the grid and communications with consumers and officials.
Texas has no mandatory weatherization standards for the power plants that supply the grid, Magness said, pointing to a likely direction for lawmakers as they begin hearings on the weather disaster on Thursday. 
About 48% of the power generation available in the state was forced offline at the peak of the outages due to cold weather, lack of fuel or mechanical failures, Magness said. ERCOT had ample reserves available through Sunday, when generators began to drop off the grid. 
Utilities cut power to homes and businesses to prevent serious damage to generators and transmission lines, he said. Plans to rotate outages among consumers could not happen because of the sizeable loss of generation, he said.
Randal Miller, who represented independent retail power providers, resigned late Tuesday, leaving the board with seven vacancies. Tanberg, ERCOT's vice chairman and three other directors, all of whom live outside of Texas, also submitted resignations. Directors have been widely criticized for their handling of the outage and for not living in the state.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott earlier called for resignations. The state's investigation will ""uncover the full picture of what went wrong"" and ensure it is not repeated, he said in a statement on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - ReNew Power will go public through an $8 billion merger with a blank-check firm in the biggest deal in the fast-growing clean energy sector in India, allowing the country's largest renewable energy firm to grow capacity over the next few years.
The deal will be financed with cash proceeds of $1.2 billion, including $855 million in investments from serial blank-check dealmaker Chamath Palihapitiya, funds managed by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Sylebra Capital, ReNew Power said on Wednesday.
Founded in 2011, ReNew Power counts Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board among its prominent investors. It owns and operates solar energy projects for more than 150 commercial and industrial customers across India.
ReNew, which currently has a 10% market share of India's renewable energy market, is among a wave of clean-energy firms poised to benefit from the country's push into renewable energy.
India, the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, wants to raise its renewable energy capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW), or 40% of total capacity, by 2030.
ReNew's total operational clean energy capacity is currently over 5 GW and it has an aggregate capacity of about 10 GW. It also counts Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Global Environment Fund and JERA Co Inc, a consortium of two of the biggest Japanese utilities, as investors.
The company expects to grow its capacity to about 19 GW by 2025, with cash raised from the deal to be used to fund the roll-out, Sumant Sinha, chairman & chief executive officer of ReNew, told Reuters.
Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are serving as financial advisers to ReNew, with Morgan Stanley also acting as a joint placement agent to the blank check company RMG Acquisition Corp II on the PIPE deal.
Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, such as RMG raise money through an initial public offering to merge with a privately held company that then becomes publicly traded.
RMG's shares were up about 3% in New York. The combined entity is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""RNW"".
""We had been looking at trying to get an IPO done, and preferably from our standpoint, in the overseas market, just because they understand renewables better,"" Sinha said.
The amount of environmental, social and governance capital in overseas markets also influenced ReNew Power's decision to list in the U.S., Sinha added.

Palihapitiya, a former Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) executive, also led the PIPE (private investment in public equity) round at SoftBank-backed robotics firm Berkshire Grey, which earlier on Wednesday agreed to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>",Apple supplier Foxconn teams up with Fisker to make electric vehicles,"By Akanksha Rana and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - Electric-car maker Fisker Inc said it will work with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn to produce more than 250,000 vehicles a year beginning in late 2023, sending its shares up 18%.
The deal, codenamed ""Project PEAR"" (Personal Electric Automotive Revolution), is looking at markets globally, including North America, Europe, China and India, Fisker said.
Foxconn, Apple's main iPhone maker, has ramped up its interest in electric vehicles (EVs) over the past year or so, announcing deals with Chinese electric-car maker Byton and automakers Zhejiang Geely Holding Group and Stellantis NV's Fiat Chrysler unit.
Sources have said Apple is targeting 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle.
Foxconn aims to provide components or services to 10% of the world's EVs by 2025 to 2027, Chairman Liu Young-way said in October.
The Taiwan-based company's approach poses a major threat to established automakers that technology companies such as Apple and other non-traditional players could use contract assemblers as a shortcut to competing in the vehicle market.
""A lot of auto suppliers and manufacturers are looking to get a piece of this explosive growth that's ahead for the global electric vehcile market,"" said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson, who has a ""buy"" rating on Fisker. 
Fisker Chief Executive Henrik Fisker told Reuters that Foxconn is more than just a contract manufacturer under this deal and is developing the vehicle with the startup. He expects the deal to be finalized in the second quarter and to last about seven years. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Fisker said the new vehicle would be ""futuristic"" and ""something completely different,"" as well as ""affordable."" It will launch in the fourth quarter of 2023, and is one of the four vehicles Fisker previously said it would introduce by 2025, he said. 
""We're not just going to make another electric car,"" Henrik Fisker said in an interview. ""We want to introduce things that probably will almost feel a little scary to some people.""
Where the vehicle will be built by Foxconn has not been set, he said. 
The EV sector has been booming, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc still the market leader. On Tuesday, luxury electric-car maker Lucid Motors announced plans to go public by merging with a blank-check company.
The recent runup in valuations of several EV startups, including Nikola Corp and Lordstown Motors Corp, which have yet to produce saleable vehicles or meaningful revenue, has drawn comparisons to the dotcom bubble of 1999 to 2000, with analysts and investors expecting a near-term correction.

Fisker said in December that Canadian auto supplier  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) Inc would initially manufacture its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, in Europe. The production is on track to start in the fourth quarter of next year, said Henrik Fisker, who added that the Foxconn deal does not affect those plans.

259,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 11:00AM ET</span>",India's largest stock exchange reopens after telecoms glitch,"By Savio Shetty and Chris Thomas
MUMBAI (Reuters) - A telecoms outage shut all trading on India's National Stock Exchange for nearly four hours on Wednesday before coming back up, leaving investors in the dark ahead of a monthly derivative contract expiry and forcing bourses to extend trading hours.
The country's markets regulator said it ""advised the NSE to carry out a detailed root cause analysis,"" asking it to explain the reasons why trading did not migrate to the disaster recovery site.
The exchange did not immediately say when it would respond when contacted by Reuters.
""Brokers and investors witnessed huge panic in the system,"" said Rahul Sharma, market strategist & head of research at investment advisory firm Equity99, who was driving to work in downtown Mumbai when he started getting scores of panicked calls from clients. 
""At least the resumption gave some relief, otherwise it would have been a disaster."" 
The NSE, headquartered in India's financial capital Mumbai, is the world's largest derivatives bourse by volume and the third-largest stock exchange globally in terms of the number of equity trades, according to its annual report.
It said telecom disruptions at two of its providers forced the exchange to halt trading earlier in the day, resuming with the NSE Nifty 50 Index gaining 0.39% by 1008 GMT. The stock exchange did not specify the names of the telecom carriers. 
The BSE and the NSE said equity and equity derivatives markets would remain open until 1130 GMT, extending the day's session by one and a half hours. 
Both indexes ended the session higher, with the some analysts saying stock moves after the resumption of trade reflected frantic trading to square off positions. 
""I can't recall trading hours having been extended like this in the past decade. The move will be welcomed as people were completely stuck ahead of the derivatives expiry,"" said Ajit Mishra, vice-president, research at Religare Broking.
The outage is the latest incident to hit an exchange in the region. In November, Australia's main stock exchange was slammed by a software glitch just 20 minutes into the session.
A month earlier, trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was hit by a hardware failure, and earlier, New Zealand's stock exchange was affected by various system glitches. 
The NSE outage sent some frustrated traders to the Bombay Stock Exchange. That bourse's daily turnover — the total value of shares traded — crossed 400 billion rupees ($5.5 billion) at the close of trade, nine times the turnover in the previous session, exchange data showed.
In January, NSE recorded an average daily turnover of about $10 billion in equities and $498 billion in equity derivatives.
The stock exchange had faced similar system problems in 2017 that led to a five-hour-long shutdown, prompting the market regulator to call for a review of the bourse's contingency plans.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global airline industry body IATA warned that the outlook for airlines has been weakened recently by tightening coronavirus restrictions but said it was preparing for a travel recovery later this year and would launch a digital travel pass in March. 
IATA said the sector would continue to bleed cash this year and raised its forecast for total annual airline cash burn to between $75 billion and $95 billion, up from the $48 billion it had forecast in December but still well short of roughly $150 billion last year. 
Despite mounting losses the industry focus is on how travel can restart at scale when borders are finally reopened and huge pent-up demand is released. 
""We need to plan for the recovery,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told reporters on Wednesday. 
""We will need a way to digitally manage health credentials and we need a secure global standard to record test results and vaccinations.""
IATA said its travel pass, which will formally launch at the end of March, will help to facilitate travel by putting COVID-19 test results and vaccine certificates in one digital format, speeding up check-in processes.
This summer is make or break for many airlines struggling to survive after a year of minimal revenue owing to the pandemic. As restrictions ease, digital systems will be needed to accommodate rising passenger numbers. 
DIGITAL PROOF 'CRITICAL'
Britain's Heathrow Airport on Wednesday said that it was taking 20 minutes per passenger to check paper test results and passenger locator forms, something that is only possible when passenger numbers are so low.
Vaccinations give hope that more travel will be allowed, but IATA said that countries need to issue digital proof to allow travel to take off. 
""It's really absolutely critical that we start issuing digital vaccine credentials,"" said Alan Murray Hayden, IATA's head of airport, passenger and security products. 
Despite vaccine rollouts, the emergence of more infectious variants in countries such as Britain, Brazil and South Africa has forced governments to bring in new travel restrictions this year.
But there is light at the end of tunnel. De Juniac praised Britain for setting out its plans to restart travel. Holiday bookings flooded in after the UK said international travel could resume from mid-May, depending on progress against the virus. 

De Juniac said he is hopeful the recovery will happen in the second half of 2021.

BEIJING/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - China's Geely Automobile and its Swedish sister company Volvo Cars will abandon merger plans but launch a new entity to combine their powertrain operations and expand cooperation on electric vehicles, the companies said.
A year ago the two said they were planning to merge, giving Volvo access to public markets, as global automakers pursue alliances to respond better to the cost of the transition to electric cars, tougher emission rules and autonomous driving.
Geely and Volvo on Wednesday said they would preserve with their existing separate corporate structures after ""a detailed review of combination options"".
They added, however, that they would launch a new company to combine their existing powertrain operations.
The new entity, expected to become operational this year, will provide engines, transmissions systems and petrol-electric hybrid systems for use by both companies as well as other automakers.
""I firmly believe that this is the best combination, the best way forward for our companies,"" Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson told a joint news conference.
Asked if Volvo Cars would consider a stock market listing, he said there were currently no such plans. 
The two companies will also focus on the development and sourcing of next-generation technologies, from connectivity and self-driving vehicles to car sharing and electrification, their statement added.
The companies did not disclose what savings they expect to make from the various collaborations.
Geely and Volvo's joint research team rolled out a car product platform, dubbed Compact Modular Architecture (CMA), to develop, design and build different types of compact cars with similar mechanical layout faster than before and at lower cost.
Geely Auto will also forge a partnership with Volvo's sales network to help to boost growth for their jointly owned Lynk & Co car brand.
Last year Geely Auto sold 1.32 million cars while Volvo Cars sold 661,713 vehicles.
Geely Auto plans to raise 20 billion yuan ($2.93 billion) from a public share sale on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market, which CEO Gui Shengyue said would be unaffected by the new collaboration with Volvo.

Hangzhou-based Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, Geely Automobile's parent, bought Volvo Cars from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co in 2010. It also has stakes in  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Malaysian carmaker Proton.

267,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 09:42AM ET</span>",Wall Street Falls at Open as Bond Yields Surge to New Highs; Dow Down 80 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell again at the opening on Wednesday, as fears of higher inflation drove long-term bond yields higher. 
The 10-Year Treasury not yield rose to a new 12-month high of 1.4%, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recommitted in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee to a policy stance that is aggressively reflationary. He's expected to repeat such lines again from 10 AM ET (1500 GMT) in remarks to the House of Representatives.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 80 points, or 0.3%, at 31,458 points. The S&P 500 was also down another 0.3% while the Nasdaq Composite was again underperforming with a drop of 0.8%.
The rise in bond yields profoundly changes the assumptions underlying the valuation of stocks. Most financial models base their discount rates on such reference points, and tech stocks in particular have benefited in recent months from the assumption that long-term rates will stay at historically low levels over the next few years. But the 10-year risk-free rate has now risen over a quarter of a percent in the last two weeks, and plugging the higher number into discounted cash flow models inevitably results in lower valuations for most stocks. 
As such, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was down 1.3% and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock were both down 1.1%.  
Outperformers included the big bank stocks, all of whom stand to gain from widening lending margins. They too price their longer-term loans off of bond yields, while the Federal Reserve is set to keep short-term rates anchored close to zero for at least the next two years.PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) stock rose 1.9% in early trading, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock rose 1.6% and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 1.5%.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock also outperformed, rising 0.6% after the Food and Drug Administration said that its one-shot vaccine against Covid-19 is safe and effective. The news is likely to lead to a swift authorization for emergency use from regulators, providing more competition for the likes of  Pfizer  and  Moderna . Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) stock lost 0.5% while Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock lost 2.4%.
Elsewhere, Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) stock extended its decline, albeit at a slower pace, falling another 9.2% after failing to win a federal contract for electric delivery vehicles that many had bet on. The stock had lost over half its value on Tuesday, with circuit-breakers being activated at regular intervals. The order went instead to rival Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK), whose stock rose 6.8% in early trading.
With crude oil and gas prices still underpinned by a weak dollar and suggestions of sustained bottlenecks in the wake of the Texas cold snap, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 5.0% to its highest in a year."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The main processor for U.S. stock trades said on Wednesday it supports an effort to shorten the settlement cycle for securities to help reduce market risk, an area that has been under scrutiny in the wake of the  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) trading frenzy.
The time it takes to settle a stock trade, or when then buyer must make the payment and the seller must deliver the security, is currently two days after the transaction happens.
Reducing that time to one day after the transaction would significantly cut costs for brokers, reduce market risk, and lower margin requirements, especially during times of high volatility, said the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC).
Settlement times were in the spotlight following the recent volatility around so-called meme stocks, when a flood of retail trading drove GameStop and other shares to extreme highs, squeezing hedge funds like Melvin Capital that had bet against them.
The social media-fueled rally was hampered when Robinhood Financial and some other retail brokerages placed trading restrictions on the frothiest of the stocks after a DTCC subsidiary raised collateral requirements to guarantee trades in those names.
If settlement occurred in real time, collateral would not have been an issue, Robinhood Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev argued during a Feb 18. Congressional hearing on the matter.
The DTCC said it had the capability to move to same-day settlement, but industry participants favored a move to settlement one day after transactions occur, which could be done with existing technology and would cut the volatility component of collateral requirements by 41%.

""We are looking to keep the impact on the industry at a minimum, but give the biggest bang for the buck in terms of margin reduction and capital efficiency,"" Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services at the DTCC said in an interview.

Norwegian last year won protection from bankruptcy in both Norway and Ireland, where most of its assets are registered, and is aiming to emerge with fewer aircraft and less debt as it plots a future beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under a multi-year deal signed in 2012 and revised several times since, Airbus was to deliver 100 jets to Norwegian, and according to the aircraft maker's financial filings the company still has 88 narrow-body jets on order.
""We have agreed, judge, in the last short while, the terms of a consent order,"" Norwegian Air lawyer Brian Kennedy told the court.
Among the terms, Airbus will keep any prepayments it has received and will still be owed 600,000 pounds ($847,800) by Norwegian, he said.
The deal comprised both Norwegian Air and its asset-owning subsidiary Arctic Aviation, Kennedy said, although he did not specify the number of aircraft involved.
A lawyer representing Airbus confirmed to the court that the two sides had reached an agreement.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Norwegian had contractual commitments amounting to $9.55 billion for the purchase of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus aircraft from 2020 to 2027, according to the carrier's financial filings.
Last June however, Norwegian unilaterally terminated its remaining orders with Boeing for 97 aircraft and sought compensation for the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jets and technical problems with 787 Dreamliners.
Boeing has contested the move and also made counterclaims against Norwegian, documents filed by the airline show.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 07:50AM ET</span>",Australia's antitrust chief claims victory after Facebook standoff,"By Byron Kaye and Colin Packham
CANBERRA (Reuters) - The architect of Australia's laws forcing Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to pay media companies for content claimed victory on Wednesday, though critics said last-minute changes to appease Facebook favoured Big Tech over smaller news outlets.
After tense negotiations prompted Facebook to cut off news in the country last week, Australia offered a host of technical concessions and the social media giant said it would restore news as the revamped bill looked set to become law this week.
While Facebook said its concerns had been met and opposition lawmakers warned that smaller media players may be overlooked, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chair Rod Sims said the bargaining power imbalance had been righted.
""The changes the government's done are things that either don't matter much or are just to clarify things that, at least in Facebook's mind, were unclear,"" Sims, who helped draft the original laws, told Reuters.
""Whatever they say, they need news. It keeps people on their platform longer. They make more money,"" he said.
The endorsement from Australia's top antitrust regulator will bolster the government's argument that its hardline approach worked and may offer encouragement to countries such as Canada and Britain which have said they plan similar laws.
Other countries have introduced legislation forcing so-called Big Tech players to negotiate with media companies for licensing fees for links that draw traffic, and advertising revenue, to their platforms. 
However, Australia will be the first country where a government arbitrator effectively sets the rates tech giants will have to pay if negotiations with media companies fail.
The last-minute changes include an extra two-month mediation period between any failed talks and state intervention and give the government discretion to release Facebook from the process if it proves it has made a ""significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry"".
Facebook's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said the company had ""erred on the side of over-enforcement"" with its news blackout - which inadvertently blocked some government pages - because it needed to act quickly before the new legislation was introduced.
The agreed changes ""mean fair negotiations (with publishers) are encouraged without the looming threat of heavy-handed and unpredictable arbitration,"" he wrote in a blogpost he internet needs new rules that work for everyone, not just for big media corporations. B, adding: ""The internet needs new rules that work for everyone, not just for big media corporations."" 
SMALL MEDIA, BIG CONCERNS
While the Australian Senate backed the changes before sending the amended bill back to the lower house, where it was expected to pass soon, opposition lawmakers and smaller media firms warned that giving the government power to spare tech giants its involvement could leave niche outlets without compensation.
""The big (media) players could successfully negotiate with Facebook or Google. The minister then doesn't designate them, and all the little players miss out,"" independent senator Rex Patrick, who opposed the amended legislation, told Reuters.
Lee O'Connor, owner and editor of regional newspaper The Coonamble Times, said the changes appeared to weaken safeguards for smaller players.
""It's the vagueness of the language that's the main concern, and the minister's discretion is part of that,"" O'Connor said.
Antitrust regulator Sims dismissed the concerns.
""If Google and Facebook don't do deals with even the smaller players, my view is they'll get designated (as subject to intervention),"" he said.
If Google and Facebook did deals with all Australia's major outlets, which account for up to 90% of the country's media content, ""why the hell would they muck it all up and not do the other 10%? It makes no sense,"" Sims said.
DEAL DELUGE
After threatening to withdraw its search engine from Australia over the laws, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google instead struck deals with most large Australian publishers, including a global arrangement with News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA).
Television broadcaster and newspaper publisher Seven West Media became the first media company to announce a Facebook deal, saying late on Tuesday it had signed a letter of intent to reach a content supply agreement within 60 days.
Rival Nine Entertainment Co said on Wednesday it was now in talks with Facebook. 
Clegg said Facebook had invested $600 million since 2018 to support the news industry, and planned at least $1 billion more over the next three years. 
""Facebook is more than willing to partner with news publishers. We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function,"" he said.

He said Facebook was in active negotiations with publishers in France and Germany after agreeing deals for content in Britain and the United States.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",Show us the plan: Investors push companies to come clean on climate,"By Simon Jessop, Matthew Green and Ross Kerber
LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - In the past, shareholder votes on the environment were rare and easily brushed aside. Things could look different in the annual meeting season starting next month, when companies are set to face the most investor resolutions tied to climate change in years. 
Those votes are likely to win more support than in previous years from large asset managers seeking clarity on how executives plan to adapt and prosper in a low-carbon world, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen activist investors and fund managers. 
In the United States, shareholders have filed 79 climate-related resolutions so far, compared with 72 for all of last year and 67 in 2019, according to data compiled by the Sustainable Investments Institute and shared with Reuters. The institute estimated the count could reach 90 this year. 
Topics to be put to a vote at annual general meetings (AGMs) include calls for emissions limits, pollution reports and ""climate audits"" that show the financial impact of climate change on their businesses.
A broad theme is to press corporations across sectors, from oil and transport to food and drink, to detail how they plan to reduce their carbon footprints in coming years, in line with government pledges to cut emissions to net zero by 2050.
""Net-zero targets for 2050 without a credible plan including short-term targets is greenwashing, and shareholders must hold them to account,"" said billionaire British hedge fund manager Chris Hohn, who is pushing companies worldwide to hold a recurring shareholder vote on their climate plans.
Many companies say they already provide plenty of information about climate issues. Yet some activists say they see signs more executives are in a dealmaking mood this year. 
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) said on Feb. 11 it would become the first oil and gas major to offer such a vote, following similar announcements from Spanish airports operator Aena, UK consumer goods company Unilever (NYSE:UL) and U.S. rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
While most resolutions are non-binding, they often spur changes with even 30% or more support as executives look to satisfy as many investors as possible.
""The demands for increased disclosure and target-setting are much more pointed than they were in 2020,"" said Daniele Vitale, the London-based head of governance for Georgeson, which advises corporations on shareholder views.
COMPANIES WARM THE WORLD
While more and more companies are issuing net-zero targets for 2050, in line with goals set out in the 2015 Paris climate accord, few have published interim targets. A study https://www.southpole.com/news/survey-just-1-in-10-businesses-have-backed-up-net-zero-ambitions-with-science-based-targets from sustainability consultancy South Pole showed just 10% of 120 firms it polled, from varied sectors, had done so.
""There's too much ambiguity and lack of clarity on the exact journey and route that companies are going to take, and how quickly we can actually expect movement,"" said Mirza Baig, head of investment stewardship at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.
Data analysis from Swiss bank J Safra Sarasin, shared with Reuters, shows the scale of the collective challenge.
Sarasin studied the emissions of the roughly 1,500 firms in the MSCI World Index, a broad proxy for the world's listed companies. It calculated that if companies globally did not curb their emissions rate, they would raise global temperatures by more than 3 degrees Celsius by 2050. 
That is well short of the Paris accord goal of limiting warming to ""well below"" 2C, preferably 1.5C. 
https://tmsnrt.rs/3iJoUC8
At an industry level, there are large differences, the study found: If every company emitted at the same level as the energy sector, for example, the temperature rise would be 5.8C, with the materials sector - including metals and mining - on course for 5.5C and consumer staples - including food and drink - 4.7C. 
https://tmsnrt.rs/3c13GhC
The calculations are mostly based on companies' reported emissions levels in 2019, the latest full year analysed, and cover Scope 1 and 2 emissions - those caused directly by a company, plus the production of the electricity it buys and uses.
'TAILWIND ON CLIMATE'
Sectors with high carbon emissions are likely to face the most investor pressure for clarity.
In January, for example, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) - long an energy industry laggard in setting climate goals - disclosed its Scope 3 emissions, those connected to use of its products. 
This prompted the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) to withdraw a shareholder resolution seeking the information.
Calpers' Simiso Nzima, head of corporate governance for the $444 billion pension fund, said he saw 2021 as a promising year for climate concerns, with a higher likelihood of other companies also reaching agreements with activist investors.
""You're seeing a tailwind in terms of climate change.""
However, Exxon has asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to skip votes on four other shareholder proposals, three related to climate matters, according to filings to the SEC. They cite reasons such as the company having already ""substantially implemented"" reforms.
An Exxon spokesman said it had ongoing discussions with its stakeholders, which led to the emissions disclosure. He declined to comment on the requests to skip votes, as did the SEC, which had not yet ruled on Exxon's requests as of late Tuesday. 
'A CRUMB BUT A SIGN'
Given the influence of large shareholders, activists are hoping for more from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest investor with $8.7 trillion under management, which has promised a tougher approach to climate issues.
Last week, BlackRock called for boards to come up with a climate plan, release emissions data and make robust short-term reduction targets, or risk seeing directors voted down at the AGM.
It backed a resolution at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)'s AGM, unusually held in October, which asked the company to report on efforts to eliminate deforestation in its supply chains, helping it pass with 68% support. 
""It's a crumb but we hope it's a sign of things to come"" from BlackRock, said Kyle Kempf, spokesman for resolution sponsor Green Century Capital Management in Boston.
Asked for more details about its 2021 plans, such as if it might support Hohn's resolutions, a BlackRock spokesman referred to prior guidance that it would ""follow a case-by-case approach in assessing each proposal on its merits"".
Europe's biggest asset manager, Amundi, said last week it, too, would back more resolutions.
Vanguard, the world's second-biggest investor with $7.1 trillion under management, seemed less certain, though.
Lisa Harlow, Vanguard's stewardship leader for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, called it ""really difficult to say"" whether its support for climate resolutions this year would be higher than its traditional rate of backing one in ten.
'THERE WILL BE FIGHTS'
Britain's Hohn, founder of $30 billion hedge fund TCI, aims to establish a regular mechanism to judge climate progress via annual shareholder votes.
In a ""Say on Climate"" resolution, investors ask a company to provide a detailed net zero plan, including short-term targets, and put it to an annual non-binding vote. If investors aren't satisfied, they will then be in a stronger position to justify voting down directors, the plan holds. 
Early signs suggest the drive is gaining momentum. 
Hohn has already filed at least seven resolutions through TCI. The Children's Investment Fund Foundation, which Hohn founded, is working with campaign groups and asset managers to file more than 100 resolutions over the next two AGM seasons in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia. 

""Of course, not all companies will support the Say on Climate,"" Hohn told pension funds and insurance companies in November. ""There will be fights, but we can win the votes.""

277,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>","ExxonMobil to sell some UK, North Sea assets to HitecVision for over $1 billion","(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) said on Wednesday it would sell its non-operating interest in its UK and North Sea exploration and production assets to private-equity fund HitecVision for more than $1 billion. 
Exxon has been looking to sell its oil and gas assets since late 2019, seeking to free up cash to focus on a handful of mega-projects.
The deal includes ownership interests in 14 producing fields operated primarily by Shell (LON:RDSa) as well as interests in the associated infrastructure. Exxon could also receive about $300 million in contingent payments based on a potential for increase in commodity prices.
Exxon's share of production from these fields was about 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, the company said.
Exxon said it would retain its non-operated share in upstream assets in the southern part of the North Sea as well as its interest in the Shell Esso gas and liquids (SEGAL) infrastructure, which supplies ethane to the company's Fife ethylene plant.
HitecVision, in partnership with Eni, had bought Exxon's Norwegian North Sea assets for $4.5 billion in 2019.

Initially, Exxon hoped to raise more than $2 billion from the sale, which was planned for late 2019. In June 2020 sources told Reuters that the portfolio was more likely to fetch $1 to $1.5 billion given the oil price weakness last year.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",Brazil distributors scramble for diesel amid Petrobras shakeup,"By Marta Nogueira
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian fuel distributors are scrambling to secure diesel supplies for March and April after state-run oil company Petrobras said it would not fully meet their demand, adding to uncertainty amid a sudden management shakeup.
National oil industry regulator ANP confirmed to Reuters that distributors are searching for alternative diesel supplies after Petrobras turned down their orders, but the agency played down concerns of diesel shortages during a bumper soy harvest.
Fuel importers association Abicom said domestic prices set by the state firm have lagged a rebound in global markets so much that importing is unprofitable.
Outgoing Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco has resisted importing fuel to sell at a loss, as the state firm formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA did in past decades. But his efforts to raise prices at the pump this month drew the ire of President Jair Bolsonaro, who named his replacement on Friday.
The transition adds to uncertainty for distributors and importers now speculating about a new Petrobras pricing policy.
""Either there's going to be a shortage of product or Petrobras will need to get heavily involved to supply the market and suffer the losses,"" said Thadeu Silva, head of oil and gas at consultancy INTL FCStone.
Petrobras declined to say if it would meet distributors' demand for fuel in coming months. The company said it had informed customers about its diesel supplies for March, respecting the volumes and periods stipulated in contracts.
After Petrobras lost tens of billions of dollars over the past decade selling imported fuel at a loss, its bylaws were amended in 2017 to require that the government compensate it for such operations - a rule that has not yet been put to the test.

""Today we see no risk of shortage (in March and April),"" said ANP Director Rodolfo Saboia, adding that the agency will be monitoring the situation.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Tuesday 15 points, or 0.1% higher, after wiping out an earlier 360-point loss. The S&P 500 also reversed a 1.8% loss to end the day just higher, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.5%, after dropping as much as 3.9% earlier. 
The prime driver for this reversal, and Wednesday’s early gains, was Fed chief Jerome Powell, who eased concerns of an early policy shift by the central bank by stating that inflation was not an issue of concern and the economic outlook was “highly uncertain”.
“The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,” Powell said, in the text of his testimony delivered Tuesday to the Senate Banking Committee.
Powell heads to Capitol Hill again on Wednesday, where lawmakers in the House prepare to vote on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by new President Joe Biden.
Away from Washington,  retailer Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) reports quarterly results Wednesday after the close, following on from rival  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), which registered a jump in same-store sales of almost 25% in the fourth quarter on Tuesday.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) also reports earnings Wednesday, and investors will be waiting to hear what the chipmaker says about the current shortage affecting everyone from car makers to game developers. 
The economic data slate centers around the housing market Wednesday, with January's new home sales due at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT). 
Oil prices rebounded from earlier losses Wednesday, resuming their recent upward trend after Tuesday’s surprise rise in both crude and gasoline stockpiles.
The official supply numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due at 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT). These will be studied carefully after the American Petroleum Institute said crude inventories rose by over 1 million barrels last week, and gasoline inventories climbed by 66,000 barrels.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $61.36 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.2% to $65.28.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,807.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2165.

It is the week's second such incident, despite pressure on Australian iron ore miners to show they have improved practices to manage important sites after Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) destroyed two sacred rock shelters for a mine expansion last May. 
Fortescue had state government permission to clear the land in the Weelamurra Creek area registered as sacred to the Wintawari Guruma people, on condition that community elders were present to perform salvage and cultural rites, four documents reviewed by Reuters showed. 
But an administrative error led to land clearing works earlier than scheduled on Feb. 1 in the absence of the representatives, Fortescue Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines said in a statement. 
""I have spoken to Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation (WGAC) Chairman Glen Camille regarding this incident to personally express my regret and sincere apology on behalf of Fortescue,"" she said. 
""We have carried out a full investigation into the matter which has shown that this unfortunately occurred as a result of an administrative error...We have paused all clearing works at this site as we work with WGAC on the matter."" 
Gaines did not provide detail on the nature of the administrative error.
In a statement, the community corporation said, ""WGAC members are disappointed by FMG’s actions, particularly after investing so much time negotiating an outcome with them that included elders being present during the destruction.
It added, ""WGAC is concerned by yet another example of poor conduct by a mining company and the apparent disregard for Aboriginal cultural heritage.""
WGAC chairman Glenn Camille requested that the Western Australian government prosecute Fortescue, in a letter to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Ben Wyatt, reviewed by Reuters. 
""We sincerely hope that you and the next Minister for Aboriginal Affairs decide to send a message to the mining industry about the importance of protecting our Indigenous heritage.""
In a statement, Wyatt said that he had been advised that an alleged breach was under official investigation.
""The matter is being treated very seriously and with utmost priority by the Department. I trust that the investigation will be managed expeditiously and concluded swiftly.""
Earlier this week, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) said it was investigating how a rock fall damaged a registered site at its South Flank operations that was not part of active mining operations.
Last year's Rio Tinto destruction cost its chief executive and two senior leaders their jobs, and sparked a parliamentary inquiry.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 05:50AM ET</span>","Indian retail investors dabble in stocks directly, ditching mutual funds","By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Chris Thomas
(Reuters) - India's retail investors are ditching mutual funds to put money directly into stock markets, lured by soaring share prices and lacklustre returns at mutual funds in recent years.
Domestic investors have withdrawn 275 billion rupees ($3.80 billion) from equity mutual funds in the year to Feb. 16, according data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), after dumping a total of 545 billion rupees in 2020. 
Meanwhile, the number of 'demat' accounts, which contain retail investor holdings in securities in electronic format, increased 27% last year to stand at 49.8 million at the end of 2020.
(Graphic: Mutual fund redemptions vs rising demat accounts: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqgdjwvx/mf%20redemtions.jpg)
""In India, something special is taking place. Retailers have taken money from domestic funds and started to buy stocks themselves. They have driven the market higher,"" said Herald van der Linde (NYSE:LIN), head of equity strategy, Asia Pacific, at HSBC.
The rise in demat accounts comes as millennials, faced with job losses and pay cuts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, dabble in stock markets directly to try to make some extra income while staying at home.
A large number of blue-chip shares were available at multi-year lows after a sell-off in March last year. Some of the most battered large-cap stocks, such as Reliance Industries and State Bank of India, have more than doubled in price since March.
""An investor like me won't go with a mutual fund in this scenario, especially large cap mutual funds. I'd prefer to invest directly,"" said Ashish Mishra, a retail investor based in Gurgaon.
The aversion towards mutual funds is also due to their higher management fees and low returns.
According to Refinitiv Lipper data, the average return over a 3-year period for the 498 mutual funds surveyed was 2%, much lower than the 12% return for the NSE Nifty 50 index in that period.
(Graphic: Equity mutual funds vs Nifty 50 returns: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjxqknvr/nifty%20returns.jpg)
A polarised rally has also affected the performance of mutual funds. The top 10 stocks by market capitalisation in the Nifty 50 index accounted for two-thirds of the price gains over the past year.

""Investors who bought into stocks during the pandemic have seen gains of 30-40%, so we believe this trend of investing direct versus mutual funds will continue,"" said Nikhil Kamath, co-founder and chief investment officer of India's biggest stock broker Zerodha and asset management firm True Beacon.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 05:15AM ET</span>","HSBC, Barclays challenged over bond linked to Vietnamese coal project","By Simon Jessop, Melanie Burton and Aaron Sheldrick
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), which have pledged to stop financing new coal projects, have been challenged by a legal group over a Japanese bond it says will contribute to the financing of coal-fired power in Vietnam.
Both banks have come under pressure from investors keen to see them do more to help the world shift to a low-carbon economy and HSBC faces a shareholder vote over its fossil fuel financing at its annual meeting in April.
While both have policies to refrain from financing new coal plants, the complaint focuses on their alleged role in helping to fund others who go on to finance such projects.
Legal experts say this could be just the first in a series of challenges to banks over indirect financing at odds with their climate commitments.
The bond, a 250 million pound ($354.35 million) issue by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) earlier this month, will support expansion of the Vung Ang 2 power project, the Australian-based Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) said in a letter to the banks seen by Reuters.
HSBC declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Barclays and JBIC did not immediately return requests for comment.
Acting on behalf of climate-focused think-tank the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute (AFII), the EDO said it was concerned that the promotion and issuance of the bond had ""entailed possible breaches"" of the banks' legal duties.
It highlighted reported comments from both banks that they would no longer finance the expansion of coal-fired power stations.
While the JBIC money was not raised specifically to fund Vung Ang 2, the EDO said previous statements from JBIC have made clear the money would go into the pot from which funding for the Vietnamese project would be drawn.
The complaint also highlighted concerns with the bond prospectus, including that it did not explicitly mention the funds could be used to fund Vung Ang 2.
In view of JBIC's significant investments in fossil fuel projects, it said the prospectus failed to highlight the potential risk that some of the assets could become uneconomic given the world's transition to a low-carbon economy.
DENIAL OF BREACH
AFII founder Ulf Erlandsson said he had received an initial reply from both banks denying a breach of their coal policy. HSBC declined to comment on the prospectus while Barclays said the prospectus had met all applicable rules.
Erlandsson said he would go back to the banks to clarify elements of their response before deciding on the next steps. Previous EDO complaints have resulted in formal court challenges, including with Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum and Santos.
Thom Wetzer, professor of law and finance and director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme at the University of Oxford, said the EDO's letter was unlikely to be the last challenge to banks over climate.
""Investors expect banks to make credible commitments to decarbonise their business and to stick to them. When they fail to do so, and non-legal challenges do not sufficiently change that outcome, investors appear increasingly willing to take legal action to expose and end such greenwashing.""
Xavier Lerin, senior banking analyst at ShareAction, which co-filed the shareholder resolution against HSBC, said the potential use of fungible proceeds from the bond to finance Vung Ang 2 raised questions over HSBC’s coal policy.
""HSBC says it is committed to help its clients transition. But how credible is this commitment if the bank continues to provide financing to top coal financiers and coal developers with absolutely no string(s) attached?""

284,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 05:06AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Lloyds Results Gilded by Reports of Stamp Tax Holiday Extension,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Tuesday's StockBeat ended with the suggestion that Britain's banks offered the safest - if less exciting - all-round reopening bet in Europe right now. Results out on Wednesday from Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) support that case. 
The U.K.'s third-biggest banking group by assets reported earnings well ahead of expectations in the final quarter of 2020, with pretax profit of 792 million pounds ($1.12 billion) as opposed to consensus forecasts of 471 million. It also reinstated its dividend payment at 0.57 pence a share, the maximum allowed by the U.K.'s regulator at present.
Given that the bank's core tier 1 capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - remains at a generous 16.2% even after the payout, it is not hard to imagine dividends rising quickly again as residual concerns about the pandemic fade: Lloyds management only targets a ratio of 13.5%, which is itself a full 2.5 percentage points above what regulators demand. The surplus capital is there, waiting to be returned to shareholders who have had a rough ride over the last year.
Regulatory constraints are one reason why Lloyds (NYSE:LYG) stock remains so far below its pre-pandemic level, despite rising another 1.7% by mid-morning in London to a new 52-week high. Hence the importance of when and how far they will be lifted. 
The outlook on this point is getting better by the day: the phased ending of lockdowns and social distancing requirements by July, announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday - will remove, or at least sharply reduce, the threat of Lloyds' loan book going sour; economic recovery will ensure that the Bank of England can slowly dial down its talk about taking interest rates below zero, which would have the same negative effect on lending margins that it has had in the Eurozone. 
To cap it all, the U.K. government is about to extend the tax holiday on house purchases in its annual budget, according to a report in The Times on Wednesday. That will help keep the U.K. housing market's show on the road, ensuring that the U.K.'s biggest mortgage lender can keep churning out new loans for at least another quarter, and possibly longer: Lloyds said on Wednesday that its mortgage lending business started 2021 with ""a strong pipeline"" after accelerating growth in the second half of last year.
The day will come, of course, when the government can no longer kick that can down the road. However, by that time, the higher-margin businesses of consumer and auto lending should be firing again. One of the standout slides from Lloyds' Q4 presentation is the sharp deleveraging by households last year, with deposits growing over 10% and credit card balances falling by 19%. That suggests ample scope for growth as people regain their freedom to spend.
Lloyds's story is common to many retail-heavy banks in Europe, but its history of relatively solid governance has generally enabled it to trade at a sizeable premium to them. However, Investing.com data suggest it's currently trading at a substantial discount - at 0.57 times book value compared to 0.75 for peers. Barring disasters with the reopening - which can not be ruled out given the cack-handedness of the government's pandemic management last year - that anomaly should be short-lived.

The plan, dubbed Fenice 190 to celebrate the company's 190th anniversary, will initially address Italy, France and Germany and will then be extended to all the other European countries where Generali operates, the company added in a statement. 
The European economy shrank by 6.8% in the euro area and 6.4% in the 27-nation European Union in 2020, according to preliminary data from statistical office Eurostat, due to the impact of Covid on businesses and households.
Eurostat said this was the deepest annual contraction since the series started in 1995. According to analysts European economy is heading for another decline in the first quarter of this year.
Generali said it has already identified 10 investment opportunities for a total commitment of 1.05 billion euros to support European SMEs, green housing, digital infrastructures, health and energy transition. All those initiatives will have a strong focus on environmental and social sustainability, it added.
In addition to this initial amount, an annual commitment of 500 million euros will be made over the next five years.
The plan is open to the contribution of third-party funds and institutional investors.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",UK's Lloyds targets wealth push and office cuts after profit drop,"By Iain Withers and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY)'s outgoing Chief Executive António Horta-Osório set out fresh targets to expand the lender's insurance and wealth business and further cut costs, as the bank resumed a dividend despite a sharp fall in profits for 2020.
Britain's biggest domestic lender reported pretax profits of 1.2 billion pounds ($1.7 billion), well down on 4.4 billion pounds the previous year, after pandemic lockdowns shrank household spending and drove up provisions for bad loans.
But it still beat the average of analyst forecasts of 905 million pounds.
The strategy update showed Lloyds aimed to offset pressure on profits, including from wafer thin central bank interest rates, by axing costs further and increasing income from fee-based products such as wealth management and corporate banking.
The squeeze led net income to fall nearly 3 billion pounds over the year to 14.4 billion.
Horta-Osório said the bank would increase funds from insurance and wealth customers by 25 billion pounds by 2023 and expands its currency and rates services for corporate customers.
Lloyds will also cut office space by 20% within three years, the second British lender to unveil such plans this week after HSBC announced a 40% cut to its footprint as banks look to capitalise on remote working brought on by the pandemic.
Lloyds said its overall costs would be trimmed below 7.5 billion pounds by the end of this year and it would invest 900 million pounds on digitising more of its services.
The bank's shares were up 2% at 09.47 GMT, amid a 0.6% fall in the wider FTSE 350 index of banks.
""Faced with lower margins, higher volumes seem to be the answer for Lloyds,"" said Susannah Streeter, analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
Horta-Osório, who led a turnaround at the bank after its bailout in the financial crisis, is leaving Lloyds after a decade to stand for election as chairman of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in April.
HSBC executive Charlie Nunn is set to replace Horta-Osório, starting in August.
ENCOURAGING SIGNS
Similar to the situation at rivals HSBC, NatWest and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Lloyds' profits were dented by bad loan provisions. 
Lloyds set aside 4.2 billion pounds to cover loans expected to sour, although this was less than the 4.5 billion to 5.5 billion pound range previously given.
Lloyds Chief Financial Officer William Chalmers said the pace of Britain's vaccine rollout and the government's roadmap to phase out lockdowns were encouraging and paved the way for better UK growth than the 3% core forecast by the bank for 2021.
The bank said it would pay a 0.57 pence dividend per share, the maximum allowed by the Bank of England and above a forecast of 0.53 pence.
Chalmers said the bank would consider an interim dividend halfway through the year and revert to a ""stable dividend policy"" from next year depending on economic conditions.
The bank grew its mortgage book by 7.2 billion pounds, as it capitalised on a pandemic-driven boom in home sales.
The bank's core capital ratio, a key measure of financial resilience, increased to 16.2% compared to 15.2% in September.
Costs for past misdeeds chipped into profits, including an 85 million pound charge for processing delays on a final batch of mis-sold payment insurance claims and 159 million pounds for compensation and costs for historic fraud at its HBOS Reading branch.

Horta-Osório's pay package for 2020 fell to 3.4 million pound, after he and other executives waived bonuses for the year due to the pandemic. He was paid 4.7 million pounds the previous year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Digital health checks will be vital to a recovery in foreign travel from the COVID-19 pandemic, Britain's Heathrow airport said on Wednesday, after a collapse in passenger numbers saw it plunge to a 2 billion pound ($2.8 billion) loss last year.
The UK government said on Monday trips abroad could restart in mid-May as its vaccination campaign kicks in, sparking a surge in holiday bookings.
It is also looking into a digital health passport or app to help ease restrictions, while conceding the benefits have to be weighed against potential risks to civil liberties. 
But Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye said digital technology, and international agreements, would be vital to reviving a travel industry on its knees. 
""It's absolutely critical and that's one of the main things that government needs to work on,"" he said, when asked about a digital health app. 
At present, paper checks on COVID-19 test results and passenger locator forms take 20 minutes per traveller at Heathrow, making travel near impossible should passenger numbers rise from current low levels.
Britain's biggest airport said it was ""very likely"" people would be able to go on their summer holidays, but expects passenger numbers will take time to recover. 
The airport, west of London, is forecasting 25 million passengers in the second half of the year, meaning it would be operating at about 50% capacity. 
Heathrow, owned by Spain's Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority, China Investment Corp and others, last year lost its title as Europe's busiest airport to Paris after its flight schedules shrank more than those of its rivals. 
Passenger numbers plunged 73% to 22 million people last year, with half of those travelling during January and February, before the pandemic shut down global travel in March. 
Heathrow said it had 3.9 billion pounds of liquidity, giving it sufficient resources to keep going with low levels of traffic until 2023, despite the 2 billion loss before tax for 2020. 
The airport urged the government to provide business tax breaks for big airports, something only available to smaller airports so far, and to extend the furlough job support scheme to help it financially before the recovery takes off.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co will replace battery systems in some 82,000 electric vehicles globally due to fire risks - a costly $900 million recall that lays bare the thorny issue of how car and battery makers split the bill when problems arise.
The recall is one of the first mass battery pack replacements conducted by a major automaker.
""It's very significant for both Hyundai and LG as we are in the early stages of the electric vehicle era. How Hyundai handles this will set a precedent not just in South Korea but also for other countries,"" said Lee Hang-koo, senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade.
The recall mostly concerns the Kona EV, Hyundai's biggest-selling electric car which was first recalled late last year for a software upgrade after a spate of fires. One of the recalled Kona EVs caught fire in January, however, and South Korean authorities launched a probe into whether the first recall had been adequate.
LG Energy Solution, a division of LG Chem Ltd which manufactures the batteries, was quick to deflect criticism.
It said in a statement that Hyundai misapplied LG's suggestions for fast-charging logic in the battery management system, adding the battery cell should not be seen as the direct cause of the fire risks. 
South Korea's transport ministry said in a statement that some defects had been found in some battery cells produced at LG Energy's China factory. Hyundai did not comment on the cause of the fires.
Hyundai shares tumbled 3.9% while those for LG Chem closed down 2.8% in line with the broader market.
Analysts said they had been told by Hyundai that an agreement on how to split the costs may be worked out next week. Even so, they thought it might take longer given that reputational stakes were high and the two firms appeared to be at odds over the cause of the fires.
Hyundai declined to comment on LG Energy's statement or provide details on when it will work out costs, saying only it will first wait for the results of the transport ministry's probe.
The recall applies to nearly 76,000 Kona EVs built between 2018 and 2020, including about 25,000 sold in South Korea. Some Ioniq EV models and Elec City buses are also included in the recall.
The estimated 1 trillion won ($900 million) in cost includes 38.9 billion won that was spent on the first recall.
There have been some 15 cases of fires involving the Kona EV - 11 in South Korea, two in Canada and one each in Finland and Austria. 
Kona and Ioniq owners are advised to limit battery charging to 90% of capacity until the battery has been replaced, Hyundai said.

Falling tech stocks pulled Asian markets lower overnight, as recent gains in U.S. Treasury yields put lofty valuations under pressure.
In his testimony before the U.S. Senate, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell did not seem too worried about rising yields, telling Congress they were a statement on the market's confidence in the pandemic recovery.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged back down below its recent one-year high, although it rose as European markets opened.
""Powell’s comments reinforce our view that the increase in inflation expectations is most likely transitory and that higher Treasury yields primarily reflect optimism over the economic recovery and the reflation trade,"" wrote UBS chief investment officer for global wealth management, Mark Haefele, in a note to clients.
""Investors should expect an extended period in which interest rates remain below inflation.""

U.S. futures pointed to a weaker open for Wall Street, with futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq in decline for the seventh consecutive day.
Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.
Bitcoin recovered somewhat, up 3.3% at around $50,500 at 0846 GMT, but was still down 13.5% from the all-time high above $58,000 it reached on Sunday.

One year on from the start of the COVID-19 market crash, financial market participants were generally upbeat about the prospect of vaccine rollouts, lockdowns ending and economies re-opening.
Strong exports and solid construction activity helped the German economy to grow by a stronger-than-expected 0.3% in the final quarter of last year, the Federal Statistics Office said on Wednesday, revising up an earlier estimate.
U.S. consumer confidence increased in February and Britons rushed to book foreign holidays after the government laid out plans to relax restrictions. But EU government leaders will agree on Thursday to maintain curbs on non-essential travel within the bloc.
The dollar was down 0.1% versus a basket of currencies at 0849 GMT, while euro-dollar was slightly up at $1.2165.
The benchmark 10-year German Bund was a touch lower at -0.325%.
Elsewhere, oil prices slipped after industry data showed a surprise build in U.S. crude stocks last week.
Brent crude futures have still gained 26% so far in 2021 and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures have risen 27%.

At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, while the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.7%.
Bullish exports and solid construction activity helped the German economy to grow by a stronger-than-expected 0.3% in the final quarter of last year, a revision higher from an earlier estimate of 0.1% growth.
The 2020 full-year GDP figure for Europe's largest economy was also revised higher to -4.9% from -5.0%.
Also helping the tone was the news that French manufacturing sentiment rose in February, for the third consecutive month, albeit by less than expected.
Turning to the corporate sector, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) stock rose 1.3% after the U.K.-based bank set out fresh targets to expand its insurance and wealth business and further cut costs, as the bank resumed a dividend despite a sharp fall in profits and rise in bad loan provisions for 2020.
On the flip side, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock fell 1.4% after Reuters reported that the drugmaker has told the European Union it expects to deliver less than half the Covid-19 vaccines it was contracted to supply in the second quarter.
Puma (DE:PUMG) stock fell 3.2% after the sportswear maker's CEO Bjorn Gulden said the pandemic will still be a drag on business for the first half of the current year. 
Across the Atlantic, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell kept a dovish tone during his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, as he batted away worries around higher interest rates and inflation.
However, despite Powell’s reassurance, some investors are beginning to pull forward their rate-hike expectations, predicting stronger-than-expected economic growth and a jump in inflation on the back of the proposed additional stimulus. 
Fed funds futures now project the first 25 basis point increase in the central bank's key rate by the end of 2022.
Oil prices retreated Wednesday after U.S. stockpiles unexpectedly rose just over 1 million barrels last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute, in the wake of the severe cold snap which hit Texas, the largest crude producing U.S. state, and the other southern states.
Although the wintry conditions shut in production across the region and left millions without power, it also stunted fuel demand from refineries that were forced to shut down.
The official supply numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $61.38 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $64.35.
Elsewhere, gold futures were flat at $1,805.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2167.

Bullish exports and solid construction activity helped the German economy to grow by a stronger-than-expected 0.3% in the final quarter of last year, official data showed.
The benchmark euro-zone stock index STOXX 600 rose 0.2%, with travel and construction stocks leading gains.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) fell 1.3% after it told the European Union that it expects to deliver less than half the COVID-19 vaccines it was contracted to supply in the second quarter, an EU official told Reuters.

German sportswear company Puma dropped nearly 4% to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after saying it expects a heavy impact on its results from pandemic lockdowns through the end of the second quarter.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 02:25AM ET</span>","Analysis: High-flying ARK ETF falters, sparks fear of ripple effect","By David Randall and Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The steep slowdown in momentum stocks over the last week has been especially painful for ARK Invest's Cathie Wood, the top stock picker of 2020. 
The $26.6 billion ARK Innovation ETF, which analysts say is beloved by retail investors, is down nearly 11% over the last week, nearly 10 times the slide in the benchmark S&P 500, as companies in its portfolio, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, have stumbled. The fund has large positions in so-called momentum stocks, which tend to attract investors based on thematic trends rather than fundamentals or valuation. 
""It's a reminder for some investors that ETFs that can go up more than 100% in a year can come down just as hard,"" said Jimmy Lee, chief executive officer of Wealth Consulting Group, who has invested in the fund for some clients of his Las Vegas-based firm.
ARK's Innovation fund successfully rode a wave of momentum investing during the pandemic, posting gains of 144% and attracting $14.84 billion in inflows over the past 12 months, according to Lipper data. It was the top performer among all actively managed U.S. equity funds, according to Morningstar. 
Still, headwinds are growing for some of the fund's holdings. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields are near 1-year highs as investors increasingly position for faster U.S. growth, putting pressure on momentum stocks through higher interest rates. 
Wood, who is CEO and chief investment officer, seemed to suggest this could prove to be an obstacle in a Feb. 17 interview on CNBC. 
""If rates were to take a sharp turn up, then we would see a valuation reset and our portfolios would be prime candidates for that valuation reset of course,"" she said. 
Still, Wood added to positions in Tesla on Tuesday, according to a Bloomberg interview. 
Wood founded the firm in 2014 to focus on innovative companies after working as chief investment officer of thematic portfolios at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) and a co-manager of global portfolios at Tupelo Capital Management. The firm shot to prominence over the last year due to its performance and inflows.
Some investors, however, worry that the fund's inflated size may help accelerate a broader market sell-off. 
A rash of formerly high-flying bets turning sour could accelerate a negative feedback loop in the fund's holdings, given its large positions and widespread popularity, Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a recent research note. 
The fund may also be sensitive to declines in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin despite having no direct link, ""indicating vaguely that they do respond to the same risk drivers and thus might be owned by the same investors,"" he said. 
Bitcoin tumbled nearly 14% on Tuesday and is down nearly 20% from the record high it hit Sunday. The ARK Innovation fund fell 3.3% on Tuesday, outpacing the 0.5% decline in the Nasdaq Composite index. 
Wood was unavailable to comment to Reuters. 
VOLATILITY BETS 
Some increased buying of protective options contracts could reflect the fund's nearly 26% rally for the year through Feb. 12 as investors sought to hedge their gains, said Christopher Jacobson, an derivatives strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group.
At the same time, Jacobson said that some investors may be positioning for a decline in momentum stocks favored by retail investors. 
Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, said ARK Innovation's status as an actively managed fund lessens any market-wide impact from redemptions. 

""There is risk that some of the money that flooded in early in 2021 based on triple-digit gains in 2020 will be short-lived. However, we think ARK can manage its cash flow and use the liquidity of some of its large-cap positions to mitigate the impact,"" he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, amid cautious trading as investors digest comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on another busy day for corporate earnings.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.7%.
Fed chief Jerome Powell kept a dovish tone during his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, as he attempted to ease some worries around higher interest rates and inflation.
Powell stated that the U.S. economy remained “a long way” from employment and inflation goals and that interest rates would stay low and bond buying would continue until there was “substantial further progress”.
However, despite Powell’s reassurance, some investors are beginning to pull forward their rate-hike expectations, predicting stronger-than-expected economic growth and a jump in inflation on the back of the proposed additional stimulus will prompt the central bank to adjust its ultra-accommodative stance sooner than currently projected. Fed funds futures now project the first 25 basis point increase in the Fed's key rate by the end of 2022.
“We suspect that the pressure for change will build through the second quarter with a tapering of QE looking increasingly before year-end,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Turning back to Europe, the earnings season continues apace, with numbers expected from the likes of  Accor  (PA:ACCP),  Wolters Kluwer  (AS:WLSNc), Lloyds (LON:LLOY),  William Hill  (LON:WMH),  Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RB) and Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY). 
On the data front, Germany has released a detailed picture of its fourth-quarter growth, positively surprising with growth of 0.3% on the quarter, a fall of 2.7% on the year. 
Oil prices retreated Wednesday after U.S. stockpiles unexpectedly rose last week in the wake of the severe cold snap which hit Texas, the largest crude producing U.S. state, and the other southern states.
Although the wintry conditions shut in production across the region and left millions without power, it also stunted fuel demand from refineries that were forced to shut down.
U.S. crude inventories rose just over 1 million barrels last week, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute, after a fall of 5.8 million barrels the previous week. The official supply numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $61.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $64.38.

301,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 01:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ant investor Boyu Capital targets $6 billion for new private equity fund - sources,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese private equity firm Boyu Capital, an investor in Chinese technology titans including billionaire Jack Ma's Ant Group, is raising a new, China-focused fund targeting as much as $6 billion, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
Its fifth and largest U.S. dollar-denominated fund is likely to close in the near term, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential. 
Boyu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The fundraising by a firm widely associated with tech startups amounts to a high-profile test of investor appetite at a time when heightened oversight of China's tech giants clouds the near-term outlook of those companies.
It follows authorities' November suspension of Ant's Shanghai and Hong Kong dual listing, which delayed the hefty returns early investors such as Boyu could have expected from the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO).
The financial technology giant was set to raise $37 billion at a valuation of $315 billion. Since the suspension, China has sharpened oversight of its home-grown champions which has also exposed their investors to more public scrutiny.
A central bank official said Ant's IPO was suspended to safeguard consumers and investors. Ant has since agreed a restructuring plan with regulators, Reuters reported this month.
ALIBABA AID
Boyu was founded in 2010 by, among others, Alvin Jiang, grandson of former President Jiang Zemin. The firm has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore, and invests in consumer and retail, financial services, healthcare and media and technology sectors, its website showed.
It is known for its 2012 investment in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd which helped Ma buy back half of Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:AABA)'s 40% stake in the e-commerce firm, Reuters has reported.
At $6 billion, Boyu's new fund would be one of the region's largest focusing on China. It last raised $3.6 billion in 2019.
Past investors include Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing and Singapore state investors Temasek Holdings Ltd and GIC Pte Ltd, Reuters has reported. The New York Common Retirement Fund has also been an investor, showed the website of the state comptroller.
Private equity managers in Asia raised $108 billion for 481 new funds last year, down 45% by dollar value from 2019, showed Preqin data, as the COVID-19 pandemic dampened fundraising.
Activity has picked up in 2021 with $21 billion raised via 56 funds so far, the data showed. 
TECH INVESTMENTS 
Boyu invested in Ant's $4.5 billion fundraising in 2016 and $14 billion funding round two years later. In the interim, Ant's valuation leapt from $60 billion to $150 billion.
The private equity firm has invested in other booming Chinese tech and healthcare startups in recent years that generated lucrative returns，two of the people said.
Portfolio firms include ride-hailer Didi Chuxing, artificial intelligence (AI) firm MegVii and live-streaming app operator Kuaishou Technology, according to media reports and public information. 

In January, it participated in a $700 million fundraising by AI firm 4Paradigm, Dealogic data showed.

Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management's letter, seen by Reuters, follows the Japanese conglomerate's conclusion last week that it was not involved in any effort to pressure the Harvard University endowment fund over its vote at the AGM. 
Effissimo said the internal review was ""limited in scope"", and is calling for an extraordinary shareholder meeting to establish a team of legal experts to investigate, saying the voting rights of some shareholders were compromised.
""Our objective is not to re-litigate the results of the 2020 AGM but to seek reassurance that there has not been an assault on the integrity of shareholder voting,"" the letter said.
Reuters previously reported that Hiromichi Mizuno, a Japanese government adviser at the time, had told the Harvard fund that its vote at Toshiba's AGM could be subject to a regulatory probe should it vote against the firm's management.
""Even if the third party acted in isolation, does the Board not have any responsibility to protect its shareholders' rights?"" the letter said.
""Failure to perform a thorough and independent investigation will set a harmful precedent not only for Toshiba but corporate Japan as a whole,"" it said.

Toshiba will hold an extraordinary meeting on March 18 to vote on separate proposals from two large shareholders - Effissimo, which wants the independent probe, and U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, which wants a vote on the company's investment strategy.

303,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 01:18AM ET</span>",Air Cargo Remains Single Bright Spot for Aviation in 2021,"(Bloomberg) -- A year after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic destroyed demand for air travel, cargo remains the sole bright spot.
With fewer passenger planes in the air, there’s less room for freight that’s normally transported in their holds. That’s driven up demand for dedicated cargo jets to help handle the boom driven by online shopping, vaccine distribution and just-in-time supply chains.
Pre-pandemic, 60% of all international air-cargo capacity was in the bellies of passenger aircraft, according to industry group IATA, and 2020 capacity shrank by almost a quarter. That shortage meant rates surged to all-time highs, based on a report by Sanford C. Bernstein.
It’s unclear whether the boomlet for dedicated freighters will last when belly capacity will return with passenger jet frequencies. But Bernstein expects demand to remain strong as airlines only gradually restore full services while battling to repair their balance sheets.
Carriers have even resorted to temporarily converting some passenger jets to freighters, pulling out seats to carry goods inside their main compartments. This strategy is profitable on routes with cargo rates priced above $4 per kilogram, Citi analysts wrote in a report on Feb. 23. Freight costs from Hong Kong to the U.S. were about $6.10 per kilogram in December and $5.30 per kilogram from Shanghai to Germany, they said.
Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. says it’s working flat out and is fully booked until 2022 for so-called passenger-to-freighter conversions. Luxembourg-based Cargo Facts Consulting expects about 90 aircraft to be converted to freighters in both 2021 and 2022.
 United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) expects 2021 to be another strong 12 months after posting record sales last year. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is rapidly expanding its fleet of planes, and recently announced it would buy 11 used Boeing (NYSE:BA) 767-300 jets, the first time the online retail giant has purchased, rather than leased, aircraft for its fast-growing air cargo operation.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 11:35PM ET</span>",FAA orders immediate inspections of some Boeing 777 engines after United failure,"By David Shepardson and Jamie Freed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was ordering immediate inspections of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines before further flights after an engine failed on a United flight on Saturday.
Operators must conduct a thermal acoustic image inspection of the large titanium fan blades located at the front of each engine, the FAA said. 
The National Transportation Safety Board said on Monday that a cracked fan blade from the United Flight 328 engine that caught fire was consistent with metal fatigue.
""Based on the initial results as we receive them, as well as other data gained from the ongoing investigation, the FAA may revise this directive to set a new interval for this inspection or subsequent ones,"" the FAA said.
The engine that failed on the 26-year-old Boeing 777 and shed parts over a Denver suburb on Saturday was a PW4000. The engines are used on 128 planes, or less than 10% of the global fleet of more than 1,600 delivered 777 widebody jets.
In March 2019, after a 2018 United engine failure attributed to fan blade fatigue, the FAA ordered inspections every 6,500 cycles. A cycle is one take-off and landing.
South Korea's transport ministry said on Tuesday it had told its airlines to inspect the fan blades every 1,000 cycles following guidance from Pratt after the latest United incident.
An airline would typically accumulate 1,000 cycles about every 10 months on a 777, according to an industry source familiar with the matter.
The FAA said in 2019 that each inspection was expected to take 22 man-hours and cost $1,870. It did not provide updated estimates on Tuesday.
A spokeswoman for Pratt, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) , said fan blades would need to be shipped to its repair station in East Hartford, Connecticut, for the fresh inspections, including those from airlines in Japan and South Korea.
South Korea's transport ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment after the FAA's order. Korean Air and Asiana Airlines said they would comply with the relevant authorities' directives.
Boeing said it supported the FAA's latest inspection guidance and would work through the process with its customers.
It had earlier recommended that airlines suspend the use of the planes while the FAA identified an appropriate inspection protocol, and Japan imposed a temporary suspension on flights after the Saturday incident. 
Japan's transport ministry said on Wednesday it was examining the FAA directive and had not yet decided what action to take.
The FAA spent the last two days discussing the extent of the inspection requirements, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. 
On Monday, the FAA acknowledged that after a Japan Airlines engine incident in December it had been considering stepping up blade inspections.
United, the only U.S. operator, had temporarily grounded its fleet before the FAA announcement. The airline said on Tuesday it would comply with the airworthiness directive.
United has warned of possible disruptions to its cargo flight schedule in March as it juggles its fleet after its decision to ground 24 Boeing 777-200 planes, according to a notice sent to cargo customers.

Another 28 of United's 777-200 planes were already grounded before the incident on Saturday, amid a plunge in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.

305,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 10:35PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Down, Despite Fed’s Dovish Tune","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Wednesday morning, even as Treasury yields steadied and the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged continued support for the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.93% by 10:29 PM ET (3:29 AM GMT) as markets re-opened after a holiday.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.35% and in Australia, the ASX 200 fell 1.05%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slumped 2.36%. The city’s financial secretary Paul Chan will hand down the budget later in the day.
China’s Shanghai Composite slid 1.55% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.82%.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said during his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the economy remained “a long way” from employment and inflation goals and that rates would stay low and bond buying proceed apace until there was “substantial further progress”.
“The overall takeaway from Powell is that over the next couple of months he will just keep singing the same dovish commitment song … until we see more than half of the 10 million jobs come back, Powell won’t change his tune,” OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya told Reuters.
Powell added that higher bond yields reflect raised economic optimism rather than inflation fears and was also cautiously expectant that the U.S. could return to more-normal activity later in 2021. The comments helped encourage a return of the buy-the-dip mentality that has limited equity drawdowns in recent months, as investors bet on a global economic recover from COVID-19 thanks to vaccine rollouts and U.S. stimulus measures.
“Investors need not doubt that what we are experiencing is a classic cyclical upswing: economic growth contracted last year, the cause of that contraction is now being resolved, and that allows growth, and earnings, to expand, supporting risk assets,” New York Life Investments portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin said in a note.
Ten-year Treasury yields held steady just below their one-year high reached on Monday.
Despite Powell’s reassurance, some investors pulled their rate-hike expectations forward since the start of 2021 and predicted that the Fed would raise interest rates by a quarter point by mid-2023.
In other central bank news, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.25% earlier in the day, in line with expectations. RBNZ also made no changes to its bond purchase program, adding that policy will need to remain stimulatory until inflation is sustained at 2% and employment hits maximum levels.
Bitcoin staged a comeback towards the $50,000 mark as the recent round of volatility highlighted questions about the durability of the cryptocurrency’s recent rally.
Investors are also looking to the meeting of Group of 20, or G20, finance ministers and central bankers, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, due to take place virtually on Friday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - GameStop (NYSE:GME) Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell will step down next month, the video game retailer said on Tuesday, as it focuses on shifting into technology-driven sales in the wake of headline-grabbing big betting in its stock.
GameStop said Bell's resignation was not due to any disagreement with the company relating to its operations, including accounting principles and practices. 
However, a source said that while Bell's exit was unrelated to the recent wild swings in GameStop's stock spurred by retail traders on the Reddit social media site, his departure was initiated by the company. 
The source, a person familiar with the firm's thinking, said GameStop had become dissatisfied with Bell as it works to transform into a technology-oriented business and was not confident he would be the right CFO moving forward.
Bell, who will leave the company on March 26, previously worked at brick-and-mortar retailers Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) and Coldwater Creek and restaurant chain P. F. Chang's China Bistro, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. He did not respond to requests for comment. 
Shares of GameStop fell about 5% to $42.75 in extended trading after the announcement. The stock has risen about 140% this year, after paring most of the gains that sent short sellers scrambling to cover losing bets and saw the company hit a record high of $482.95.
GameStop has also been targeted by shareholders pushing it to focus more on digital sales rather than its mall-based locations.
New directors focused on this strategy have recently joined its board and the source said those additions had helped create more momentum for the CFO transition.

GameStop said it has begun a search for a permanent CFO, adding that it would appoint Chief Accounting Officer Diana Jajeh as interim CFO if a permanent replacement was not found before Bell's departure.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:40PM ET</span>",Top executives of Texas electric grid resign after storm failure,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Top directors of Texas's electric grid operator, who faced sharp criticism from a massive failure of the state power system that left millions last week without light, heat, and water, resigned on Tuesday. 
The board's chairman, vice chairman, two directors and a board nominee of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), all of whom live outside of Texas, resigned effective Wednesday, according to a notice to the state Public Utility Commission. 
The resignations were disclosed the same day ERCOT was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit in a Texas court by customers who claim they lost power and drinkable water because of its failure to ensure the grid could function properly despite the bad weather.
There have been dozens of deaths linked to the severe cold and the state has launched investigations into what caused power generators, electrical transmission systems to shut. Municipal power suppliers and marketers face struggles to pay for costs. Retail power marketer Just Energy issued a going-concern warning due to price increases. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott welcomed the resignations, noting ERCOT has assured it had adequate power ahead of the storm. The state's investigation will ""uncover the full picture of what went wrong"" and ensure it is not repeated, he said in a statement. 
'FREE HAND'
Adrian Shelley, Texas office director of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said changes at ERCOT must go further. 
""Ultimately, lawmakers are responsible for not having created a system in which more reliable energy was available,"" he said. ""The failures that happened were free market failures. Maybe we need regulation to put some guardrails on that."" 
The four directors said they resigned ""to allow state leaders a free hand with future direction and to eliminate distractions, according to a joint letter signed by Chairman Sally Talberg, Vice Chairman Peter Cramton and directors Terry Bulger and Raymond Hepper. 
""Our hearts go out to all Texans who had to go without electricity, heat and water during frigid temperatures and continue to face the tragic consequences of this emergency,"" they added. 
Craig Ivey, former president of Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) Co of New York who was nominated to fill a board vacancy effective Feb. 16, withdrew before he could be seated, according to the notification. Ivey cited concerns over out-of-state directors in his letter. 

A spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas declined immediate comment on the resignations or when the regulator would seek to appoint new members. The PUC appoints the 15-member ERCOT board.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:15PM ET</span>",Analysis: Aussie cannabis firms go capital light as they roll into Europe,"By Shruti Sonal
(Reuters) - A handful of small, young Australian firms are taking a chance on Europe in spite of the region's diverse markets, hopeful that a capital-light investment strategy will diminish their risks.
Europe could be a hard market to crack as regulations vary by country, but favourable rulings for medical marijuana and potential demand are promising factors. The companies reckon that establishing an early base there and working with European partners will help them better negotiate different markets and steal a march on larger North American rivals.
Cann Group and MGC Pharmaceuticals are among many firms that have pushed into Europe, recently signing partnerships to distribute medical marijuana products and also exploring a dual-listing in the region.
Europe is much smaller than North America, already battling oversupply, but the market is a draw for Australian companies that contend with an even smaller home base.
""With prospects still limited largely to just the prescription market (in Australia), exports remain key to marijuana firms,"" said Jo Paterson, founder and CEO of BOD Australia. 
New South Wales-based BOD, valued at just $37 million, entered into distribution partnerships in the United Kingdom, Italy and Netherlands last year. Its stock surged two thirds in the period.
There are indications that regulations around cannabis will continue loosening in Europe.
A ruling https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-11/cp200141en.pdf in November by the European Union's highest court that cannabidiol - the main ingredient in medical marijuana products - is not a narcotic, is crucial for their success in Europe, the companies said.
The United Nations drug agency voting weeks later to remove cannabis from the most tightly-controlled category of narcotics will also help, they said.
Medical marijuana sales in Europe are expected to surge 52% by 2025, hitting $3.1 billion, according to a report by market researcher Brightfield Group and consultant Hanway Associates. 
Graphic: European medical marijuana sales set to rise - https://graphics.reuters.com/CANNABIS-EUROPE/jbyprdrjgpe/chart.png
A recent short-lived Reddit-fuelled rally in cannabis stocks notwithstanding, many investors see them as long-term bets. The cannabis index has risen 30% in the past 12 months, outstripping 16% growth in the S&P 500. 
Graphic: Cannabis stocks rally as more catalysts emerge - https://graphics.reuters.com/AUSTRALIA-CANNABIS/oakperndavr/chart.png
CAPITAL LIGHT
Analysts have warned, however, that Europe's regulatory landscape is complex and could be hard to navigate.
Even bigger firms such as  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) have found it difficult to make profits in the continent and are now scaling back investments, though they say that Europe remains a big opportunity. 
""Policymakers and businesses are tackling issues including cross-border supply chains, standardising manufacturing and laboratory practice, and prescription requirements,"" said Ibrahim Said Abdeldayem, a risk consultant at Arriello.
Some countries, including Germany and the Netherlands have well-established medical cannabis legislation. In others such as Sweden and Belgium, cannabis is strictly prohibited. 
Graphic: Framework of cannabis legalization in Europe - https://graphics.reuters.com/CANNABIS-EUROPE/xklvyomwbvg/chart.png
Australian companies are tackling the diverse markets with a capital-light approach: sticking to partnerships with firms that are better-equipped to handle distribution and rules locally, rather than trying to build processing plants.
Cann Group, the first in Australia to receive a licence to cultivate medicinal cannabis in 2017, said it will focus on Germany and Britain because those markets are expected to grow quickly.
Cann, worth roughly $150 million, is partnering with a London-based company to ensure it is well positioned when the market takes off, its chief operating officer Shane Duncan said.
""Hopefully (Australian investments) will be more thoughtful and more strategic, with a better understanding of the limits of the market, and that it will take time,"" said Jamie Schau, analyst at Brightfield.

""The important part is to get it right in each market and not treat it as a bloc.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) said on Tuesday it will award a multibillion-dollar, 10-year contract to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense to manufacture a new generation of postal delivery vehicles.
Under the initial $482 million investment, Oshkosh Defense, a unit of Oshkosh Corp, will finalize the production design, testing and vehicle tooling necessary prior to vehicle production.
The contract, which could be worth more than $6 billion in total, allows for delivery of between 50,000 to 165,000 of the vehicles over 10 years that will be a mix of internal combustion-powered and battery-electric vehicles. Oshkosh had teamed up with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on its proposal based on a Transit van.
The current gas-guzzling USPS delivery vehicles are nearly 30 years old on average. An audit report last year said USPS spent $5,000 alone per delivery vehicle annually on maintenance costs.
Oshkosh shares rose about 6.1% on the news. Shares of Workhorse Group Inc, a losing bidder that sought to build electric only vehicles, were briefly halted and lost almost half their value after the news.
Colliers Securities analyst Michael Shlisky said Workhorse's loss of the contract is ""really bad news for recent Workhorse investors.""
USPS, which began planning to replace the current fleet in 2015, said the new vehicles could be retrofitted later with ""electric vehicle technologies.""
The USPS fleet has more than 230,000 vehicles, including 190,000 that deliver mail.
New USPS vehicles will begin deliveries in late 2023 and include air conditioning and heating, improved ergonomics, and advanced vehicle safety technology including air bags and 360-degree cameras. They will be able to carry more cargo and better accommodate higher package volumes.

Last month, President Joe Biden vowed to replace the U.S. government’s fleet of roughly 650,000 vehicles with electric models. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the USPS contract decision.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 05:35PM ET</span>",Lucid dream deal turns Klein's $43 million investment into $3.3 billion windfall,"By Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Veteran dealmaker Michael Klein and his partners have made a paper gain of nearly $3.3 billion on their $43 million personal investment in the blank-check acquisition firm they are merging with luxury electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors Inc, according to Reuters calculations.
The gain, within just a few weeks, came from the meteoric rise in the shares of Klein's special purpose acquisition company, SPAC Churchill Capital IV Corp. It is by far the most striking example of a Wall Street insider benefiting from the amateur trading frenzy in shares such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), sweeping the world of SPACs.
Many mom-and-pop investors bought Churchill Capital IV shares hoping for a quick gain, pushing Lucid's implied valuation from $11.75 billion at its nominal deal price to $56.3 billion at Tuesday's closing price.
But while the most lucky investors might have scored a gain of a few fold, Klein and his partners are sitting on a paper gain of more than 7,500%, based on shares in the SPAC they are entitled to.
They are restricted from cashing out for up to 18 months, and the stock could drop considerably within that period, especially if Lucid, which has yet to sell a single car, fails to meet its ambitious production targets.
A representative for Churchill Capital IV declined to comment on Tuesday.
SPAC sponsors are often awarded large stakes in companies they help take public, a form of compensation known on Wall Street as the ""promote."" But the gains in Klein's SPAC shares have made his potential payout unprecedented.
Klein and his partners received 42.85 million warrants in the SPAC which are exercisable at $1 apiece, according to regulatory filings. They were also given 51.75 million so-called founders' shares in the SPAC.
Churchill Capital IV's stock closed at $35, valuing the founders' shares at $1.8 billion. The shares available for purchase through the warrants would also be worth around $1.5 billion.
It is a home run for Klein in his second act on Wall Street. He had worked at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) for 23 years and ran the bank's institutional clients business, where he oversaw its advisory and financing practice.
Klein was once considered a potential successor to former Citigroup Chief Executive Sandy Weill, but left in 2008. He later set up a New York-based boutique advisory firm, M. Klein & Co, and branched out into SPAC investing in 2018.
The Lucid deal helps Klein regain some luster with investors who backed his previous SPAC deal for U.S. healthcare services firm MultiPlan Corp, which is trading down more than 20% since the deal closed.

Shares in his first SPAC deal, a 2019 merger with analytics firm Clarivate Plc, have more than doubled since closing.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 05:06PM ET</span>",Analysis: Boeing alters course in speedy response to engine blowouts,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Two years ago, after a second fatal 737 MAX crash in five months, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co worked behind the scenes to urge aviation regulators not to ground the jet.
Its efforts went as far as the White House, with Boeing's then-Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg calling former U.S. President Donald Trump to assure him the jet was safe.
But Saturday's engine failure on a United Airlines 777, which produced jarring footage of an engine on fire and chunks of metal littering a Denver suburb - but no injuries - triggered a very different response inside Boeing. 
Within a day, Boeing issued a statement urging airlines to suspend use of 777 jets with the same Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines - effectively grounding 128 jets as investigations played out.
The world's largest aerospace company also expressed unequivocal support of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's call for extra inspections and Japan's mandatory suspension of flights.
""If there is anything Boeing has learned from the MAX situation, it's to take action immediately,"" one industry source familiar with Boeing's thinking said. ""Even if that action might result in some loss or embarrassment - do it quickly.""
Boeing's response to Saturday's engine failure reflects the challenges its brand and image face as the company rebuilds its core commercial jet programs and its corporate finances. 
The incident involving the United 777 happened in the United States – the epicenter for Boeing's frayed regulatory and political relationships and a market in which air accidents are exceptionally rare - and draw exceptional attention when they do occur.
Saturday's dramatic incident, and a separate incident the same day in the Netherlands during which another PW4000 engine blew apart on a 747, sparked a storm on social media, where widely shared videos showed jet engines on fire mid-air and a massive engine blade wedged into the roof of a car.
Investigators are focusing attention on the engine, which was designed and built by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit, not Boeing. 
Still, as media reports of the Denver incident broke on Saturday, Boeing officials told the FAA they supported a recommendation for extra inspections, a second source said. That was hours before Boeing issued its public comment, even though an effective grounding would impact other customers flying with PW4000 engines.
“They are trying to rebuild, cooperate, take ownership,“ said Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “Their reputation is the most valuable asset they have, and they need to be transparent to build trust.” 
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.
The incidents followed other mid-air engine failures involving Pratt & Whitney's PW4000, most recently in December, when a malfunction forced a Tokyo-bound JAL 777 to return abruptly to Naha airport.
A Pratt & Whitney spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The firm said it was coordinating with regulators to review inspection protocols.
The weekend's incidents involved two aging aircraft and happened in the middle of a global pandemic that has decimated demand for the largest jets Boeing produces. The potential financial impact to Boeing of grounding the older planes is relatively small, analysts said. 
The MAX crisis, by contrast, involved a design issue on Boeing's best-selling jet and happened at a time of booming air travel demand.
The nearly two-year 737 MAX grounding cost Boeing some $20 billion, triggered criminal and congressional investigations, hundreds of lawsuits and ousted executives - including Muilenburg.
As CEO, Muilenburg apologized to the victim's families and implemented changes at the board and in Boeing's engineering to improve safety oversight. He has declined to comment on the company since leaving his post in late 2019.
Industry experts cautioned that it was premature to judge Boeing's response and how the MAX crisis has shifted its culture. 

""The stakes are far lower,"" said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. ""They may have learned lessons from the MAX crisis - but this isn't the situation that would show it.""

313,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 05:06PM ET</span>","Analysis: Bubbles, bubbles bound for trouble?","By Marc Jones and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - The $6.2 billion-an-hour rise in the value of world stocks since March was dubbed the ""mother of all asset bubbles"" by BofA analysts last week - and all of a sudden there is a high-pitched hissing sound.
Electric car doyen Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which raced up 750% in last year's frenzy, skidded into the red for 2021 on Tuesday, hit by a selloff of tech stocks and a plunge in Bitcoin, in which the carmaker recently invested $1.5 billion.
Both are technically in bear markets, defined as down 20% from their latest peaks, although for ultra-volatile Bitcoin which has surged well over 1,000% since March, that was admittedly only a few days ago.
More broadly, Tesla and the bellwether FAAMG quintet - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - have seen half a trillion dollars, or around the equivalent of Austria's economy, topsliced off their combined value this year. 
Meanwhile ten-year U.S. Treasury yields, a key driver of global borrowing costs, have gone up from just under 0.9% to just shy of 1.4% which, while barely visible in a historical context, is nevertheless a 50% increase. 
For UniCredit's Co-Head of Strategy Research Elia Lattuga, the quick rise in benchmark yields represents ""a significant risk for equities in general but especially for the parts of market like growth and tech stocks that have seen the sharpest expansion in valuations."" 
Graphic: Bubbly assets: Bitcoin to FAANGs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/dgkvlzayqvb/Pasted%20image%201614091294852.png
He added that the 80% rise in world stocks since last March's COVID-19 meltdown - at a pace almost 10 times faster than that seen after the 2008 global financial crisis - had been driven by the well over $20 trillion worth of aid provided by governments and central banks.
Since the start of the year, though, the hopes that vaccines will help overcome the coronavirus and curtail the need for so much support have been building. 
Tracking the trend in U.S. Treasuries, Europe's still deeply negative German Bund yields are set for their biggest monthly jump in three years, and yields in deflation-plagued Japan are at their highest in more than two years.
There are echoes of the 'taper tantrum' of 2013, when world stocks saw a number of 3-5 percentage point drops as global yields began to climb.
Stocks did recover, though, and were climbing again when U.S. yields topped 3%, and for SEB investment management's global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson, any danger signs from the current rise in yields should also come with caveats.
""I don't see it as a fundamental threat to the markets. But it is up for discussion,"" he said.
Graphic: Up and away: global bond yields on the rise - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqgobnpx/bondyields2302.png
SPAC-TACULAR
This time, however, as nearly 90% of respondents in Deutsche's Bank most recent money-manager survey concluded, bubbles are building in many market segments. 
Bond bubbles, biotech bubbles, Special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) bubbles, shorting bubbles, space travel ETF bubbles. In fact, you have to search pretty hard to find an asset class that hasn't been flagged up.
Ray Dalio co-chief investment officer of the world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater, posted on Monday that around 5% of the top 1,000 U.S. firms were in bubble territory, which while high is well off dot.com boom levels. 
Climate change worries also mean anything green has turned red hot. 
Tesla's rise has been a staggering 16,000% over the last decade. It is worth the majority of the world's other carmakers combined and even with its drop this month, its shares still trade at 163 times this year's expected earnings.

It's a multi-storey bandwagon that increasing numbers are climbing on.
GMO's veteran bubblecaller Jeremy Grantham has warned of a massive rise in SPACs - blank check companies that merge with privately-owned firms specifically to float on the stock market - and initial public offerings (IPOs). 
SPAC-led Tesla-wannabes seem to emerge almost daily. S&P's Global Clean Energy index has nearly doubled in value over the past year, giving it a valuation of 41 times its companies’ expected earnings.
There were 480 initial public offerings (IPOs) last year, more than the height of dot.com mania. Of that, 248 were SPACs and there have already been over 150 this year according to Spacinsider.com data and plenty with celebrity backers.
Green bonds are roaring too, along with solar, wind and hydrogen stocks. Hydrogen fuel cell manufacturer  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) is trading at nearly 65 times its expected revenue having seen its share price surge over 1,000% over the last year.
""These great bubbles are where fortunes are made and lost,"" Grantham said recently. ""...This bubble will burst in due time, no matter how hard the Fed tries to support it.""

314,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 04:47PM ET</span>","Bitcoin, Powell Testimony, Nvidia: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- The rotation away from tech stocks continued on Tuesday as investors snapped up energy and financials while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the recovery was still in the early stages.
Pent-up consumers could drive big economic growth later this year, once vaccines make their way into enough of the population to make a full reopening possible. Powell told Congress on Tuesday that the Fed stands at the ready to support growth, and downplayed the risk of inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose during afternoon trading, erasing earlier losses, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite stayed in the red despite a late-day rally.
Powell heads to Capitol Hill again on Wednesday, where lawmakers in the House prepare to vote on a $1.9 trillion stimulus package that includes extended unemployment benefits and funds for vaccinations.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Companies bitten by bitcoin
Bitcoin has fallen back somewhat since it soared past $55,000 this month, and that’s hitting some companies. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)fell as much as 10% earlier on Tuesday before coming back to settle down more than 2%.
 Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) disclosed after the closing bell that it bought $170 million of Bitcoin, on top of the $50 million it already bought. Bitcoin now makes up 5% of its assets. Square fell 5% in after-hours trading after falling 4% during the Tuesday session. Bitcoin is trading just over $48,000.
2. More word from the Fed
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell starts a second day of Congressional testimony at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT). On Tuesday he told lawmakers the economic recovery still had a long way to go and downplayed the risk of inflation.
His appearance on Capitol Hill this week comes as the House prepares to vote on President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Senators are expected to oppose certain aspects of the plan, including its size. Democrats are aiming to get a bill to President Biden by early next month.
3. Chip earnings
Gaming chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reports earnings on Wednesday, and analysts are expecting EPS of $2.80 on revenue of $4.8 billion.
There is a chip shortage affecting everyone from car makers to game developers. Nvidia said earlier this year it was seeing GPU shortages because they were being used to mine cryptocurrency. In response, it rolled out a GPU dedicated to crypto mining, a move designed to ease up the shortage for gaming. Analysts will be listening for word on that effort.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Tuesday it had agreed to sell its asset management business, which manages more than $603 billion on behalf of customers, to private equity firms GTCR LLC and Reverence Capital Partners for $2.1 billion.
The sale represents the biggest shake-up at the U.S. bank since former Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) top boss Charles Scharf joined as chief executive officer in 2019. Reuters reported in January that a Wells Fargo deal with the buyout firms was close.
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo will own a 9.9% stake in the asset management unit and will continue as a client and distribution partner, the bank said. The $2.1 billion sale price includes the value of Wells Fargo's stake in the new company, GTCR Managing Director Collin Roche said in an interview.
The business, to be rebranded upon the deal's completion in the second half of 2021, will continue to be led by Nico Marais as chief executive. Joseph Sullivan, the former head of  Legg Mason  (NYSE:LM), will join as executive chairman, according to Wells Fargo's statement.
Under new ownership, focus would include growing its business among retail customers, including upon an existing strong position in separately managed accounts, Roche said, adding that further investment would be made in the company's technology offering.
The sale of the asset management arm is in-line with steps taken by Scharf to turn around Wells Fargo following a sales practices scandal. 
The bank in recent weeks has also agreed to sell its private student loan portfolio and its Canadian direct equipment finance business.
""This is not a business that would typically be for sale, so that became an opportunity for both of our firms,"" Reverence Capital Managing Partner Milton Berlinski told Reuters, adding that the franchise's size and product set would make it well-positioned to grow as an independent company.

Wells Fargo Securities advised the bank on the divestment, with Broadhaven Capital Partners and UBS Group providing financial advice to the buyers. The respective legal advisers were Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and Kirkland & Ellis.

(Reuters) - Stock market investors valued electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors at $62 billion on Tuesday after a deal to merge with blank check firm Churchill Capital IV, sparking some concerns about the real worth of the company which has yet to start regular production. 
In comparison, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) was worth about $72.5 billion at mid-day Tuesday, while China's leading electric car maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc was valued at $72 billion. 
Shares in Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which have surged more than 10 times in value over the past year to around $900, fell for a second day in a row on Tuesday, with its mid-day shares at $674 and its market capitalization at $647 billion.
Lucid's first electric car, the luxury Air, won't go in production now until late 2021, later than the spring 2021 launch initially planned, the company said in a filing. Officials on Tuesday said they do not expect Lucid to be cash-flow positive until 2025.
Shares of Churchill Capital IV Corp fell more than 40%, a day after it agreed the merger with Lucid. At mid-day, CCIV shares had recovered slightly to $39.00, down 32%. 
The Lucid-CCIV deal includes new private investment that valued the company at $24 billion, just a fraction of Tesla, but still the biggest ever involving so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).
""We're bringing the world's best technology to the market this year, here in the U.S. I think the valuation is a reflection of our technology,"" Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson told CNBC on Tuesday when asked whether Lucid's valuation made him nervous.
Rawlinson told investors on a call that its Lucid Air Dream edition is virtually sold out, while former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banker Michael Klein, head of Chruchill Capital, said the company has sufficient funding for its first three models.
TIME FOR A CORRECTION?
Rawlinson said that the carmaker expects production of a less expensive, sub-$70,000 version of the luxury sedan in 2022, followed by a new model code-named Project Gravity in 2023. 
The recent run-up in valuations of several EV startups, including Nikola Corp and Lordstown Motors, that have yet to produce saleable vehicles or meaningful revenue, has drawn comparisons to the dotcom bubble of 1999-2000, with analysts and investors expecting a near-term correction. 
""The EV sector feels like it’s going through a correction. Lucid’s SPAC-IPO probably (is) driving circular negative reinforcement,"" said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin. 
""We think Tesla has been valued for teleportation, so the correction is probably a very healthy thing. This allows investors to watch for potential entry points in names they feel they might have missed,"" he added. 
Lucid, run by ex-Tesla engineer Rawlinson, is the latest EV firm to tap U.S. capital markets, with investors rushing into the sector as tougher emission norms drive a switch to electric vehicles. 
With its roster of deep-pocketed financial backers, it is one of the strongest of the flock of startups challenging Tesla's dominance. 
After Lucid priced its Air sedan, starting at $77,400, Musk announced a price cut to its flagship Model S sedan. ""The gauntlet has been thrown down!"" he tweeted.
However, Lucid's five-year timeline to get to production of 250,000 vehicles a year is a reminder of the challenges of scaling up mass production in the auto industry.

Tesla, founded in 2003, produced about 500,000 electric vehicles last year.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped its five-day losing streak Tuesday, as big tech tech pared losses, shrugging off jitters about rising inflation, while value stocks continued to rack up gains amid a favorable economic backdrop as progress continued on rolling out another round of stimulus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.04%, or 13.75 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.06%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5%, though had been down more than 1% intraday.
Energy and financials were among the value sectors in the green, with the latter led by gains in People’s United Financial Inc (NASDAQ:PBCT) for the second day following its impending $7.6 billion takeover by M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB). Other financial companies including  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Corp and Hartford Financial Services (NYSE:HIG) were 2% higher.
Energy, added to gains from a day earlier, up nearly 2%, as investors looked ahead to another weekly U.S. inventory report in the U.S., expected to show a sharp draw in the crude stockpiles that will boost expectations for a speedier pace of rebalancing.
The strength in value stocks has been driven by a brighter outlook for the economy. Covid-19 infections continue to decline, the pace of vaccine rollouts is increasing, and President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus is expected to be rolled out sooner than later. The House is expected to vote on the bill later this week, before moving to the Senate, where it is expected to face opposition.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer promised ""urgent and bold"" stimulus relief, and said the package was on track to reach President Biden before unemployment benefits expire on March 14.


Despite the expectations for a stronger reopening and recovery, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated Tuesday that the economy remains ""a long way"" from the central bank's employment and inflation goals."" The economy is likely to ""take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,"" Powell added.
Technology, which has led broad-market rally since the pandemic lows in March, cut intraday losses as big tech moved off lows.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were higher, with the latter climbing 2% after agreeing to reaching a deal to restore news pages in Australia. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended lower.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 04:00PM ET</span>",U.S. bank profits fell 36.5% in 2020 on pandemic concerns - FDIC,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank profits fell 36.5% in 2020 from the prior year as banks set aside massive amounts to guard against potential losses, but the industry showed signs of strengthening in the fourth quarter as the economy begins to recover from the pandemic, a regulator reported on Tuesday.
The industry posted $147.9 billion in profits in 2020, a sharp decline from record 2019 profits, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Bank profits rose 9.1% in the fourth quarter, however, to $59.9 billion compared with the previous year as firms shrank how much cash they set aside to guard against losses.
FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams said the new data showed that despite falling profits, banks proved their resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Testifying separately before Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was still debating whether to reinstate stricter capital requirements on banks. The Fed eased some leverage restrictions for larger banks in April, with that relief set to expire at the end of March.
Industry groups are already pressing for extending the relief. Top groups, including the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said in a letter on Tuesday the Fed should extend the relaxed standards as soon as possible.
They said the relief had helped banks play a ""pivotal role"" in stabilizing markets by continuing to lend during the downturn.
The new data shows the wild swings the banking industry went through in 2020, as firms scrambled to set aside billions of dollars to guard against the economic toll of the pandemic, only to begin digging out from those losses in the second half of the year.
The profit growth posted by banks in the fourth quarter was primarily due to shrinking reserves against potential losses. The FDIC said so-called provision losses fell by 76.5% in the end of 2020 compared with the end of 2019 to $3.5 billion, the lowest level since 1995.
The FDIC noted a looming challenge for banks was the persistent low-rate environment. Banks have seen their interest income shrink for five straight quarters, and the average net interest margin remained at record lows in the fourth quarter.

322,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 04:00PM ET</span>","Knorr-Bremse, Lufthansa mogul Thiele dies at 79","By Thomas Escritt
BERLIN (Reuters) - German braking systems maker Knorr-Bremse said its majority shareholder Heinz Hermann Thiele, who shaped the company since buying it from his then-employer in 1985, has died unexpectedly at the age of 79.
Thiele was also a major shareholder in Lufthansa, becoming a highly visible public figure last year when he was portrayed as the main obstacle to the state bailout the airline needed to survive the coronavirus crisis.
""The Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board mourn the loss of a global and visionary entrepreneur who has been shaping the global rail and commercial vehicle industry for decades,"" Munich-based Knorr-Bremse said in a statement on Tuesday.
His unexpected death adds to uncertainty over succession at the company, whose chairman Klaus Mangold is due to step down this year.
Under Thiele's stewardship, Knorr-Bremse grew into the global market leader in braking systems for trains, trucks and tractors, making him immensely wealthy. It now employs around 29,000 people in over 100 companies.
He was an aggressive competitor, entering a bidding war with rivals to stop them taking control of Knorr's Swedish rival Haldex, and defying sceptics by successfully taking control of rail technology company Vossloh.
Forbes estimated his fortune at $15 billion, placing him 91st on their list of the world's richest people. His abrasive style led to repeated senior departures from the company and rows with unions.
In talks over Lufthansa's government bailout, Thiele went almost to the brink, with the airline's management warning that the deal could fail unless he dropped his objections to the carrier taking on a government stake, which he said would make it harder to carry out a painful restructuring.
In this, he was defeated. Germany now holds a 20% stake.
On Tuesday, Knorr-Bremse reported free cash flow of around 700 million euros, topping forecasts, and expected sales at the upper end of a forecast corridor of 5.9-6.2 billion euros.
Thiele floated the company in 2018 in a move that raised some 3.9 billion euros for him and his daughter Julia Thiele-Schuerhoff and was seen as part of the company's succession management process. The family owns 59% of the company.
""It is Mr. Thiele's desire that professional investors get a voice and that the company becomes independent from individual people,"" then-Chief Financial Officer Ralph Heuwing said at the time.

Though Thiele left the supervisory board in 2016, he returned last year as its deputy chairman, continuing to keep a close eye on the company he joined in 1969 as a legal clerk.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A dive in Bitcoin's price spilled onto shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which recently disclosed that it held a $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency, and slammed exchange-traded funds holding the stock on Tuesday.
Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP) slumped 13.3% to $46,951.51, tracking toward its biggest daily loss since March. Tesla's shares in turn fell 3.3% to $690.59. 
The drop in Tesla shares hit exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the ARK Innovation ETF, down 4.9%, and the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF, down 4.3%. Both ETFs feature Tesla as their biggest single holding.
Meanwhile, the GraniteShares 3X Long Tesla Daily ETP, a levered exchange-traded product aimed at tripling the daily moves in Tesla shares, ended 22.8% lower in London.
The losses come amid a broader market downturn over the last few days that has seen investors sell shares in a wide range of assets that have notched big rallies in recent months, from technology stocks to cannabis and solar ETFs.
""Over the long term, we think there could be reversion to the mean"" among many of those recently high-flying funds, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.
Rosenbluth added that he had a positive long-term outlook for ARK's ETFs but that their recent performance illustrated the perils of having a concentrated position in one stock. The ARK Innovation ETF has fallen more than 13% since Feb. 12 as volatile bitcoin prices have jostled Tesla shares.
Indeed, some investors may have been preparing for downside in the ETF. Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, noted that options activity indicated a rise in demand for protection against a decline in ARK.
Bullish sentiment for many of the holdings in the ARK Innovation ETF remains high, Wu Silverman noted. And despite recent weakness, outflows from the fund have been minimal, according to research from Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
""The ARKK ETF has been the poster child of momentum high fliers and is beloved by retail,"" Wu Silverman wrote.
Yet some signs point to investors becoming more cautious on Tesla. Skew, an indicator showing the level of demand for protective options positioning, has climbed for Tesla over the past few weeks, according to data from Trade Alert.
Investors focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors may also have cause for concern. 
While Tesla has long campaigned to cut global auto emissions through use of its relatively environment-friendly cars, the company's decision to invest in bitcoin could weigh on its ESG rating, Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, chief investment officer at asset manager  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) IP told Reuters on Friday.    Meanwhile,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts noted there had been a drop in conversations about the company on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, a popular discussion spot for individual investors, which could explain some of the loss of appetite for the stock.    ""With only 2-3 total submissions on each of the past several days, we remain below the trend in attention that has come along with big returns jumps in the past,"" the analysts said in a note.    Even with the shake-out from a record high above $58,000 two days ago, bitcoin is up 62% this year, and is increasingly being accepted as a mainstream investment and means of payment. 

Michael Saylor, chief executive of MicroStrategy, a major corporate backer of bitcoin, told CNBC on Tuesday that the approximately $1 trillion total value of the digital currency could subsume the market capitalization of gold at about $10 trillion.

(Reuters) - Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Corp, one of the largest U.S. poultry producers, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to pay a $107.9 million fine on Tuesday to settle federal charges it conspired to fix chicken prices and passed on the costs to consumers and other purchasers.
Chief Executive Fabio Sandri entered the guilty plea on the company's behalf at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Raymond Moore in Denver. A plea agreement had been reached in October.
The plea followed the indictments last year of 10 poultry industry executives, including former Pilgrim's Pride Chief Executives Jayson Penn and Bill Lovette, on price-fixing charges. All 10 have pleaded not guilty.
Pilgrim's Pride is based in Greeley, Colorado, and owned mainly by Brazilian meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY).
It was the first U.S. poultry company to settle charges that companies conspired from 2012 to at least 2019 to reduce production in order to boost prices of broiler chickens, which account for most chicken meat consumed in the United States.
Prosecutors estimated that Pilgrim Pride's illegal activity affected at least $361 million in sales of its broiler chicken products.
The fine was less than federal guidelines recommended because of the company's ""substantial assistance,"" Moore said.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), another poultry producer, has said it was cooperating with the Justice Department probe under a corporate leniency program.
Pilgrim's Pride, Tyson, Perdue Farms Inc and  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) Inc are also facing federal lawsuits in Chicago by consumers, restaurants, supermarket chains and food distributors over alleged price rigging dating back to 2008.
The producers were accused there of using data from an outside service to review rivals' production and pricing activities, which should have remained confidential.

Chick-fil-A, Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Sysco Corp  (NYSE:SYY) are among the plaintiffs in Chicago. In January, Pilgrim's Pride and Tyson agreed to pay a respective $75 million and $221.5 million to settle other claims there.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street retreated on Tuesday as investors shifted away from mega-cap growth stocks, but the sell-off eased following reassurances from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
All three major U.S. indexes were in the red, driven by declines in market-leading tech and tech-adjacent companies which drove the rally that had pushed indexes to record levels despite economic lockdowns.
""A lot of the 'pandemic plays' that saw outsized growth are going to see a slowing of that growth,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""But I don't think it's going to go away.""
""Growth doesn't stop after the pandemic.""
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) were among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500, and more acutely, on the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell eased concerns that the central bank's economic support increased the risk of an inflating asset bubble, and insisted that the central bank's accommodative monetary policy would remain in place for ""some time.""
In prepared remarks ahead of his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said the economic recovery was ""uneven and far from complete,"" later adding that investors are mostly responding to an anticipated rebound as vaccine deployment curbs the pandemic.
""If you look back at (Powell's) initial tenure, there was some ambiguity as to where the Fed stood,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""But over the last year, in response to the pandemic, he's done an excellent job communicating their commitment to stable markets and full employment.""

Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, five were in negative territory, with consumer discretionary and tech shares suffering the largest percentage losses. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc plunged 3.8% to enter red territory for the year, pulled down amid the tech selloff and falling bitcoin , which were down 13.9%. Tesla recently invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency miners Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) Inc and Marathon Patent Group Inc plunged 24.0% and 22.7%, respectively, while bitcoin bank Silvergate Capital (NYSE:SI) Corp slid 23.3%.
Home improvement retailer  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings. But it cast doubt on whether spiking sales, driven by homebound consumers taking on do-it-yourself projects amid COVID lockdowns, are sustainable going forward. Its shares were the heaviest drag on the Dow, falling 3.4%.
Smaller rival Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW), expected to report its results early Wednesday, was down 2.7%
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

""The industry that existed last March in many respects no longer exists today,"" Dickson said at a town hall about commercial aviation safety shown on social media, citing the retirement of veteran pilots, new fleets with complex aircraft and less international flying.
""All these changes are creating a whole new set of stressors that can inject new safety risks into the system,"" he said.
While the risk of a fatal U.S. commercial aviation accident has fallen by 94% since 1997 thanks to improvements in aviation safety, Dickson said the industry must proactively curb new safety risks by understanding the pandemic's impact.
He cited added training and enhanced industry oversight as possible measures.
""COVID-19 has created a tremendous amount of disruption and change in our system with breathtaking speed,"" he said.
Airlines have parked jets and drastically reduced their workforce, mostly through early retirement programs, as they weather a sharp downturn in demand as a result of the pandemic.

All five of Ark Investment Management’s active exchange-traded funds slumped on Tuesday, with the company’s $27 billion flagship ETF tumbling as much as 12% and heading toward its worst back-to-back rout since March. The selloff came after investors collectively piled $6.2 billion into the product since the beginning of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Activity for the fund was intense in the first hour of trading, with about $2.5 billion worth of shares changing hands.
As its top holding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. drops alongside Bitcoin -- Wood’s other big bet -- the question is whether the $18 billion invested in Ark products this year alone will stick around. The skyrocketing popularity of Elon Musk’s company, which currently comprises about 8.7% of the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK), helped fuel an almost 150% surge in 2020. Both the electric-car maker and the fund are being dragged down this week amid growing concerns about valuations for the companies that have led the bull-market in stocks, just as an increase in Treasury yields fuels worries over a pickup in inflation.
“The patience for investors that arrived to the ARKK party in 2021 after triple-digit returns will be tested if the fund inevitably has a week or two of declines before recovering,” said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA Research’s director of ETF research.
History suggests there’s a good chance investors will hang around -- for now at least. In ARKK’s previous pullbacks, inflows barely missed a beat. In fact, since the stock-market lows in March, it’s only faced nine days of outflows, and never more than three in a row.
Take the September technology plunge, for instance, when lofty valuations and skepticism about further gains in growth names triggered a pullback. Tesla’s 21% slide dragged ARKK down about 15%. Following the drop, the fund only lost about $77 million in outflows over the course of three days and went on to end the month with $674 million in inflows, as Wood bought even more Tesla stock.
Even when ARKK fell about 6% at the end of January, as the speculative frenzy around  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). and other retail stocks grabbed investors’ attention, it only lost a net $16 million.
Michael Purves, chief executive officer at Tallbacken Capital Advisors, says “the technical position shows signs of pivoting” and recommends buying ARKK put options in case the ETF’s price continues to drop.
Even with the recent pullback, the fund is still showing an eye-popping performance. It’s taken in almost $3.1 billion so far this month and its 2021 gain is close to 8%, compared with just 2.2% for the S&P 500.
“It’s probably going to take more of a decline for it to test the resolve of many investors,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “It has had such a great run that many investors are likely to see this as a buying opportunity.”

332,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 02:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: AstraZeneca to miss second-quarter EU vaccine supply target by half - EU official,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) expects to deliver less than half the COVID-19 vaccines it was contracted to supply the European Union in the second quarter, an EU official told Reuters on Tuesday.
The expected shortfall, which has not previously been reported, comes after a big reduction in supplies in the first quarter and could hit the EU's ability to meet its target of vaccinating 70% of adults by the summer.
The EU official, who is directly involved in talks with the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, said the company had told the bloc during internal meetings that it ""would deliver less than 90 million doses in the second quarter"". 
AstraZeneca's contract with the EU, which was leaked last week, showed the company had committed to delivering 180 million doses to the 27-nation bloc in the second quarter.
""Because we are working incredibly hard to increase the productivity of our EU supply chain, and doing everything possible to make use of our global supply chain, we are hopeful that we will be able to bring our deliveries closer in line with the advance purchase agreement,"" a spokesman for AstraZeneca said, declining to comment on specific figures.
A spokesman for the European Commission, which coordinates talks with vaccine manufacturers, said it could not comment on the discussions as they were confidential.
He said the EU should have more than enough shots to hit its vaccination targets if the expected and agreed deliveries from other suppliers are met, regardless of the situation with AstraZeneca.
The EU official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, confirmed that AstraZeneca planned to deliver about 40 million doses in the first quarter, again less than half the 90 million shots it was supposed to supply.
AstraZeneca warned the EU in January that it would fall short of its first-quarter commitments due to production issues. It was also due to deliver 30 million doses in the last quarter of 2020 but did not supply any shots last year as its vaccine had yet to be approved by the EU.
All told, AstraZeneca's total supply to the EU could be about 130 million doses by the end of June, well below the 300 million it committed to deliver to the bloc by then.
The EU has also faced delays in deliveries of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech as well as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s shot. So far they are the only vaccines approved for use by the EU's drug regulator. 
AstraZeneca's vaccine was authorised in late January and some EU member states such as Hungary are also using COVID-19 shots developed in China and Russia.
OUTPUT BOOST DOWN THE LINE?
While drugmakers developed COVID-19 vaccines at breakneck speed, many have struggled with manufacturing delays due to complex production processes, limited facilities and bottlenecks in the supply of vaccine ingredients.
According to a German health ministry document dated Feb. 22, AstraZeneca is forecast to make up all of the shortfalls in deliveries by the end of September.
The document seen by Reuters shows Germany expects to receive 34 million doses in the third quarter, taking its total to 56 million shots, which is in line with its full share of the 300 million doses AstraZeneca is due to supply to the EU.
The German health ministry was not immediately available for a comment.
If AstraZeneca does ramp up its output in the third quarter, that could help the EU meet its vaccination target, though the EU official said the bloc's negotiators were wary because the company had not clarified where the extra doses would come from.""Closing the gap in supplies in the third quarter might be unrealistic,"" the official said, adding that figures on deliveries had been changed by the company many times.
The EU contracts stipulates that AstraZeneca will commit to its ""best reasonable efforts"" to deliver by a set timetable.
""We are continuously revising our delivery schedule and informing the European Commission on a weekly basis of our plans to bring more vaccines to Europe,"" the AstraZeneca spokesman said. 
Under the EU contract leaked last week, AstraZeneca committed to producing vaccines for the bloc at two plants in the United Kingdom, one in Belgium and one in the Netherlands.
However, the company is not currently exporting vaccines made in the United Kingdom, in line with its separate contract with the British government, EU officials said.
AstraZeneca also has vaccine plants in other sites around the world and it has told the EU it could provide more doses from its global supply chain, including from India and the United States, an EU official told Reuters last week.

Earlier this month, AstraZeneca said it expected to make more than 200 million doses per month globally by April, double February's level, as it works to expand global capacity and productivity.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 01:20PM ET</span>",Ratan Capital bounces back in 2020 after years of curve balls,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - A few years ago, Ratan Capital Management faced questions of survival due to bad bets that shriveled its capital and its founder settling regulatory charges about information sharing. 
Now, the hedge fund is back in the spotlight after posting stellar returns last year that might help lure new investors. 
Ratan Capital, run by Nehal Chopra, delivered a 98% return in 2020, its best ever, thanks to long-held investments in companies that provide business solutions, according to a letter sent to investors and seen by Reuters. 
Its performance trounced the average hedge fund's 11.6% return, as well as the S&P 500 Index , which gained 16% last year. 
Investments in Vertiv Holding Co, RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) Inc and Clarivate PLC were the biggest winners, all posting double-digit gains, Chopra wrote. They more than offset losses from online ticket-ordering business Trainline PLC and health-insurance claims processor Multiplan Corp.
Chopra declined to comment. 
It is too early to know whether the outsize returns lead to fresh capital, but Ratan's performance is the latest in a series of dips and rebounds for the firm. One of a handful of women to run their own hedge funds, investors saw Chopra as a rising star when she started Ratan in 2009. It was a difficult time to launch because of industry losses during the financial crisis, but she secured backing from major investors including Tiger Management founder Julian Robertson. 
Strong early results helped swell Ratan's assets to roughly $1 billion by 2015. Despite ups and downs, its long-term performance has been strong, with an average 16% return over 10 years and an average 35% return per year over the last three years. 
However, Ratan joined prominent hedge fund managers, including Pershing Square Capital Management's William Ackman, to invest in pharmaceutical firm Valeant – which turned out to be a disastrous bet. Now called Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC) Inc, the investment seriously harmed Ratan's performance in 2015.
Then, in December 2017, Chopra settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged inappropriate information-sharing with her husband, Paritosh Gupta, who worked at a different fund. Soon after, Robertson and other investors exited. Ratan now has $350 million in assets under management.
Whether last year's eye-popping performance translates into fresh cash remains to be seen. Since the financial crisis, investors have become increasingly skittish, often preferring big-name funds with smaller but steadier returns.

In her letter, Chopra thanked investors who stuck with her over time, and warned that this year will likely be ""bumpy.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Online platforms like Robinhood in the United States that offer commission-free share trading to retail investors would be illegal in the European Union, officials from the bloc said on Tuesday.
Online trading came to the fore last month after retail investors following the Reddit forum WallStreetBets piled into  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares via the Robinhood platform, sending the retailer's stock rocketing more than 1,000% at the expense of prominent investors who had bet against the stock.
Ugo Bassi, a senior official in the European Commission's financial services unit, said the EU executive had looked at ""payment for order flow"" under three aspects of the bloc's securities law.
This refers to a broker rewarding an online platform for funnelling trades to it.
""The preliminary conclusion that we came to is that the combination of these three sets of rules would prevent a payment for order flow as it was described in GameStop and Robinhood from being legal and authorised in Europe,"" Bassi told the European Parliament.
Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority, the EU's markets watchdog, added it was difficult to reconcile payment for order flow ""with putting the client first"".
Holders of a short position in stocks must disclose it to EU regulators and Bassi said potential changes could include publishing which stocks have short positions on a weekly or fortnighly basis.
""We could think of rules clarifying the duties of brokers or investment advisors and their firms when they participate in online chat rooms,"" Bassi said.
Maijoor said there were only 20 stocks in Europe with net short positions of above 10%, limiting the risk of a GameStop-style short squeeze.
Online communities of retail investors were still mainly national in the EU, giving them less clout than in the far bigger U.S. market, Maijoor said.
He cautioned about going too far in penalising short-sellers, saying they can help markets work well, referring to collapsed German payments company Wirecard.

""In the Wirecard case, there were short-sellers wanting to get the accounting fraud to the surface,"" Maijoor said.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 11:15AM ET</span>",UK minister says insurance reforms not part of a 'deregulatory agenda',"By Huw Jones and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's plans to change capital requirement rules for insurers following its departure from the European Union are about tailoring them to local conditions rather than any ""gratuitous deregulatory agenda,"" its financial services minister said. 
Britain inherited the Solvency II insurance capital rules from the EU, which it left on Dec. 31. But UK insurers and lawmakers have long called for changes to make the rules more specific for the sector in Britain.
A consultation by the finance ministry on potential changes has just ended, with the insurance industry hoping it will lead to an easing in capital requirements. 
""This isn't about a gratuitous deregulatory agenda, but proportionate and appropriate changes to reflect the situation happening in the UK,"" finance minister John Glen told the Association of British Insurers' (ABI) annual meeting.
The Bank of England has also warned insurers not to expect any big reduction in capital requirements after Brexit.
Jon Dye, chair of the ABI, said insurers were not looking for ""huge capital reduction at the expense of policyholder protection"".
""There's plenty of scope for practical reform here that utilises the UK's ability post-Brexit to have a regulatory system designed for the UK market, not the aggregated needs of 28 countries.""
The EU is concerned Britain might use its departure from the bloc to try to gain a competitive advantage.
Changes to the Solvency II regime could free up 95 billion pounds ($134 billion), which insurers could use to invest in areas such as tackling climate change, according to research by consultants KPMG for the ABI.
Charlotte Gerken, an executive director at the Bank of England, told a later conference session that ""we are not looking for increase or decrease ... but are interested in the evidence as to ... what is the amount of capital that is about right"".
Gerken said insurers had been resilient during the pandemic under the current regime.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 11:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Top banks asked to justify why they still clear euro swaps in London,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top banks must justify why they should not have to shift clearing of euro-denominated derivatives worth billions of euros from London to the European Union after Brexit, an EU document seen by Reuters on Tuesday showed.
Clearers in Britain have EU permission to continue clearing for EU customers until mid-2022 to give banks time to shift their euro positions to the continent, but switching has been slow.
The banks are being asked to set out detailed views on shifting euro derivatives positions from London on Friday in the first meeting of a new European Commission working group on moving euro clearing.
""The current level of exposure to UK central counterparties (CCPs) raises a number of issues for the EU that should be addressed by a reduction in the EU’s exposure to UK CCPs,"" the European Commission said in a questionnaire sent to banks.
The EU wants to deepen its capital market to cut reliance on the City of London now that Britain has left the single market.
EU policymakers and the European Central Bank, which regulates top lenders, have long wanted euro clearing moved from London to the single currency area where it can be supervised directly.
The London Stock Exchange's LCH arm in London still clears the bulk of euro swaps transactions, even though swathes of trading in the swaps have shifted from London to platforms in the EU and New York since Dec. 31.
""The objective of this discussion is to ensure that the Commission is aware of all possible impediments, obstacles and opportunities,"" the document prepared for the meeting said.
Banks are being asked to say which types of the derivatives they clear in Britain they would consider ""the easiest to clear"" at an EU clearer instead, a sign of a potentially targeted approach.
""Participants are asked to reflect on the possibility of repapering transactions already cleared in UK CCPs into another CCP, therefore not going through the market,"" the document said.
Banks, which are also being asked to justify why some products would be hard to shift, say splitting markets would cut savings on margin or cash posted against trades, that comes from netting across a wide range of transactions.
""Doesn’t market fragmentation already exist in clearing without any adverse effect on the market?"" the document says.
It asks for details on maturities of trades they hold at LCH, and what the necessary conditions are for moving the positions from one clearer to another.

""Several third-party service providers offer switching services, why aren’t they more used?"" it asks.

Investing.com -- Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell as much as 10% on Tuesday morning, continuing its Monday decline after questions about its growth prospects with rival automakers entering the electric vehicle market.
The shares recovered some of their losses, and were trading down 7.8% just after 10:00 AM ET. Tesla shares are up 250% over the last year but have retreated back below the level where they entered the S&P 500 index in December.
Its not helping that Bitcoin is also down some 11% on Tuesday, around $47,800, after spiking above $55,000 in recent days. Tesla said this month it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, an announcement that sent the cryptocurrency soaring. 
But adding to the downward pressure was a comment on Monday by  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  (MI:BMW) CEO Oliver Zipse, as reported by Bloomberg. Zipse said during a conference that established automakers are coming out with more EV offerings. “It won’t be easy for Tesla to continue at that speed because the rest of the industry is moving ahead big time,” Zipse said during the DLD All Stars tech conference, Bloomberg reported.

349,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 09:43AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Sharply Lower on Inflation Fears Ahead of Powell Testimony,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply lower, led again by losses in technology stocks, as fear of a potential end to the Federal Reserve's policy of easy money prompted profit-taking in some of the country's most expensively-valued stocks. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite, which more than doubled from its post-pandemic low before the recent sell-off started, was down 395 points, or 2.9%, adding to losses of some 2.5% on Monday. The S&P 500 was down 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, home to a greater concentration of mature 'value' stocks that command less demanding valuations, was down only 0.5%, or 154 points, at 31,368 points. 
The moves came as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell prepared to start two days of testimony in Congress about the state of the economy. Fears that the combination of loose fiscal and loose monetary policy could stoke inflation have driven up 10- and 30-year bond yields to their highest in over a year ahead of the testimony, ensuring that Powell's every word will be scrutinized even more closely than usual.
The most dramatic moves were in the car sector, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock – whose valuation has long been at levels hard to justify on traditional metrics - falling 11%. The sell-off had twin catalysts: for one, the price of Bitcoin has slumped some 20% since the weekend. While that's unlikely to have any material impact on its finances, CEO Elon Musk has tied his company's valuation somewhat to the cryptocurrency by converting $1.5 billion of its available cash into Bitcoin. 
The second catalyst for the profit-taking was the formal announcement overnight that Lucid Motors will merge with the  Churchill Capital IV  Corp (NYSE:CCIV) SPAC set up by former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) investment banking head Michael Klein. The terms of the merger also exposed the degree to which speculation there had gotten ahead of itself. Churchill stock fell 40%. Once the merger is complete, Lucid - founded by Tesla's former chief engineer Peter Rawlinson - will have a direct, U.S.-based competitor against which its valuation can be benchmarked.
Similar concerns also weighed on the ADRs of Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE:NIO), which fell over 10% in early trading.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) all saw selling, losing 3.4%, 2.0% and 1.7%, respectively, while Shopify stock (NYSE:SHOP) fell by 7.8% after announcing the placement of 1.18 million new shares.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) stock fell 5.9% and TheRealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) stock fell over 10%, both after disappointing earnings updates. Home Depot said it couldn’t be sure that the home improvement boom witnessed during the pandemic could continue through 2021."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp reported higher sales and operating profits and said it would reshape its corporate structure for a post-pandemic world, closing offices, streamlining technology and relying more on artificial intelligence and machines.
The news and information group said it would invest $500 million to $600 million over two years to make the transition from a content provider to a content-driven technology company to serve customers increasingly working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It aims to cut annual operating expenses by $600 million through eliminating duplicate functions and consolidating technology, as well as through attrition and shrinking its real estate footprint. The cost cuts do not involve layoff programs and divestitures, the company said. 
""We look at the changing behaviors as a result of COVID ... on professionals working from home working remotely being much more reliant on 24-7, digital always-on, sort of real-time always available information, served through software and powered by AI and ML (machine learning),"" Chief Executive Steve Hasker said in an interview.
Sales growth is forecast to accelerate in each of the next three years compared with 1.3% reported sales growth for 2020, the company said in its earnings release.
Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News, said revenues rose 2% to $1.62 billion, while its operating profit jumped more than 300% to $956 million, reflecting the sale of an investment and other items. 
Its three main divisions, Legal Professionals, Tax & Accounting Professionals and Corporates, all showed higher organic quarterly sales and adjusted profit.
Adjusted earnings per share of 54 cents were ahead of the 46 cents expected, based on data from Refinitiv. 
The company raised its annual dividend by 10 cents to $1.62 per share.
The Reuters News business showed lower revenue in the fourth quarter. In January, Stephen J. Adler, Reuters' editor-in-chief for the past decade, said he would retire in April from the world's largest international news provider.
Thomson Reuters also said its stake in The London Stock Exchange is now worth about $11.2 billion. 

The LSE last month completed its $27-billion takeover of data and analytics business Refinitiv, 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters.

The electricity and gas provider, however, said the total energy cost for the month of February may be impacted by higher usage because of the winter storms sweeping across Texas.
Electricity prices in the state soared last week as utilities scrambled to meet a surge in heating demand during the historic winter storm.
On Monday, Just Energy, whose units Amigo Energy and Tara Energy also operate in Texas, forecast a $250 million loss from the storms and said it was talking with key stakeholders to address liquidity issues.
Customers with residential fixed rate plan, and month-to-month residential customers will not see a rate increase on their February bill, the company said in a statement. 

Governor Greg Abbott said on Sunday utility regulators will temporarily ban power companies from billing customers or disconnecting them for non-payment, after the deadly winter storm that caused widespread blackouts.

(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) forecast 2021 sales largely above Wall Street estimates on Tuesday as the retailer bets on its growing online business and on the COVID-19 vaccine rollouts allowing customers to return to its department stores after pandemic curbs.
The upbeat outlook from the U.S. retailer follows better-than-expected sales in the holiday quarter as stimulus checks and strong online demand eased the blow from the health crisis.
Macy's expects sales between $19.75 billion and $20.75 billion for the full year, compared with analysts' estimates of $20.13 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Macy's said its annual forecast accounted for some pandemic-related challenges in the spring season with momentum building in the back half of 2021.
On Monday, the U.S. COVID-19 death toll surpassed 500,000.
Retailers are tipped to benefit from another wave of stimulus-driven consumer spending in the coming months as U.S. Congress considers the Biden administration's support plan that includes sending a $1,400 check to households.
Same-store sales on an owned basis fell 17% in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, compared with Wall Street estimates of a 16.60% fall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Macy's online sales jumped 21% in the quarter as it pushed for faster delivery times with stores being used to fulfill orders made on its website and app as more consumers move their shopping online.
The company now expects annual online sales to reach $10 billion within the next three years.
Beauty, home, jewelry, and casual apparel performed well in the quarter, Macy's said.
Net sales fell to $6.78 billion from $8.34 billion in the fourth quarter, but beat estimates of $6.50 billion.
Shares of Macy's were up about 2% in premarket trading, after also handily beating expectations for quarterly profit.

Excluding one-time items, the company reported a profit of 80 cents per share, above expectations of 12 cents.

Norwegian last year won protection from bankruptcy in both Norway and Ireland, where most of its assets are registered, and is aiming to emerge with fewer aircraft and less debt.
The Irish High Court this week is hearing arguments concerning the repudiation of some of Norwegian’s liabilities including aircraft leases. 
“There is a hearing ongoing and we can’t comment until that is over,” a Norwegian spokesman said.
Airbus declined to comment. Boeing was not immediately available for comment. 
Norwegian has 88 A320neo-family narrow-body jets on order from Airbus, according to the manufacturer.
The airline said last June it had cancelled orders for 97 Boeing jets and would claim compensation for the grounding of the 737 MAX and for 787 Dreamliner engine troubles.
However, the orders for 5 Dreamliners and 92 MAX remain posted on the Boeing website, indicating the U.S. planemaker has until now asserted its rights on the contract.
Boeing has received significant cancellations of the 737 MAX after the plane was grounded for almost two years in the wake of two fatal crashes.
Planemakers have not so far faced sizeable cancellations directly related to the coronavirus crisis as deliveries were cushioned by deposits held on account, industry sources say.
But pressure is growing on jet order books as the pandemic extends into a second year.
Airbus is meanwhile locked in tough negotiations with another major budget carrier, Malaysia's AirAsia.
Several sources said discussions focused on whether AirAsia, one of Airbus' largest customers with some 400 planes on order across the group, could not only delay deliveries but also obtain a partial return of deposits, seen as a rare move.

Airbus and AirAsia have repeatedly declined comment on aircraft negotiations.

The Columbus, Ohio-based company's attempt to sell a majority stake in its Victoria's Secret business to Sycamore Partners collapsed last year after the buyout firm alleged that L Brands breached the terms of the deal.
L Brands did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Earlier this month, the company said it was aiming to complete the separation of its Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works businesses by August, with options including a spin-off of the former into a public company or a private sale of the business.

""2020 was one of the most challenging years in aviation history. For Spirit, the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic created a dual-crisis,"" Spirit Chief Executive Officer Tom Gentile said.
The company now stands to benefit from ungrounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jet by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in November after a 20-month ban. The MAX accounted for about 50% of Spirit's sales in 2019.
Spirit's total deliveries of shipsets, or complete sets of parts, fell 48.9% to 231 units in the fourth quarter. Boeing 737 MAX deliveries fell to 19 shipsets from 153 a year ago.
European planemaker Airbus last week forecast flat deliveries in 2021 as it braces for more coronavirus-induced uncertainty in the wake of an annual loss. Boeing has yet to set out detailed targets.
Spirit posted a loss of $295.9 million, or $2.85 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $67.7 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company lost $1.31 per share. Analysts had expected the company to report a loss of 85 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Total revenue decreased 55.3% to $876.6 million.

The company agreed to sell Wells Fargo Asset Management to private equity firms GTCR LLC and Reverence Capital Partners for $2.1 billion, according to a statement Tuesday. The unit has $603 billion of assets under management and employs more than 450 investment professionals.
Scharf, who took the reins in late 2019, has conducted deep reviews of Wells Fargo’s businesses, and said earlier this year that divestitures would help improve the company’s focus. He listed asset management, corporate trust and rail as units that could be among the targets.
“This transaction reflects Wells Fargo’s strategy to focus on businesses that serve our core consumer and corporate clients, and will allow us to focus even more on growing our wealth and brokerage businesses,” Barry Sommers, CEO of Wells Fargo’s wealth and investment-management division, said in the statement.
The bank agreed in December to divest its $10 billion private student-loan book to a group including Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc. and Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc., and has been exploring selling its corporate-trust business.
Wells Fargo has been struggling under an asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve to punish the lender for a series of lapses in governance and risk management. In one of the first signs of success in the drive to escape the penalty, the company secured the Fed’s acceptance of a proposal it submitted in September to overhaul operations.
Not everything is on the chopping block. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo decided to keep its private-label credit-card unit after reaching out to potential buyers last year, a person with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
The asset-management deal, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021, will leave Wells Fargo with a 9.9% equity interest in the operation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Plans by Britain and the European Union to set up a new financial cooperation forum by the end of March have made some progress but this will not automatically lead to market access, senior officials said on Tuesday.
Britain's trade deal with the EU that came into effect when it left the single market on Dec. 31 does not cover financial services, leaving the City of London largely adrift from its biggest export market. Trading in euro denominated shares and swaps has already left London for the EU and New York.
A forum for financial regulators from Britain and the EU to exchange views would help to improve relations. There is already a forum set up for EU and U.S. market watchdogs.
""We are in the process of exchanging texts and looking at that, and in due course we will come to a resolution,"" John Glen, Britain's financial services minister, told an insurance conference on Tuesday.
Separately, Mairead McGuinness, the EU's financial services commissioner, said ""informal engagements"" regarding a memorandum of understanding on regulatory cooperation were now taking place.
""Once we agree on our working arrangements, we can turn our attention to resuming our unilateral equivalence assessments,"" McGuinness, speaking at an online event at the European Parliament, said.
Glen said the EU's equivalence assessments would not be part of the MoU. ""That is a process we can't control,"" he said.
The EU can grant direct market access for foreign financial services companies if it deems their home market rules to be equivalent or aligned closely enough to the bloc's own regulations.
The EU has only granted two temporary equivalence decisions for clearing and settling trades for Britain. 

""We consider our interests and will only take equivalence decisions that are in the EU's interests. There cannot be equivalence and wide divergence,"" McGuinness said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Tuesday, with the high-growth tech sector set to be hit hard as rising bond yields force a rethink of the models underlying some stretched valuations.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was flat, while S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.4%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 185 points, or 1.4%. 
Wall Street closed mixed Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending marginally higher, while the S&P 500 ended down 0.8%, for the fifth session in a row, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 2.5%.
This rotation out of growth stocks, typified by the Nasdaq’s tech sector, and into the companies that have been very hard hit and could benefit from the reopening, is likely to continue Tuesday. Tech stocks whose valuations rests on rock-bottom discount rates extrapolated into the distant future are particularly at risk from any sign that borrowing costs could rise sooner than expected. 
Higher yields and inflationary pressures are likely to be prime topics of discussion as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell starts his two days of Congressional hearings later Tuesday, particularly with President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package likely to be approved by Congress in the next few days. The spending package implies Treasury issuance well beyond what the Fed has said it will buy.
“Powell’s team of cooing doves will have a harder and harder time facing down speculation of an early tapering by the Fed towards the summer,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “Inflation is about to surge, and perhaps even core inflation will get a move on due to ‘unexpected’ spill-over effects.”
Away from Capitol Hill,  the retailers  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Macy’s (NYSE:M) reported quarterly results before the bell Tuesday, but the focus will be on what the company executives say about the outlook for this year. Home Depot stock fell 1.5% after it said 2021 may not be as strong as last year.
Looking at the economic data slate, the reading for February consumer confidence is due at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT), with a move higher to 90 expected, up from 89.3 the prior month. 
Oil prices surged Tuesday with U.S. production slow to return from the deep freeze which affected large swathes of the country last week, including Texas, the largest crude producing state.
Estimates point to up to two weeks to restart more than two million barrels per day of crude output thanks to frozen pipes and power supply interruptions.
Inventories data from the American Petroleum Institute will be studied carefully when they are released later in the session given last week’s outages. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $62.16 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.7% to $64.79.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,810.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2158.

Stuck-at-home Americans have been snapping up tools, paint and building materials all through the COVID-19 health crisis, but the roll out of vaccines and the hopes for a normal life have led many to believe that demand in 2021 will fade. 
""We are not able to predict how consumer spending will evolve,"" Home Depot Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said.

Though India is known as the pharmacy of the world for its massive production capacities of both generic drugs and vaccines, China accounted for half of its API needs in 2019 from nearly nothing three decades ago, industry data shows.
Executives at India's Cadila Healthcare, Cipla, Sun Pharmaceutical and ‎Biocon said on Tuesday they were aggressively working on reducing the dependence on the richer rival for raw materials.
Disruption to supplies from China due to the COVID-19 pandemic was also a major factor, they said, as early last year many of them had to scramble for ingredients to make important drugs sold worldwide.
""Because of the anti-China sentiment ... most of the companies are working towards de-risking themselves in terms of making it clear that their supply chain linkages with China are limited,"" Gaurav Suchak, supply head of Cadila, told the BioAsia conference organised by the southern state of Telangana.
""For the critical API molecules, the idea is to go for a backward integration where you are in control of that pie which is going to make the most impact on your business, and also to make sure that the entire value chain is secure.""
Companies are also eyeing reliable local vendors who can promise consistency and competitive prices, he said.
Cipla's supply chief Swapn Malpani said it had launched an ""API re-imagination"" programme to possibly expand its own manufacturing capacities using recent government incentives such as production subsidies, apart from working with local suppliers.
Biocon's supply head Prasad Deshpande said the company had a target on ""how much percent of revenue is independent of China"".
""We are happy to say that by the last quarter, we were almost 50% completely independent of China,"" Deshpande said. ""That does not mean we will not source from China, but we are not dependent on China anymore.""

But he also said India would have to improve its infrastructure and accelerate approval processes to take on the scale and speed of China.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>","HSBC curbs profit and payout ambitions, bets on Asia wealth","By Alun John and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC lowered its long-term profitability target on Tuesday and unveiled a revised strategy focused mainly on wealth management in Asia after the COVID-19 shock saw its annual profit drop sharply.
Citing the low interest rate environment and tough market conditions, HSBC ditched its goal of achieving a return on tangible equity of 10 to 12%, and said instead it will aim for 10% over the medium term.
The move by Europe's biggest bank underlined the tough outlook for the banking sector as low interest rates worldwide curb profits, even as a global markets rally boosted the prospects for the wealth management business. 
The margin pressure and mounting losses in Europe have pushed HSBC to redouble its focus on Asia which provided a dominant share of the bank's profits in 2020.
""The big structural shift that’s gone on since we set out the plan last February has really been the shift in interest rates down toward zero in most markets that we do business in,"" Ewen Stevenson, HSBC's group chief financial officer, told Reuters. 
""If interest rates were 100 basis points higher today across the board it would improve our returns by 3 percentage points."" 
The bank said it would pay a dividend of $0.15 a share in cash, the first payout announced since October 2019, after the Bank of England blocked all big lenders from payouts in 2020 to conserve capital. 
However, it said it would stop the previous practice of paying a quarterly dividend, and target a payout ratio of between 40% and 55% of reported earnings per ordinary share from 2022 onwards, well below the level in recent years.

HSBC also set out plans to reduce its office space globally by 40% over the long term as part of its cost-cutting drive, in a further sign the pandemic could mean permanent changes to working patterns.
The bank gave no update on an overall plan to cut around 35,000 jobs it unveiled a year ago, but said around a third of the 7,000 jobs in its finance department would go as it invests in technology. 
The announcement came as HSBC reported profit before tax of $8.78 billion for 2020, down 34% from a year earlier but just above the $8.33 billion average of analysts' estimates compiled by the bank.
HSBC's shares fell 2% in London, against a 1% drop in the FTSE 350 banks index as investors considered the bank's dividend cut and modest strategic ambitions.
""It's hard to have high ambitions in this climate, or at least dangerous to declare them if they exist,"" said Hugh Young, managing director at Aberdeen Standard, HSBC's ninth-largest shareholder. 
ASIA FOCUS, SHRINKING ELSEWHERE
HSBC said that its growth in Asia for the next five years will be driven by around $6 billion of additional investment in its wealth management and international wholesale business. 
Profit from the bank's wealth management and personal banking division in Asia was $5 billion in 2020, but its cash cow Hong Kong accounted for almost all of this, despite its controversial decision to assist Hong Kong police with investigations into pro-democracy activists.
Chief Executive Noel Quinn said he could shift some executives, who report directly to him, from London and other locations to the Asian financial hub, including global business heads, but the decisions have not been finalised. 
Elsewhere in the world, HSBC said it is in talks with potential buyers for its troubled retail banking unit in France, which it has been trying to dispose of for over a year, but no deal has been confirmed. 
It said it expected to make a loss on the sale given the business's underlying performance. 
The bank also said it is ""exploring organic and inorganic options"" for its U.S. retail banking franchise, suggesting it is trying to sell the unit where it has already closed 80 branches in the last year.
Reuters, and others, have reported the bank is trying to withdraw from U.S. retail banking.

The bank is however confident of restoring profitability in its Mexico business, Quinn told Reuters.

366,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:09AM ET</span>",‘Portfolio Warming’ Is the New Climate Anxiety for Fund Managers,"(Bloomberg) -- All good money managers expect to outperform their benchmark, and by one such metric the French insurer and investor Axa SA recently scored a market-beating success. Not by delivering higher returns, but by generating a lower level of global warming.
If human activity is driving carbon emissions and temperatures to dangerous highs, then a giant asset owner like Axa with a 650 billion-euro ($790 billion) horde of stocks, corporate bonds and sovereign debt is one of the principal proprietors of climate change. In theory, that means every investment portfolio can be evaluated for the “warming potential” of its underlying assets.
After a painstaking process of self-evaluation that took two years, including a significant shift away from heavy polluters, Axa concluded its assets would warm the planet by 0.8 degrees Celsius less than if it held all the companies in major global stock and bond indexes. That was good news for an early adopter of portfolio-warming metrics.
The bad news: Axa’s portfolio implied a temperature increase of almost 3°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. At that level, scientists warn of mass extinctions of animal species, large parts of the planet becoming uninhabitable due to extreme heat, rising sea levels swallowing up coastal cities, and lush rainforests turning into savannas. It also would put Axa, despite its climate-conscious efforts, on the wrong side of the 2015 Paris Agreement in which every nation agreed to limit warming to 2°C.
“You can try to drive your portfolio to a cooler temperature, but when you have to operate in an investment universe that is really trapped in a rising carbon footprint, you will encounter strong limitations on what you can do,” said Ulrike Decoene, Axa’s head of corporate responsibility. “We’re not seeing the broader economy decreasing its warming potential and that’s worrying.”
And it’s not only Axa that’s taking the temperature of its assets. U.K. insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) Plc and Japan’s $1.7 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund have published data on warming potential. New York-based BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., with $8.7 trillion of assets, plans to do the same for some of its funds. The practice is likely to spread in the years ahead.
There’s big promise in taking warming potential seriously. The world’s largest money managers, with holdings in every major company, might be better suited than a single government to gauge the rate at which businesses are warming the planet. These temperature readings can then help giant investors prod the companies to cool things down more quickly, fulfilling the promise of the sustainable investing movement.
But the process of avoiding the apocalypse can look quite alarming, especially when those managing trillions in assets discover they own a 3°C future. If even climate-conscious pools of capital are flashing such doomsday warnings, can this kind of data really help avoid catastrophic warming?
The dire outlook has prompted hundreds of banks, insurers and other corporations to unveil net-zero emissions targets as concerns about the environment breach the walls of the capitalist establishment and force companies to change the way they conduct their business. Paris-based Axa has done more than most in the financial-services industry to reckon with its impact on the planet.
Ranked among Europe’s largest insurers, Axa stopped underwriting certain new coal projects in 2017 and last year committed to wind down its existing coal insurance contracts by 2040. At the same time, the company has been divesting its coal and oil sands holdings since 2015 and pledged two years ago to put 24 billion euros into green projects by 2023. Perhaps most ambitiously, Axa has committed to reduce the warming potential of its portfolios to 1.5°C by 2050.
Yet all of these efforts, some pursued for years, have barely budged the temperature of its overall asset pool. From the start of 2018 through the end of 2019, Axa’s holdings cooled by just 0.2°C to 2.8°C. The warming potential metric for 2020 will be published by June; Axa declined to provide guidance.
Decoene said the slight reduction followed divestments from the most carbon-intensive sectors, with the average warming potential of companies on its exclusion list at 4.6°C. Going forward, Axa is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of its equity, corporate debt and real estate investments by 20% by 2025, she said.
Calculating the implied temperature of a portfolio is a relatively novel concept, and there’s no consensus on the best way to do it. Some critics question whether it’s even possible to make an accurate forecast.
A report co-authored last year by David Blood, who started sustainable investing firm Generation Investment Management with Al Gore, found at least seven different methods of measuring portfolio alignment from firms including MSCI Inc. and a unit of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc. That may lead to investor confusion, and even increase the risk of greenwashing, ""as the metric could be adjusted to fit different purposes,"" according to the paper.
Axa collaborated with a Swiss fintech company called Carbon Delta, which has since been acquired by MSCI, to develop a methodology. Axa was more open to experimenting with climate metrics than many of its global peers, in part because of pressure from the French government. There’s also growing interest among the company’s clients to show how their businesses stand up next to the goals of the Paris accord. The process is complicated.
An investor’s portfolio has the same warming potential as everything inside of it. That means Axa needed to determine just how much it believed each of its assets would increase global temperatures by the year 2100. Climate scientists do this type of modeling using what’s known as temperature pathways, projecting different scenarios for the coming decades based on assumptions about greenhouse gas output. Will society’s adoption of electric vehicles go faster than expected? Will coal power plants continue operating for longer?
Axa needed to form the same assumptions about the future emissions associated with everything in its vast portfolio, from U.S. treasuries to Nestle SA (SIX:NESN). To do that, it needed reliable data on emissions—both those produced directly by a business or a country, as well as those created by customers using the products of a company whose shares it owns. Emission-reductions plans, such as net-zero pledges or corporate investments in green technologies, as well as relevant state-level commitments to cut greenhouse gases, also are taken into consideration.
With all that information, Axa’s portfolio can be assessed under the same sort of temperature pathways used by scientists to estimate how much carbon dioxide can be emitted by the economy before the planet breaches various warming thresholds. That’s how Axa calculates its portfolio score, based on the size of its holdings.
At a company level, the results of this process can be surprising. Even companies making bold commitments to reduce emissions can heat up a portfolio. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). plans to be carbon neutral by 2040, for example, and yet MSCI ESG Research LLC ascribes a warming potential of 3.9°C to the retail giant. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s 2.9°C warming score stands at odds with its pledge to zero-out emissions from its supply chain and products by 2030. By that year, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects to be carbon negative, meaning it plans to be removing greenhouse gas from the atmosphere on balance; it gets a 2.1°C score.
And giant tech companies tend to be forthcoming with emissions data, which isn’t the case in other sectors. A new report by the Transition Pathway Initiative determined that only 16 of 111 large publicly-listed industrial companies, such as miners and steelmakers, publish emissions projections that align with the Paris Agreement.
Still, even with imperfect data and subject to a fair amount of skepticism, the effort to calculate warming potential shows how climate concern is changing the rules of the game for investors and businesses alike. Measuring a company’s alignment with the Paris objectives has the potential to become a regular part of investment analysis, in much the same way fund managers now scrutinize cash flows and earnings.
“It would be ideal if this metric became part of the everyday lexicon of traders and analysts,” said David Lunsford, co-founder of Carbon Delta who now leads climate strategy and policy at MSCI in Zurich. “More data disclosure would help us to thoroughly assess companies’ temperature alignments and could encourage a wider adoption of the metric.”
Investors that have published a warming potential calculation have two notable commonalities: Their portfolios imply around 3°C of warming, and they have concluded there’s only so much cooling possible on their own.
“To some extent, our portfolio reflects the real economy and there’s a limit to which we can disconnect from that,” said Ben Carr, an analytics and capital-modeling director at Aviva, where he has led the London-based insurer’s work on the development of climate metrics. Aviva recorded a warming potential at the end of 2019 of 3.2°C for its equities holdings and 3°C for corporate credit.
For most of the early adopters, the results are rather dystopian. Japan’s GPIF estimated 2.76°C of warming for equities and 2.88°C for bonds in its home market, while its foreign stock and fixed-income holdings had a warming potential of 2.97°C and 2.76°C, respectively.
In the U.S., meanwhile, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System said its global equity and fixed-income holdings, which account for 75% of its assets, are on track for a warming potential of 3.23°C by 2050.
Aviva reduced the warming potential of its equity and credit portfolios by 0.2°C between 2018 and 2019 by engaging with portfolio companies. It also divested from those “where we see no prospect of progress,” Carr said.
While that approach may have brought some success in the past, time is running out to curb emissions and set the economy on path to net zero, according to a December report from MSCI’s ESG research group. Institutional investors, working with governments and the public, are going to have to do their part to persuade companies to make radical changes. If they don’t, there’s a growing risk that money managers will face a rapidly-shrinking universe of investments that can be considered Paris-aligned, the MSCI analysts said.
Just 16% of an MSCI index covering 9,000 stocks globally were aligned to a 2°C temperature-rise scenario at the end of November, and only 5% were on course for a 1.5°C world, MSCI said, making clear just how much more needs to be done.
“The warming-potential concept requires a far broader public-private effort that cannot be achieved by investors alone,” said Decoene, who’s also responsible for corporate communications and brand management at Axa. “This is a huge undertaking, for us and also for markets, businesses and policymakers.”
World leaders will gather later this year in Glasgow, Scotland, for what could be the most consequential moment for climate diplomacy since the Paris agreement: a United Nations conference at which signatories of the 2015 accord are expected to ramp up their ambitions for cutting emissions.
The event in Glasgow also may be a significant moment for financial markets. Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who was appointed UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance in 2019, has laid out a strategy for building a net-zero world in which every financial decision is made with consideration for the climate. Among his desired outcomes is the development of a portfolio-alignment framework that investors can use to gauge where they stand on the path to net zero.
Currently, opinion is divided. The two co-chairs of the Transition Pathway Initiative, an entity supported by the likes of Pacific Investment Management Co. and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) that assesses companies’ preparedness for the transition to a low carbon world, offered a scathing criticism of implied temperature-increase metrics last month. Faith Ward and Adam Matthews said there’s a lack of reliable emissions data to make the computations and the metrics rely on assumptions.
By contrast, the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a $5 trillion coalition of pension and insurance funds, including Axa, Aviva and Calpers, said this month it supports standardization and development of portfolio-warming metrics. Decoene said Axa, which leads the Alliance’s warming-potential working group, is aware of the weaknesses, but it’s still “actively promoting temperature metrics.”
The question of whether portfolio-alignment scores are informative or misleading forms part of a broader question about climate models. A recent paper by a group of academics and climate scientists suggests financial markets may misuse them because they operate on different time horizons and with different priorities, increasing the likelihood of mispricing climate risks and even greenwashing.
Generation Investment’s Blood warned against nitpicking. Even with flaws in the early models, warming-potential metrics can provide insight on the gap between a portfolio’s constituents policies and the goals of the Paris accord, he said.
“If we just continue with incrementalism, we aren’t going to get there,” Blood said. “We may need to rethink the allocation of capital. Perhaps climate impact needs to be the driver of that over the next five years. And perhaps we should debate the repercussions of a three-degree world.”
Action must be immediate and decisive to cut emissions, Blood said, and that should mean changes in the way investors make decisions. “If we have 10 years of great returns and yet are locked into a three-degree world, that is a terrible outcome for all our stakeholders,” he said. “Perhaps we should be measuring returns differently?”

367,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:08AM ET</span>",Facebook 'refriends' Australia after changes to media laws,"By Byron Kaye and Colin Packham
CANBERRA (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said on Tuesday it will restore Australian news pages after negotiating changes with the government to a proposed law that forces tech giants to pay for media content displayed on their platforms.
Australia and the social media group have been locked in a standoff for more than a week after the government introduced legislation that challenged Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google's dominance in the news content market.
Facebook last week blocked Australian users from sharing and viewing news content on its popular social media platform, drawing criticism from publishers and the government.
But after a series of talks between Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a concession deal has been struck, with Australian news expected to return to the social media site in coming days.
The issue has been widely watched internationally as other countries including Canada and Britain consider similar legislation.
""Facebook has refriended Australia, and Australian news will be restored to the Facebook platform,"" Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday.
Frydenberg said Australia had been a ""proxy battle for the world"" as other jurisdictions engage with tech companies over a range of issues around news and content.
While Big Tech and media outlets have battled over the right to news content in other jurisdictions, Australia's proposed laws are the most expansive and seen as a possible template for other nations.
""Facebook and Google have not hidden the fact that they know that the eyes of the world are on Australia, and that's why they have sought I think to get a code here that is workable,"" Frydenberg said.
Australia will offer four amendments, which include a change to the proposed mandatory arbitration mechanism used when the tech giants cannot reach a deal with publishers over fair payment for displaying news content.
'UNTESTED'
Facebook said it was satisfied with the revisions, which will need to be implemented in legislation currently before the parliament.
""Going forward, the government has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won't automatically be subject to a forced negotiation,"" Facebook Vice President of Global News Partnerships Campbell Brown said in a statement online.
She said the company would continue to invest in news globally but also ""resist efforts by media conglomerates to advance regulatory frameworks that do not take account of the true value exchange between publishers and platforms like Facebook.""
The government had up until Monday maintained it would not change the legislation.
Analysts said while the concessions marked some progress for tech platforms, the government and the media, there remained many uncertainties about how the law would work.
The amendments include an additional two-month mediation period before the government-appointed arbitrator intervenes, giving the parties more time to reach a private deal.
It also inserts a rule that an internet company's existing media deals be taken into account before the rules take effect, a measure that Frydenberg said would encourage internet companies to strike deals with smaller outlets.
The so-called Media Bargaining Code has been designed by the government and competition regulator to address a power imbalance between the social media giants and publishers when negotiating payment for news content used on the tech firms' sites.
Media companies have argued that they should be compensated for the links that drive audiences, and advertising dollars, to the internet companies' platforms.
A spokesman for Australian publisher and broadcaster Nine Entertainment Co Ltd welcomed the government's compromise, which it said moved ""Facebook back into the negotiations with Australian media organisations.""
Major television broadcaster and newspaper publisher Seven West Media Ltd said it had signed a letter of intent to strike a content supply deal with Facebook within 60 days.
A representative of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), which has a major presence in Australia's news industry and last week announced a global licencing deal with Google, was not immediately available for comment.
The proposed code will apply to Facebook and Google, although the competition regulator, which advised government on the legislation, has said it's likely other tech firms will be added.
Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Australia's Curtin University, said Facebook's negotiating tactics had dented its reputation, although it was too early to say how the proposed law would work.
""The law itself remains untested. It's like a gun that sits in the Treasurer's desk that hasn't been used or tested,"" said Leaver.
Frydenberg said Google had welcomed the changes. A Google spokesman declined to comment on Reuters' queries.
Google also previously threatened to withdraw its search engine from Australia but later struck a series of deals with publishers. 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chair Rod Sims, the main architect of the law, declined to comment.

The government will introduce the amendments to Australia's parliament on Tuesday, Frydenberg said. The country's two houses of parliament will need to approve the amended proposal before it becomes law.

370,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 05:23AM ET</span>",StockBeat: U.K. Reopening Plays Surge Again on Hopes for Return of Normality,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.K. stocks are reaping the benefits of the government's vaccination policy, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader in Europe to map out a clear timetable for a return to normality after a second winter of lockdowns.
The U.K.-focused FTSE 250 index was the best performing index in Europe by a distance on Tuesday, rising nearly 1% by mid-morning in London thanks to strong gains in all manner of stocks poised to gain from the reopening of shops and the return of commuters to their offices. The FTSE 100, meanwhile, was the best performing of the larger boards, as sustained strength in mining and commodity stocks limited its losses to 0.2%. 
By contrast, most European markets were markedly lower, as increasing talk about the return of inflation prompted investors to take money off the table, especially in those stocks which have been major winners in the pandemic. The German Tech Dax was down 2.9% while the OMX Copenhagen 20 also fell over 2%, as money poured out of the likes of Vestas Wind Systems (OTC:VWDRY) and jeweler Pandora (OTC:PANDY).
The chief trigger for the move was a TV address by Johnson late on Monday which promised a ""cautious and irreversible"" way out of lockdown in four stages, which aims to lift all meaningful restrictions on social and business life by early July.  
""The end really is in sight,"" Johnson said. 
The global audience might wonder that the words of a man who has already told countless, demonstrable falsehoods - mainly but not exclusively about Brexit - can still persuade people to commit real money to markets (unless as a contrary indicator). However, this time, Johnson has the facts on his side: deaths from Covid-19 are averaging less than 500 a day for the first time this year, while the number of new infections is down by some 80% from its peak in January. Nearly 18 million people have already received their first vaccination - over one-third of the adult population - and fresh data released over the weekend offered tangible proof that the decision to lengthen the time between the two required injections had slowed transmission of the disease as well as easing pressure on a stretched hospital system. After a year of at times spectacular mismanagement, London appears to have found a recipe for success.
Reopening is even more important for the U.K. economy than for many others, given the intensity of services in its GDP. The blow to services is one reason that U.K. GDP fell more sharply than, say, Germany's last year. As the European economy reverts to the mean, the figures will flatter Britain. In particular, they will flatter pub chains like J D Wetherspoon  (LON:JDW) or  Mitchells & Butlers  (LON:MAB), commercial landlords like  Hammerson  (LON:HMSO) or  British Land  (LON:BLND), or the companies whose food and news agent outlets dominate the country's rail and bus stations, such as SSP Group (OTC:SSPPF) and WH Smith (LON:SMWH). It was these midcaps that led the charge on Tuesday, along with other High Street names like fast-food joint  Greggs  (LON:GRG) and transport-themed stocks such as Trainline and hotel owner  Whitbread  (LON:WTB). 
Such stocks are more certain gainers in the near term than those that depend on the revival of international travel and tourism. EasyJet (LON:EZJ), conspicuously rose 10% after saying that bookings had risen 300% in the wake of Johnson's speech, but that comes off a pitifully low base, and international tourism demands the cooperation of other countries, chiefly in Europe, whose reopening schedules are well behind the U.K.'s - so far, in fact, as to cast real doubt over how open they will be by summertime. 
Even so, EasyJet's offhand statement lifted the whole travel and tourism sector, with big gains in everything from Jet2 (LON:JET2) to Rolls Royce (LON:RR), whose outlook for maintenance revenues improves with every extra hour that airlines use its engines. 
It remains a mean reversion story. both on a small scale and a large one: on the macro level, U.K. equities remain the biggest underweight in Bank of America's weekly surveys of international fund managers, due to Brexit and cyclical issues.  At a company specific level, the biggest gains are likely to be in stocks that were until now the most distressed, such as movie theater owner Cineworld.  But for those who don't need the excitement of high beta, the country's banks and asset managers probably remain the safer bet.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 05:23AM ET</span>","Commodities rally, stocks steady, yields off highs","By Danilo Masoni and Anshuman Daga
MILAN/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Optimism about the economic outlook pushed commodity prices to new highs on Tuesday, helping stocks steady as expectations of a dovish testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell calmed down bond yields.
The MSCI world equity benchmark was flat near two week lows by 0919 GMT, helped by gains in commodity-heavy equity indexes in Asia and a rally in European travel stocks on the prospect of easing social restrictions.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out a phased plan on Monday to end a COVID-19 lockdown in the world's sixth largest economy.
World stocks had been weighed down in recent sessions by a rapid surge in global bond yields which fuelled expectations that central banks could eventually turn less accommodative in a bid to tame inflation. Tech stocks were among the hardest hit.
But the sell-off in the bond market eased after European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said on Monday the central bank was ""closely monitoring"" rising borrowing costs.
Investors now expect Fed's Powell to be equally reassuring when he testifies before Congress at 1500 GMT.
""If there were already any expectations that Powell could try to calm down rates, then (Lagarde's remarks) have just further cemented them,"" said Giuseppe Sersale, strategist and fund manager at Anthilia in Milan.
Tech stocks and rate-sensitive sectors like utilities in Europe however fell, offsetting stronger travel and commodity stocks and pushing down the  regional benchmark by 0.6%.
In Asia, the rally in commodities lifted Australia's S&P/ASX 200 0.9%, while tech-laden South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3%. Japanese markets were shut for a public holiday.
Nasdaq futures were down 0.6% at three-week lows after high-growth stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dragged the index down 2.5% on Monday, while S&P 500 futures inched 0.1% lower.
Bond yields have risen sharply this month as prospects of more U.S. fiscal stimulus boosted hopes for a faster economic recovery globally. However, that is also fuelling inflation worries, prompting investors to sell growth stocks that have rallied in recent months.
""Real U.S. interest rates are now in positive territory, which has created some concern around the consequences for equities markets,"" Cesar Perez Ruiz, chief investment officer at Pictet Wealth Management said in a report.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields edged up to 1.374% but remained below the one-year high of 1.394% hit on Monday.
Germany's 10-year Bund yields also rose to -0.309% but were below the 8-month high of -0.278% hit in the previous session.
Commodity prices strengthened again. 
Oil prices jumped by more than $1, underpinned by optimism over COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and lower output as U.S. supplies were slow to return after a deep freeze in Texas shut in crude production last week.
Brent crude was last up 0.9% at $66.18 a barrel after earlier hitting a fresh 13-month high of $66.79, while U.S. crude rose 1.2% to $62.45 a barrel.
""Oil has been caught up in the broader commodities move higher, with a weaker USD proving constructive for the complex,"" ING strategists led by Warren Patterson said in a note.
""Meanwhile, there is also a growing view that the oil market is looking increasingly tight over the remainder of the year"".
Copper prices meanwhile hit a 9-1/2-year high as tight supply and solid demand from top consumer China boosted sentiment. 
In currency markets, the dollar briefly dropped to its lowest since Jan. 13 ahead of Powell's testimony, while commodity-linked currencies hovered near multi-year highs. 

The dollar index was up 0.1% at 90.143, with the euro flat at $1.2151.

(Reuters) - European shares reversed early gains to trade lower on Tuesday as mixed corporate earnings updates overshadowed a boost from strong commodity prices, while British bank HSBC fell after abandoning its long-term profitability targets.
HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) dropped 1.5% after its annual profits fell sharply due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while it unveiled a revised strategy focused mainly on wealth management in Asia.
The benchmark euro zone stock index was down 0.8%. Tech and healthcare stocks fell the most, while oil and gas and travel shares gained nearly 1%.
""Investors are cautiously optimistic about the rise in U.S. bond yields and what that tells us about inflation trajectories, while German shares seem to be weighing on the wider European market as tech stocks weaken further with the DAX being a tech-focussed index,"" said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets. 
Investors are tracking U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to the senate committee later in the day for clues on the central bank's thinking to a recent rise in yields.
Meanwhile, core European government bond yields resumed their upward trajectory, even after the European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Monday signalled discomfort with the recent surge in yields.
European stocks have rallied sharply off pandemic-driven lows hit last year. But unlike their peers across the Atlantic, they have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels amid concerns over a stalling economic recovery and slow vaccine rollout.
UK's FTSE 100 index traded flat at 0905 GMT, while the mid-cap index jumped 1%, led by gains in travel stocks as the country looks to ease its lockdown restrictions in a phased manner. 
Holiday Inn-owner InterContinental Hotels gained 3% after it said a faster recovery in its Holiday Inn Express brand had helped it outperform in key markets, even as it booked an annual loss of $153 million.
In other earnings news, German healthcare group Fresenius slipped after it narrowed down its 2021 sales growth forecast and said it would launch a cost-cutting program, while cement-maker HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG) dropped 2.3% even after preliminary results showed core profit was up 6% last year.
Germany's benchmark index traded 1.0% lower with Heidelberg being the second biggest loser on the index.

French energy group Total gained nearly 2% after it agreed to sell off stakes in some wind and solar farms to Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) Assurances and Banque des Territoires.

In a weekly commentary note, strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said the firm was increasing its 'underweight' on U.S. Treasuries. Yields on U.S. Treasuries, which move inverse to price, have hit their highest levels since February 2020 this week as investors have sold government bonds.
The asset manager also said it was upgrading European stocks to a 'neutral', noting that it saw room for the market to close a valuation gap with the rest of the world. It downgraded credit and euro area peripheral bonds and to 'neutral'.
BlackRock also said it was debuting an 'overweight' call on UK equities in the wake of Brexit, while retaining it overweight stance on U.S. and emerging market stocks and underweight on Japanese stocks. 
Britain's FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 have underperformed global stock market indices since the start of 2016, the year the country voted to exit the European Union.
""We expect our new nominal theme of stronger growth and a muted response in nominal bond yields to higher inflation to further play out, even after significant market moves,"" strategists at the BII said in the note. 
""This supports our tactically pro-risk stance. A key risk is a further increase in long-term yields as markets grapple with an economic restart that could beat expectations.""

""This could spark bouts of volatility, even though we believe the Fed would lean against any sharp moves for the time being.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Ltd and former suitor U.S.-based Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) are close to agreeing a joint venture that would give the American fund control of its asset management business AMP Capital, a source with knowledge of the deal said. 
The arrangement, which could be finalised and announced within the next week, would leverage Ares distribution networks to distribute AMP investment funds, the person said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are private. 
Representatives for AMP, which on Feb. 11 said Ares had withdrawn a A$6.36 billion ($5.03 billion) takeover offer for the whole company, declined to comment.
Representatives for Ares also declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Bloomberg reported on Tuesday the deal could value the asset management business at more than A$3 billion and AMP would retain a minority stake, citing people familiar with the matter.
Following reviews in the past six months that sought to find a buyer for AMP as a whole or its units, the Sydney-based firm last week said it had closed all but one of the processes.
Its wealth management businesses in Australia and New Zealand and a banking division, were no longer under review but it would continue in negotiations with Ares about a potential sale or partnership involving AMP Capital. 
A deal was not certain, Chief Executive Francesco De Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) said at the time.

(Reuters) - British private security group  G4S  (CSE:G4S) on Tuesday urged shareholders to accept Allied Universal's 3.8 billion pound ($5.4 billion) final offer after the end of the U.S. bidder's drawn-out takeover battle with Canada's GardaWorld.
Hostile bidder GardaWorld had called a halt to the contest on Monday by telling the UK's Takeover Panel it would not increase its December bid of 235 pence per share for the world's largest private security company.
Allied on Tuesday said it would not increase the 245 pence per share offer it announced on Dec. 8, making it the final bid. 
G4S had backed that offer last year after repeatedly rejecting GardaWorld's hostile advances, but low shareholder acceptance forced repeated extensions to offer deadlines.
""G4S directors unanimously recommend that G4S shareholders accept the final Allied Universal offer,"" The London-listed company said.
Allied on Tuesday extended its offer deadline to March 16 and the acceptance condition was lowered to 75% from 90% in nominal value and voting rights.
It has largely obtained the required antitrust regulatory approvals in the United States and European Union, Allied Universal added, though Britain has yet to approve the deal. 
""The biggest issue now is probably the pension deficit in the UK, which has constricted M&A deals in the recent past involving G4S UK businesses,"" said Morningstar analyst Michael Field.
G4S last year sold most of its cash-handling business to rival Brinks Co but held on to the UK operations with attached pension obligations.
In its offer document, Allied said it planned to evaluate the possibility of exiting the prison business, where G4S has faced problems in the past, and some other markets, such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan and Uganda. 
""Allied will have to work with the pension trustees to come to an arrangement if it wishes to divest anything here (in the UK),"" Field added.
Shares in G4S traded flat at 242 pence at 0855 GMT.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese social media platform Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Corp has appointed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and CLSA to work on its planned Hong Kong secondary listing in the final half of 2021, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The listing by China's largest microblogging platform could raise up to $700 million, one of those people said, as the company joined a wave of Hong Kong share sales by U.S.-listed Chinese companies. 
The Nasdaq-listed company, which has a market capitalisation of $13.2 billion and is backed by tech giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), is considering selling about 5% of its enlarged share capital in Hong Kong to broaden the investor base, one of the sources said.
They asked not be named because the information has not been made public.
Weibo did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and CLSA declined to comment. 
A Hong Kong listing adds Weibo to the Chinese companies whose shares are trading in New York that are seeking to return to exchanges closer to home against the backdrop of political tension between the United States and China.
Refinitiv data shows $34 billion in secondary listings in Hong Kong since Alibaba's $12.9 billion float in late 2019. Last year, e-tailer JD (NASDAQ:JD).com raised $4.5 billion and games developer NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc raised $3.1 billion.
Other Chinese companies planning such listings include popular video site Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI), search engine giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and online travel major Ctrip.
Weibo, which went public in 2014, has seen its shares gain 42% so far this year, outperforming the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese firms listed on the U.S. exchange and has advanced 26% over the same period.

The Beijing-based company reported $417 million in advertising and marketing revenues, its core source of income, in the third quarter, flat year-on-year, following fierce competition from rivals, such as Bytedance, which runs popular short video app Douyin and online video firm Kuaishou.

Several Nordic pulp makers are part of projects developing new clean ways https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nordics-forestry-idCAKCN0WF076 to turn trees into textile fibre. 
TreeToTextile said in a statement its plant would have a production capacity of 1,500 tonnes and its owners would fund the bulk of the 35 million euro ($42.6 million) investment.
""The novel process is deliberately designed to have low energy demand and low chemical need. It is engineered to suit large scale production and includes a recovery systemfor reusing chemicals,"" it said.
""By investing in a demonstration plant, we are finally on the go. With it we are turning years of R&D into reality to increase the biobased share on the textile market to support climate action.""
TreeToTextile, whose fourth part-owner is innovator Lars Stigsson, said the plant would be located at Stora Enso's Nymolla mill in Sweden, and its construction would start in the near future. 
Viscose is the main existing textile fibre from wood pulp - followed by the newer lyocell which has a cleaner manufacturing method. Production is dominated by Austria’s Lenzing, India’s Aditya Birla and China’s Sateri.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Tuesday, despite higher commodity prices with HSBC weighing as the region’s largest bank illustrated the current difficulties for the sector.
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.1%.
HSBC (LON:HSBA) stock lost 2% after its annual profit fell sharply due to the Covid-19 pandemic, dropping 34% from a year ago to $8.78 billion.
That still beat analysts’ expectations of $8.33 billion, according to estimates compiled by HSBC. However, the bank abandoned its long-term profitability target, and unveiled a revised strategy focused mainly on wealth management in Asia, underlining the tough outlook for the banking sector with interest rates at all-time lows.
However, heavily-weighted resource stocks have helped limit losses in Europe with commodity prices on a tear. 
Oil prices surged Tuesday with U.S. production slow to return from the deep freeze which affected large swathes of the country last week, while both base metals, like copper, and precious metals, such as gold, have climbed sharply on the back of global recovery hopes and inflationary concerns.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $62.22 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $64.96. Gold futures were 0.1% lower at $1,806.30/oz, while copper futures were flat at $4.15/oz, not far off the all-time high set in 2011.
As a result, BHP (LON:BHPB) stock climbed 1%, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock gained 0.5%, BP (NYSE:BP) stock rose 3.2% and Shell (LON:RDSa) stock gained 1.4%.
Elsewhere, German cement-maker HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG) stock fell 2.1% even as it posted a 6% rise in core profit for last year, while private security firm  G4S  (CSE:G4S) recommended shareholders vote for Allied Universal's final offer, ending a months-long takeover battle with Canada's GardaWorld.
In economic news, the U.K. received some good news Tuesday, as the unemployed claimant count actually fell by 20,000 in January as opposed to rising by the forecast 35,000. That said, the unemployment rate climbed to 5.1%, the highest in nearly five years.
On Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined a path to take his country out of Covid-19 lockdown, in an effort to gradually reopen the battered economy, aided by one of the fastest vaccine rollouts in the world.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies saw slight revenue and profit growth in 2020, in line with its expectations, its rotating chairman said on Tuesday, even as Washington toughened up sanctions against the Chinese telecom equipment maker.
The company was put on an export blacklist by former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019 and barred from accessing critical technology of U.S. origin, affecting its ability to design its own chips and source components from outside vendors. 
Huawei has repeatedly denied it poses a security risk.

""Operations were relatively stable and in line with our guidance, registering slight growth in revenue and profit.""

380,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",Damage to United Boeing 777 engine consistent with metal fatigue: NTSB,"By David Shepardson and Jamie Freed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Damage to a fan blade on an engine that failed on a United Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 flight is consistent with metal fatigue, based on a preliminary assessment, the chairman of the U.S. air accident investigator said on Monday.
The Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engine failed on Saturday with a ""loud bang"" four minutes after takeoff from Denver, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters following an initial analysis of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.
There was minor damage to the aircraft body but no structural damage, he said.
He said it remained unclear whether the incident is consistent with an engine failure on a different Hawaii-bound United flight in February 2018 that was attributed to a fatigue fracture in a fan blade.
""What is important that we really truly understand the facts, circumstances and conditions around this particular event before we can compare it to any other event,"" Sumwalt said.
The engine that failed on the 26-year-old  Boeing Co  777 and shed parts over a Denver suburb was a PW4000 used on 128 planes, or less than 10% of the global fleet of more than 1,600 delivered 777 widebody jets.
In another incident on Japan Airlines (JAL) 777 with a PW4000 engine in December 2020, Japan's Transport Safety Board reported it found two damaged fan blades, one with a metal fatigue crack. An investigation is ongoing.
The focus is more on engine maker Pratt and analysts expect little financial impact on Boeing, but the PW4000 issues are a fresh headache for the planemaker as it recovers from the far more serious 737 MAX crisis. Boeing's flagship narrowbody jet was grounded for nearly two years after two deadly crashes.
The United engine's fan blade will be examined on Tuesday after being flown to a Pratt laboratory where it will examined under supervision of NTSB investigators.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it had already been evaluating whether to adjust fan blade inspections in the wake of the December incident in Japan after reviewing maintenance records and conducting a metallurgical examination of the fan blade fragment.
Boeing recommended that airlines suspend the use of the planes while the FAA identified an appropriate inspection protocol, and Japan imposed a temporary suspension on flights. 
Pratt & Whitney, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp., has recommended airlines increase inspections in a plan that is being reviewed by the FAA, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Pratt did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The FAA has said it plans to issue an emergency airworthiness directive soon that will require stepped-up inspections of the fan blades for fatigue. 
""United Airlines has grounded all of the affected airplanes with these engines, and I understand the FAA is also working very quickly as well as Pratt & Whitney has reiterated or revised a service bulletin,"" Sumwalt said. ""It looks like action is being taken.""
In March 2019, after the 2018 United engine failure attributed to fan blade fatigue, the FAA ordered inspections every 6,500 cycles. A cycle is one take-off and landing.
South Korea's transport ministry said on Tuesday it had told its airlines to inspect the fan blades every 1,000 cycles following guidance from Pratt after the United incident. 
Sumwalt said the United incident was not considered an uncontained engine failure because the containment ring contained the parts as they were flying out.
NTSB will look into why the engine cowling separated from the plane and also why there was a fire despite indications fuel to the engine had been turned off, Sumwalt added.
Industry sources said that although the engine is made by Pratt, the cowling, or casing, is manufactured by Boeing. Boeing referred questions on the part to the NTSB.

Nearly half of the global fleet of PW4000-equipped Boeing 777 jets operated by airlines including United, JAL, ANA Holdings, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines had already been grounded amid a plunge in travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.

APA has been looking to acquire a North American pipeline business for several years, saying previously it was targeting a controlling stake in a business with an enterprise value of up to A$4 billion ($3.2 billion).
Chief Executive Rob Wheals said the company sees $2.6 trillion of investments needed in energy infrastructure and renewable generation in the United States over the next 20 years to meet shifting energy needs.
APA is now looking at integrated gas and electricity transmission companies, where it expects growth to meet net zero emissions targets, as well as gas pipelines and utilities.
""North America remains an extremely attractive market for APA and is key to our refreshed strategy,"" Wheals told analysts on a half-year results conference call.
""We're going to do something that's big enough to make sense but not big enough that we bet the farm,"" he told Reuters.
APA also plans to spend more than A$1 billion between 2021 and 2023 on projects in Australia, including a three-stage, 50% expansion of capacity to deliver gas from the northeastern state of Queensland state to Sydney.
And it will spend A$3 million on research to test what it would need to do to repurpose a 43 km (27 mile) section of one of its pipelines in Western Australia to carry pure hydrogen, in the country's first such test. 
Other tests of hydrogen in gas pipelines have involved blending small volumes with gas.
""This is about learning what is going to be required to be 100% hydrogen ready, which could be a game-changer,"" Wheals said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leading when you know where the world is headed is one thing, but it is something else when the future is uncertain.
Corporate executives are facing this challenge in the COVID-19 era, having to chart a path forward in foggy conditions without a map.
As a top headhunter who finds, develops and places those leaders, Krishnan Rajagopalan has seen first-hand how management has changed at this moment in history.
The president and chief executive of Heidrick & Struggles (NASDAQ:HSII) sat down with Reuters to discuss how leaders can keep their teams focused, productive and moving forward.
Q: How has leadership changed in the past year?
A: Leaders needed to be agile. That's a key way we assess people: Agility means having foresight, adaptability, resilience. That was so important last year, when we all experienced setback after setback.
But lots of other attributes became critical, too. Those who were able to embrace building a diverse and inclusive organization became very successful. Communication skills became very important, because you had to communicate more than you ever had to before. And on the personal side, you had to be able to show some humanity and empathy.
Q: Has this crisis changed what companies are looking for in leaders?
A: What people began to talk to us about was the human side of leadership. The ability to focus on not just on profits, but people.
There was more emphasis on human leaders, who could communicate, and be fair and authentic, and who really believe in diversity and inclusion. The bars on those issues were set much higher.
Q: Are there any particular CEOs who serve as good role models, for what leaders can be?
A: I really respect (Chief Executive) Satya Nadella at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). He focuses on the big picture, he can motivate people, and he thinks about the purpose of the company quite a bit. He thinks about their place in the community and on the planet.
Even when they moved to fully remote work, he continued to focus on company purpose and how to drive that. I like that consistency.
Q: You have mentioned the importance of diversity and inclusion, so how do you approach that as a search firm?
A: In 2018, we came out and said that at the board level, we would present a fully diverse slate on candidates on all our board searches.
We have been measuring the diversity of placements across our whole system. Last year in the Americas nearly 60% of our placements at the board level were diverse, and over 40% of our placements overall. We think about this issue on every search.
Q: How do you coach people through Imposter Syndrome, or not feeling qualified enough to be leaders?
A: Through our consulting business, we've certainly seen an uptick from leaders raising concerns about Imposter Syndrome as pandemic uncertainty continues. 
We remind our clients that all of us are operating in a ""new norm"" - no one has been through this current situation of leading through a pandemic. The really good leaders aren't afraid to acknowledge to their teams that they don't know everything, and they are transparent and authentic about that. 
Q: Emotionally this era has been hard on employees and leaders alike. What advice do you have for people about pushing through?
A: Be mindful of your mental well-being. What applies to employees, applies to leaders as well. It's OK to be vulnerable, and to show that with your team. 
I tell people not to bottle it all up. Communicate, communicate, communicate.
Q: Do you see this pace of change continuing in 2021?

A: It's only going to increase. When you think about it, we went from largely office-based environments to virtual worlds so incredibly fast. That pace is going to continue, and we're not going to return to previous ways of working. The world is changing, and leaders are changing as well.

The company faces 25,000 lawsuits by former users of its baby powder who say asbestos-laced talc in the product caused their cancers, it said in a securities filing https://johnsonandjohnson.gcs-web.com/static-files/e2a329b4-aeb6-438d-a449-f0e282cf8ee0 on Monday.
The figure is nearly double the $2.1 billion the company, based in New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey, said in November it would set aside for talc verdicts.
Johnson & Johnson has faced intense scrutiny over the safety of its baby powder following a 2018 Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer that found it knew for decades about asbestos in the talc.
Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.
The drugmaker is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court against an award of $2.12 billion in damages in Missouri to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in its products.

In November, a New York state judge ordered the company to pay damages of $120 million to a Brooklyn couple, after the woman blamed her cancer on asbestos exposure from using its baby powder.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Tuesday morning, clawing back some gains following their U.S. counterparts’ fluctuation during the previous session.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.97% by 10:30 PM ET (3:30 AM GMT). Bookings for the city’s residents to be inoculated with Sinovac’s Coronavac vaccine opened earlier in the day. Debate on reforming the city’s election rules continued, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam telling a press conference earlier in the day, “it is crystal clear we have reached a stage where the central authorities will have to take action to address the situation, including electoral reform.”
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.34% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.60%.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.51% while in Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.54%. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.
Investors are now re-evaluating expectations for a quick recovery from COVID-19 and the inflation that is driving both commodities and bond yields up. The rally in global shares in 2020 in the wake of COVID-19 is also under scrutiny as the cost of longer-term borrowing rise.
Concerns over the rising bond yields have even made their way up to policymakers, with European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde saying on Monday that her institution is “closely monitoring” the market for government bonds.
There are also rising concerns that shares have already priced in a good part of the global economic recovery expectations that have been driven by global COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and the prospect of further U.S. stimulus packages. There are also concerns that central banks such as the ECB led by Lagarde will eventually ease emergency fiscal programs that have boosted global markets.
The key drivers of equities “may be fading as markets come to terms with the next phase of the recovery … I wouldn’t be surprised if market returns are more volatile in the coming months. My approach to fixed income would be to look for opportunities to start to buy the long end again,” AXA Investment Managers chief investment officer Chris Iggo told Blomberg.
Bond markets steadied after the gap between five and 30-year yields, a key part of the U.S. Treasury curve, climbed to the highest level in over six years. Cash Treasuries will not be traded on Tuesday on account of the Japanese holiday.
Other investors were also pessimistic.
“The sell-off in bonds is like a car crash in slow motion for equity investors … a higher interest rate environment forces investors to consider the opportunity costs of investments. Stocks that have significant borrowing, or produce no income for investors, may be particularly vulnerable,” CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petrobras shares plunged 22% on Monday, wiping out 71 billion reais ($13 billion) in market value, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro again slammed its pricing policies after he replaced the state-controlled oil company's market-friendly CEO with a retired army general. 
The selloff, following a series of analyst downgrades, deepened after Bolsonaro said the company's fuel policy was only pleasing to financial markets and select groups in Brazil and should be changed as part of an effort to lower gasoline and diesel prices.
Overall, the last few days have marked a dramatic about-face for Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist whose interventionist instincts until now had been largely contained by economically conservative allies.
Shares in state electricity company Eletrobras also plunged on Monday after Bolsonaro said it would be the next sector in which the government would ""stick its finger.""
In comments to Brazil's Radio Bandeirantes on Monday, Joaquim Silva e Luna, the man tapped by Bolsonaro on Friday to take the reins from Roberto Castello Branco, floated the idea of a government fund, or ""cushion"", to lessen the effects of fluctuating fuel prices on consumers.
Bolsonaro doubled down on his criticism of Castello Branco, mocking his decision to social distance since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the severity of which the president has repeatedly minimized.
""Now, the current Petrobras chief executive, let's be very clear, has been at home for 11 months without working, working remotely. Now, the boss has to be on the front line,"" Bolsonaro said, adding: ""This is for me unacceptable.""
BONDS ALSO HIT
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Santander (MC:SAN), Scotiabank, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Bradesco and XP (NASDAQ:XP) analysts were among those who downgraded their recommendations on shares of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known.
""A good reputation is hard to earn and easy to lose,"" BTG bank analyst Thiago Duarte said in a note to clients.
Dollar-denominated debt issued by Petrobras also suffered hefty losses with the 2043 bond dropping 7.6 cents to trade at a seven-month low of 98 cents on the dollar, Refinitiv data showed.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) removed its 'like' recommendation on Brazil sovereign bonds on Monday, citing fiscal concerns and potential spillover from the removal of Castello Branco.
Petrobras' ""all-important"" pricing policy and its implications for cash generation and planned asset sales, particularly of its refineries, has clouded its debt reduction and dividend outlook, Santander analysts led by Christian Audi said in a note to clients. They downgraded their recommendation on the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy.""
Director-General Rodolfo Saboia of Brazil's oil regulator ANP said that the CEO change would not affect the country's policy of opening up the refinery sector to private investment or pursuit of free markets. He declined to comment directly on Petrobras' refinery sales.
""The best way to attempt to reach a fair price is by opening the market ... and not depending on one actor to set the price a certain product should have,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post after the close of trading on Friday, Bolsonaro announced the nomination of Silva e Luna, a former defense minister who has been managing giant hydroelectric dam Itaipu, to replace Branco. 
The retired general, who lacks any oil and gas industry experience, said in the Radio Bandeirantes interview that he had not discussed and does not have an opinion on an eventual privatization of the company.
On Saturday, Silva e Luna told Reuters that the company needed to find ""balance"" in fuel pricing, considering the impact on shareholders, investors, sellers and consumers.
Brazil's securities industry watchdog CVM on Monday announced the opening of an investigation on the change of leadership, confirming an earlier Reuters report on the matter.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) expects to deliver more than 13 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine per week to the United States by the middle of March, more than doubling its shipments from early February, a top Pfizer executive said in prepared testimony ahead of a Tuesday congressional hearing.
Pfizer has shipped around 40 million doses to locations across the United States so far and is on track to deliver 120 million doses of its two-dose regimen by the end of March, said John Young, Pfizer's chief business officer.
He added that Pfizer is also prepared to provide a total of 300 million shots to the United States by the end of July and has raised global production expectations for 2021 to at least 2 billion doses.
In his own prepared remarks,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc President Stephen Hoge said the drugmaker plans to deliver 100 million doses of its two-dose shot by the end of March, and 300 million by the end of July.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) believes it will be able to ship at least 20 million doses of its single-dose shot to the United States by the end of March after receiving U.S. regulatory authorization, said Vice President of Medical Affairs Richard Nettles. It expects to ship 100 million doses by mid-year 2021, it said.
The drugmakers’ remarks put the United States on track to receive 240 million doses by the end of March, enough to inoculate 130 million Americans, and 700 million doses by mid-year, more than enough to dose the entire U.S. population.

The comments were prepared ahead of a U.S. congressional hearing on vaccine availability to be held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on Tuesday.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) on Monday posted a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss despite higher oil and gas prices as an asset sale weighed on results.
The U.S. producer has slashed jobs and output after the coronavirus pandemic hammered global energy demand, pressuring an energy company that had loaded up on debt in 2019 to acquire an oil rival. Its fourth-quarter loss widened to $731 million compared with a $269 million loss in the same quarter a year ago. 
Shares fell as much as 4% in after-hours trading but later pared losses to trade down 2% at $25.85.
The adjusted per-share loss of 78 cents was higher than analyst expectations for a 59-cent loss, according to IBES data on Refinitiv. For the same quarter last year, the company reported a per-share loss of 30 cents. 
“We remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and transitioned into 2021 with an improved financial position by achieving our 2020 divestiture target, reducing debt and successfully extending debt maturities,” said Chief Executive Vicki Hollub. 
Occidental reported a net loss of $1.3 billion, or $1.41 per share, flat with the $1.3 billion, or $1.50 per share, loss in the fourth quarter of 2019. The latest loss included a pretax charge of $820 million from the sale of oil properties in West Texas. 
The company collected 5% more, or $40.77 per barrel, for its oil in the fourth quarter from the third, benefiting from a rebound in oil prices. It also collected 31% more for its natural gas during the final quarter compared with the third. 
Occidental forecast the current quarter's oil and gas production would shrink about 4%, mostly due to output losses during the recent winter storm in Texas. Shale firms shut some wells as electric power outages and frozen lines curtailed production. 
It projected a $225 million first-quarter profit from chemicals and forecast pipeline and marketing losses would widen to a range of between $135 million and $185 million. 
For the year, Occidental forecast oil and gas output would be flat compared with the fourth quarter at about 1.14 million barrels per day. It expects pretax earnings from its OxyChem chemicals unit to show a profit of between $775 million and $825 million offset by a pretax loss in its pipeline and marketing business of between $650 million and $750 million.
Occidental reiterated capital spending plans of around $2.9 billion this year. 

It plans to sell between $2 billion and $3 billion in properties this year, the proceeds of which would go to pay down its debt of about $33.6 billion.

While natural gas producers have benefited from cold weather forcing closure of wells, shale oil drillers stand on the losing side of the trade as frozen pipes and power supply interruptions are expected to slow an output recovery.
Shale oil producers in the southern United States could take at least two weeks to restart the more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude output that shut down and some of that production may never return, analysts said.
Diamondback on Monday estimated the winter storm will remove about four to five days worth of total production from its current-quarter earnings, sending its shares down 5.4% after the bell.
Occidental forecast first-quarter production of 450,000 to 460,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from the Permian basin, including a 25,000 boepd hit from downtime related to the storm. Its shares fell around 4%.
Smaller rival  Cimarex Energy  Co (NYSE:XEC) said it expects an up to 7% hit to production volume in the first quarter.
Laredo Petroleum (NYSE:LPI) Inc said that extended freezing temperatures and severe icing have hit its Permian basin operations for the last 12 days, though production is starting to return to pre-storm levels.
It forecast a combined impact of shut-in production and well completion delays will reduce the company's first-quarter total production by about 8,000 boepd and oil output by about 3,000 bpd.
Diamondback said it expects full-year total production to average between 308,000 and 325,000 boepd, more than the 300,300 boepd it produced in 2020 when large parts of production was shut down for months to combat pandemic-driven plunges in crude prices.

Occidental, however, forecast full year production to drop from 2020's reported output of 1.35 million boepd to an expected 1.14 million boepd in 2021, as the company sells assets to pay off the massive debt it took on to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) in 2019.

The announcement came days after Schroders applied to set up a wholly-owned mutual fund business in China, where the government fully opened up its giant financial sector to foreign companies last year. 
""Schroders has long been committed to the Chinese market,"" Peter Harrison, Schroders Group Chief Executive Officer, said in a statement.
""The Chinese market represents a significant opportunity for Schroders, entailing the world's second and third largest equity and bond markets respectively."" 
But some fear Schroders is setting up too many platforms in China, potentially diluting its resources to run its local businesses. Schroeder already owns a mutual fund venture with BOCOM and operates a private fund business in the country.
""Why would they burn themselves with an additional platform?"" said Peter Alexander, founder of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.
""They have decided to put a lot on their plate. They're going to have to find a way to execute."" 
The new wealth management venture, based in Shanghai, will be 51% controlled by Schroder Investment Management Ltd, and 49% owned by BOCOM Wealth Management Co. 
It's the third wealth management venture in China. Amundi partnered with Bank of China, while BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd are setting up a similar venture with China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF). 
""We look forward to being able to support savers in China with innovative investment products ..."" said Lieven Debruyne, Schroders Global Head of Distribution. 
Alexander of Z-Ben Advisors said the foreign scramble to partner with Chinese banks did not necessarily ensure success in China. 
""There is this overwhelming desire, among foreign asset managers to gain some access to distribution,"" Alexander said.

But ""marketing is what really matters. And this is what's being overlooked by a very myopic, large group of global managers.""

""This is not just a climate issue but a fundamental investor issue - no different than capital allocation or management compensation,"" the firm said in the letter.
Engine No. 1 said Exxon needs board members with deep energy expertise and insights into evolving trends to put itself on a path to net zero emissions that is sustainable and profitable. The firm has already nominated four directors to the board. 
Exxon has gone from ""dismissing emissions reduction goals as a ‘beauty competition’ to claiming repeatedly this month that its emissions reductions plans are ‘consistent’ with the Paris Agreement,"" the investment firm said.

Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In recent weeks, Exxon has announced several changes, including the appointment of a new board member, setting a new goal to cut emissions and committing $3 billion over the next five years to carbon capture.
""The Company aims for industry-leading greenhouse gas performance across its businesses by 2030, and recently announced new emission reduction plans for 2025, which are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement,"" it said in its 2021 Energy & Carbon Summary.
Engine No. 1 wants Exxon to do more.

Questioned at a news conference about the tax burden on mining firms in Mexico, Lopez Obrador said there were Canadian companies that met all their fiscal obligations.
""However, this other company does not,"" Lopez Obrador said, describing the miner as operating in Tayoltita in the northern state of Durango, without disclosing its name.

Reuters reported this month that the government planned to seek 11 billion pesos ($534 million) from First Majestic in delinquent taxes.
First Majestic declined to comment on Lopez Obrador's remarks.
The company said previously it would pursue all legal options, including under international law, if it could not reach an agreement with tax authorities. 
Lopez Obrador said the company was attempting to use international tribunals to protect itself.

(Reuters) - A historically hefty advantage that the S&P 500 dividend yield has held over the benchmark U.S. Treasury note is on the verge of disappearing, a year after the collapse in interest rates set the stage for Wall Street's recovery from the pandemic sell-off. 
Investor concerns that measures to restore a U.S. economy hammered by the global pandemic could also spark inflation lifted the yield on the 10-year note as high as 1.394% overnight, the highest since February 2020. The yield was last at 1.365% late on Monday.
(GRAPHIC: 10-year Treasury yields close the gap with S&P 500 dividends - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpoezkwpd/Pasted%20image%201614020883177.png) 
That compares with the S&P 500's dividend yield of about 1.46%, according to Refinitiv's Datastream. That yield has gradually declined as the index hit record highs for the past several months, fueled by low interest rates that have made stocks more attractive.
""This is a return to the normal pattern of things, where dividend yields are less than the 10-year Treasury,"" said S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt.
Treasury yields have moved steadily higher in recent weeks as Democrats push a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package through Congress, spending that is viewed by many as necessary to boost the economy, but also seen as potentially stirring inflation as the country begins to recover. The Fed's ongoing loose monetary policy also has some investors worried about inflation. 
More gains in Treasury yields could put pressure on stocks with the highest valuations, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts wrote in a report on Sunday.
Treasury yields tumbled in February 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic shocked global financial markets and crippled much of the world's economy. Simultaneously, falling stock prices created a spike in the S&P 500 dividend yield, even as many companies suspended payouts to shareholders. 
The S&P 500 dividend yield in late March reached 2.76%, a historically large premium over the 10-year Treasury yield of 0.76% at that time, according to Datastream.

Since then, companies have largely resumed their dividends, with many even increasing their shareholder payouts. After total S&P 500 dividend payments dipped less than 1% last year to $483 billion, total dividends in 2021 are on track to rise by about 5%, Silverblatt said.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 04:26PM ET</span>","Nasdaq, S&P 500 end lower as U.S. yields rise; Disney lifts Dow","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Monday as climbing Treasury yields and prospects of rising inflation triggered valuation concerns, hitting shares of high-flying growth companies.
The Dow industrials ended higher, boosted by a surge in Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co shares.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were up at 1.37% on Monday. Since the beginning of February, 10-year yields have risen about 26 basis points, on track for their largest monthly gain in three years.
Still, some analysts noted that the stocks pullback was expected after a torrid rally this year and in 2020.
""This is a small pulback primarily because stocks got a little overheated and there are a few worries out there that people are making mountains of out molehills,"" said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist, at Reynolds Strategy.
He cited worries about the rise in Treasury yields, but noted that junk bond yields hit all-time lows last week, suggesting there has been a shift from the safety of Treasuries to the riskiness of corporates among investors.
""That's bullish for stocks,"" he added.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, and investors are expected to look for any potential changes to the central bank's dovish outlook.
""What investors are grappling with ... is what does this (higher Treasury yields) mean from an inflation perspective. Because of that, there's a little bit of tantrum in the market right now,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) resumed their slide from the previous week.
Largely upbeat fourth-quarter earnings had powered Wall Street's main indexes to record highs early last week, but the rally lost steam, in part due to fears of a potential snag in U.S. vaccination efforts and inflation concerns emanating from stimulus measures.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 29.08 points, or 0.09%, to 31,523.4, the S&P 500 lost 30.2 points, or 0.77%, to 3,876.51 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 341.42 points, or 2.46%, to 13,533.05. 
The S&P 500 declined for five straight sessions, its longest such streak in a year. 
Value stocks have outperformed growth shares in February, with investors betting on a rebound in industrial activity and a pickup in consumer demand as countries roll out vaccines to tame the pandemic.
The S&P 500 industrials and financial sector both rose, while energy stocks surged on higher oil prices. 
Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc jumped after the media company said it was expecting 12 million global paid streaming subscribers by the end of February, as coronavirus-led restrictions kept people at home.
Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) gained after a group of activist investors nominated nine directors to the department store chain's board.

Principal Financial Group Inc (NASDAQ:PFG) added after a media report that activist investor Elliott Management Corp had taken a stake in the life insurance company and planned to push for changes.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 04:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Discount retailer Dollar General takes steps to find possible CEO successor - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Discount chain  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG), one of the few U.S. retailers thriving during the COVID-19 pandemic, is taking steps to find a potential successor to Chief Executive Todd Vasos, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
While no decision has been made about Vasos stepping down, Dollar General has started conversations with headhunting firms and is considering candidates, the sources said.
Dollar General has been looking within its ranks and will assess the performance of its top executives against those at rival companies, the sources said. Dollar General Chief Operating Officer Jeff Owen is under consideration, one of the sources added.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. 
A Dollar General spokesman said Vasos had not communicated any plans to the company regarding a potential departure after his contract ends in June, noting it was ""merely good governance"" to plan for a transition. Vasos' contract renews automatically on an annual basis in June unless terminated or renegotiated.
""We have been speaking with management consulting firms related to executive development programs and as part of our succession planning process. We have not entered into a contract with any such firm to date,"" the spokesman said.
Vasos has expanded Dollar General's offerings to include more fresh produce and is wooing higher-income shoppers with new products in categories such as home decor, in a bid to stave off competition from large rivals such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Dollar General has also invested heavily in private label brands, developing lines for items ranging from cat food to shampoo. It has added more distribution centers to supply its stores with dairy products, deli meats and frozen entrees. It has more than 16,000 stores, often in areas underserved by other retailers.
Dollar General shares have risen 170% since Vasos became CEO in 2015, compared to a 115% rise in the S&P 500 General Merchandise Stores index over the same period.
The COVID-19 outbreak has boosted Dollar General's sales, as shoppers stay home more and buy more household necessities. Dollar General operates in small communities with few retailers. 
The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company has taken steps to protect its more than 157,000 workers during the pandemic, and announced last month that it would pay its hourly and salaried workers for receiving COVID-19 vaccines. 

It also said it would award $50 million in appreciation bonuses to its frontline workers in its fourth quarter, for a total of up to about $173 million for fiscal 2020.

Investing.com – The Dow closed just above the flatline Monday, after shedding its intraday losses supported by rising value stocks as expectations for further stimulus and the ongoing reduction in virus cases stoked optimism over the economic outlook.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, or 29 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.77%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 2.46%.
As the pace of Covid-19 cases slows and vaccine roll outs rise, and with another round of fiscal stimulus expected to be passed shortly, market participants continue to tout a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy.
Bank of America upped its GDP growth to 6.5% this year from 6.0% a year ago, and 5.0% in 2022 compared to 4.5% previously, citing strong first quarter economic data.
The $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, which will include the proposed $15 per hour wage proposal, is expected to be passed in the House of Representatives this week, but could face hurdles in the Senate.
Democrat Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia have already voiced opposition over the minimum wage proposal.
The stronger backdrop for the economy has placed value stocks like energy, financials and industrials on investor shopping lists.
Energy jumped more than 3% as oil prices continued to accelerate on bets for a faster-than-expected decline in inventories on lower refinery activity following recent weather-related disruptions across oil-rich Texas.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) hiked its price target on Brent crude oil to $70 in the second quarter and $75 in the third, from prior forecasts of $60 and $65, respectively, citing expectations for tight oil markets this summer.
""We now forecast that oil prices will rally sooner and higher, driven by lower expected inventories and higher marginal costs -- at least in the short run -- to restart upstream activity,"" Goldman said in a note.
Financials, meanwhile, were pushed higher by rising bank stocks as government bond yields continue to rise on expectations for a faster recovery and a pick-up in inflation.
Some market participants remain wary of the further reaction, though continue to tout further upside as the broader secular remains intact.
""While we remain on alert for short-term corrections ahead, remember that the U.S. cycle is still in 'reflationary expansion' mode- which implies that pullbacks / corrections occur within the context of a broader secular bull market,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note.
Gains in industrials, meanwhile, were kept in check by a fall in Boeing (NYSE:BA) after the aircraft maker recommended all of its 777 be grounded following a malfunctioning engine on a 777 jet over the weekend.
Technology struggled to turn positive as investors continue to hit pause on growth stocks, with the Fab 5 stocks in sector ending the day in the red.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB),and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed in negative territory.
In other news, Cinema stocks were in favor after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that movie theaters in the city will be allowed to reopen with reduced capacity on Mar. 5. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was up nearly 15%, and  Imax Corp  (NYSE:IMAX) (F:IMX) rose 6%."

(Reuters) - Drugmakers should test any COVID-19 vaccines that have been retooled to combat new variants of the coronavirus in clinical trials designed to track the immune response of hundreds of test subjects, which could take months, U.S. regulators said on Monday. 
Vaccine developers may need to modify their shots to provide protection against new variants of the coronavirus that turn up in the United States should they fail to elicit immune response in their current form, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.
The FDA said it believes currently authorized vaccines from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) with partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc are effective against variants currently circulating in the United States. 
Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said drugmakers should not wait until a mutated virus is demonstrated to be able to escape the vaccines to begin developing new versions.
""We need to anticipate this and work on it, so that we have something in our back pocket before the threshold is upon us,"" she said at a news conference.
The emergence of new, more contagious variants has prompted the U.S. government to step up efforts to track coronavirus mutations and try to keep vaccines and treatments effective against any new variants. 
Pfizer and Moderna have both said they plan to run clinical trials of versions of their vaccine that have been redesigned to combat the highly contagious COVID-19 variant that has become prevalent South Africa and has turned up in several U.S. States.
The FDA made the comments as part of a newly updated guidance for companies making vaccines, tests and therapeutics for COVID-19. As part of its updated guidance, the FDA recommended that vaccine makers test any modified vaccines in both previously unvaccinated people and vaccinated people. The manufacturers should compare the immune response of a modified vaccine against both the new variant as well as the original virus. The FDA also recommended monitoring test subjects' safety for at least seven days, to support emergency use authorization for modified vaccines. The agency is trying to allow drugmakers to make the change with a minimal amount of extra data needed, said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.  Still, the type of trial the agency wants, ""might take a few months, whether it be two or three,"" Marks said. ""I can't say exactly how long but again, that type of the scale of the amount of time.""  
""We want to be ready so that we can move it into production, when it's ready and when it's needed,"" he said.

The two companies have been at loggerheads since August, when the game maker tried to avoid Apple's 30% fee on the App Store by launching its own in-app payment system, which led to Apple's subsequent ban of Fortnite from its store.
The UK tribunal said Epic's suit against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google could move forward, but deemed that the United States would be a better forum for its case against Apple.
""Epic will reconsider pursuing its case against Apple in the UK after the resolution of the U.S. case,"" the video game company said in a statement in response to the tribunal's ruling. 
Apple and Google did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
In October, a federal judge in California ruled in an injunction request that Apple could bar the Fortnite game from its App Store but must not harm Epic's developer tools business, which includes the ""Unreal Engine"" software used by hundreds of other video games.

Epic Games founder and Chief Executive Tim Sweeney had previously said Apple's control of its platform had tilted the level playing field.

Codelco vice president of sales Carlos Alvarado said the growing expectations would likely also spur goods and service providers to hike prices, leading to higher overall costs for the state-run miner. 

The executive said it was still ""too early"" to know if the spike in the global copper price represented a new ""super-cycle,"" similar to that seen in the early 2000s following a tectonic demand boost from industrialization and urbanization in emerging nations.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian financial markets went into a tailspin on Monday, as investors dumped the country's currency and stocks, while pushing up interest rates, after President Jair Bolsonaro moved late on Friday to sack the head of state-run oil firm Petrobras following weeks of clashes over fuel price hikes.
The right-wing populist's intervention in one of Brazil's most valuable companies, along with a vow to reduce prices in the power sector too, cast growing concern on the government's commitment to free markets. 
Several brokerages downgraded Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) cut Brazilian stocks to 'marketweight' in its Latin American portfolio, excluding Petrobras and state power company Eletrobras entirely.
""Today is a pretty ugly day,"" said a hedge fund trader in Sao Paulo. ""The big concern now is if Bolsonaro's decisions are going to be limited to public companies, or if he is going to spend more without reforms.""
Petrobras preferred shares and common shares both plunged around 20% on Monday, wiping more than 60 billion reais ($11 billion) off the company's value. Its market capitalization fell some 28 billion reais on Friday.
The Bovespa index fell over 5% in early trading before paring losses, with preferred shares in Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, as Eletrobras is formally known, down almost 8% at one point.
The real fell as much as 2.5% to a 3-1/2-month low of 5.53 per dollar, bringing its losses against the dollar so far this year to 6% before recovering slightly. 
The real is one of the worst-performing currencies against the dollar so far this year, according to Refinitiv data on 152 currencies.
Interest rate futures also surged on Monday. The January 2022 contract jumped almost 20 basis points to 3.61%, a level not seen since May last year. 
Brazil's credit default swaps (CDS), effectively the cost of insuring against sovereign default, jumped 22 basis points to 185 bps, the highest in over three months.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) removed its 'like' recommendation on Brazil sovereign bonds, citing fiscal concerns and potential spillovers from Bolsonaro's action.
Bolsonaro defended his decision to replace Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco with a retired army general with no oil and gas experience, insisting on Monday that recent fuel price hikes were hurting the Brazilian people. 
""It is my right to renew (his tenure) or not. It will not be renewed. What's the problem? Some people in financial markets are very happy with a policy that only ... serves the interests of certain groups in Brazil,"" he told supporters outside the presidential palace.
Over the weekend, Bolsonaro cast rising energy prices as an attack on him and vowed to reverse the trend.
He said on Monday there was room to cut fuel prices 10% by reducing taxes and profits for fuel distributors.
A survey of institutional investors by online brokerage XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investimentos released over the weekend showed that 57% of investors now think the government's formal spending cap will be broken this year, up from 32% last month.

A growing number of investors also think Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, a committed free-marketeer, will not last in his post beyond June.

The post on the CVM website gave no details about the investigation, but comes after Petrobras shares plunged more than 20% on Monday following Bolsonaro's announcement. 

Under Brazilian securities law, listed companies must communicate important information via securities filings, which did not happen when the president decided to replace Petrobras CEO. He mentioned that in interviews and the nomination of a replacement to current CEO Roberto Castello Branco in this case. Executive changes must be approved by the board of directors, which did not happen here either.

(Reuters) - The mother of an 11-year-old boy who died after they lost electricity and heat in their Texas mobile home during last week's freeze has filed a $100 million lawsuit against two power companies for gross negligence.
Maria Pineda said the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and  Entergy Corp  (NYSE:ETR) are responsible for the death of her son Cristian, who was found unresponsive on the morning of Feb. 16 at home, where he shared a bed with his 3-year-old brother.
More than 4 million people in Texas lost power and at least two dozen people died after a snowstorm blanketed the state last week and sent temperatures plunging well below freezing.
The complaint filed on Saturday accused the defendants of ignoring a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recommendation following a 2011 freeze to ""winterize"" the power grid, and were caught ""wholly unprepared"" when the grid failed last week.
Cristian froze to death ""because grid wasn't a priority, and the energy provider made decisions based on profits,"" said the complaint filed in the Jefferson County District Court.
The family lives in Conroe, Texas, a Houston suburb.
ERCOT, a cooperative responsible for about 90% of Texas' electricity, did not immediately respond on Monday to a request for comment.
Entergy declined to discuss the lawsuit, but a spokesman said: ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of life in our community.""
Pineda's lawyer Tony Buzbee told ABC News he represents seven families who suffered deaths in the storm's aftermath, and more lawsuits against power companies are planned. An autopsy on Cristian is being performed, ABC News said.
ERCOT began rolling blackouts on Feb. 15, saying they were needed to avert a cascading, statewide outage.
President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Texas on Saturday.

Texas has an unusual, deregulated energy market that lets it avoid federal regulation but limits its ability to draw emergency power from other grids.

Investing.com --  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) shares jumped 11% on Monday after the company said bookings are up as vaccines roll out and Americans begin looking to the seas for vacation once more.
Future bookings are coming in with similar volumes and higher prices than the time before the pandemic began last year, putting a halt to sailings.
Royal Caribbean also reported a narrower-than-expected fourth quarter loss of $1.37 billion, or $6.09 a share, after net income of $273.1 million, or $1.30 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding nonrecurring items, the loss of $5.02 a share beat expectations for a loss of $5.20 a share.
Revenue dropped 98.6%, to $34 million. The company affirmed its guidance for  an average monthly cash burn of $250 million to $290 million while operations continue to be suspended. "

The government published the so-called fiscal stimulus figure in its official gazette on Friday afternoon.
Last week, a senior Mexican official told Reuters that a package worth about $5 billion was being prepared for Pemex, comprising a tax break worth roughly 75 billion pesos and a capital boost of some $1.3-1.6 billion.
A senior official said on Monday the stimulus was the tax break, and would be applied gradually from February onward.
The new stimulus comes in addition to a gradual reduction to the tax burden shouldered by Pemex, which has financial debts of some $110 billion, and whose financial rescue is one of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's top priorities.
The government said the fiscal support was needed to help lift oil output and offset negative economic conditions stemming from events linked to the global public health emergency.

Neither Pemex nor the finance ministry responded to requests for comment on the stimulus announcement on Monday.

The right-wing populist's intervention in one of Brazil's most valuable companies, along with a vow to reduce prices in the power sector, sent Petrobras' share price and bonds into a tailspin on Monday.
Morgan Stanley said its previous upbeat recommendation on Brazil's sovereign debt had been contingent upon the government addressing fiscal concerns through reforms.
""The changes at Petrobras are worrying in this respect, as they show that the tolerance for unpopular policies is low, perhaps driven by election considerations,"" the bank's analysts said.

""Additionally, investor exposure through Petrobras is very high at a time when the spread versus sovereign is near record tights, leaving little reason for investors to hold onto bonds in case the direction of the company changes.""

In response to a story by the Financial Times, IG said it would be withdrawing less than 8% of the 12,000 leveraged equities products it offers. 
Leveraged products allow traders to increase their exposure to the market with a relatively small capital investment.
Big bets by individual investors, particularly in the shares of U.S. retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), have triggered massive price swings in some stocks around the world, leading some people to make hefty profits but leaving others facing large losses. 
Along with rivals CMC and Plus500 (LON:PLUSP), IG had a rough couple of years before the COVID-19 pandemic as tighter regulations on certain leveraged products - including so-called contracts for difference - hit profits. 
But the global health crisis drove a sharp rise in business, as more people in lockdown started to trade. IG last month announced a $1 billion deal to buy U.S. rival tastytrade after a strong 2020.
IG also said on Monday it had reached its limit for the amount of cryptocurrency it holds as a business and that it was no longer accepting new cryptocurrency buy orders from clients.
A recent rally in bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has been fuelled by signs it is gaining acceptance among mainstream companies, from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) to BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK).
Last month, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority warned investing in cryptoassets generally involved taking very high risks and consumers should be prepared to lose all their money if they do invest in them.
The Financial Times reported earlier that IG had withdrawn certain types of trading in companies including insurer Hiscox, malls operator Hammerson and clothing brand Superdry. 
""These equities represent a very small part of our overall offering and clients will still be able to trade these equities through our share dealing offering. We have been in contact with clients who hold relevant positions,"" the company said. 

""IG has experienced a sustained period of exceptional demand for the products we provide. This has been reflected across the market,"" it added.

417,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 11:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: From gum to gummies, Beau Wrigley takes pot producer Parallel public","By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - Billionaire William ""Beau"" Wrigley Jr is taking cannabis producer Parallel public, in a merger due to complete this summer with Canadian-listed Ceres Acquisition Corp that values the Atlanta, Georgia-based firm at $1.88 billion.
Parallel, the first firm Wrigley Jr has led since selling his family's chewing gum business for $23 billion in 2008, will take on Ceres' listing on the NEO exchange as expectations of an easing of U.S. rules on the pot sector draws investment.
Shares of Ceres surged 19% to $12.50 as the deal comes at a time when officially-sanctioned sales of cannabis have surged to record levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The combined company expects to have $430 million cash when the deal closes, a spokeswoman for Parallel confirmed to Reuters.
With around 50 retail stores, cultivation and manufacturing sites in four U.S. states, Parallel will use the money to expand into new markets. It sells finished products including gummies, vapes and balms, but not chewing gum.
The company, which also named record industry executive Scooter Braun as a special adviser, said it currently has license applications pending in Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia.
U.S. firms that grow or sell cannabis cannot list their shares on the country's major stock exchanges as marijuana remains illegal at the federal level.
Jay-Z backed Californian pot producer TPCO Holdings also went public on NEO, while cannabis review site Weedmaps' parent struck a deal in December to list on Nasdaq.
Parallel's spokeswoman said it has also received commitments from a group of investors for a $225 million private investment in a public equity (PIPE) transaction when the deal closes.
The PIPE investment was over-subscribed, with a large chunk of the raise set to come from existing Parallel and Ceres investors, the spokeswoman said.
Parallel is already profitable, and expects to be cash flow positive this year, the company said on a call following the merger announcement.
Besides decriminalization in the selling of weed products, Wrigley feels one of the most significant changes could be the loosening of constraints around banking.
""That will frankly make life easier for companies like ours to navigate some of those territories and do so in a much more cost effective fashion,"" Wrigley, who will remain the combined company's chief executive officer, told Reuters.
U.S. laws have prevented interstate movement of pot products and has deterred banks and other financial institutions.
But dealmaking and fundraising in the industry remains hot as expectations grow that President Joe Biden's administration will relax federal prohibitions.
Graphic: Pot producers raising record money - https://graphics.reuters.com/CANNABIS-STOCKS/FUNDRAISING/xklvyozegvg/chart.png
Joe Crouthers, chief executive of Ceres, a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC), said the cannabis market has a lot of positive momentum, and some room is still left for growth.
""You're starting to see not only the companies deliver, but the governments deliver on some of those conversations and promises,"" said Crouthers, who will join Parallel's board.

SPACs have become a popular route to the stock market as they can be completed more quickly than an IPO and grant greater certainty over the funds a company will raise.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 10:02AM ET</span>","Goodyear to buy Cooper Tire for $2.8 billion, nearly doubling China presence","By Shreyasee Raj and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co said it would buy Cooper Tire & Rubber Co in a $2.8 billion deal to beef up its portfolio in the high-margin light truck and SUV segments and strengthen its presence in North America and China.
Shares of Cooper, which has historically had stronger margins than Goodyear, jumped 20% in morning trade while Goodyear stock was up 3.4%.
The deal, announced on Monday, nearly doubles Goodyear's presence in China and broadens distribution for Cooper replacement tires through Goodyear's network of 2,500 retail stores in the country. U.S. and China, the two largest tire markets in the world, account for about one-third of global industry volume.
The combined company will also benefit from Goodyear's original equipment and Cooper's strength in the rapidly growing light truck and SUV product segments.
The global tire industry was hard hit in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp decline in demand for replacement tires and original equipment, forcing automakers to halt production.
However, industry experts expect a rebound in auto demand this year, fueled by the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, record low interest rates and healthy consumer savings as people held off spending money on large purchases during the pandemic. 
Under the terms of the deal, the implied cash and stock consideration for Cooper shareholders is $54.36 per share, representing a premium of 24% to its closing price on February 19.
Goodyear expects about $165 million in run-rate cost synergies within two years after the deal closes. Goodyear shareholders will own about 84% of the combined company while Cooper shareholders will own about 16%.
Goodyear intends to fund the cash portion of the deal, expected to close in the second half of 2021, through debt financing. The combined company will be headquartered in Akron, Ohio.
Separately, Cooper reported a nearly 3% fall in quarterly revenue, while net income attributable to the company fell 25.8% to $37.99 million the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.

Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) is serving as lead financial advisor for Goodyear while Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) LLC is advising Cooper.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened Monday sharply lower amid fears that the massive stimulus package making its way through Congress will lead to higher inflation, leading to higher borrowing costs and higher input costs for companies.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 166 points, or 0.5%, at 31,428 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.3%.
The moves were triggered by a sharp move higher in Treasury bond yields, which hit their highest level in a year over the weekend. Yields on 10-year notes came off their overnight high of 1.40% to trade at 1.35% by 9:35 AM ET, but are still up some 25 basis points over the last three weeks. Many tech companies, whose value lies mainly in their projected income streams far into the future, are particularly sensitive to interest rate movements because their future cash flows have to be offset by a higher discount rate.
Bonds are being weighed upon by the prospect of a sharp increase in Treasury issuance to fund the $1.9 trillion stimulus package crafted by the administration of President Joe Biden. The package is likely to be voted on by the House of Representatives as early as Friday, making a vote in the Senate possible next week.
Risk appetite has been bolstered by upward revisions to U.S. growth forecasts this year as a result of the mix of loose fiscal and monetary policy. Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said earlier he saw upside risks to a base case forecast of 5% growth this year. Kaplan told a conference that Americans will “gradually” increase their engagement with the economy in the first half, accelerating it in the second half as more and more of the population is inoculated against Covid-19.
Among notable gainers was the Special Purpose Acquisition Company Churchill Capital IV, which rose 12.6% on reports that it is soon to merge with electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors. The deal has been rumored for some weeks now, during which time investors have piled into Churchill in the hope of getting relatively cheap exposure fo the luxury carmaker. There are still no details as to how the respective firms would be valued in any such deal.  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, for which Lucid would provide competition, fell 3.1%, while Nio (NYSE:NIO) ADRs fell by a similar amount.
Elsewhere, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rose 11.3% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock rose 8.3% in an echo of the violent short squeeze that happened earlier in the month. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock also rose 4.5%.
Among the biggest losers were ADRs in Brazilian oil and gas company PetroBras (NYSE:PBR), which fell over 20% after President Jair Bolsonaro fired its chief executive in a dispute over domestic diesel prices. Reuters reported that the whole of the company's management board is considering stepping down en masse in protest at what would be a big swing back towards state intervention in the economy, with worrying echoes of how similar policies destroyed the economy of neighboring Venezuela. Brazilian iron ore giant Vale (NYSE:VALE) also suffered by association, losing over 5% despite a fresh surge in iron ore prices. Base metals from copper to zince have all hit multi-year highs over the weekend, again lifting the prices of mining companies such as Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX).

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - South African digital bank Tyme has raised $110 million in private capital and linked up with JG Summit, one of the biggest conglomerates in the Philippines, to apply for a local digital bank licence, a top Tyme executive told Reuters.
Tyme, majority-owned by South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe, will use most of the money, mainly from private equity fund Apis Partners, to expand TymeBank in South Africa, Coen Jonker, co-founder and executive chairman of Tyme said.
The proceeds will also finance the Philippine venture, said Jonker, a former senior executive of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY). JG Summit also participated in the Tyme funding.
""We believe that the future of digital banking in emerging markets is multi-country, to actually build a banking group where there is enough critical mass of customers,"" Jonker said in an interview on Monday.
Across Asia, regulators are opening up banking to digital players, encouraged by a boom in mobile connectivity and the prospect of tech firms offering low-cost financing services. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for digital transactions.
In the Philippines, the central bank last November approved rules allowing the creation and licensing of digital banks. Last December, Singapore gave out four digital banking licences..
""For us, Philippines represents the best fit in terms of our business and operating model to expand, and JG Summit the best partner in terms of the retail capacity that they have and their loyalty programmes,"" said Jonker.
In South Africa, TymeBank customers can set up accounts and get a debit card at more than 700 automated kiosks in Boxer supermarkets, owned by one of the country's largest chains Pick n Pay, where account holders can benefit from the stores' rewards programme. This is in addition to the mobile app.
TymeBank has already attracted 2.8 million customers in South Africa since its launch two years ago.
Tyme is now looking to replicate part of that strategy in the Philippines, where it can piggyback on JG Summit's retail reach in shopping malls, grocery and pharmacy stores. JG Summit's other interests include food manufacturing, real estate and hotels.
This month, Jonker relocated from Hong Kong to Singapore where Tyme is setting up its global business strategy team.
After the new funding, the stake of Motsepe's investment vehicle African Rainbow Capital will reduce slightly in Tyme but it will remain the biggest investor.
Jonker said Tyme was also looking to apply for a digital banking licence in Malaysia, where the regulator has issued a policy framework for online-only banks and plans to issue up to five licences.

""We are in the final stages of closing in on an exclusive partnership with a consortium,"" said Coen.

Cruise operators have been shoring up cash reserves by issuing new shares, selling assets or raising billions of dollars in debt over the last few months as the COVID-19 pandemic brought the industry to a virtual standstill.
With its ships not sailing, Royal Caribbean's total revenue for the quarter plunged to $34.1 million from $2.52 billion last year. Analysts had expected a revenue of $35.6 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
However, the company said bookings for the first half of 2022 were within historical ranges and at higher prices, underlining a strong demand for cruises.
Royal Caribbean, which posted a rare negative revenue last quarter, said it expected to incur a net loss for its first quarter and the 2021 fiscal year.
Several analysts expect Royal Caribbean and its peers Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd to resume voyages gradually in the back half of this year, as governments in the United States and other major markets vaccinate thousands of people.
As of December end, Royal Caribbean had about $4.4 billion in liquidity, up from about $3.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, after it raised $1 billion in a stock offering during the fourth quarter.
The operator of ""Oasis of the Seas"" and ""Symphony of the Seas"" cruises posted a net attributable loss of $1.37 billion, or $6.09 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $273.1 million, or $1.30 per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, the company lost $5.02 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of a loss of $5.20.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: Mortgage vendor IPO woes reflect U.S. housing market peak,"By David French and Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Investors fueling an initial public offering bonanza are snubbing many U.S. mortgage providers' stock market debuts over concerns that the sector might have reached its peak.
Five mortgage vendors have scaled back or canceled plans to go public in the last four months, as investors flinched at their frothy valuations. This may bode poorly for IPOs by other home loan providers such as Better.com and NewRez.
Many lenders have never had it so good, as affluent professionals fleeing big cities during the COVID-19 pandemic take out large loans to buy homes in the suburbs, and as near-record low interest rates fuel refinancings.
Yet investors and analysts say IPO hopefuls in the sector have not priced in an expected housing market slowdown in 2021. 
""Investors don't like buying into a company at the start of a down cycle, and mortgage originations are an extremely cyclical business,"" said Matthew Kennedy, a senior strategist at IPO-focused research firm Renaissance Capital.
LoanDepot Inc was forced to cut its IPO by 75% to $54 million this month, after investors balked at its request to be valued as highly as $6.8 billion. Home Point Capital Inc downsized its IPO by 40% at the end of January to $94 million, giving up hopes of an up-to-$2.9 billion valuation.
This is despite 62% of U.S. operating companies that went public in January having upsized their offerings on strong investor demand, according to data compiled by IPO expert Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida.
Two other mortgage vendors, AmeriHome and Caliber Home Loans, pulled their IPOs in October. AmeriHome's owner, private equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), clinched a deal last week to sell the company to regional bank Western Alliance (NYSE:WAL) Bancorp at a 23% discount to the $1.3 billion valuation it was seeking in the IPO.
The investor pushback reflects concerns about the industry outlook, as mortgage rates gradually creep up with the economic recovery, and home price inflation begins to weigh on purchases. The Mortgage Bankers Association is forecasting a 49% decline in the number of refinancings in 2021.
Other warning signs have emerged. Shares in Rocket Companies Inc, parent of America's largest mortgage lender Quicken Loans, trade barely above the level at which the company priced its IPO in August, which was downsized by a third on poor demand.
Guild Holdings Co, which listed in October after shrinking its IPO by 24%, has reported net income for the first nine months of 2020 of $293 million, reversing a loss of $39 million in the year-ago period. Yet its shares are up 10% since the IPO, underperforming a 13% rise in the S&P 500 Index . 
""Investors are saying these are earnings that are unlikely to be growing and we are not willing to give the (mortgage) company a valuation at a high price-to-earnings ratio,"" Ritter said.
IPO PIPELINE
Some big industry players are still hoping to tap the IPO market in the coming weeks. Online lender Better.com, backed by banks including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) and investors such as Activant Capital and 9 Yards Capital, has been working with bookrunners to launch an IPO in the first half of this year, according to people familiar with the matter.
A spokeswoman for Better.com declined to comment.
NewRez, a mortgage lender and servicer, said in November it had filed confidentially for an IPO. Its owner, real estate investment firm New Residential Investment Corp, has recently expressed apprehension about its listing prospects.

""It is on the table. It is just one of those things that we just want to make sure before we do it, that it is going to be something that is worth it for our shareholders,"" New Residential Chairman Michael Nierenberg said on the company's quarterly earnings call this month.

430,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 07:01AM ET</span>",Nasdaq Futures Down 165 Pts; Rising Bond Yields Weigh,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, with the high-profile tech sector in focus amid concerns over rising bond yields and inflationary pressures.  
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 170 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 27 points, or 0.7%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 165 points, or 1.2%. 
The House of Representatives plans to vote as soon as Friday on President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, meaning the Senate could vote on it as soon as next week.
The potential for this bill has been boosting Wall Street for a number of weeks, but investors are starting to grow concerned that this additional liquidity, coupled with a very easy policy stance from the Federal Reserve, will result in a rapid rise in inflation.
This has been reflected in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rising 16 basis points last week to 1.36%, its highest level in a year. These rising yields could hurt high-growth companies reliant on easy borrowing while diminishing the relative appeal of stocks. 
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite closed with losses of 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively, last week, ending a two-week winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just 0.1% over the same period.
This all puts the focus onto Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ahead of his two-day testimony to Congress, starting Tuesday, on the economic outlook and the central bank’s monetary policy stance.
“His challenge will be to express confidence in the recovery, but not too much confidence such that the bond market slide turns into a collapse,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The corporate earnings season is nearing the end, but this week sees a number of retailers reporting results, including Macy’s (NYSE:M),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and TJX (NYSE:TJX). As far as Monday is concerned, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and DISH (NASDAQ:DISH) are among the highlights.
Oil prices climbed Monday as U.S. production returned only slowly from last week’s severe cold snap, further tightening a global market where inventories have fallen sharply in recent weeks.
It will likely take several more days for oilfield crews to get production fully up again after the cold snap in Texas, the largest crude producing U.S. state, and the surrounding region forced the shut down of an estimated 4 million barrels per day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $59.78 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $62.87.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1% to $1,795.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2134.

431,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 06:54AM ET</span>",Strategists Pick Commodities as a Favorite Way to Play Reflation,"(Bloomberg) -- As the reflation theme dominates markets, investment strategists are picking commodities as some of their favorite trades.
Even though it seems premature to worry about inflation, investors who are looking for hedges against a hot economy should consider scooping up commodity indexes, oil and energy equities, according to John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
At  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Andrew Sheets listed shorting gold against copper as one of his top trades. Evercore ISI says cyclicals, like industrials, energy and materials, are the way to trade expectations for faster growth.
Across Wall Street, strategists are thumbing through their playbooks for ways to position for a sharp recovery out of the pandemic, especially as the Federal Reserve appears ready to let the economy run hot. As goverments make fast progress in vaccinating their populations, the debate among investors has quickly shifted to inflation and how price pressures could ripple through markets.
Here’s what strategists are saying about the reflation trade:
Safe Is Risky?
“Instead of ‘looking up’ for the biggest beneficiaries as growth improves, the more pressing issue for the market may be ‘looking out’ to havens that have so far ignored the improving economic story,” Morgan Stanley’s Sheets wrote Sunday.
Top cross-asset trades include: short gold versus copper, being underweight duration, long the Canadian dollar versus the Swiss franc and the Chinese yuan versus the Japanese yen, and bets on a steepening of the U.S. real yield curve.
Commodity Hedges
The lessons of history, current valuations and carry suggest that the best hedges for a “too-hot economy” are a commodity index, oil, agriculture, energy equities and emerging-market commodity FX, according to John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
The worst are base metals, gold and G-10 commodity FX, while the “in-betweens” are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and mining equities.
Dollar Tailwind
“While not our base case, a rapid and significant rise in U.S. real yields” may add to tailwinds for the U.S. dollar,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc strategists led by Ashish Agrawal said in a note Sunday.
Agrawal said the company’s U.S., strategists think a potentially sizable infrastructure plan from President Joe Biden’s administration is beginning to push real yields higher.
Market Duel
“For the start of this week, it’s a fight between rising commodity prices and rising bond yields,” said Kit Juckes, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA. “And the danger is bond yields win.”
The dollar is likely to weaken in due course on a global economic recovery with the Fed set to stay on hold for a long time, he said. The rise in bond yields “is probably going to overshoot on the upside at some point just because we are going to find inflation data that come behind that aren’t that alarming,” he said.
Taper Tantrum
“Cyclicals are best positioned to benefit from the normalization of economic activity,” said Dennis DeBusschere, a strategist at Evercore ISI. “Another taper tantrum would weigh on the absolute level of risk assets, but should also benefit cyclicals, especially those most levered to increasing global growth like industrials, energy and materials.”

432,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 06:27AM ET</span>","World shares sink as bond yields, commodities surge","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares sank on Monday as expectations for faster economic growth and inflation battered bonds and boosted commodities, while rising real yields made equity valuations look more stretched in comparison.
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks shares across 49 countries, was down 0.4% after the start of European trade.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 1%, at its lowest in 10 days. Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40 and Spain's IBEX 35 index fell 1% each, Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.85% and Italy's FTSE MIB index fell 0.9%. 
S&P 500 futures fell to their lowest since Feb. 4, down 1% on the day. 
Bonds have been bruised by the prospect of a stronger economic recovery and greater borrowing as President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package progresses.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivers his semi-annual testimony before Congress this week and is likely to reiterate a commitment to keeping policy super easy for as long as needed to drive inflation higher. 
""The coming week is relatively thin on the international data agenda, but after the recent rise in long bond yields, Fed Chairman Powell's hearings in both chambers of Congress (Tuesday / Wednesday) will be attracting great interest,"" said Elisabet Kopelman, U.S. economist at SEB.
""The fact that the most recent rise in long bond yields has been driven by higher real interest rates and not just inflation expectations increases the probability of a dovish message.""
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is also expected to sound dovish in a speech later Monday.
Yields on 10-year Treasury notes have already reached 1.38%, breaking the psychological 1.30% level and bringing the rise for the year so far to a steep 43 basis points.
Analysts at BofA noted 30-year bonds had returned -9.4% in the year to date, the worst start since 2013.
""Real assets are outperforming financial assets big in '21 as cyclical, political, secular trends say higher inflation,"" the analysts said in a note. ""Surging commodities, energy laggards in vogue, materials in secular breakouts.""
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan went flat, after slipping from a record top last week as the jump in U.S. bond yields unsettled investors.
Japan's Nikkei recouped 0.8% and South Korea 0.1%, but Chinese blue chips lost 1.4%.
A COPPER-PLATED RECOVERY
One of the stars has been copper, a key component of renewable technology, which shot up 7.7% last week to a nine-year peak. The broader LMEX base metal index climbed 5.5% on the week.
Oil prices have gone along for the ride, aided by tightening supplies and freezing weather, giving Brent gains of 22% for the year so far. [O/R]
On Monday, Brent crude futures were up 0.7% at $63.33 a barrel. U.S. crude added 0.7% to $59.65.
All of that has been a boon for commodity-linked currencies, with the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars all higher for the year so far.
Sterling reached a three-year top at $1.4050, aided by one of the fastest vaccine rollouts in the world. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to outline a path from COVID-19 lockdowns on Monday.
The U.S. dollar index has been relatively range-bound, with downward pressure from the country's expanding twin deficits balanced by higher bond yields. The index was last at 90.342, not far from where it started the year at 90.260. 
Rising Treasury yields has helped the dollar gain against the yen to 105.60, given the Bank of Japan is actively restraining yields at home.
The euro was steady at $1.2104, corralled between support at $1.2021 and resistance around $1.2169.
One commodity not doing so well is gold, partly due to rising bond yields and partly as investors question if crypto currencies might be a better hedge against inflation. 

Gold stood at $1,793 an ounce, having started the year at $1,896. Bitcoin was off 3.3% on Monday at $55,535, but started the year at $32,216.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 06:24AM ET</span>","Analysis: For Black founders, venture funding remains elusive despite new funds","By April Joyner and Arriana McLymore
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Donnel Baird first pitched his idea in 2014 to create a technology platform that could help small apartment buildings and other urban structures become energy efficient, he got the U.S. government to promise him $2.1 million, provided he could raise a similar amount from elsewhere. 
But not one of some 200 venture capital firms he approached agreed to invest back then.
Baird believes that initial funding was elusive in part because as a Black man without a background in software development, he was an outsider. Investors did not grasp the opportunity that seemed obvious to him as someone who had grown up in a predominantly Black, low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn, Baird told Reuters.
""That's one of the hardest things about being Black. It is really hard to tease out why things happen. All I know is that the VCs decided I could not pull off what I was talking about,"" Baird said in an interview. ""Silicon Valley has a narrow archetype of what they like to invest in.""
Some seven years later, the 39-year-old has become the recipient of one of the largest early-stage funding rounds ever raised by a Black entrepreneur. His company, BlocPower, has raised $63 million in debt and equity, with the help of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and other investors. The bulk of the money will go toward financing energy-efficient heating and cooling systems for BlocPower's clients.
The financing is both a sign that corporate America's growing acknowledgment of its diversity problem is beginning to lead to some change, and a stark reminder that the pace of change is slow. Interviews with Black entrepreneurs and investors as well as a Reuters analysis of venture capital data provided by Crunchbase, a business information company, show Baird is an outlier. 
The share of U.S. venture capital going to Black-founded companies stood at just over 3% of the $147.6 billion of 2020's overall deal volume, the data shows. In the past six years, that percentage has not budged above 5%, even though about 10% of U.S. companies are Black-owned, according to U.S. Census data.
For Black founders, consistent support has come from only a handful of venture capital firms, and many of them are relatively small.
""One of the challenges for Black entrepreneurs is that you have a good idea, you're ahead of the curve, and you have the skills to execute it, but because they haven't seen a Black person do it, they wait for another person to do it,"" said Jon Gosier, a Black entrepreneur who said he had to sell one of his more successful ventures a few years ago because he could not find investors.
FEW BACKERS
Venture capital firms, which typically provide funding in exchange for an equity stake, finance only a tiny sliver of U.S. businesses. But their backing can make a huge difference to an entrepreneur's success. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and many other corporate titans today have benefited from such early backers.
Past founders and employees of such companies have in turn gone on to back other successful ventures. Black entrepreneurs have largely been unable to generate such wealth. The value of equity that Black founders hold in their companies, on average, is about a quarter the value of their white counterparts, a McKinsey & Company study shows.
""So often, people who have worked at those sorts of companies who have found financial success can go back to the folks in their community,"" said Deldelp Medina, executive director of Black & Brown Founders, a nonprofit organization supporting Black and Latino entrepreneurs. ""We haven't been able to build that out."" 
For Black founders, consistent support has come from only a handful of venture capital firms, according to Crunchbase data. Only 16 firms out of hundreds of venture capital firms participated in 10 or more early-stage funding rounds for Black-founded or Black-led companies between 2015 and 2020, the data shows. The list includes large accelerators such as Techstars and Y Combinator, the famed program that funded Airbnb Inc and DoorDash Inc.
Among the 10 most frequent backers of Black founders in that period, three were founded by African Americans: Backstage Capital, Precursor Ventures and MaC Venture Capital. Another firm in the top 10, Kapor Capital, focuses on companies that close ""access gaps,"" especially in Black and Latino communities. Kapor Capital and MaC Venture Capital have both invested in BlocPower.
DIVERSITY PUSH 
Backstage, Precursor and MaC have less than $200 million in assets under management combined, Pitchbook data show. In contrast, the top 20 U.S. venture capital firms each managed tens of billions of dollars or more.
""We can only meet a tiny portion of the demand,"" said Charles Hudson (NYSE:HUD), managing partner and founder of Precursor Ventures, referring to Black-founded venture firms such as his. ""The biggest of us are not very big in the grand scheme of things.""
The lack of venture capital financing forces entrepreneurs to seek out alternatives, which can be limiting when they need to go back for more money, entrepreneurs and investors said. 
""When you have an investor base that's made up of individuals and angel investors and maybe accelerators and less institutional capital, it's a lot harder to go back to those previous investors and ask them to help you out through a potential downturn,"" said Monique Woodard, founder and managing partner of early-stage investor Cake Ventures.
Larger venture firms are under pressure to make greater efforts toward diversity, but the attempts are fledgling. Andreessen Horowitz's Talent x Opportunity Fund, launched in June, for example, drew criticism for its relatively small initial funding of $2.2 million. The firm, a previous investor in BlocPower, has since announced investments in seven companies through the fund. 
Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment on the fund. 
Some firms have taken steps toward building a pipeline of diverse talent. At Kapor, for example, a program is in the works to partner with other firms to train potential investors from underrepresented backgrounds. 
But too often, said co-founder Mitch Kapor, other investors have turned to him as a would-be scout for diverse talent, rather than building broader networks themselves. 

""Where do we find Black founders to invest in?"" Kapor said he is often asked. ""Like the answer was something like, 'Aisle 12.'""

434,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Reopening Hopes Give Wizz Air Wings,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The company’s traffic was down nearly 80% in its last report, and its main business is still tightly restricted across all of its major markets. It’s just borrowed another 500 million euros ($600 million), having lost over 110 million in the past three months, and it’s not able to give guidance for the current year.
All in all, it might seem like the wrong time for Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) to be posting all-time highs, but the budget airline with a focus on central and eastern European routes is going from strength to strength.
Like Wizz’s customers, desperate for a bit of sunshine or a family visit, investors are looking through the many problems that the pandemic is still causing the industry to focus on the glittering prize ahead: the reopening of the European travel market, enabled by mass vaccination campaigns.  
The stock is up nearly 60% since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech put an end to the pandemic in sight by announcing the had made the world’s first vaccine effective against Covid-19 (an effectiveness emphatically endorsed in an Israeli study at the weekend using real-world data).
It added another 2.4% on Monday in London, as details leaked of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plans to relax curbs on business and social life, even though there was little that suggested the airline industry is in for any immediate relief. If anything, it's been the reverse: the U.K. has tightened restrictions on international travel to stop the spread of new variants of Covid-19, even as it has talked up the prospect of an early reopening of the domestic economy.
Johnson is due to present a timetable for the U.K. to exit lockdowns at 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT).
 Wizz has been comfortably the best performer of all European airline stocks since the pandemic hit, up 13% from a year ago. Its biggest strength has been its flexibility on costs: most of its personnel are employed in central Europe, where labor law is less restrictive than in, say, Germany or Spain.  Another strength is the age of its fleet: at six years old, it’s one of the youngest in the world, keeping fuel costs low and providing some defense against the likely rise in carbon costs that the industry will face in coming years. And, unlike EasyJet, it hasn't been locked into expensive aircraft purchase contracts.
But just as importantly, it doesn’t have a legion of pensioners, often on generous defined benefit plans, acting as a permanent drain on cash flow. The scale of this problem at others was in evidence on Monday, when International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) said it had managed to improve the liquidity position of British Airways by postponing 450 million pounds in contributions to its (already restructured) pension scheme.  It’s pledging other assets to its pensioners in lieu of the money in the meantime, but aims to resume contributions in September (BA won’t be sending any money upstairs to IAG as dividends until 2024, by contrast). BA said on Monday it has also clinched the 2 billion pound, part-government-guaranteed loan it announced a few weeks ago. 
Wizz, too, has been borrowing to shore up its cash position, with a new 500 million euro note just earlier this month. That's enough to avert liquidity problems at least until the summer, by which time cash should again be flowing from more typical sources."

436,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>","British Airways owner IAG says pensions deal, loan help boosts liquidity","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) said on Monday it had raised total liquidity by 2.45 billion pounds ($3.4 billion) by deferring pension contributions and finalising a loan, which will help it survive the travel slump for longer. 
IAG said it continued to explore other debt opportunities to improve its finances, which have been battered by the pandemic. The group will report quarterly results on Friday, which analysts expect to show a 1.25 billion euro ($1.51 billion) loss for October-December. 
In order to clinch the deferral of the 450 million pounds worth of pension deficit contributions due between October 2020 and September 2021, BA agreed not to pay any dividends to parent company IAG before the end of 2023.
Like all airlines, IAG has been burning through cash, around 205 million euros a week, after operating for nearly 12 months with minimal revenues. It scrapped its dividend last April, and then raised 2.74 billion euros in October from shareholders to ride out the crisis.
Countries around the world have tightened travel restrictions over the last two months in response to new variants of the coronavirus and it is unclear when travel will restart, putting further pressure on airlines' finances. 
""In addition to these arrangements, IAG continues to explore other debt initiatives to improve further its liquidity,"" IAG said in a statement. The group also owns the airlines Iberia and Vueling in Spain and Ireland's Aer Lingus. 
Shares in IAG are trading down 55% from where they were this time last year, but news of the extra liquidity helped them rise 1.1% to 167 pence in early trading on Monday, in line with Britain's blue-chip index.
BA said it reached a final agreement for a new 2 billion pound five-year loan, which is partially guaranteed by Britain through its UK Export Finance unit, and would draw down the facility by the end of this month. 
That facility was secured in December and also includes restrictions on BA making dividend payments to IAG. 
Pension trustees also agreed to BA deferring monthly contributions of 37.5 million pounds, in a deal which included putting up property assets as security, and a suspension of BA dividends to parent company IAG until the end of 2023.
BA is IAG's biggest and most profitable airline and the pause in dividends from it means it could be years before IAG shareholders see payments again.
That is unlikely to be a surprise for shareholders, given new debts taken on by the airline group, and the fact that travel is not expected to reach 2019 levels until 2024. 
""This highlights the fact that IAG will be managing debt not distributions to shareholders for at least the next two years, which could be seen as reinforcing a negative,"" Goodbody analysts said in a note.

(Reuters) - European shares fell 1% on Monday as hopes of a vaccine-led global economic recovery fuelled a rally in commodities and raised concerns over the risk of higher inflation.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was on course for its worst day this month, led by declines in technology companies and retail stocks.
Germany's benchmark stock index fell the most among its European peers, down 1.3%.
Yields on Germany's benchmark 10-year bond jumped to their eight-month high, putting upward pressure on borrowing costs in the euro area.
""European equities are currently trading at quite higher valuations and with the current upward trajectory in bond yields, it might lead to further added pressure on equities,"" said Roland Kaloyan, a strategist at SocGen. 
""However, equity markets even on current valuations are equipped to absorb the rise in U.S. treasury yields up to 1.5% but any rapid spike in yields would definitely hurt equity markets.""
Europe will decide whether to extend the suspension of its rules limiting budget deficits and debt, known as the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), in coming weeks, the Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni said.
Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 1%, while investors awaited Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to gradually reopen the battered economy.
Meanwhile, focus is likely to turn to European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde's speech later in the day and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before Congress on Tuesday.
In company news, security firm  G4S  (CSE:G4S) dropped nearly 10% to the bottom of the STOXX 600 index after Canada's GardaWorld said it would not raise its offer further.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Monday, starting the week on a cautious note with investors focusing on developments surrounding the pandemic and vaccine rollouts.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.1%, and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 1.1%.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out a roadmap to ease England's third national lockdown on Monday, having met a target to vaccinate 15 million Britons from higher-risk categories by mid-February.
That said, Johnson has stressed the need to avoid complacency, and the lockdown will only be lifted slowly. Newspaper reports suggest that the travel and hospitality industry is unlikely to be functioning anywhere near normality by the important Easter break.
This sector has been battered by the mobility restrictions put in place to combat the transmission of the virus. Earlier Monday, British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) said it has raised total liquidity by 2.45 billion pounds ($3.4 billion), reaching final agreement for a 2 billion pound loan, and striking a deal to defer 450 million pounds of pension contributions. Its stock rose 0.6% in an overall weaker day.
The U.K. has been the bright spot in Europe in terms of the speed of its vaccination rollout, and concerns exist that continental Europe will still be locked down for some time to come. Indeed, the mayor of Nice in southern France called Sunday for a weekend lockdown to reduce the flow of tourists as it battles a sharp spike in coronavirus infections.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is set to give a speech later Monday, while Germany’s Ifo business climate index rose by more than expected in February, with both current performance and expectations coming in stronger. Manufacturing remained the strongest sector. .
In other corporate news,  Galp Energia  (LS:GALP) stock fell 3.2% as the Portuguese energy company posted a loss in the fourth quarter, while  G4S  (CSE:G4S) stock slumped 9.8% after GardaWorld said it would not revise its 235p/share offer for the British private-security company. 
French car parts maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) lost 3.4% even after it targeted its sales close to 25 billion euros ($30.29 billion) and an operating margin above 8% of sales by 2025.
Oil prices climbed Monday as U.S. production returned only slowly from last week’s severe cold snap, further tightening a global market where inventories have fallen sharply in recent weeks.
It will likely take several more days for oilfield crews to get production fully up again after the cold snap in Texas, the largest crude producing U.S. state, and the surrounding region forced the shut down of an estimated 4 million barrels per day in output.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $59.55 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $62.53.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 03:00AM ET</span>",Alpha Bank to sell 10.8 billion euro portfolio to Davidson Kempner,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's Alpha Bank will sell a 10.8 billion euro ($13.09 billion) portfolio of impaired loans and 80% of loan services provider Cepal Holdings to U.S. fund Davidson Kempner under a definitive agreement it announced on Monday.
The sale of the portfolio, known as Galaxy, will be the second-largest rated securitisation of non-performing exposures (NPEs) in Europe after Monte dei Paschi's Sienna project, it said.
The deal is expected to reduce Alpha Bank's NPE and NPL ratios in Greece to 24% and 13% respectively from 43% and 29% in September 2020.
Reuters had exclusively reported that Alpha Bank had selected Davidson Kempner as its preferred bidder in November last year.
The deal involves Alpha selling 51% of the mezzanine and junior securitisation notes of the 10.8 billion euro NPE portfolio along with 80% of loan servicing subsidiary Cepal Holdings.
""This is a turning point for our bank as we are making a decisive step in dealing conclusively with the legacy asset quality issues from the long-lasting recession in Greece,"" Alpha CEO Vassilis Psaltis said in a statement.
""In spite of the unprecedented conditions we experienced due to COVID-19, we are proud to have managed to sign such a complex transaction in just eight months from launch,"" he said.
The deal puts Cepal's enterprise value at 267 million euros, with Alpha having further upside through an earn-out of up to 68 million linked to the achievement of certain targets, the bank said.
It said the mezzanine and junior securitisation notes will be sold to an entity managed and advised by Davidson Kempner for cash, at an aggregate valuation for 100% of those notes of 40 million euros.
Total proceeds for Alpha Bank, including the senior notes and the sale price of the mezzanine and junior notes, correspond to about 35% of the portfolio's total gross book value.
The sale is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) was Alpha Bank’s lead financial adviser.

Amazon appealed to the Supreme Court this month against Future Group's sale to market leader Reliance Industries, accusing its partner of violating contracts by agreeing to the sale.
The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world's richest men, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani, could reshape India's pandemic-hit shopping sector and decide if Amazon can blunt Reliance's dominance of retail.
Three people familiar with Monday's proceedings said the Supreme Court ordered that while the tribunal can continue to review the deal and oversee the approval process, it could not pass a final order while the court hears Amazon's concerns.
""This is a good thing for Amazon,"" said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of events. 
Indian stock exchanges and the antitrust watchdog have already cleared the deal, which now awaits clearance by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), in line with regulatory procedures.
A second source said Future had only asked the NCLT to let it to call meetings to seek shareholder approvals of the deal. That process will continue, and Future will later seek final approval from the tribunal, the source added.
Amazon declined to comment, while Future Group and Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The sources sought anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.

In its Supreme Court appeal, Amazon will argue that an arbitration order in October that put the Future-Reliance deal on hold remains valid, Reuters has reported.

Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, who stepped down from his role at the end of 2020, received total remuneration of 13.3 million pounds ($18.6 million) under Australian accounting rules, up from 7.1 million pounds a year earlier.
Despite the loss of about 2.7 million pounds in awards following a board review into the blast, the sum, which includes the value of share awards that have not yet vested, was boosted by Rio Tinto's strong share price performance.
Jacques and two other executives left Rio after the company determined their positions had become untenable after a backlash against a board review that originally imposed only financial penalties for the destruction of the sacred sites. 
Rio Tinto's remuneration committee, led by non-executive director Sam Laidlaw, granted ""eligible"" leaver status to the three executives, meaning they avoided stiffer financial penalties for the incident. 
""In making the eligible leaver determination the Board fully recognised the gravity of the destruction at Juukan Gorge but was mindful that the three executives did not deliberately cause the events to happen, they did not do anything unlawful, nor did they engage in fraudulent or dishonest behaviour or wilfully neglect their duties,"" it said in the annual report.
Rio's iron ore head, Chris Salisbury, who stepped down in September, received total remuneration of A$6.7 million ($5.3 million) including termination benefits and unvested share awards, from A$2.9 million in 2019. Salisbury lost a A$1.1 million short-term incentive.
Head of Corporate Affairs Simone Niven forfeited 525,000 pounds in short-term incentives but received 5.1 million pounds, including 1.1 million pounds in termination benefits and unvested share awards. 
Independent Rio Tinto Director Michael L'Estrange, who lead the initial board review, had a 46% increase in fees and salary. His total remuneration rose to A$227,000 from A$201,000.
Chairman Simon Thompson was paid 939,000 pounds, up from 934,000 pounds the year before.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) lifted its profit guidance on Monday, sending shares to 12-month highs, as its large North American energy business profits from the winter storms sweeping across Texas and other states.
Macquarie said it expects its fiscal 2021 profit to jump by as much as 10%, after warning just two weeks ago that earnings would be ""slightly down"". 
The energy business unit, designed to move large quantities of gas to meet unexpected demand, has single-handedly increased the overall profit forecast of the investment bank by about A$400 million, analysts said.
""Extreme winter weather conditions in North America have significantly increased short-term client demand for Macquarie's capabilities in maintaining critical physical supply across the commodity complex,"" the company said in a statement.
Macquarie is the second biggest gas marketer in North America, behind oil major BP (NYSE:BP). It purchases natural gas and moves it along pipelines and grids, typically from an area where usage is low to high-demand markets.
The deadly winter storm that crippled infrastructure and left millions of Texans without power meant electricity generators had to compete for natural gas supplies, pushing up prices sharply in the deregulated market.
The supply crunch has provided Macquarie with an unexpected windfall.
""Macquarie appears to be capitalising well on volatility and financial market dislocation,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities analysts said in a note, as it increased its earnings forecasts for the Sydney-headquartered company.
Macquarie's performance hurt last year by the pandemic, with subdued deal-making and deteriorating economic conditions leading to a rise in impairment charges.
But a strong initial public offering of its majority-owned data analytics software business, Nuix, late last year and a fillip in the energy business have helped push its share price back to pre-pandemic levels.
The company, which also operates Australia's largest asset manager and investment banking business, is set for extra boost from a rebound in local M&A activity this year.
Macquarie's shares were 4.31% higher at A$148.39 early on Monday, the highest level in a year, outperforming a broader market that was flat. The share price eased slightly in afternoon trading.
Earlier this month, the Sydney-based financial conglomerate had forecast full-year earnings for the group to be ""slightly"" lower than in fiscal 2020.

Macquarie's Commodities and Global Markets division contributes close to 40% of its group earnings. Analysts had previously raised concerns that the pandemic could erode profits from the division if high energy-use industries shuttered.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>",Boeing recommends airlines suspend use of some 777s after United incident,"By Jamie Freed and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said it recommended suspending the use of 777 jets with the same type of engine that shed debris over Denver at the weekend after U.S. regulators announced extra inspections and Japan suspended their use while considering further action.
The moves involving Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines came after a United Airlines 777 landed safely in Denver on Saturday local time after its right engine failed.
United said the next day it would voluntarily and temporarily remove its 24 active planes, hours before Boeing's announcement.
Boeing said 69 of the planes were in service and 59 were in storage, at a time when airlines have grounded planes due to a plunge in demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The manufacturer recommended airlines suspend operations until U.S. regulators identified the appropriate inspection protocol.
The 777-200s and 777-300s affected are older and less fuel efficient than newer models and most operators are phasing them out of their fleets.
Images posted by police in Broomfield, Colorado showed significant plane debris on the ground, including an engine cowling from the 26-year-old plane scattered outside a home.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said its initial examination of the plane indicated most of the damage was confined to the right engine, with only minor damage to the airplane.
It said the inlet and casing separated from the engine and two fan blades were fractured, while the remainder of the fan blades exhibited damage.
Japan's transport ministry ordered Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) and ANA Holdings Inc to suspend the use of 777s with PW4000 engines while it considered whether to take additional measures.
The ministry said that on Dec. 4, 2020, a JAL flight from Naha Airport to Tokyo returned to Naha due to a malfunction in the left engine. 
Japan Transport Safety Board said on Dec. 28 that it had found two of the left engine's fan blades were damaged, one from a fatigue fracture. The investigation is ongoing.
United is the only U.S. operator of the planes, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The other airlines using them are in Japan and South Korea, the U.S. agency said.
""We reviewed all available safety data,"" the FAA said in a statement. ""Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes."" 
Japan said ANA operated 19 of the type and JAL operated 13 of them, though the airlines said their use had been reduced during the pandemic. JAL said its fleet was due for retirement by March 2022.
Pratt & Whitney, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, said it was coordinating with operators and regulators to support a revised inspection interval for the engines. 
An official at South Korea's transport ministry said it was waiting for formal action by the FAA before giving a directive to its airlines. The U.S. agency said it would soon issue an emergency airworthiness directive.
Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, which has 16 of the planes, 10 of them stored, said on Monday it grounded the remaining six it had in operation of its own volition. 
Asiana Airlines Inc, which has nine 777s with Pratt & Whitney engines, said it is in discussion with Boeing and the relevant authorities on what measure to take. 
In February 2018, a 777 of the same age operated by United and bound for Honolulu suffered an engine failure when a cowling fell off about 30 minutes before the plane landed safely. The NTSB determined that incident was the result of a full-length fan blade fracture.

Because of that 2018 incident, Pratt & Whitney reviewed inspection records for all previously inspected PW4000 fan blades, the NTSB said. The FAA in March 2019 issued a directive requiring initial and recurring inspections of the fan blades on the PW4000 engines.

Indeed, the mayor of Nice in southern France called Sunday for a weekend lockdown to reduce the flow of tourists as it battles a sharp spike in coronavirus infections.
“While we expect economic growth to start a sharp recovery this year, it will clearly lag inflation as lockdowns are still set to continue for the short-term,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Worries about inflation have led to rapidly rising bond yields in recent weeks, and this has concerned some equity investors as they could diminish the relative appeal of stocks.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivers his semi-annual testimony before Congress this week and is likely to reiterate a commitment to keeping policy very accommodative for a prolonged period, while European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is also expected to take a similar tone in a speech later Monday.
The economic calendar is relatively quiet Monday, with only Germany’s Ifo Institute releasing its February survey on the country’s business climate.
Oil prices climbed Monday as U.S. production returned only slowly from last week’s severe cold snap, further tightening a global market where inventories have fallen sharply in recent weeks.

TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund is poised to have a new number-one asset in its portfolio with the upcoming floatation of top South Korean e-tailer Coupang, furthering a turnaround that has seen the fund yo-yo from huge losses to record profit.
The $50 billion target valuation that Reuters reported this month would likely see the decade-old firm surpass recently listed U.S. food deliverer DoorDash Inc on a roster of assets that also includes stakes in TikTok parent ByteDance and ride-hailers Grab and Didi.
The Vision Fund built up its 37% stake in Coupang for $2.7 billion, mostly at an $8.7 billion post-money valuation, a person familiar with the matter said. The fund is not expected to sell shares in the initial public offering (IPO) that Coupang filed for in New York, the person said, declining to be identified as the information was not public.
SoftBank Group Corp and Coupang declined to comment.
Achieving a $50 billion valuation would add to good news for the fund which is bouncing back from an annual loss in March. This month, it announced record quarterly profit, driven by the listings of DoorDash and home seller Opendoor Technologies Inc and share price rise of ride-hailer Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
HIT PARADE
The fund has written big cheques for late-stage startups to fuel rapid growth, with two-thirds of the value of its portfolio concentrated in 10 assets including Coupang.
The 10 include 25% of British chip designer Arm - to be sold to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp pending regulatory approval - but not stakes in high-profile stumbles like office-sharing firm WeWork.

SoftBank initially invested in Coupang in 2015, adding it to a stable of e-commerce hits that included 25% of China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, before placing it under the fund.
The e-tailer has grown rapidly during stay-home policies while the COVID-19 pandemic has forced other portfolio firms like Indian hotel chain Oyo to scramble to preserve cash. 
Analysts see Coupang's $50 billion valuation as feasible given its first-mover status and as it expands beyond replacing brick-and-mortar retail with a rising number of online channels.
It is the biggest e-tailer in South Korea that directly handles inventory, with 2020 purchases at about 21.7 trillion won ($19.62 billion), showed data from WiseApp.
""The market's assessment isn't exaggerated,"" said analyst Park Eun-kyung at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities. ""Coupang's market leadership is a premium factor.""

449,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2021 10:45PM ET</span>",Five things to look out for in HSBC strategy update,"By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC will update its ""transformation"" plan announced a year ago on Tuesday, when the Asia-focussed lender also reports annual results. 
As part of its latest strategy, the bank said in February last year it would shrink its investment banking operations and revamp its businesses in the United States and Europe resulting in 35,000 jobs being cut. 
HSBC's pretax profits for 2020 is expected to fall 38% to $8.3 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by the bank, because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here are five key things to look out for in the new plan to revive its growth -- 
1. How will HSBC boost fee income?
The bank has promised details of its plans to make more money from the fees it earns from selling products to customers than it does by pocketing the difference between the interest rates it offers savers and charges borrowers. 
This could involve selling more products to wealth management clients, charging corporate clients in different ways, and maybe even charging retail clients for basic banking services. 
2. What do the plans to double down on China and Asia mean?
HSBC intends to refocus resources from elsewhere on what it calls its ""high returning Asia business"", but investors want to know what this means in practice for markets and business lines. 
Politics could make this harder. HSBC has been attacked by British lawmakers for assisting Hong Kong police with investigations into pro-democracy activists, including freezing some bank accounts. 
CEO Noel Quinn said last month the bank had to comply with police requests and he could not ""cherry-pick which laws to follow"". 
3. Will HSBC resume paying a dividend? 
HSBC has not announced a dividend since the third quarter of 2019, on instructions from the Bank of England. This angered retail investors in Hong Kong who tried unsuccessfully to have the policy changed.
The regulator has since lifted the ban, and British rival  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said Thursday it would pay a dividend of one pence a share. However, despite beating analyst expectations with its 2020 results, Barclays shares fell as a vague outlook without profit targets left investors underwhelmed. 
HSBC investors will be looking beyond the day's numbers for concrete commitments towards improved returns and a more positive outlook for key economies. 
4. How will HSBC shrink its U.S. and European footprint? 
HSBC's French high street banking operations are up for sale, but it has had trouble finding a buyer. 
The market is due an update on whether HSBC has managed to find a buyer on terms it will accept, or whether it will seek to wind the business down more gradually. 
HSBC will also give details of how it will accelerate its existing efforts to shrink assets, staff and branches in the U.S., which accounted for 0.5% of the group's pre-tax profit in the first half of last year. 
5. More job cuts on the way? 

HSBC employed 307,000 people at the end of 2010. The bank's management said last year it was aiming to reduce the headcount of 235,000 closer to 200,000 by 2023. Investors want to know whether the new plan will mean deeper cuts. Nearly every new strategy launched by HSBC in the past decade has resulted in fewer people being employed by the bank.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning, giving up earlier gains even as global COVID-19 vaccine programs advance and optimism continues to grow for an economic recovery.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 were up 0.26% by 10:32 PM ET (3:32 AM GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.16%, with the Bank of Korea to hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edge down 0.14%. Australia began its COVID-19 vaccine rollout earlier in the day and is set to report no local cases for a third consecutive day. The vaccines also saw Fitch maintain the country’s AAA credit rating, albeit with a negative outlook.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.05%. The city received its first batch of  Sinovac Biotech  Ltd.'s (NASDAQ:SVA) Coronavac vaccine during the previous week, with registration for priority groups set to open on Tuesday.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.06% and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.21%.
The optimism saw a bond selloff continue Monday, with benchmark 10-year Treasury yields climbing to the highest in about a year and a slide in sovereign debt for both Australia and New Zealand. Progress on the $1.9 trillion stimulus packages proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden also contributed to the selloff.
“Yield curves have continued to steepen, as COVID infection rates decline further, reopening plans are discussed and a large U.S. fiscal stimulus package looks likely,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) head of economics research Christian Keller told Reuters.
“This in principle signals a better medium-term growth outlook for the U.S. and beyond, as other core yields curves are moving in the same direction … meanwhile, central banks seem set to look through this year’s inflation increase, keeping the curves’ front end anchored,” he added.
As vaccine rollouts continue globally, Israel said that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) seemed to protect most recipients from infection. Although global progress against the pandemic drove investor sentiment up, concerns about the reflation trade driving yields too high are staring to creep in.
Investors will be watching whether Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell shows any signs of concerns over higher long-term borrowing costs when he delivers the Fed’s semi-annual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.
Across the Pacific Ocean, the Reserve Bank of Australia resumed purchases of three-year securities to defend its yield target.

Investors including Macellum Advisors GP LLC, Ancora Holdings Inc, Legion Partners Asset Management LLC, and 4010 Capital LLC had earlier this year nominated nine people to its now-12-person board, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. 
These activist investors are calling on Kohl's to take a range of actions, including adding directors with retail experience who can work with Michelle Gass, the company's CEO.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>",Global dividend payouts forecast to revive in 2021,"By Joice Alves
LONDON (Reuters) - Global dividend payments could rebound by as much as 5% this year, a new report estimated on Monday, after the coronavirus caused the biggest slump in payouts since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. 
Companies' payouts to shareholders plunged more than 10% on an underlying basis in 2020 as one in five cut their dividends and one in eight cancelled them altogether.
A total of $220 billion worth of cuts were made between April and December, based on investment manager Janus Henderson's Global Dividend Index. But there are signs companies are beginning to reinstate at least some of them. 
Janus Henderson's report warned that dividends could still fall 2% this year, in a worst-case scenario. But its best-case scenario sees 2021 dividends up 5% on a headline basis.
""It is quite likely we will see companies pay special dividends in 2021, utilising strong cash positions to make up some of the decline in distributions in 2020"". 
Banking dividends will be likely to drive the rebound in payouts in 2021, the report said, after the European Central Bank and Bank of England eased blanket bans for lenders on dividends and buybacks. These were imposed during the first wave of the crisis to prepare for a potential increase in bad loans.
UK lenders  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and NatWest resumed payouts this month.
Last year, dividend bans meant banks cut or cancelled $70 billion of payments globally, according to the report. 
(GRAPHIC: Global annual dividends and 2021 forecast - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxwqlnpx/Global%20annual%20dividends%20and%202021%20forecast.png)
But the overall global dividend cuts proved less dramatic than expected. In August, Janus Henderson had expected the virus to drive corporates to cut $400 billion worth of dividends, nearly double the eventual outcome.
A resilient fourth quarter of 2020 helped, said Janus Henderson. The likes of German car maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Russia's largest lender Sberbank restored payments. 
(GRAPHIC: Global dividends cuts by sector - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmpjxjggpr/Global%20dividends%20cuts%20by%20sector.png) 
Mining and oil companies cut dividends after a slump in commodity prices, while consumer discretionary companies also took a hit following lockdowns. 
European dividends, not including Britain, fell by 28.4% on an underlying basis in 2020 to $171.6 billion. ""This was the lowest total from Europe since at least 2009,"" Janus Henderson said.
(GRAPHIC: Dividend cuts by region - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjxjkavr/Dividend%20cuts%20by%20region.png) 
In contrast, North American payouts rose 2.6% for the full year, setting a new record of $549 billion, the report said. Canada had the fewest dividend cuts anywhere in the world, the index showed.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian banks are set to post their fourth straight year-on-year quarterly profit drop when they report results next week, the longest decline streak since the financial crisis, on margin compression and declining commercial lending, but flattening loan loss provisions signal a turning point, investors said.
Banks' profit margins are also expected to get a boost from rising 10-year bond yields in Canada and the United States in future quarters as short-term rates remain near zero. Banks often fund their lending with short-term borrowing or bank deposits.
Analysts estimate the nation's six biggest lenders - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) - will post an average decline of 4.3% in first-quarter profit from the previous three months and 12% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data.
BMO and Scotiabank start reporting results for the three months through January on Tuesday.
Bank CEOs have turned optimistic about 2021, driven by the deployment of coronavirus vaccines, although Canada has seen a slower rollout than some other developed nations.
""Regardless of short-term issues, it's comforting that we have multiple vaccines,"" said Manulife Investment Management Senior Portfolio Manager Steve Belisle. ""They’ve good reason to be optimistic versus the worst case scenarios last year.""
First-quarter profit declines will be driven by margin pressure and modest loan growth, Canaccord Genuity Analyst Scott Chan said in a note on Thursday. But profits are set to benefit from strong mortgage growth driven by booming housing demand, and gains in capital markets and wealth and asset management units, Chan said.
Chan said he's revised earnings estimates up 3%, ""supported by our assumption of better credit conditions and continued tailwinds from market sensitive businesses."" 
Record provisions for loan losses (PCLs) taken in 2020 mean a significant increase in capital set aside is unlikely during the quarter, said Anthony Visano, managing director of Kingwest & Company, which holds shares in TD, Scotiabank and CIBC. 
However, unlike U.S. banks that have already begun releasing some of their reserves back into earnings, Canadian lenders are likely to wait until later in the year to do so, he said. 
""As the year unfolds, we should see the vaccine's assist in terms of the loan growth books ... sequentially, we should see improvements, especially when it comes to provisions normalizing,"" Visano said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A United Airlines flight landed safely at Denver International Airport on Saturday after its right engine failed, the Federal Aviation Administration said, with dramatic images showing debris from the plane scattered on the ground.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-200 plane, with 231 passengers and 10 crew on board, was heading to Honolulu when it suffered an engine failure soon after takeoff, the airline said. 
There were no reports of injuries, either on the plane or the ground. 
Images posted by police in Broomfield, Colorado showed significant plane debris on the ground, including an engine cowling scattered outside a home and what appeared to be other parts in a field. Police tape was used to cordon off the debris. 
One video taken from what appeared to be inside the United plane showed an engine on fire.
Another video on social media showed a cloud of black smoke being left by a plane.
""Something blew up,"" a man on the video can be heard saying.
In an audio recording, a United pilot could be heard making a mayday call to air traffic control. 
""Mayday, aircraft just experienced engine failure, need to turn immediately,"" according to audio from the monitoring website liveatc.net which was reviewed by Reuters.
The FAA said it and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will investigate. The NTSB said it had opened an investigation. 
""If you find debris PLEASE don't touch it or move it. The 
@NTSB wants all debris to remain in place for investigation,"" the Broomfield police department said on Twitter. 
The 26-year-old 777 was powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines. Investigators will focus on what caused the accident and will look at whether a fan blade failed.
Boeing said its technical advisers would assist the NTSB with its investigation, while United pledged to ""work with federal agencies investigating this incident.""
United said most of the passengers on Flight 328 took off on a new flight to Honululu late Saturday.
Engine failures are rare but are potentially dangerous whenever rotating parts pierce the outer casing - an event known as an uncontained engine failure.
In February 2018, an older Boeing 777 operated by United and bound for Honolulu suffered an engine failure when a cowling fell off about 30 minutes before the plane landed safely. The NTSB determined that incident was the result of a full-length fan blade fracture.

Because of the United fan blade separation incident, Pratt & Whitney, which is unit of Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), reviewed inspection records for all previously inspected PW4000 fan blades, the NTSB said. The FAA in March 2019 issued a directive requiring initial and recurring inspections of the fan blades on the PW4000 engines.

461,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2021 08:35PM ET</span>",Big U.S. companies slash donations to politicians after Trump election challenge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ten U.S. corporations slashed donations to candidates seeking federal office by more than 90% in January, after pledging to cut off giving to the Republicans who supported former President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn his election defeat.
None of the political action committees of 10 major companies reviewed by Reuters, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), donated to any of the 147 congressional Republicans who voted to support Trump's claims just hours after his supporters launched a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol.
Disclosures to the Federal Election Commission ahead of a Saturday filing deadline showed the group of corporate PACs affiliated with those 10 companies made $13,000 in new donations to candidates in January. The reports were the first by the PACs to detail contributions made since the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.
The money donated during the month was less than one-tenth the roughly $190,000 the 10 company PACs gave candidates in January 2017, and tiny relative to the roughly $10 million donated to candidates during the 2019-2020 election season. The 147 lawmakers who voted to overturn President Joe Biden's victory had received more than $2 million from those 10 PACs during the last two-year political cycle.
Only committees tied to two of the companies -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) - reported any new giving to federal candidates in January.
American Express' PAC gave $5,000 to Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota, while GE's gave $5,000 to Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a prominent Republican Trump critic, and $1,000 to Representative Rick Larsen of Washington, a Democrat.
Political giving usually slows down in the months after a U.S. general election and money from corporate political action committees is a small slice of the funds raised by political campaigns.
But the paucity of corporate-affiliated giving in January points to a slower start in one corner of political finance ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.
Corporate PACs cannot donate money from the company treasury but generally serve as a conduit for contributions from managers and shareholders.
Committees affiliated with Best Buy,  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT), Dow Inc and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) did not report new donations to any candidates in January.

While more than a thousand PACs are associated with corporate America, the 10 reviewed by Reuters include major companies which made clear public statements that they would throttle back donations following the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's nominee to lead state-run oil company Petrobras said on Saturday the company needs to find ""balance"" in fuel pricing, considering the impact on shareholders, investors, sellers and consumers.
Joaquim Silva e Luna, a retired army general and former defense minister overseeing the state-run Itaipu hydroelectric dam on the border with Paraguay and Argentina since 2019, was tapped on Friday to be the next chief executive of Petróleo Brasileiro SA.
Bolsonaro has criticized Roberto Castello Branco, current CEO of the state firm known formally as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, for ignoring the complaints of truckers as he hiked diesel prices 15% this week, tracking global markets higher.
Petrobras shares plunged on Friday due to growing investor fears of political interference in fuel pricing, which has triggered billions of dollars in losses over the past decade. 
Luna was cautious in some of his first public comments since Bolsonaro made the announcement in a late Friday social media post, seeking to allay concerns that the company would lose autonomy to set prices in Brazil, where it dominates the market.
""There is no way to have interference in the pricing policy. There's executive management ... and we have the capacity to handle the issue. We'll reflect on the economy as well as on the trucker who has no cargo to transport,"" he told Reuters in an interview.""We need to find a balance, considering the shareholder, the market, oil prices, the currency, as well as the people, because gasoline and diesel prices have an impact on the whole chain of production. We cannot ignore this reality,"" he said.
Reflecting on his background in the military and government service, Luna said he would be ""a manager and not a general"" at Petrobras. ""My profile is to deliver results,"" he added.
Current CEO Castello Branco's term ends March 20. Cheered by investors for his efforts to sell underperforming assets and cut debt, the University of Chicago-trained economist would be the second Petrobras head in three years to leave over disagreements in fuel pricing. In 2018, then-CEO Pedro Parente resigned when the government forced fuel prices lower in a concession to striking truckers.

Parente had vowed to set domestic prices in line with global markets, breaking with a policy that made Petrobras sell fuel below international parity, triggering some $40 billion in losses from 2011 to 2014.

The chief executive of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, whose recent tweets have fueled the digital-currency rally, made the remark on Twitter while replying to a user who said that gold was better than both bitcoin and conventional cash.
Musk, who earlier in the week remarked that he found the prospect of holding bitcoin adventurous for an S&P 500 company, said in a tweet: ""Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter ...""
""That said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol,"" he added.
Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, hit a fresh high in Asian trading on Saturday, extending a two-month rally a day after the digital currency's market capitalization exceeded $1 trillion.
Ethereum or ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and daily volume.

Musk, an ardent proponent of digital currencies, has defended Tesla's recent purchase of $1.5 billion of bitcoin, which has ignited mainstream interest in the digital currency.

PARIS (Reuters) - The head of European planemaker Airbus called on Saturday for a ""ceasefire"" in a transatlantic trade war over aircraft subsidies, saying tit-for-tat tariffs on planes and other goods had aggravated damage from the COVID-19 crisis.
Washington progressively imposed import duties of 15% on Airbus jets from 2019 after a prolonged dispute at the World Trade Organization, and the EU responded with matching tariffs on Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets a year later. Wine, whisky and other goods are also affected.
""This dispute, which is now an old dispute, has put us in a lose-lose situation,"" Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in a radio interview.
""We have ended up in a situation where wisdom would normally dictate that we have a ceasefire and resolve this conflict,"" he told France Inter.
Boeing was not immediately available for comment.
Brazil, which has waged separate battles with Canada over subsidies for smaller regional jets, on Thursday dropped its own complaint against Ottawa and called for a global peace deal between producing nations on support for aerospace.
Faury said the dispute with Boeing was particularly damaging during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has badly hit air travel and led to travel restrictions or border closures. He expressed particular concern about widening bans within Europe.
""We are extremely frustrated by the barriers that restrict personal movement and it is almost impossible today to travel in Europe by plane, even domestically,"" he said.
""The priority no. 1 for countries in general is to reopen frontiers and allow people to travel on the basis of tests and then eventually vaccinations.""
The comments come as businesses increase pressure on governments to reopen economies as coronavirus vaccine roll-outs gather pace across Europe. 
France has defended recently introduced border restrictions, saying they will help the government avoid a new lockdown and stay in force until at least the end of February.
Germany installed border controls with the Czech Republic and Austria last Sunday, drawing protest from Austria and concerns about supply-chain disruptions.
Berlin calls the move a temporary measure of last resort.

Poland said on Saturday it had not ruled out imposing restrictions at the country's borders with Slovakia and the Czech Republic due to rising COVID-19 cases.

""Since most of the customers we serve are large customers, they all have proper precautionary planning,"" said Liu Young-way, chairman of the manufacturing conglomerate formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd
""Therefore, the impact on these large customers is there, but limited,"" he told reporters.
Liu said he expected the company to do well in the first half of 2021, ""especially as the pandemic is easing and demand is still being sustained.""
The global spread of COVID-19 has increased demand for laptops, gaming consoles, and other electronics. This caused chip manufacturers to reallocate capacity away from the automotive sector, which was expecting a steep downturn.
Now, car manufacturers such as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have cut output as chip capacity has shrunk. 
Counterpoint Research says the shortage has extended to the smartphone sector, with application processors, display driver chips, and power management chips all facing a crunch.
However, the research firm predicts Apple will face a minimal impact, due to its large size and its suppliers' tendency to prioritise it. Apple is Foxconn's largest customer.
Foxconn is looking at other areas for growth, including in electric vehicles (EVs), and Liu said their EV development platform MIH now had 736 partner companies participating.
He expected it would have two or three models to show by the fourth quarter, though did not expect EVs to make an obvious contribution to company earnings until 2023.

Liu also said the company was still looking for semiconductor fab purchase opportunities in Southeast Asia after not winning a bid to take over a stake in Malaysia-based 8-inch foundry house Silterra.

CANBERRA (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is back at the negotiating table, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday after the tech giant this week blocked news on its site in the country.
Facebook's abrupt decision to stop Australians from sharing news on the site and strip the pages of domestic and foreign news outlets also erased several state government and emergency department accounts, causing widespread anger.
The company has ""tentatively friended us again,"" Morrison told a news conference in Sydney. ""What I'm pleased about it that Facebook is back at the table again.""
Facebook has publicly indicated no change in its opposition to a proposed law requiring social media platforms to pay for links to news content. Morrison was not asked about that.
Australia's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Friday he had spoken with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and further talks were expected over the weekend. It was not clear whether those talks have happened.
A Facebook spokeswoman and representatives for Frydenberg did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The stand-off comes as Australia's vows to press ahead with the landmark legislation, which could set a global precedent as countries like Canada express interest in taking similar action.
The Australian law, which would force Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google to reach commercial deals with Australian publishers or face compulsory arbitration, has cleared the lower house of parliament and is expected to be passed by the Senate within the next week.
Simon Milner, Facebook’s Asia-Pacific policy director of policy for the Asia-Pacific region, was quoted on Saturday as telling the Sydney Morning Herald the company had three main objections to the legislation.
Facebook objects to being barred from discriminating between different news outlets that ask for money, to arbitration models that allow an independent body to select one payment over another, and to the obligation to enter commercial negotiations with Australian media companies, Milner said.
Facebook declined to make Milner available to speak with Reuters.
Australia's legislation is being widely watched overseas.
Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said on Thursday his country would adopt the Australian approach as it crafts its own legislation in coming months.
Google, which has initially threatened to close its search engine in Australia, has announced host of preemptive licensing deals over the past week, including a global agreement with News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA).
Facebook's move had an immediate impact on traffic to Australian new sites, according to early data from New York-based analytics firm Chartbeat.

Total traffic to the Australian news sites from various platforms fell from the day before the ban by around 13% within the country.

Tight chip supplies have caused problems for auto makers globally, who in some cases are having to curtail production.
This week U.S. President Joe Biden's top economic adviser, Brian Deese, thanked Wang for her efforts to resolve the shortage in coordination with the island's manufacturers. 
Wang told reporters that she had received the letter on Friday night, adding she had previously met with local chip makers on the issue, referring to meetings she has held in recent weeks.
""Going forward, manufacturers are doing what they should,"" she said.
This is a problem affecting car makers around the world, including in the United States, Japan and Europe, and Taiwan is an important supplier, Wang added.

The shortage has affected Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers.
Chip makers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip maker, have pledged to prioritise production.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 08:45PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Rising U.S. bond yields pose new threat to sky-high stocks,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market has so far digested a surge in Treasury yields, but some investors are worried that a continued ascent could prove more problematic.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which rises when bond prices fall, climbed to a one year high of 1.36% this week, fueled by expectations that progress in the countrywide vaccination program and further fiscal stimulus would further spur economic growth.
So far, stocks have responded with little more than a wobble. But some investors worry that a continued rise in yields on Treasuries -- which are backed by the U.S. government -- could dim the allure of comparatively riskier investments such as equities and weigh on the S&P 500 that has risen about 75% since last March. 
""When ... government bond yields rise, all asset prices should reprice lower -- that’s the theory,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, adding that he does not believe yields have yet risen far enough to provide an competitive alternative to stocks. 
The rise in yields comes as the S&P 500 hovers near all-time highs at the end of a fourth-quarter earnings season that has seen companies overall report earnings 17.2% above expectations, according to Refinitiv data. Earnings will continue to be in focus next week along with data tracking the economic recovery and developments with President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.
Despite solid corporate results, worried investors can point to any number of signs -- including blistering rallies in Bitcoin and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares and the proliferation of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) -- that ultra-easy monetary policy and fiscal stimulus have fueled an excessive appetite for risk that could be curbed if yields start to rise. 
The latest fund manager survey by BofA Global Research showed a record in the net percentage of investors taking higher-than-normal risk, cash allocations at their lowest level since March 2013 and allocations to stocks and commodities at their highest point in around a decade.
Citi strategists said in a report this week that a 10% pullback ""seems very plausible,"" noting that ""if rising bond yields drag down some mega-cap IT growth names... that will impact the broad index as a result of the over-representation of such stocks.""
Analysts at Nomura, meanwhile, said earlier this week that a move above 1.5% on the 10-year could spark an 8% drop in stocks. 
Low yields and interest rates support equities in several ways, such as reducing debt and borrowing costs, making stocks look relatively attractive to bonds and helping increase the value of companies' future cash flows.
At 22.2 times its forward price-to-earnings ratio, the S&P 500's valuation is well above its long-term average of 15.3, according to Refinitiv Datastream, though several investors said stocks still look relatively inexpensive compared to bonds.
Plenty of investors are sanguine about the move, noting that yields appear to be rising due to expectations of an improving economy. 
J. Bryant Evans, a portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, recently added bank and mortgage company stocks to a high dividend portfolio this week to take advantage of the improving economic outlook and rising rate environment.
More broadly, he was targeting a 3% yield on the 10-year for when bonds might start competing more aggressively with stocks.
""For my clients, I would urge some balance and wait a little bit before moving to fixed income because I think interest rates are still extremely low historically speaking,"" Evans said.
Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, is watching whether rising yields eventually come with a ""change in tone at the Fed"" that suggest the central bank will start tapering its bond purchases as it reins in its stimulus, which could shake the market.
Still, he isn't pulling back on his equity exposure for now because of the recent rise in yields, convinced a strengthening economy will continue buoying stocks, particularly those that should shine in a recovery such as financials and other value shares. 

The steeper yield curve, Nolte said, is ""the bond market’s way of telling everybody that the economy is recovering and getting healthy.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) will beef up its process to investigate workers' concerns and expand training after former employees shared accounts on social media of racial and sexual harassment. 
Manish Mehta, BlackRock's global head of human resources, outlined the changes in a note sent firmwide on Thursday and shared by a company spokesman on Friday. 
Mehta wrote that ""While we strive for a culture of respect and belonging, some of our people have experienced the firm in a way that is not inclusive. Whether the behaviors that cause this are intended or not, they are not acceptable and impact our colleagues and culture.""
He wrote after former employees posted accounts they said showed the world's largest asset manager not living up to its high standards for diversity, part of a broader conversation about race in corporate America.
In a Feb. 1 Medium post, former BlackRock analyst Essma Bengabsia described being sexually harassed and discriminated against as an Arab-American Muslim woman, including being taunted for not wearing a Christmas holiday sweater. Little happened after she complained to the firm's human resources department, she wrote.
In a separate post on Thursday she and Mugi Nguyai, another former analyst who is from Kenya, wrote that they were ""labeled as difficult, aggressive, or too outspoken to manage"" when they tried to speak up. They petitioned for steps including an independent audit of all internal harassment reports.
In a statement sent by a spokesman BlackRock said it reviewed the claims by Bengabsia ""but did not find she had been the subject of discrimination or harassment."" The spokesman declined to comment on Nguyai's account.

Like rivals BlackRock had stepped up its focus on diversity since last summer's Black Lives Matter protests against racial injustice. In July BlackRock said it aimed to promote more diverse team members and released data showing that as of 2019 Blacks and Latinos held just seven of 103 top jobs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Valentino SpA was sued on Friday for $207.1 million by the landlord of its former American flagship on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, which said the Italian fashion company had no right to break its lease and leave the store in disrepair.
The complaint followed a judge's Jan. 27 dismissal of Valentino's own lawsuit seeking to void its 16-year lease because the coronavirus pandemic had made operating the store, two blocks south of Trump Tower, impossible.
According to the landlord, 693 Fifth Owner LLC, Valentino owes all rent due through the lease's July 2029 expiration despite abandoning the store in December.
Valentino must also pay $12.9 million to repair store damage, including to Venetian Terrazzo marble panels now defaced with paint and holes, the landlord said.
Neither Valentino nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment. The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, a New York state court.
In seeking to end its lease, Valentino said the pandemic left it unable to operate the store ""consistent with the luxury, prestigious, high-quality reputation"" of its neighborhood.
But in dismissing Valentino's lawsuit, Justice Andrew Borrok of the Manhattan court said the lease gave the landlord broad protections from nonpayment of rent.
""The fact that the COVID 19 pandemic was not specifically enumerated by the parties does not change the result,"" he wrote.
Valentino is appealing Borrok's decision.
Manhattan retailers have struggled during the pandemic with reduced traffic from tourists and office workers, and early forced store closures.
Last month, the Real Estate Board of New York said rents sought for Manhattan retail space fell throughout the borough, including an 8% drop in the stretch including Valentino's store.
""The building owner tried to work with Valentino during the pandemic with the understanding that these are difficult times,"" the landlord's lawyer Robert Cyruli said. ""We look forward to presenting our case for damages in court.""

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has decided to appoint former Defense Minister Joaquim Silva e Luna as chief executive of state-controlled oil company Petrobras, he said in a Friday post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Roberto Castello Branco, the current CEO of the state-run oil firm known formally as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, has drawn ire from Bolsonaro for raising fuel prices despite complaints from truckers threatening to strike.
The move comes after investor concerns about political interference in the state firm triggered a 6.6% plunge for its Brazil-listed preferred shares on Friday. 
During a late Thursday announcement about lower fuel taxes, Bolsonaro made clear his dissatisfaction with Castello Branco, saying there would be changes at Petrobras ""in coming days,"" even as he reiterated that he would not ""interfere"" in the firm.
Petrobras did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company's board of directors is set to meet on Tuesday. 

The board has so far proven loyal to Castello Branco, although the majority of its members are government appointed, Reuters reported earlier in the day. One person close to the company had said its board and top executives were considering mass resignations to back the CEO's independence.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street closed near break-even on Friday as investors sold technology shares that have rallied through the pandemic and rotated into cyclical stocks set to benefit from pent-up demand once the coronavirus pandemic is subdued.
Industrials led rising sectors in the S&P 500, spurred by a 9.9% surge in Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT)'s 5.0% gain to an all-time peak of $211.40 a share. Financials, materials and energy, along with industrials, rose more than 1%. 
The S&P 1500 airlines index jumped 3.5%, with post-pandemic travel in focus.
The stay-at-home winners, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), fell in a trend seen for most of the week. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also fell, as investors sold the leaders in the big rally since last March. 
Value stocks rose 0.6% while growth fell 0.6%. Advancing stocks led declining shares by about a 2:1 ratio.
A battle continues between tech-led growth stocks and cyclicals, companies that are heavily affected by economic conditions, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
""When the economy is roaring, they're roaring. When the economy is weakening, they're weakening,"" Ghriskey said of cyclicals. ""The economy will roar, at least for a period of time. There's huge pent-up demand, whether just for travel or going back to work.""

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.47 billion shares.
Strong earnings, progress in vaccination rollouts and hopes of a $1.9 trillion federal coronavirus relief package helped U.S. stock indexes hit record highs at the start of the week. 
The Dow hit an all-time intraday peak, led by Caterpillar, after Deere raised its 2021 earnings forecast. Deere reported profit more than doubled in the first quarter on rising demand for farm and construction machinery.
The benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted their first weekly declines this month on concerns over higher stock market valuations, and expectations of rising inflation led to fears of a short-term pullback in equities. 
For the week, the Dow rose 0.1% while the S&P 500 fell 0.7% and the Nasdaq slid 1.6% as big tech sold off.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) expects a more than 10% pullback in stocks, which are trading at more than 22 times 12-month forward earnings, the most expensive since the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat, after hitting an record intraday high of 31,647.53. The S&P 500 was down 0.20%, while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.1%. 
The rise in government bond yields has turned investors off consumer staples and utilities, commonly used as a bond proxy given the sector’s steady dividends.
Industrials were up more than 1% following a 10% surge in Deere (NYSE:DE). The heavy equipment maker reported fourth-quarter earnings that were markedly above analyst estimates, driven by improving conditions in the farm and construction sectors.
The backdrop of positive vaccine news, which has also played a role in galvanizing rates, has continued to support cyclical corners of the market like airlines.  
Airlines also supported the move higher in industrials on hopes travel demand could return sooner than expected following a positive update on the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine.
The Covid-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) was 85% effective after just the first dose, according to the latest findings from Israeli health-care workers published in The Lancet medical journal. The companies also submitted data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to request their vaccine be stored at a regular freezer temperature. Still, it wasn't all positive news on the vaccine front as officials reported the cold snap that swept across the U.S. had delayed vaccine roll outs.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) rallied on the day.
The broader value sector of the market, which includes industrials, was also supported by upbeat economic data showing services activity was beginning to emerge from its Covid-led slumber.   
The February preliminary reading for Markit U.S. services PMI was 58.9, above the 58.0 expected, and the highest since March 2015.
Technology turned negative as weakness in big tech offset a climb semiconductor stocks thanks to a rally in Applied Materials.
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) jumped 7% after the semiconductor equipment market delivered a fourth-quarter earnings beat, and upbeat guidance.  
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were lower. 
In other tech news, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is reportedly weighing the sale of Watson, its artificial intelligence business. Its shares were down more than 1% on the day.

Aireon and L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) announced in November a new partnership with the FAA giving the agency broad access to Aireon’s real-time air traffic surveillance Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data.
The FAA said on Friday that ""Aireon is providing the agency with ADS-B flight data for all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.""

481,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 02:25PM ET</span>",Packaged food giants push direct online sales to gauge consumer tastes,"By Siddharth Cavale and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Packaged food giants including Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC),  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) and Kellogg (NYSE:K) are pushing sales of their products to consumers directly via their own online channels, in a quest to gather more data about shoppers' purchasing habits. 
Velveeta-cheese maker Kraft Heinz saw its e-commerce sales double in 2020, now representing more than 5% of its global sales, Chief Executive Miguel Patricio said at the virtual Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference this week.
The company sells Heinz baked beans and tomato soup by subscription or in bundles directly to consumers on a ""Heinz To Home"" website in the United Kingdom, Australia and Europe. 
Sales on the site are ""giving us valuable insights into consumer behavior, enabling us to quickly test and learn from innovations,"" Kraft's head of international business, Rafael de Oliveira, said at the conference.
Kraft would continue to use the site as a channel to generate strong sales in developed markets, he said.
The company also counts sales of its products through marketplaces such as on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).com as part of its e-commerce sales.
U.S. shoppers spent on average $1,271 buying groceries online last year, 45% more than they did in 2019 as the pandemic spurred shopping online, according to market research firm Earnest Research. In contrast, the average dollars spent in stores rose only about 7% to $3,849.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) sells products including Doritos, Quaker oats and Gatorade directly to consumers through two websites, pantryshop.com and snacks.com, both launched in 2020. 
Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said that more than 45% of the company's capital investments over the next few years would be dedicated toward manufacturing capacity, automation, and a ""ramping up of investments in our e-commerce channel.""
As major online retailers including Amazon.com and Walmart.com continue to gather valuable data on shoppers, many packaged food manufacturers are keen to gather their own data on shoppers, too. 
""COVID (has) simply accelerated our digital growth and has provided us with yet another source of data and insight,"" Monica McGurk, chief growth officer at breakfast cereal maker  Kellogg Co. , told the conference. 
Kellogg, producer of Corn Flakes as well as Pringles chips, said on Wednesday it had launched a direct-to-consumer website focused on digestive wellness. The group plans to sell its new Mwell Microbiome Powder for gut health via the site to gather data on customer interest before it launches the product more widely. 
E-commerce sales have doubled in the past year and now represent about 8.5% of the group's $13.77 billion in annual sales, Kellogg said.
Pillsbury dough-maker General Mills also sees the benefits of tracking consumer habits more closely.
""We're aggressively investing in data and analytics. We are gathering unparalleled insights from the first-party data we collect through our brand websites,” General Mills' Chief Executive Jeffrey Harmening said at the conference. 
On its Bettycrocker.com website, General Mills provides hundreds of recipes using Betty Crocker cake mixes and frosting. The site leads people to the closest store or an online retailer where they can purchase the products, thereby generating data for General Mills on what a particular customer from a certain zip code is buying. The company does not sell the food products directly on its website.
Consumers, however, may have to shell out more if they shop directly from brand websites. 
Prices on the two PepsiCo sites, for example, were generally higher than those on Walmart.com or Amazon.com, Reuters checks show. On Walmart.com, for example, a 10 oz pack of Doritos Nacho Cheese was on sale for $2.50 compared to $4.29 on Pepsico’s website.
Kraft Heinz offers tins of soup, beans, pasta and baby food bundled into packs ranging from six to 25 items and costing between 10 and 20 pounds ($14.01-$28.03) on its UK website. It told Reuters the relatively higher prices of items and bundling of packs than on some other online marketplaces was to be able to eke out a margin after including delivery costs.
""Longer term, we see real value in this channel to be an insight and data channel for us,"" Jean-Philippe Nier, head of e-commerce for Kraft Heinz's business in the UK and Ireland, told Reuters. People are more prepared to order directly from manufacturers than they were before. The time is now.""

482,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 02:11PM ET</span>",Major U.S. airlines will voluntarily collect international contact tracing info,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines on Friday said they would adopt a voluntary international contact tracing program, months after the White House under then-President Donald Trump blocked a mandatory effort.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United Airlines and other major airlines said they had committed to collecting contact tracing data from passengers traveling into the United States and to relaying that data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) if travelers provide information.
In August, Trump officials rejected an effort to require airlines to collect contact tracing information from U.S.-bound international passengers after some senior administration officials cited privacy concerns, Reuters reported.
Major airlines and administration officials had held talks for months over a long-standing CDC effort to mandate the collection and reporting of tracing information from international passengers.
In February 2020, the CDC issued an interim final rule to require airlines to collect five contact data elements from international passengers, including phone numbers, and electronically submit them to Customs and Border Protection to facilitate contact tracing. But the rule was never enforced.
Airlines protested, arguing they could not provide such information, especially from passengers booking tickets through third-party websites. Airlines backed setting up a website and a mobile application for passengers to send contact information directly to the CDC.
Nick Calio, who heads airline trade association Airlines for America, said airlines were hopeful the voluntary effort and COVID-19 international passenger testing requirements adopted last month by the CDC ""will lead policymakers to lift travel restrictions.""
President Joe Biden in January reimposed an entry ban on nearly all non-U.S. travelers who have recently been in Brazil, the United Kingdom, Ireland and 26 countries in Europe that allow travel across open borders that Trump had sought to end - and quickly added South Africa to the list.
There is no immediate indication the CDC will move quickly to drop those restrictions, some of which have been in place for almost a year.

Investing.com – The Dow eased from record highs Friday, as tech gave up gains but cyclicals like industrials supported the broader market, as Deere (NYSE:DE) rallied on blowout earnings, while airlines racked up gains following positive vaccine news that stoked hopes for a quicker reopening.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, or 58 points, and had hit a record intraday high of 31,647.53. The S&P 500 was down 0.09%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1%. 
Industrials were up more than 2% following a 10% surge in Deere. The heavy equipment maker reported fourth-quarter earnings that were markedly above analyst estimates, driven improving conditions in the farm and construction sectors.
Airlines also supported the move higher in industrials on hopes travel demand could return sooner than expected following a positive update on the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine.
The Covid-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) was 85% effective after just the first dose, according to the latest findings from Israeli health-care workers published in The Lancet medical journal. The companies also submitted data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to request their vaccine be stored at regular freezer temperature. Still, it wasn't all positive news on the vaccine front as officials reported the cold snap that swept across the U.S. had delayed vaccine roll outs.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) rallied on the day.
The broader value sector of the market, which includes industrials, was also supported by upbeat economic data showing services activity was beginning to gather pace.  
The February preliminary reading for Markit U.S. services PMI was 58.9, above the 58.0 expected, and the highest since March 2015.
Technology turned negative as weakness in big tech offset a climb semiconductor stocks thanks to a rally in Applied Materials.
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) jumped 7% after the semiconductor equipment market delivered a fourth-quarter earnings beat, and upbeat guidance.  
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were lower. 
In other tech news, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is reportedly weighing the sale of Watson, its artificial intelligence business. Its shares were down more than 1% on the day.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), meanwhile, rose 1% after it reported a beat on the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter, driven by pandemic-fueled demand."
484,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>","Mexico pressing ahead with GMO corn, glyphosate bans, says key official","By David Alire Garcia
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico is sticking to a plan to stop importing genetically modified corn and a ban on a widely used herbicide, a senior official told Reuters, doubling down on a policy that has pleased green advocates but alarmed industry leaders.
The plan announced late last year by executive order aims to replace some 16 million tonnes of yellow corn imported mostly from U.S. farmers and nearly all of it genetically modified, with new, local production by 2024. The imports represent more than a third of the country's demand for the grain, and mostly feed Mexico's large livestock industry.
Victor Suarez, the deputy agriculture minister and a key architect of the order, argued that GMO corn and the herbicide glyphosate are too dangerous and that local output and sustainable ""agroecological"" practices must be prioritized.
Hi cited studies linking glyphosate to cancer and saying that it harmed pollinators like bees and separately alleged that GMO corn contaminates Mexico's native strains of the grain.
 Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN), one of the main producers of glyphosate, has said decades of studies have shown that the substance is safe for human use. 
Backers of GMO crops, including corn, argue that they have dramatically boosted farmer productivity and that studies have shown no ill effects on humans.
""We are moving in this direction, and this must be clear: No one should think that they can bet that this decree will not be implemented,"" said Suarez, an agronomist and long-time ally of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has pledged to wean Mexico off its dependence on foreign supplies.
If it does take effect, the end of GMO corn imports would be a heavy blow in particular to the mostly American farmers who for years have relied on Mexico as their top export market. 
He described GMO corn and glyphosate as ""undesirable and unnecessary"" to reach the government's goal of making Mexico self-sufficient in food.
""We have to put the right to life, the right to health, the right to a healthy environment ahead of economic and business (interests),"" said the former congressman, who also manages Lopez Obrador's direct cash-payment program for some 2.3 million smallhold farmers with a budget of 13.5 billion pesos ($662 million) this year.
Critics counter that the self-sufficiency plan's local production goals are wildly unrealistic and would lead to higher consumer prices.
Mexico is mostly self-sufficient in white corn, used for the country's staple tortillas, but meat producers have for years relied on growing volumes of yellow corn imports to fatten cows, pigs and chickens.
Asked if the Dec. 31 decree applied to animal feed as well processed foods that include GMO corn, Suarez said that the law covers all food that ""will eventually reach human consumption.""
While Suarez sees no need to modify the decree, which he acknowledged will be difficult to carry out, he did leave open the possibility that as the 2024 deadline approaches, the government could show some flexibility.
""Let's say we don't reach the goal of substituting the 16 million tonnes (of imports), and we only reach the substitution of 10 million,"" he said.
""Well, we would evaluate that along the way and we could eventually make the necessary adjustment,"" he added, providing a strand of hope to those in the industry hoping moderate voices in the government will prevail. 
Suarez noted that over the past couple years domestic corn production grew by about 7%, as the government seeks to boost farmer productivity. Local output, however, would need to increase by nearly 60% to make up for present import volumes.

He also cited ongoing research into alternatives to glyphosate, but did not name specific products.

After administration of 13.8 million doses of the Pfizer/ BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccines to the U.S. population, most reports indicated non-serious side effects of the type that had been expected, such as headaches and fatigue. No deaths have been attributed to the vaccines, the data showed. 
The CDC collected data between Dec. 14, 2020 and Jan. 13, 2021 from both an existing national surveillance system for adverse events and its own safety monitoring system established for COVID-19 vaccines. 
During that time, 6,994 reports of adverse events after vaccination were recorded in the national surveillance system with 90.8% of them classified as non-serious and 9.2% as serious. 
Rare cases of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction requiring medical attention, were reported with both vaccines at a rate of 4.5 cases per million doses administered, down from the agency's previously reported rate of 5 per million doses administered. 
""Healthcare providers and vaccine recipients can be reassured about the safety of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines,"" the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

A total of 113 deaths were reported and available information, including from death certificates and autopsy reports, found no causal link between COVID-19 vaccination and fatalities, CDC said.

During Thursday's hearing, several lawmakers had raised concerns on whether large market makers had taken advantage of retail investors and if they could pose a threat to the financial system.
Griffin had pushed back against those questions, saying that Citadel Securities, which executes roughly 47% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, had worked for years to help give consumers ""a better price."" 
A market maker is a broker or dealer who holds a certain amount of securities at hand to facilitate trading, competing for orders by giving buy and sell price quotations, then filling orders rapidly either from its own inventory or an offsetting order.
The retail investor-led rally in heavily shorted stocks earlier this year has raised scrutiny on the information market makers can collect from the order flow. 
""There's been a number of misperceptions about the data that we receive from the retail brokerage community. In fact, a prominent U.S. Senator asked us specifically about what personal identifying information do we receive from retail investors. The answer is none,"" Griffin told CNBC.
Friday's interview allowed Griffin to clear the air after he got cut off repeatedly on Thursday by lawmakers who demanded quick, clear responses. 

""This conspiracy theory that we somehow or another are like some of the big tech giants that have access to personal identifying information is just flat out false,"" he said on Friday.

The SEC temporarily suspended trading of Marathon Group Corp, Affinity Beverage Group Inc, and Sylios Corp beginning on Friday and ending on March 4, the SEC said in statements published on its website.
The suspensions are the latest effort by the SEC to address soaring retail investor interest driven by conversation on social media platforms, most notably seen in a surge and subsequent plunge in share prices of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). Last week, the regulator suspended trading in a defunct stock.
Volatile trading in so-called ""meme stocks,"" assets which draw sudden interest from retail investors amid discussion on social media platforms, has left both hedge funds and retail investors nursing steep losses in recent weeks. The market tumult has drawn the scrutiny of federal and state regulators as well as U.S. lawmakers, who on Thursday grilled executives from online broker Robinhood, market maker Citadel Securities and hedge funds.
In each of three separate statements detailing Friday's trading suspensions, the SEC said ""certain social media accounts may be engaged in a coordinated attempt to artificially influence"" share prices. 
The SEC has been looking at the actions of any and all participants involved in the recent trading. Potential misconduct the SEC is probing, according to its acting chair, includes: market manipulation; whether retail brokers breached fair access rules by restricting buying; the role of hedge funds with short positions in the companies, including whether there was enough data and transparency around their bets; and whether the companies took advantage of the rally to raise funds.

All three securities suspended on Friday saw sudden increases in their share prices and volumes in the absence of any publicly available news, the regulator said. The SEC further cautioned brokers and other dealers to make sure they have complied with investor protection rules when trading resumes.

Shares surged to an all-time high.
Net income for fiscal 2021 is forecast at $4.6 billion to $5 billion, the Moline, Illinois-based producer said in a statement Friday. That compares with the $3.6 billion to $4 billion that Deere forecast in November, and the $4.06 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
After a trade war and pandemic disruptions, Deere is betting that American farmers are finally ready to overhaul aging fleets as grain prices reach multiyear highs and agricultural profits soar amid a flood of government aid. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economist David Oppedahl called the agricultural outlook “the rosiest in years” based on a survey of bankers.
“Our results were aided by outstanding performance across our business lineup and improving conditions in the farm and construction sectors,” Chief Executive Officer John May said in the statement.
For the fiscal year ended in November, net income was $2.75 billion.
The manufacturer has set a high bar for performance going into 2021, with its shares jumping 55% last year, the most since 2007. Improving farm fundamentals and sentiment will help drive double-digit revenue growth at Deere in 2021, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which also cautioned that supply-chain disruptions and rising costs remain risks.
Competitor AGCO Corp. earlier this month forecast 2021 adjusted earnings per share that beat the average analyst estimate, with the company saying it sees North American margins increasing for the year.
Deere shares rose as much as 10% to a record $330.25. The stock was up 9.4% at 9:49 a.m. in New York.

493,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 09:54AM ET</span>",Barrick to ‘Step Back’ From Freeport After Copper Gain,"(Bloomberg) -- Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) Corp. says the window has closed on a potential deal with Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc., given the run-up in copper prices and recent comments from the world’s largest publicly traded producer of the industrial metal.
Barrick had engaged in conversations with Freeport in an effort to boost its exposure to copper, Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said Thursday in an interview. Talks were “both remote and direct,” he said, without indicating when they took place or if they were focused on a potential corporate tie-up or asset deals.
A surge in copper prices to eight-year highs has pushed up valuations of producers of the metal used in wiring, with Freeport’s stock nearly tripling in the past 12 months. Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson also dismissed a merger of equals in October as the Phoenix-based company pushed ahead with retooling its massive copper-and-gold flagship mine in Indonesia. Barrick indicated in 2019 that any tie-up with Freeport would have to be friendly.
The messaging from Freeport and its stock performance is “very clear,” according to Bristow. “That’s the market and that’s what happens, so we’ll step back and maybe there’ll be other opportunities.”
For now, Toronto-based Barrick is focused on boosting its exposure to copper by developing its own assets. The company sees copper as a “strategic” commodity underpinned by electrification and one that’s compatible with gold from a production perspective, he said.
“I was very outspoken on the opportunity the copper industry offered back just two years ago,” Bristow said. “If we had managed to pull one of those opportunities off it would have been fantastic for us looking back.”
Barrick has shown it can build its own gold-copper mines and the run-up in prices has strengthened its existing copper portfolio, Bristow said. He also sees more consolidation ahead in gold, with Barrick keen and able to participate thanks to a strong balance sheet.
Still, with gold near what Bristow sees as the top of the cycle, mergers and acquisitions come with “substantial risk” and require “a lot of careful strategy to be able to be effective and not look back from a deal that cost you too much money.

494,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 09:52AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Higher as Yellen Comments Support Risk Appetite; Dow up 33 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened on higher on Friday and were on course to end the week in positive territory, after comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and strong earnings from diverse companies offered an antidote to weak labor market data on Thursday.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33 points, or 0.1% at 31,526 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
The moves came against a background of ever bolder ""reflation"" trades, as comments by Yellen to CNBC again encouraged investors to move out of long-dated bonds and into equities. The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose as high as 2.11%, while the 10-year note yield again tested a 12-month high of 1.33%.
Yellen had again stressed the importance of delivering both fiscal and monetary stimulus in large measure, in view of the sustained high level of unemployment and hardship due to the pandemic
“Inflation has been very low for over a decade, and you know it’s a risk, but it’s a risk that the Federal Reserve and others have tools to address,” she told CNBC. “The greater risk is of scarring the people, having this pandemic take a permanent lifelong toll on their lives and livelihoods.”
Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock surged another 10%, still enjoying the afterglow of an endorsement from star fund manager Cathie Wood earlier in the week. Wood's influence is, for now, more than offsetting any downward pressure from the end of the post-IPO lockup for Palantir's longer-term shareholders, which kicks in today.
Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) also rose 10% after the maker of farm and other heavy machinery said its profit in the first quarter of its fiscal year was more than double analysts' forecasts and forecast a sharp improvement in its operating environment in the course of the year. Deere stock has now nearly doubled since last July.
Mining stocks were also well supported as the reflation trade translated into a bet on industrial metals. Copper Futures topped $4 a pound for the first time in 10 years, pushing Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX) stock up 8.4%, and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) and Antofagasta (OTC:ANFGF) ADRs both by more than 3%.
On the downside,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock was unable to capitalize on news that its vaccine can be stored in normal freezers without losing efficacy - something that should reduce concerns about the problems of distributing it and broaden its appeal to the world's healthcare systems, in an increasingly crowded vaccine space.  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose 4.6%, by contrast, after snaring a massive supply deal for its Covid-19 vaccine."

LONDON (Reuters) - A strong start for world equities in 2021 after the fastest bear-to-bull market switch last year has prompted market mavens to flag worries about pricey assets, with BofA calling it the ""mother-of-all asset bubbles"".
The torrent of cash sloshing around world markets due to the unprecedented stimulus measures in place to fuel economies coming out of the pandemic-led recession has fed into the euphoric rush to equities, particularly Big Tech.
The U.S. Federal Reserve for instance has been purchasing bonds at a record pace, doubling its balance sheet to nearly $8 trillion in less than a year. During the same period, the five biggest tech stocks have seen their market value double.
As financial assets worth $1.1 billion are gobbled up by global central banks every hour, there is irrational exuberance on Wall Street, according to BofA.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Chief Executive David Solomon and strategists at some major investment banks have since January been warning about stock market volatility, particularly in the immediate future.
Most traditional market-top signals have been flashing amber - just as they did before the bursting of the dotcom bubble two decades ago. But what's different this time is that interest rates look firmly stapled to the floor for years to come.
Ten-year yields on bonds of G7 countries are hovering near record lows, lending credence to ""bubble"" naysayers and captured in the hefty 'equity risk premium' (ERP) relative to historical averages.
""You're practically 'forced' to move into riskier assets,"" said Jeroen Blokland, a portfolio manager at Robeco, adding that outside the United States, things look even less bubbly.
The benchmark U.S. S&P 500 is now the most expensive developed market index based on the price-to-earnings ratio, trading at levels last seen during the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s.
Though Blokland sees rising odds that markets globally end up in a bubble, he said the upcoming cash injections and fiscal spending could further support asset prices.
Some data points below signal higher odds of a bubble:
1/ PARTYING LIKE IT'S 1999
Sitting at 22-times 12-month forward earnings, the S&P 500 is trading well above its long-term average of just 16x. Other major indexes are also trading above long-term averages, but are still far from S&P's extreme levels.
(Graphic: Global stock valuations surge well above long term averages: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/yzdvxwaonpx/Pasted%20image%201613736119174.png)
2/ BURSTING CALLS, FALLING PUTS
The frenzy is also visible in options markets. The CBOE put-to-call ratio has been pinned at near 20-year lows for eight months now, at levels last seen just before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. Put options confer the right to sell at a pre-agreed price and calls allow holders to buy.

3/ LAST CHANCE TO BUY?
Super-low bond yields leave equities attractive for investors navigating between the two asset classes, and that's captured by the still hefty ERP relative to historical averages.
(Graphic: Table on Equity Risk Premium for G7 and China: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznvnojdxpl/Table%20on%20Equity%20Risk%20Premium%20for%20G7%20and%20China.png)
4/ BUBBLY BIG TECH 
While the reflation trade drives gains in small cap stocks, which fell heavily last year, interest in tech stocks hasn't abated. That's built a concentration risk in markets as the sector expands to make up a fifth of all global stocks - the highest since the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s.
(Graphic:Concentration risk in world stocks? Tech dominates: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/jbyvrdxjnve/Pasted%20image%201613737694920.png)
5/ TAKE THE M2, ENJOY THE BUY RIDE
Another indicator is the extent of central bank liquidity support in the system. M2, a measure of money supply that takes into account cash and deposits, jumped sharply last year spawning bubbles in many corners of the markets from bitcoin to high-flying tech stocks.

Meng is facing charges of bank fraud in the United States for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to violate U.S. sanctions.
She has been under house arrest in Canada since being detained at Vancouver airport in 2018 and has become one of the most high-profile figures in a trade war between China and the United States. 
In a hearing at Britain's High Court last week, her lawyers argued that the charges against her were based on a presentation she gave to a senior HSBC executive in 2013. 
The legal team said that ""an incomplete version"" of her statements in the presentation had been presented by U.S. authorities and asked the court to order the release of HSBC documents detailing the contents of the meeting.
The judge's written judgment on Friday declined Meng's application and ordered her team to pay legal costs of 80,000 pounds ($111,936).
A Huawei spokesman said: ""Huawei is disappointed by today's court ruling. The pursuit of justice benefits from access to relevant information and clarity of fact.""
An HSBC spokeswoman said: ""This application for disclosure in the UK was without merit and we are pleased that the High Court agreed with our position.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A record rush to big technology stocks saw equity funds bagging $27.8 billion inflows last week with the ongoing ultra-easy monetary policy creating the ""mother-of-all asset bubbles"", BofA said on Friday.
Global market capitalisation has risen $50 trillion, or $6.2 billion per hour, since last March, almost 10 times faster than the pace seen in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank said.
The unprecedented sums of cash thrown by policymakers into global financial markets has swept up mega-cap technology stocks to record highs as investors have chased returns on investments ranging from bitcoin to real assets.
The U.S. Federal Reserve for instance has been purchasing bonds at a record pace, doubling its balance sheet to nearly $8 trillion in less than a year. During the same period, the five biggest tech stocks have seen their market value double.
BofA expects more than a 10% pullback in stocks, which are trading at more than 22 times 12-month forward earnings -- the most expensive since the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s.
The bank's chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett said more stimulus from the U.S. government would lead to an equities ""overshoot"" and an inflation ""overshoot"", which in turn could lead to a correction in markets.
Big tech attracted a record $19 billion inflows in the last six weeks. Bond funds took in $12.6 billion in the week to Wednesday, BofA's flow data showed.
Outflows of just $300 million marked the largest drawdown in emerging markets debt since July 2020, while emerging market stock funds saw $5.3 billion inflows.
Meanwhile, surging inflation expectations have led to real assets outperforming financial assets so far in 2021, prompting investors to pour $1.2 billion into Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening slightly higher Friday, ending a subdued week on a positive tone as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen asserted the need for a substantial stimulus package to consolidate the country’s economic recovery.  
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 57 points, or 0.4%. 
Helping the mood Friday were comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen after the close Thursday. She stated that $1.9 trillion in pandemic-relief spending is still needed, despite recent strong economic data, citing the continued weakness in the labor market, as U.S. jobless claims hit a four-week high.
“The price of doing too little is much larger than the price of doing something big,” she said, on CNBC Thursday.
The Biden administration’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief package could come to a vote in the House of Representatives next week, according to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The stock market’s recent rally has stagnated this week amid concerns of rising U.S. Treasury yields. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are down 0.5% and 1.6% this week, respectively, on track to break their two-week winning streak, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is largely unchanged.
There’s not much on the calendar for Friday in terms of government economic data or earnings, but Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is likely to be in the spotlight after the ride-hailing company lost a U.K. Supreme Court ruling, threatening the company’s business model in its largest European market. Its drivers now have to be classified as “workers” and thus be entitled to rights like minimum wage, holiday pay and rest breaks.  The company has already effectively averted a similar threat in the U.S., its most important market.
Oil prices retreated Friday from 13-month highs as wells in Texas, the U.S.’s biggest oil-producing state, resumed production once the week’s unexpected wintry snap passed.
The focus is shifting to the impact on refineries amid worries they will take time to resume operations, creating a gap in demand which will likely lead to builds in crude stocks over coming weeks.
U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week, before the freeze, with inventories down by 7.3 million barrels to their lowest level since March, the Energy Information Administration said Thursday.
U.S. crude futures traded 2% lower at $59.32 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $63.02.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,769.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.2136.

500,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>","Battling Covid collateral damage, Renault says 2021 will be volatile","By Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) said on Friday it is still fighting the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a shortage of semiconductor chips, that could make for another rough year for the French carmaker.
Renault reported an 8 billion euro ($9.7 billion) loss for 2020 which, combined with gloomy take on the market, sent its shares down more than 5% in late morning trading.
""We are in the midst of a battle to try to manage a difficult year in terms of supply chains, of components,"" Chief Executive Luca de Meo told reporters. ""This is all the collateral damage of the Covid pandemic... we will have a fairly volatile year.""
De Meo, who took over last July, is looking at ways to boost profitability and sales at Renault while pushing ahead with cost cuts. There were early signs of improving momentum as margins inched up in the second half of 2020. 
The group gave no financial guidance for this year, although it said it might reach a target of achieving 2 billion euros in costs cuts by 2023 ahead of time, possibly by December. 
Executives said they were confident the carmaker could be profitable in the second half of 2021, but that they lacked sufficient market visibility to provide a forecast.
Renault struck a cautious note, saying it was focused on its recovery but warned orders had faltered in early 2021 as pandemic restrictions continued in some countries.
The group is facing new challenges as the European Union tightens emissions regulations and after rivals PSA and Fiat Chrysler joined forces to create Stellantis, the world's fourth-biggest automaker.
The auto industry endured a tough 2020 but a swift rebound in premium car sales in China helped companies such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) to weather the storm. 
Auto companies globally have since been hit by a shortage of semiconductors that has forced production cuts worldwide.
""The beginning of the year has shown some signs of weakness,"" De Meo told analysts, but added the chip shortage should be resolved by the second half of 2021. ""We have taken the necessary measures to anticipate and overcome challenges.""
Renault estimated the chip shortage could reduce its production by about 100,000 vehicles this year. 
SHARP HIT 
The group was already loss-making in 2019, but took a sharp hit in 2020 during lockdowns to fight the pandemic, which also hurt its Japanese partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY).
Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected a 7.4 billion euro loss for 2020. The group posted negative free cash flow for 2020. 
The 2018 arrest of Carlos Ghosn, who formerly lead the alliance between Renault and Nissan, plunged the automakers into turmoil.
In a further sign that the companies have been working to repair the alliance, De Meo told journalists that Renault and Nissan will announce new joint products together in the coming weeks or months.
Renault has begun to raise prices on some car models, and group operating profit, which was negative for 2020 as a whole, improved in the last six months of the year, reaching 866 million euros or 3.5% of revenue. 
Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said the operating performance was better than expected. Sales were still falling in the second half, but less sharply. 
Renault is slashing jobs and trimming its range of cars, allowing it to slice spending in areas like research and development as it focuses on redressing its finances. It is also pivoting more towards electric cars as part of its revamp. 
It was already struggling more than some rivals with sliding sales before the pandemic, after years of a vast expansion drive it is now trying to rein in, focusing on profitable markets. 
De Meo told journalists on Friday that the French carmaker will make three new higher-margin models at its Palencia plant in Spain, where manufacturing costs are lower, between 2022 and 2024.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Myanmar's refined fuel imports have stalled as protests over the military coup have shut banks and government offices, while a depreciation of its currency has driven up costs, five industry sources said. 
Myanmar relies heavily on gasoline and diesel imports as its refineries are too small and old to meet its fuel needs. One source said imports may make up as much as 98% of Myanmar's fuel consumption. 
""The economy is almost at a standstill. Almost all government ministries are closed,"" the source said. ""Fuel supply is running low. (The country) might run out of oil in two months."" 
Graphic: Myanmar oil costs rise after military coup causes the kyat to devalue against the U.S. dollar - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jznvnolojpl/MyanmarOilvsFX.png
Reuters was unable to reach Myanmar government officials for comment. The five sources declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the topic. 
Tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to denounce the coup that ousted the democratically elected government on Feb.1. A civil disobedience movement that calls on people not to go to work has also paralysed government, business and banking functions.
""One of the main problems is (the movement) telling people, 'Don't go to work'. So banks are shut and there's nobody there,"" another of the sources said.
The first source said banks have stopped processing payments and the customs and commerce offices that process import taxes and permits are not fully functioning.
A spokeswoman for Japan's Mizuho Bank said it has not closed its Myanmar branches or stopped operations there, although it was not clear what services it was offering. 
Oil import terminals operated by Puma Energy and PetroChina subsidiary Singapore Petroleum Company have stopped operating, although other terminals owned by local companies are still operational, the source said.
""But most don't have more shipments arriving anymore,"" he added. 
Puma Energy - whose main shareholders are commodity trader Trafigura and Sonangol Holdings - said on Feb. 10 that its terminal had been shut. PetroChina did not respond to a Reuters query on the status of its operations in Myanmar. 
LOCAL FUEL PRICES UP A THIRD 
Oil trading companies have also become more cautious in supplying fuel to Myanmar amid the political and economic upheaval and as a sharp drop in the value of the local currency helped to drive up importers' costs. 
The kyat has lost 6.5% against the U.S. dollar since the start of February, Refinitiv data showed, and local gasoline and diesel prices have risen by about a third since end-January.
Myanmar's oil importers used to be given credit terms of up to 90 days by having their banks issue letters of credit (LCs), but fuel suppliers are no longer accepting LCs from Myanmar companies, the sources said. 
They have instead asked for telegraphic payment in advance, the sources said, although this is not possible without banks.
One source said they were trying to look for sources of U.S. dollar offshore from people who are willing to accept Myanmar kyats in Myanmar.

""Until banks open it's not easy for anyone to perform their trades,"" a fourth source said.

The move to sell Ulster Bank is the latest by NatWest CEO Alison Rose to strip out costs and simplify the lender since taking the helm in late 2019, after cutting back trading unit NatWest Markets and axing digital venture Bó just months after its launch.
Ulster Bank has served customers in Ireland for more than 160 years and is the country's third largest lender with a 20 billion euro loan book and 2,800 staff.
The decision follows a months-long review and sparked immediate criticism in Ireland, where the government and regulators have expressed concerns over shrinking banking competition.
Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Friday the banking landscape would be poorer as a result of NatWest's decision.
""I won't say the Irish government welcomes this decision, they do not. But it is supportive of the plans to dispose parts of the business to AIB and the discussions we're having with Permanent TSB,"" NatWest chairman Howard Davies told reporters.
Rose said the exit - which does not cover NatWest's Northern Irish unit - would take a number of years and would be done ""in a very considered way"".
NatWest shares were up 1% at 9.48 GMT, after initially rising as much as 2.5% in early trading. 
""Alison Rose is making a name for herself as a no-nonsense leader, keeping the core business healthy by adding to its core business and chopping off the gangrenous limbs,"" said Freetrade senior analyst Dan Lane.
""That ruthless streak will serve her well in a year that's likely to be even harder than the last.""
PROFIT SQUEEZE
Despite posting a loss, NatWest announced it would pay a dividend of 3 pence per share, after the Bank of England gave lenders the green light to resume investor payouts.
The bank remains 62% taxpayer-owned as a legacy of its state bailout in the 2007-09 financial crisis, meaning the government will receive 225 million pounds of the overall 364 million pound pot.
It pledged to increase shareholder returns in future years by distributing at least 800 million pounds per year from next year up until 2023.
British banks' profits have all been squeezed by near-zero central bank interest rates and a spike in expected loan defaults due to the pandemic.
But unlike rival  Barclays  (LON:BARC), which reported robust profits on Thursday, NatWest could not count on a surge in revenues at its own much smaller investment bank NatWest Markets to prop up its earnings.
Overall, NatWest's impairment charges for expected bad loans came in at 3.2 billion pounds for 2020, below the bank's guidance of a minimum 3.5 billion pounds.
The lender has granted around 14 billion pounds of state-backed loans to struggling companies so far in the pandemic.
It maintained one of the strongest capital ratios among its peers, up to 18.3%.
The bank said by 2023 it would aim to reduce its capital buffer to 13-14%, hit a return on tangible equity of 9-10% and reduce costs by 4% a year. 
Rose's pay was 1.8 million pounds, after she voluntarily gave up a quarter of her fixed pay for 2020.

(Reuters) - Euro zone shares rose on Friday as data showed factory activity in February jumped to its highest in three years, while upbeat quarterly earnings updates from companies including Hermes boosted confidence in a broader economic recovery.
The euro zone index was up 0.3%, with gains capped by another contraction in the bloc's dominant services industry due to widespread coronavirus-induced lockdowns that have hurt the hospitality sector more than factories.
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.2%, led by gains in Germany's DAX as manufacturing activity in Europe's powerhouse surged to a 36-month high.
Still, the STOXX 600 was set to end the week with modest declines, snapping a two-week gaining streak, as optimism around a better-than-expected earnings season gave way to fears that rising inflation could lead central banks to start tapering a raft of stimulus packages launched to support a recovery.
""This week's slightly adverse price action has all the hallmarks of a loss of momentum temporarily and not a structural turn,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""There is not a major central bank in the world thinking about taking their foot off the monetary spigot, except perhaps China. (Markets) will remain awash in zero percent central bank money through all of 2021 (and) a lot of that will head to the equity market.""
Minutes of the European Central Bank's January meeting, released on Thursday, showed policymakers expressed fresh concerns over the euro's strength but appeared relaxed over the recent rise in government bond yields.
The STOXX 600 has rebounded more than 50% since crashing to multi-year lows in March 2020, with hopes of a global economic rebound this year sparking demand for sectors such as energy, mining, banks and industrial goods.
Mining stocks rose 1% and were on course for their third week of gains in a row as copper prices scaled nine-year highs. 
London's FTSE 100 lagged regional bourses due to a slump in January retail sales and as the pound jumped to its highest against the dollar in nearly three years. 
In company news, Hermes surged 5.3% after the Birkin bag maker said sales recovered sharply in the fourth quarter.
The stock was among the biggest gainers on the STOXX 600 and also helped lift the European personal goods index by 0.8%.

French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) fell 3.7% after posting a record annual loss of 8 billion euros ($9.68 billion), while food group Danone and German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) rose following upbeat trading forecasts.

Shares traded at 49.61 zloty as of 9:38 a.m. in Warsaw compared with the 50 zloty issue price in its initial public offering. The company and its owners raised 1.67 billion zloty ($445 million), with Huuuge becoming Poland’s second-biggest listed gaming studio after CD Projekt SA.
The IPO drew strong interest from retail buyers, who on average got 3% of the shares they subscribed for in the listing due to high demand. Due to legal restrictions, Huuuge shares can’t be traded via most Polish brokers’ mobile apps, which may affect individual investors’ ability to buy and sell the stock.
Huuuge’s debut cements Warsaw’s status as an incubator for gaming IPOs. Most recently, People Can Fly owner PCF Group SA floated in December, while four gaming companies started trading on the market’s NewConnect platform for smaller stocks this year. Though Huuuge is registered in the U.S., most of its staff is in Poland.
Huuuge’s 56% free float upon listing may help the stock to get into the mWIG40 Index for mid-sized companies quickly, which would drive more investor flows. It could be eligible to join Poland’s main WIG20 benchmark in the future, according to Pawel Sugalski, a fund manager at Rockbridge TFI SA."

Investing.com - European stock markets were mixed Friday, with the U.K. underperforming after weak retail sales data, while investors also digested a number of corporate results, including from  Renault  and Hermes.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was 0.1% lower.
British retail sales slumped in January, falling 8.2% on the month, as non-essential shops went back into lockdowns. This was the second largest fall on record after the drop in April 2020, at the start of the pandemic, and indicative of the damage Britain’s service-based economy is suffering.
The economic news wasn’t all bad, as German economic activity expanded for an eighth month, with manufacturing growing at the fastest pace in three years, according to IHS Markit.
French factories also reported the quickest expansion since early 2018, though the private-sector economy shrank overall.
In corporate news, Renault (PA:RENA) stock fell 3.2% after the French carmaker posted a record annual loss of 8 billion euros ($9.68 billion), CEO Luca de Meo also said that """"2021 is set to be difficult given the unknowns regarding the health crisis as well as electronic components supply shortages.""
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock rose 2.2% to its highest in over a year, after a report saying it's looking at spinning off its most valuable brand, Porsche, to unlock value.
Hermes International (OTC:HESAF) stock rose 5.8% after the luxury goods maker said sales recovered sharply in the fourth quarter, in a sharp contrast to rival Kering  (OTC:PPRUY), which reported disappointed sales at its flagship brand Gucci earlier this week.
In the insurance sector, Allianz (DE:ALVG) stock rose 0.9% after the German insurer posted a better-than-expected 2.2% fall in net profit in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) stock was largely flat despite the reinsurer recording a net loss for 2020. 
Attention may also be drawn to a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven leaders, chaired by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The leaders, who will include both U.S. President Joe Biden and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi for the first time, are expected to discuss the battered world economy as well as the group’s relationship with China, along with plans to defeat the novel coronavirus, .
Oil prices retreated Friday from 13-month highs: wells in Texas, the U.S.’s biggest oil-producing state, have started to resume production as the week’s unexpected wintry snap passed. The focus is shifting to the impact on refineries amid worries they will take time to resume operations, creating a gap in demand which will likely lead to builds in crude stocks over coming weeks.
U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week, before the freeze, with inventories down by 7.3 million barrels to their lowest level since March, the Energy Information Administration said Thursday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $59.42 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $63.03.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,773.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2128.

Investors purchased $26.5 billion in equity funds last week, marking a tenth straight month of net buying in equity funds, Refinitiv Lipper data showed.

Global bond funds also attracted about $19.5 billion, helped by heavy inflows into shorter-dated bonds and inflation-linked debt.
Investors poured some $5.7 billion into funds that invest in U.S. short-term and medium-term bonds, or bonds maturing between 1-5 years, the data showed. Funds investing in inflation-linked bonds, which are structured to provide protection against rising inflation, lured about $1.1 billion.

Meanwhile, some investors stuck to their holdings in energy funds due to a recent rise in oil prices, driven by a historic freeze in the south of the United States which has hit production.Energy funds saw their lowest investment outflow in 8 weeks in the week ending Feb. 17, but precious metal funds had their second consecutive week of outflows.
Funds investing in the technology and healthcare sectors led equity inflows. Investors poured $6.98 billion into tech funds, followed by $1.12 billion into healthcare funds during the week, data for 1,170 tech funds and 861 healthcare funds, based on Lipper's sector classification, showed.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen mixed at the open Friday, amid cautious trading with investors focusing on corporate earnings, mainly from the insurance sector, ahead of key PMI economic data.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
The moves follow a weak session in the U.S. on Thursday, as valuation concerns resurfaced against the backdrop of a surprise rise in weekly jobless claims.
In the insurance sector, Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) will be in the spotlight after the reinsurer recorded a net loss for 2020 as pandemic-related charges weighed upon its earnings. 
Allianz (DE:ALVG) posted a better-than-expected 2.2% fall in net profit in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, with the German insurer noting pressure on business from the coronavirus pandemic.
In France,  Renault  (PA:RENA) reported a record 8 billion euro ($9.68 billion) loss for 2020 as the pandemic hit sales and production at the carmaker and its Japanese partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY). Elsewhere in the industry, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) remains well supported after a report saying it's looking at spinning off its most valuable brand, Porsche, to unlock value.
The economic calendar is also busy Friday, with U.K. retail sales slumping 8.2% on the month in January, a far sharper drop than expected, while German PPI climbed 1.4% in the same month, better than expected.
Later in the session the final PMI data for the European region will be released, which are expected to confirm a weakening of business confidence in January as the lockdowns to combat the Covid-19 virus were in place.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks pulled back from all-time peaks on Friday as higher longer-dated bond yields and underwhelming U.S. data dented investor confidence in a faster economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, while gold hit a seven-month trough.
Europe's eurostoxx 50 futures and Germany's DAX futures were both up 0.2%, while futures for London's FTSE were barely changed. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were slightly lower. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan was last down 0.1% at 733.9 from a record high of 745.89 touched on Thursday. 
The index is on track for a small weekly loss after two consecutive weeks of gains. 
Since the start of the year, the index has surged nearly 10.5%, largely led by easy monetary and fiscal policies around the world and initial rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines.
On Friday, Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index finished 1.3% down while Japan's Nikkei fell 0.7%. 
Chinese shares, which started the day in the red, recouped losses with the blue-chip CSI300 up 0.2%.
""It’s kind of odd to think that only a year ago investors were worried about depression and deflation and now they are worried about overheating and inflation,"" said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based economist for AMP (OTC:AMLTF).
""The big picture backdrop of still low underlying inflation and spare capacity in jobs markets, combined with economic and profit recovery and low interest rates is a positive one for growth assets, particularly shares,"" he added.
Core bond yields have pushed higher globally led by the so-called ""reflation trade"" where investors wager on a pick-up in growth and inflation. Growing momentum for coronavirus vaccine programmes and hopes of massive fiscal spending under U.S. President Joe Biden have spurred reflation trades. 
Germany’s 10-year yield on Thursday posted its highest close since June, British 10-year yields traded at a 10-month top of 0.65% and U.S. Treasury yields are hovering near one-year highs around 1.3%, a large factor supporting the U.S. dollar.
Rising bond yields hurt the appeal of gold, with spot prices hitting a seven-month low of $1,759.3 an ounce on Friday. [GOL/]
While rising yields weighed on investor sentiment, ""disappointing U.S. jobless figures didn't help the cause, either,"" said Rodrigo Catril, forex strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY).
An unexpected increase in the number of Americans seeking jobless benefits weighed heavily on the outlook. The Labor Department reported initial unemployment claims rose by 13,000 to 861,000, injecting scepticism about how quickly the U.S. economy could rebound from the global pandemic.
Further, U.S. housing starts fell 6.0% in January, the first decline in five months.
On Wall Street, the Dow fell 0.38%, the S&P 500 lost 0.44%, and the Nasdaq Composite 0.72%.
In currencies, the dollar was steady with its index at 90.511. 
The British pound held near its highest in over three years at $1.3983 led by the country's successful vaccine programme which has seen 16.5 million people already inoculated. It is on track for a sixth straight weekly rise. 
The euro is poised for a small weekly loss. The single currency was last at $1.2098. 
The risk sensitive Australian dollar was on track for a third straight weekly rise, last trading at $0.7787. 
In commodities, oil markets saw some profit-taking following days of gains that were driven by a deep freeze across Texas that weighed on production. [O/R]

Hachigo will remain on the company board, Japan's second-biggest automaker by sales said in a statement.
Mibe, 59, joined Honda in 1987, with stints in engine development and the drivetrain business. He became the president of Honda's R&D unit in 2019, working with Hachigo to push through structural reforms.
Mibe's appointment, first reported by Reuters this week, comes as Honda races to catch up in the field of all-electric cars and faces competition from new entrants and tech giants such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Traditionally known for its fuel-efficient internal-combustion engines, Honda launched its first mass-produced all-battery vehicle last August. It has said it wants new-energy vehicles such as plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars to make up two-thirds of its sales by 2030.
The two executives will hold a news conference at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT).
During his six years as CEO, Hachigo sought to simplify the vehicle development process by combining some operations for cars and motorcycles. He also slashed costs by streamlining Honda's model line-up and consolidating factories at home and overseas.
Hachigo also expanded a partnership with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to include cooperation in developing electric and autonomous vehicles. 

To focus on zero-emission technology, Honda last year said it would stop participating as an engine supplier in the FIA Formula One World Championship at the end of the 2021 season.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Thursday named Marian Croak, one of its few Black executives, to oversee research on responsible artificial intelligence (AI) after weeks of internal anger over its firing of a prominent Black scientist.
Google confirmed Croak will manage 10 teams, including a dozen scientists studying the ethical considerations of automated technologies known as AI. Ethical AI co-lead Timnit Gebru said in December that Google abruptly fired her for contesting company orders.
Employees for weeks have expressed concern that Gebru's critiques of Google led to unfair punishment, and Croak has been among executives trying to broker a way forward between staff and management.
Croak, a vice president of engineering who will report to Google AI chief Jeff Dean, told employees in a Thursday meeting that she respected Gebru and that what happened to her was unfortunate.
In a video on Google's blog, she also acknowledged dissent in the research areas now in her purview. ""There's quite a lot of conflict right now within the field, and it can be polarizing at times, and what I'd like to do is just have people have the conversation in a more diplomatic way,"" she said.
Google employee Alex Hanna on Twitter called the news about Croak ""a betrayal,"" saying it occurred behind the Ethical AI team's back and did not address demands the team made after Gebru's firing.
Gebru said in a statement, ""Marian is a highly accomplished trailblazing scientist that I had admired and even confided in. It's incredibly hurtful to see her legitimizing what Jeff Dean and his subordinates have done to me and my team.""

Croak, who previously was working on site reliability for Google, will also oversee teams doing research related to accessibility, social good and fairness in health algorithms.

Others include two $500 million REITs, from conglomerate-owned SM Prime and Robinsons Land, sources said.
""It is really a question of when, not if. On the size, it depends on what the market can absorb,"" Alex Pomento, vice president for investor relations of SM Prime, told Reuters.
A long-pending $1.5 billion IPO from  National Grid  (LON:NG) Corp of the Philippines (NGCP) to comply with regulatory requirements is also expected, though sources said the process could be pushed to next year.
Robinsons Land did not respond to a request for comment. NGCP declined to comment while calls to Monde Nissin were unanswered.
Issuers are keen to take advantage of the abundant market liquidity and tap investors before next year's presidential elections that could create market volatility.
""Companies are willing to fund expansion. That is what we did not experience last year when a lot of them held back on expansion plans, borrowing and IPOs,"" said Michael Gerard Enriquez, CIO of Sun Life of Canada (Philippines).
The economy slumped by a record 9.5% last year, the worst contraction in Southeast Asia for 2020, as Philippines enforced one of the world's longest and strictest pandemic-induced lockdowns.
The government's record $93.7 billion national budget is expected to pump-prime the economy, which is targeted to grow by 6.5-7.5% this year, government officials say.
A strong performance of IPOs launched last year is also supporting new issues despite the broader market falling 9% last year.
""I assume these will be well-received. They will be a play on high growth and consumption and economic dividends,"" said Eduardo Francisco, president of BDO Capital and Investment Corp, referring to potential IPOs of Monde Nissin and NGCP.
This year, about four property units are set to launch REITs, an emerging asset class, after new rules announced last year allowed lower public floats and tax breaks for REITs, which typically pay higher dividends to investors.

""Given the attractiveness of REITs as an investment and the robust real estate market fundamentals in the Philippines, we are expecting to see more REIT IPOs come to the market,"" said BofA's Siah.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 10:55PM ET</span>","U.S. to unveil Nord Stream 2 pipeline report, but sanctions may take time: sources","By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is expected to name as early as Friday the companies it believes are helping build Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline, five sources said, a move that could eventually prompt sanctions on the nearly completed project. 
The State Department report to Congress, which may come on Friday, is expected to list companies the administration believes are helping to complete the natural gas pipeline that Russia's state energy company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) says is more than 90% complete. 
Sanctions law that went into effect on Jan. 1 would require the administration to sanction named companies, but President Joe Biden could take advantage of a consultation period with allies to delay imposing any measures that would quickly kill the project, said four of the sources, including three congressional aides and someone who works in industry. 
President Joe Biden believes the pipeline is a ""bad deal"" for Europe, his spokeswoman Jen Psaki has said, and many U.S. lawmakers are pushing for sanctions. But Biden has also been under pressure to allow the project from Germany, which desperately wants Russian gas as it weans itself off nuclear and coal plants. 
Biden is slated to deliver remarks at a virtual gathering of the Munich security forum on Friday. 
The White House had no immediate comment. 
The pipeline would bypass Ukraine, through which Russia has sent gas to Europe for decades, depriving it of lucrative transit fees and potentially undermining its struggle against Russian aggression. 
Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers want sanctions on the project, which has become even more politicized after Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who was poisoned in Siberia, was imprisoned by Russia this month. Some of the lawmakers also come from states producing gas that could be sold to Europe as an alternative to pipelined fuel from Russia.
Gazprom says the project with western partners to pipe Russian gas under the Baltic Sea to European customers will be finished this year. But it still requires tricky pipe-laying in deep waters off Denmark. 
The administrations of former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump opposed Nord Stream 2, believing it would increase Russian President Vladimir Putin's political and economic influence on Europe. 
The consultation clause in the sanctions law that went into effect on Jan. 1 allows a U.S. president to consult with allies for an unspecified period of time before imposing sanctions. 
""There is great concern that they will use consultation with the Hill and allies to delay strong sanctions,"" a Senate aide said. 
The Biden administration has been consulting closely with Congress on the report, said an additional administration source, who did not confirm the timing of the report. 
The notion of cooperation between the State Department and lawmakers who oppose the project was contested by the congressional sources, with one Senate aide saying it was ""grossly misleading."" 

In recent weeks, Democratic and Republican lawmakers who oppose the pipeline from both the House and the Senate have prodded the administration to impose sanctions on companies involved with its construction.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's attorney general says accusations that former U.S. President Donald Trump's interfered in Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou's extradition trial is irrelevant because he is no longer in office. 
Meng is facing charges of bank fraud in the United States over misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to violate U.S. sanctions. 
She has been under house arrest in Vancouver, Canada, since her arrest at the airport there in December 2018 and is fighting extradition in the British Columbia Supreme Court. 
In an interview with Reuters 10 days after Meng's arrest, Trump said he would intervene in the Justice Department's case against Meng if it served national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China. 
Meng's lawyers have argued that Trump's statements compromised the fairness of the extradition proceedings. 
Canadian lawyers said in documents filed ahead of hearings scheduled for next month that such an argument was ""moot"". 
""The facts on which it is based – statements by a president no longer in office, about a possible intervention in this case that never occurred, purportedly to achieve a trade deal that has long since been successfully negotiated – have no past, present or prospective impact on these proceedings."" 
A Huawei spokesman had no immediate comment. 
Meng's arrest caused tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, and soon afterward, China detained two Canadians, who continue to have limited access to legal counsel or diplomatic officials. 

Meng is set to next appear in court on March 1 for the last stage of her extradition hearings, which are scheduled to finish in May. There is an administrative hearing for her case on Friday.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Friday morning, retreating from record highs as investors digested higher longer-dated bond yields and underwhelming U.S. data that dented hopes for a quick U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.15% by 10:27 PM ET (3:27 AM GMT). The country’s National Core Consumer Price (CPI) index fell 0.6% year-on-year in January, against the 0.7% drop in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and December’s 1% drop.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.94% and in Australia, the ASX 200 fell 1.55%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.18%. Hong Kong approved a second COVID-19 vaccine,  Sinovac Biotech  Ltd.'s (NASDAQ:SVA) Coronavac offering, on Thursday after it relaxed some social distancing measures. Registration for the city’s vaccination program for priority groups will begin on Feb. 23.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.40% and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.92%.
Higher longer-dated bond yields were also on investors’ minds.
“The recent move up in longer dated core yields appears to be weighing on equity investors’ mind,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) forex strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
Investors had bet on increased economic growth and inflation, pushing core bond yields higher in a reflation trade. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the prospect of massive fiscal spending under U.S. President Joe Biden have also driven the reflation trade.
With rising yields weighing on investor sentiment, “disappointing U.S. jobless figures didn’t help the cause either,” NAB’s Catril added.
Investors were also surprised by an unexpected rise in the number of U.S. jobless claims. A total of 861,000 claims were filed during the previous week, against the 765,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 848,000 claims filed during the previous week. The surprise jump was a stark reminder of the U.S. economic recovery’s fragility, and some investors were doubtful about how quickly it would recover from COVID-19.
With benchmark Treasury yields currently at around 12-month highs, other investors were debating whether further rises could lead to a shake-out in risk assets. However, the pause in the bond-market selloff is another reminder of the economic recovery’s fragility, and investor hopes are now pinned on a successful global vaccine rollout.
“There are so many assets that are priced on really low rates forever … as soon as you do get a hint of this idea that long-term rates are not going to be zero forever, then those are going to be the most vulnerable assets,” UBS Asset Management head of multi-asset strategy Evan Brown told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, an unexpected cold front in Texas and surrounding areas is likely to keep oil refineries shut for another week."

(Reuters) - Waze has struggled to grow within Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, the navigation app's former top executive said, renewing concerns over whether it was stifled by the search giant's $1 billion acquisition in 2013.
More than 140 million drivers worldwide use Waze monthly, up from 10 million when it was acquired, according to a Wednesday blog post by Noam Bardin, who left Jan. 31 after helming Waze since 2009.
But Waze usage is flat in some countries as Google Maps gets significant promotion, and Waze has lost money as it focuses on a little-used carpooling app and pursues an advertising business that barely registers within the Google empire, according to interviews with 11 former employees over the last year.
Amid increased scrutiny of ""killer acquisitions"" designed to neutralize potential competitors, antitrust critics and U.S. lawmakers in recent months have questioned whether competition authorities failed by allowing Google to purchase Waze.
""We could have probably grown faster and much more efficiently had we stayed independent,"" Bardin wrote, noting that Google imposed constraints on Waze and copied its ideas into Google Maps.
Bardin, who has yet to be replaced, declined to comment further.
In response to his blog, Google said it ""invested enormously"" in Waze and its community, citing increased marketing spending, and added features such as Waze Carpool, toll prices, contactless fuel payments and integration with Audible.
""We wish Noam all the best with his future endeavors,"" it said in a statement. 
Former employees said Bardin tried to maintain an innovative culture by holding get-togethers apart from the rest of Google and discouraging promotion and bonus procedures popular at other Google units.
But Bardin said he was naive to believe that Waze could reach its full potential within Google despite the semi-autonomy.
""We ended up with the worst of both worlds - the challenges of a start-up (scale, access, distribution) with the constraints of a corporation (forced to use internal not-best-of-class systems, cost structure, politics, culture etc) all aggravated by the inability to quickly hire and fire,"" Bardin wrote.
Google perks, including free meals, stock-based compensation and liberal leave policies crept into Waze and eroded its ""startup magic,"" he lamented.
Founded in 2008 in Israel, Waze grew popular because it crowdsourced map and traffic information from users, keeping it more updated than rivals and shaving minutes off journeys.
Before the pandemic, Waze generated more than $200 million annually from fast food, retail and other ads shown throughout its app, two former employees said, but how to grow further has been a big internal debate.
Some employees advocated an increased focus on advertising, but Bardin was more interested in an app Waze launched in 2016 to connect commuters with people who would pay them for rides, the sources said.

Waze Carpool generated 550,000 rides in September 2019. To stoke usage last year, Bardin encouraged employers to subsidize commutes of essential workers. Results of that effort have not been disclosed.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund manager William Ackman, whose bets on companies are closely watched, updated investors on how his flagship fund earned a record 70.2% return in 2020 on Thursday in a socially distanced way by sending out a 57-page presentation.
Normally this would be one of the rare occasions where investors could pepper the billionaire investor and his partners in person with questions about markets and individual companies over dinner in New York.
Ackman has plenty to celebrate after his Pershing Square Capital Management put up a second straight year of record returns in 2020. In 2019 the fund returned 58.1%. And 2021 is off to a strong start with an 8.1% return.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic however, Ackman and his team continue to work remotely, something they started over a year ago, and there will be no public champagne cork popping or dinner tonight.
It was only in 2018, over dinner, that Ackman told investors that he would stop jetting around the world to meet with investors throughout the year. He was going to focus more on researching new ideas instead of acting as his firm's chief marketer. For investors, the shift has paid off, and Ackman called 2020 and ""outstanding year"" in the presentation.
He did not give any clues on how his blank check company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings is faring in finding a target.

Several months after announcing plans to hire a woman to his all-male investment team, Ackman said Manning Feng will join Pershing Square later this year. She previously worked as a private equity associate at Warburg Pincus and as analyst at Centerview Partners.

Those testifying were Robinhood CEO Vlad  Tenev, Melvin Capital CEO Gabriel  Plotkin, Citadel CEO Ken Griffin and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.
Here are the testimonies of the players involved and a link to biographies of some of them. 
Some quotes from the hearing: 
KEITH GILL: 
""A few things I am not. I am not a cat. I am not an institutional investor, nor am I a hedge fund. I do not have clients and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions. I am just an individual whose investment in GameStop and posts on social media were based upon my own research and analysis.""
""Investing can be risky and my approach can be risky but for me personally, yes (I would buy GameStop now). Yes, I do find it attractive at this price point."" 
""My investment in GameStop was based on the fundamentals."" 
""Increased transparency could help. That someone like me could have a better understanding of how those things work ... would help retail investors."" 
ROBINHOOD CEO VLAD  TENEV: 
""We always felt comfortable with our liquidity... The additional capital we raised wasn’t to meet capital requirements or deposit requirements... "" 
""I recognize customers were very upset (from the restrictions on trading)... it would have been significantly worse if we had prevented customers from selling."" 
""Not at all, zero pressure (from anyone on the panel to decide to restrict trading), it was a collateral depository decision."" 
""I’m sorry for what happened. I apologize. I’m not going to say that Robinhood did everything perfect and we haven’t made mistakes in the past, but what I commit to is making sure that we improve from this, learn from it, and we don’t make the same mistakes in the future. And Robinhood as an organization will learn from this and improve and make sure it doesn’t happen again, and I will make sure of that.""
""I do believe that the ability for the same share to be shorted an indefinite number of times is somewhat of a pathology and that should be fixed and I think step one of that is modernizing the antiquated settlement infrastructure that everything is built on. We simply don’t have the ability to properly track which shares have been shorted and how many times as they are moving through our settlement system."" 
""Robinhood owns what happened and we need to make sure it doesn't happen again but Robinhood Securities had limited options and I believe the team did the right thing and the only thing. 
""Payment for order flow is one of our largest revenue sources. Yes (it is the largest.)""
CITADEL CEO KEN GRIFFIN 
""As I was trying to explain... the quality of the execution varies by the channel of the order, this is a commonly understood phenomenon in economics.""
""We have fought for 15 years to make that the basis by which orders are allocated because we strongly believe Citadel is better to provide better execution for retail orders in the long run."" 
""We are able to share our trading acumen with retail investors, give them a better price and give payments for orderflow to firms like Robinhood. 
""This has been very important for the democratization of finance."" 
""I believe that the short interest in GameStop was exceptional. I’m not sure it’s worth us delving into legislative corrections for a very unique situation.""
""We of course are talking to Robinhood as we manage a substantial portion of their order flow. 
""Absolutely not (whether they contacted Robinhood about restricting trading in GameStop).""
""We don't own DTCC. We are not party to the discussion/ dialogue between DTCC and Robinhood. We have literally nothing to do with DTCC other than being a member of DTCC... Citadel Securities owes a duty of best execution for every order that comes from Robinhood and I'm proud of how seriously our team takes that best execution.""
""If we were to think about legislative priorities this (short selling) doesn't make the top 100 list.""
MELVIN CAPITAL CEO GABRIEL  PLOTKIN
""I think it is a really good question (regarding more reporting around shorting). It is not for me to decide. But if those are the rules then I will certainly abide by them."" 
""Anytime we short a stock, we locate a borrower. Our systems actually force us to find a borrower.""
""In 2014 at our inception (we took a short position in GameStop). 
""I don't remember (what it was worth) at the time. Maybe $40. We believed the company had a lot of structural challenges. 
""Our systems won't allow that (a naked short position) so it wouldn't be possible to do."" 
""They (retail traders) exploited an opportunity around short selling and we will have to adapt.
""I don't think you'll see stocks with the kind of short interest levels that you saw earlier this year, people like ourselves won't want to be susceptible for that.""
REDDIT CEO STEVE HUFFMAN

""We spend a lot of time at Reddit ensuring the authenticity of our platform. So we’ve got a large team dedicated to this exact task. Everything on Reddit - all of the content is created by users, voted on by users and ranked by users, and we make sure that is authentic, and as unmanipulated as possible. And in this specific case, we did not see any signs of manipulation.""

523,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 07:50PM ET</span>","Hedge fund manager Plotkin's GameStop short, dissected","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Gabriel Plotkin first bet against the future of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) in 2014 when it traded around $40. But after a harrowing experience with short sellers in recent weeks, he's wary about holding big short positions again. 
Plotkin, long one of the hedge fund industry's most admired traders, became one of the financial industry's most vilified players last month when an army of retail investors pushed the video game retailer's stock much higher after his hedge fund shorted the stock, betting its price would fall.
On Thursday, he spent more than five hours answering U.S. lawmakers' questions about how his firm Melvin Capital Management, which shed 53% of its value in January, lost so much money and whether it wasn't playing by the rules. 
But the fund manager, trying to strike a contrite note by saying he has to earn the cash back for his investors, turned the lens around and cast himself as having been hurt by Main Street investors who ganged up on the professionals.
""They exploited an opportunity around short selling and we will have to adapt and the whole industry will have to adapt,"" Plotkin said.
""I don't think investors like ourselves want to be susceptible to these types of dynamics. Whatever regulation you guys come up with we'll abide by."" 
Plotkin said Melvin is paid to take a view on companies and always follows financial industry rules. ""If those are the rules then I will certainly abide by them.""
To him, GameStop was an ailing video retailer with structural problems and declining revenues. 
""Anytime we short a stock, we locate a borrower, our systems actually force us to find a borrower,"" he said, explaining that Melvin does not engage in so-called naked shorting which is prohibited.
He was not drawn into a debate about the merits of short selling. 
And he sidestepped picking a fight with Elon Musk when a lawmaker asked him whether Musk's tweet ""Gamestonk!!"", seen as an endorsement of the stock, might have targeted him for having at one point bet against Musk's electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
""I don't want to speculate on what the motives of his tweet were. The stock did rise,"" Plotkin said diplomatically.
GameStop's gains deeply wounded Melvin as its assets shriveled to $8 billion from $12.5 billion at the start of the year. Billionaires Steven A. Cohen - Plotkin's mentor - and Kenneth Griffin, who runs hedge fund Citadel LLC, gave Melvin Capital a $2.75 billion dollar lifeline.
Due to the pandemic, lawmakers and Plotkin used video to communicate and the fund manager sat in a drab room whose biggest feature was a large printer.
He said he comes from a middle-class family in Maine, and did not have a job when he graduated college.

He left out that he worked for one year at Griffin's Citadel and soon joined Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors. He has earned enough money during his career to buy a stake in the Charlotte Hornets professional basketball team and pay around $44 million for two side-by-side properties overlooking Miami's Biscayne Bay last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Supreme Court will rule on Friday in a battle over workers' rights at taxi app Uber (NYSE:UBER) that could have ramifications for millions of people in the gig economy.
In a case led by two drivers, a London employment tribunal ruled in 2016 that they were due entitlements such as the minimum wage, paid holidays and rest breaks.
The Silicon Valley-based company appealed the decision all the way to Britain's top court which will provide its verdict from 0945 GMT on Friday. 
Uber drivers are currently treated as self-employed, meaning that in law they are only afforded minimal protections. 
If the firm loses, it could still take several months for the details to be worked out following a further employment tribunal hearing, depending on the nature of the Supreme Court's decision.
""It would involve them working out exactly how many hours they worked, how much they got paid for those hours and identifying occasions when that meant that they were paid less than the minimum wage,"" Matt McDonald, a partner who specialises in employment disputes at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, told Reuters.
""As an administrative job for the courts, it's a messy one,"" he said. 
A total of 25 drivers form part of an expanded group who are part of the case. Uber has around 60,000 drivers in Britain, including 45,000 in London, one of its most important markets.
A win, however, would be a major boost to it and several transportation, delivery and courier companies which use a similar business model, including food service firm Deliveroo and taxi rival Addison Lee.
The gig economy, where people tend to work for one or more companies on a job-by-job basis, has faced criticism from unions who say it is exploitative whilst businesses cite flexibility as an advantage. 

Uber saw off a challenge in its home market of California in November when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers' status as independent contractors, not employees.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The hackers behind the worst intrusion of U.S. government agencies in years won access to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s secret source code for authenticating customers, potentially aiding one of their main attack methods.
Microsoft said in a blog post on Thursday that its internal investigation had found the hackers studied parts of the source code instructions for its Azure cloud programs related to identity and security, its Exchange email programs, and Intune management for mobile devices and applications. https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/02/18/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-final-update
Some of the code was downloaded, the company said, which would have allowed the hackers even more freedom to hunt for security vulnerabilities, create copies with new flaws, or examine the logic for ways to exploit customer installations.
Microsoft had said before that the hackers had accessed some source code, but had not said which parts, or that any had been copied. 
U.S. authorities said Wednesday the breaches revealed in December extended to nine federal agencies and 100 private companies, including major technology providers and security firms. They said the Russian government is likely behind the spree, which Moscow has denied.
Initially discovered by security provider FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) Inc, the hackers used advanced skills to insert software back doors for spying into widely used network-management programs distributed by Texas-based SolarWinds Corp.
At the most prized of the thousands of SolarWinds customers that were exposed last year, the hackers added new Azure identities, added greater rights to existing identities, or otherwise manipulated the Microsoft programs, largely to steal email.
Some hacking also used such methods at targets which did not use SolarWinds. Microsoft previously acknowledged that some of its resellers, who often have continual access to customer systems, had been used in the hacks. It continues to deny that flaws in anything it provides directly have been used as an initial attack vector.
Microsoft declined to answer Reuters' questions about which parts of its code had been downloaded or whether what the hackers discovered would have helped them hone techniques.
The company also declined to say whether it was changing any of its code as a result of the breach.
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions.
The company said Thursday it had completed its probe and that it had ""found no indications that our systems at Microsoft were used to attack others.""
Nevertheless, the problems with identity management have proved so pervasive in the recent attacks that multiple security companies have issued new guidelines and warnings as well tools for detecting misuse.
President Joe Biden has promised a response to the SolarWinds hacks, and an inquiry and remediation effort is being led by his top cybersecurity official, Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger.

The Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on the hacks Tuesday with witnesses including Microsoft President Brad Smith and FireEye Chief Executive Kevin Mandia.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government will inject between $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion into state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) this year and offer a tax break of 75 billion Mexican pesos ($3.68 billion), a senior official told Reuters on Thursday.
The world's most indebted oil company, Pemex had more than $110 billion in financial debt at the end of the third quarter last year, while its liabilities far exceeded its assets. 
In the past two years, the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has injected billions of dollars in capital in the loss-making company and reduced its tax burden.
The source, who has direct knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified, said the tax reduction will be applied on a monthly basis and be separate from the already reduced profit sharing rate (DUC) from 58% to 54% for this year.
Neither Pemex nor the finance ministry immediately responded to a request for comment. Earlier on Thursday, Lopez Obrador said a new agreement will come into force to further reduce the tax burden on Pemex, but he gave no details.
Last year, the government reduced the DUC, the largest payment Pemex makes to state coffers, from 65% to 58%.
The source also said the first of several capital injections, scheduled within the next two weeks, will be used to pay down debt, and that it is unlikely Pemex will issue bonds on the international market this year. 
Pemex has carried out liability management of different types, including bond refinancing and bank line extensions, totaling more than $30 billion between 2019 and 2020. 
Luis Gonzali, co-director of investments at Franklin Templeton Investments in Mexico, said the $5 billion will ""enter and leave, without any major impact"" on the company's long-term prospects.
""Lowering taxes and capitalizing in small amounts does not solve the underlying problem: lack of infrastructure, capital supporting unprofitable projects, lack of exploration,"" he said. ""But it will help it survive more comfortably throughout the year.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is recalling 153,000 older trucks that may have had obsolete Takata air bag modules installed in collision and theft repairs after the Takata recall was completed, the automaker said on Thursday.
The second-largest U.S. automaker identified 144,340 U.S. 2004-06 Ford Ranger trucks and about 8,800 in Canada that could have obsolete Takata parts. Ford said it could not locate 45 inflators that could have been installed and was recalling all of the vehicles ""at the request of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration"" (NHTSA). 
Ford also said on Thursday it was separately recalling a group of 1,100 vehicles from the 2004-2011 model years that may also have had obsolete Takata service parts.
Last month, Ford said it would comply with an earlier NHTSA request to recall 3 million vehicles with potentially defective driver-side Takata air bags and would take a $610 million charge.
NHTSA rejected a formal petition from Ford to avoid a recall.
The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of more than 67 million inflators. Worldwide, about 100 million inflators installed by 19 major automakers have been recalled.
Also last month, NHTSA said at least 17 million U.S. vehicles with Takata air bags remain unrepaired.
Takata inflators have resulted in the deaths of at least 27 people worldwide and 18 in the United States, and over 400 reported injuries.
Two people died in Takata air bag ruptures in previously recalled 2006 Ford Ranger vehicles, with the most recent death in 2017.

In November, NHTSA said it was rejecting a petition filed by General Motors (NYSE:GM) to avoid recalling 5.9 million U.S. vehicles with Takata inflators. GM said later it was taking a $1.1 billion charge as a result of the recall.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Freezing weather that interrupted gas supplies in the southern United States and Mexico was wreaking havoc on Thursday on car manufacturing plants on both sides of the border, with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp reporting disruptions to their assembly lines.
The cold snap has overwhelmed Texas' power grid, while natural gas supplies to Mexico from Texas were interrupted, leaving millions without power in Mexico's industrial northern states earlier in the week.
In Texas, freezing temperatures are expected to last through Saturday.
Mexico generates most of its power from natural gas, largely imported from the United States. The two countries also require intricate supply chains to be functional to supply auto and other industrial operations on both sides of the border.
In six Mexican states, significant power cuts contributed to the suspension of operations at auto assembly plants, according to Mexican auto association AMIA.
Some car factories also use natural gas on their production lines. Fewer supplies have meant at least five plants reported cutting their consumption of the fuel by between 20% and 30% since Tuesday, the association added.
Ford on Thursday said adverse weather had led to the temporary closure of plants in Kansas City, Michigan and Kentucky, as well as a plant in Hermosillo in the northern Mexican border state of Sonora.
Late on Wednesday, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said it would suspend some production in Mexico on Thursday and Friday due to limited natural gas supply. The cut in supply also affected Audi as well as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s plant in the central city of Silao, where work stopped on Tuesday night and Wednesday. 
GM said on Thursday that first-shift operations were canceled at plants in Arlington, Texas; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Bowling Green, Kentucky. The first two factories also would likely be closed for the second shift. 
Other automakers affected by the winter weather include Toyota and Nissan.
Toyota said its Texas plant would be idled through Friday, while first shifts would not operate on Thursday at plants in Mississippi and Alabama. In Mexico, the automaker said it would reduce shifts and suspend work in the coming days at its plants in Baja California and Guanajuato. 
Nissan said production at plants in Smyrna, Tennessee, and Canton, Mississippi, remain suspended, and that in Mexico it was halting some production in Aguascalientes while seeking to quickly switch to liquefied petroleum gas at other plants.
Ford's Kansas City plant's operations have been canceled from Feb. 13-22, the company said. 

Mexico, Latin America's second-largest economy, has reeled as gas imports via pipeline from Texas dropped by about 75% over the last week, causing billions of dollars of losses on power outages and factory closures.

(Reuters) - Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) on Thursday forecast second-quarter revenue above market expectations, as demand for its semiconductor manufacturing tools picked up during a global shortage of semiconductors.
The chip-gear maker is beginning to benefit from the coronavirus-induced surge in the sales of PCs, gaming consoles and other devices used to work and play from home.
The company expects fiscal second-quarter revenue of $5.39 billion, plus or minus $200 million, which would exceed above analysts' expectations of $4.96 billion. The forecast calls for adjusted profits to be $1.44 to $1.56 per share, above estimates of $1.28.
Shares were up 4.7% in extended trading after the results.
The semiconductor industry has suffered a global supply shortage that disrupted production at many automotive factories and limited revenue growth at chip designers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc. On a conference call with investors, Applied Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said the company had pulled together an internal group to target the makers of specialty semiconductors for sectors like the automotive industry. 
""We think some of these markets could be some of the fastest-growing markets over the next several years,"" Dickerson said. 
American lawmakers have passed a program that, if funded, could provide a boost to chip toolmakers such as Applied by subsidizing the construction of new chip factories. Dickerson said on the investor call that the factories in the United States and Europe could be smaller in size than megafactories in Asia, which could benefit Applied because two small factories that make the same number of chips as one big factory must buy more tools overall.
""We have been engaged with customers and also government initiatives around investments in different locations,"" Dickerson said. ""That somewhat less efficient factory size is a positive for Applied.""
For the fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 31, Applied's quarterly net sales rose 24% to $5.16 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $4.97 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, the company earned $1.39 per share in the fiscal first quarter, above Wall Street's estimates of $1.28, according to Refinitiv data.

""Our broad conclusion was that markets worked reasonably well,"" with core infrastructure resilient despite heavy trading and high volatility, Yellen told CNBC in an interview, referring to a recent meeting of regulators on retail trading that led to heightened trading in GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other stocks favored on social media. 
""We really need to look at whether the trading practices are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets,"" she added.
Regarding high stock valuations amid high unemployment, Yellen said this was partly due to a very low interest rate environment that has chased money into stocks.
""In a world of very low interest rates, price-earnings type multiples tend to be high,"" she said, adding: ""there are maybe sectors where we should be very careful.""
Yellen also said the market for U.S. Treasury debt remains ""robust"" and that she sees no issues with the Treasury's ability to finance the U.S. budget deficit. The Federal Reserve will buy whatever Treasury debt is appropriate for the central bank's monetary policy goals, she added. 
Asked if she wanted to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Yellen called it ""a high-risk, speculative investment"" that has seen a recent surge in value. The top priority was to ensure that bitcoin is not used as a vehicle for illicit transactions and that investor protections are maintained, she said.

Ensuring that firms dealing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ""adhere to their regulatory responsibilities I think is certainly important,"" Yellen added.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - RWE, Germany's largest power producer, on Thursday warned that Arctic temperatures hitting the U.S. state of Texas put some of the group's local onshore wind farms out of service and forced it to buy electricity at sky-rocketing costs.
As a result, RWE, which is Europe's third-largest renewables player, said it expected a low-to mid-triple-digit million euro hit to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at its onshore wind/solar segment in 2021.
In 2020, the unit generated adjusted EBITDA of 472 million euros ($571 million), or 15% of the group's total.
The United States account for 38% of the roughly 9 gigawatts of installed renewables capacity RWE owns globally, making them the utility's largest market by that measure.
RWE said part of its onshore wind fleet in Texas had been partly out of service from Feb. 9 because of icing and grid issues that have dealt a major blow to the United States' second-largest state.
""Priority number one is to safely resume operations at our production sites,"" said Silvia Ortín Rios, Chief Operating Officer, Wind Onshore and Solar Photovoltaics Americas, at RWE's renewables division.
""I would like to thank all our employees who are working hard to get through this difficult situation for all families in Texas.""
Hundreds of thousands of homes in Texas are coping without heat for a fourth day on Thursday after utilities made some progress restoring power while freezing temperatures are expected to last through Saturday.
The crisis has led power prices to spike as high demand from residential heating clashed with lower availability of plants, RWE said, forcing the company to buy volumes for as much as $9,000 per megawatt hour to meet its supply obligations.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 05:25PM ET</span>",U.S. labor dept expected to say it will not enforce Trump-era investment rules - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor is expected to announce that it will not enforce Trump administration rules that curb investments based on environmental and social factors, and which limit shareholder voting in corporate meetings, according to two people familiar with the matter.
A department spokesman declined to comment on Thursday. 
The rules, finalized in the last days of former President Donald Trump's administration, affect trillions of dollars in retirement accounts. The business-friendly rules sparked criticism from investors who want companies to act on issues such as climate change and gender equality.
The rules are among the first of hundreds of Trump-era measures that are being frozen or rescinded by President Joe Biden, who has put tackling climate change and social injustice at the forefront of his policy agenda.
The Labor Department rules require that fund managers put retirees' financial interests first when allocating investments, rather than other concerns such as racial justice, and only vote on shareholder proposals when there is an economic reason to do so. 
The department is expected to announce a review of both measures, and not enforce them for the time being, the people said.
In a Jan. 20 executive order, Biden said the government should review regulations that fail to the protect the environment. Overhauling the Trump-era rules would involve a process that can take months, the people said.
""That's a very sound decision on the part of the DOL,"" said Sanford Lewis, director of the Shareholder Rights Group, which advocates for investors. ""I think it's appropriate for them to reconsider it and in the meantime not enforce it."" 
Shareholder calls for companies to develop plans for climate change and disclose racial and pay data have won more investor backing, prompting some companies to push back. 
Sustainable investing advocates had been hoping that the Biden administration would quickly end rules that stifle their ability to pick stocks using environmental, social or governance factors.

They have urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to revisit a similar Trump-era rule that raises the bar for submitting shareholder proposals.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street closed lower on Thursday as investors shifted out of big technology names, while an unexpected rise in weekly U.S. jobless claims pointed to a fragile recovery in the labor market.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) weighed the most on both the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq. 
Facebook shares dropped 1.5% to $269.39 as Wall Street assessed the wider ramifications of its move to block all news content in Australia.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 119.68 points, or 0.38%, to 31,493.34, the S&P 500 lost 17.36 points, or 0.44%, to 3,913.97 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 100.14 points, or 0.72%, to 13,865.36.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.13 billion shares.
Strong earnings, progress in the vaccination rollout and hopes of a $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package helped U.S. stock indexes again hit record highs at the start of the week. 
But the months-long rally suggests stocks now have high valuations, said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.
""We are still in the cautiously bullish environment for the market on the whole,"" Pride said, citing two reasons. 
""We're going to get a vaccine-induced economic recovery, that's No. 1. The flip side of that story is the markets have largely priced that in and driven themselves to over-valued territory. Markets are going to struggle with that,"" he said. 
Concerns over a rising inflation outlook have pushed investors to book profits on stocks with high valuations in the S&P 500 technology and communications services sectors, which have underpinned a 76% rise in the S&P 500 since its March 2020 lows.
Peter Essele, head of portfolio management at Commonwealth Financial Network in Boston, said there was a lot of irrational exuberance built into stock prices heading into this year.
""We started to enter an environment where risk actually became a factor once again and notably, inflationary risk,"" he said. ""Now it's a question of whether the fundamentals are going to match the level of prices that currently exist.""
A Labor Department report showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose to 861,000 last week from 848,000 the prior week, partly due to potential claims related to the temporary closure of automobile plants due to a global semiconductor chip shortage.
Of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, only utilities and consumer discretionary rose, while real estate barely fell, off 0.02%.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc slid 6.5% to $137.66 after the world's largest retailer missed quarterly profit estimates and predicted a low-single digit rise in fiscal 2022 net sales. [nL4N2KO30J]
""We're getting mixed readings. Strong retail sales and then lousy claims. We’re going to see that probably for the rest of this quarter,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. 
""Even the Walmart story wasn't that bad on the surface; they're going to make more investments,"" Ablin said. 
Walmart has invested heavily in online advertising and healthcare businesses over the past year, using pandemic-led sales momentum to diversify beyond brick-and-mortar retail.
Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc rose 0.5% to $131.98 after reporting a quarterly loss as the hotel chain's bookings declined due to pandemic-induced travel restrictions.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.53-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Investing.com-- Stocks blew off some steam Thursday but most eyes were focused on Congress’ virtual hearing about retail trading, GameStop, and the little app that could, Robinhood. 
The theme of the hearing was a familiar one: Is Wall Street scamming the little guy? The testimony is unlikely to go far in solving the market structure issues that create the occasional trading frenzies like we saw earlier this year, however. 
Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) dragged down the indexes after disappointing earnings. The retailer said it was raising pay for  425,000 workers to an average over $15 an hour.
Also on Thursday, the White House pledged to review key supply chains affecting semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries and rare earth metals. And the focus on the energy market continued as oil-rich Texas worked frantically to get power restored to freezing residents.
Not much is on the calendar for Friday in terms of government economic data or earnings. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Stonks and the retail investor
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) fell about 11% in Thursday trading as lawmakers grilled hedge fund investors and the CEO of Robinhood about the recent short squeeze that resulted in a frenzy of retail trading earlier this year. While GameStop stood in as the poster child for the episode, several other so-called meme stocks also got caught up in it, including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and BlackBerry Ltd (NYSE:BB). 
It’s not clear what will become of the testimony in the House. The hearing was focused on a classic Wall Street business model in which a market maker pays a broker to handle their buy and sell orders. Short selling and its role in the markets -- a perennially controversial topic-- was also a topic. 
2. Stimulus could come to a vote soon
Speaking of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on  Thursday that the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package could come to a vote next week. Congress wants to get something to President Joe Biden by the end of the month.
Economic relief is considered essential to spurring growth after a year of shut downs, disruptions and job losses. Thursdays unexpectedly large number for initial jobless claims could encourage lawmakers to act.
3. Crypto rally's future
Bitcoin tumbled below $52,000 but continues to be in focus after a remarkable run up in the cryptocurrency. It gained 300% for 2020 and has since climbed nearly 80% more, a rally encouraged by splashy investments from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) (which bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin) and MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) (which plans to buy $900 million more after previous investments.
People may remember the 2017 bitcoin bubble, which resulted in an 80% fall the following year. But many believe this time is different, and that more companies will invest in bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The recent trading frenzy centered on  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other “meme” stocks is sparking a wave of investor interest in start-ups aiming to mimic the success of Robinhood Markets Inc, whose no-fee brokerage app has helped drive a trading boom.
Public.com, a direct competitor to Robinhood that boasts a host of blue-chip backers, said on Wednesday it had raised $220 million, valuing it at $1.2 billion on the private market. Another well-heeled rival, Stash, said earlier this month it had raised $125 million, while Webull Financial LLC, backed by Chinese investors, is also raising fresh funds after enjoying an influx of new users. 
Robinhood, meanwhile, raised some $3.4 billion in the midst of the GameStop furor to assure its stability amid rapid growth and demands by its trading partners that it post more collateral. 
The fresh investments are coming even as government regulators ramp up scrutiny of Robinhood and others involved in the GameStop trading. A U.S. congressional committee on Thursday grilled the chief executive of Robinhood and a YouTube streamer known as ""Roaring Kitty,"" among others, as it probes possible improprieties, including market manipulation. 
Robinhood came under stiff criticism from some quarters for restricting trading in GameStop and other shares at the height of the frenzy, a move the company says it was forced to make due to requirements of partners that settle trades. It has also drawn scrutiny for a business model that relies on payments for sending trading business to partner brokerages, a practice Public.com and some other rivals are pledging to avoid.
Investors see rich opportunity in bringing easy stock trading to smartphone users globally, though the companies say they are also cognizant of the risks. 
Stash, which doubled its active accounts to over 5 million by the end of last year, operates with only four trading windows a day to discourage rapid speculative trading, it said.
U.K.-based Freetrade.io told Reuters by email that its user numbers last year grew six-fold to 300,000 and by mid-February had reached 560,000. It said it had raised a total $35 million, including from crowd-funding rounds from over 10,000 customers. 
But it does not offer margin trading or riskier offerings. “These products encourage investors to behave as if they are gambling or speculating rather than investing,” a Freetrade.io spokesman said. 
Interest in trading apps is soaring globally. In Mexico, trading app Flink launched seven months ago and already has a million users, according to co-founder and chief executive Sergio Jimenez. He said Mexicans can buy fractions of U.S. stock through the platform, but not Mexican stocks - yet. 
“Ninety percent of them are investing for the first time,” said Jimenez. 
Flink raised $12 million in a funding round in February led by Accel, an early investor in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Accel is also an investor in Public.com and Berlin-based Trade Republic Bank Gmbh, which allows European retail investors to buy fractions of U.S. stocks, according to Accel partner Andrew Braccia. 
“The bigger story here is there's just this global trend of… accessibility,” he said.
Start-up investors also see opportunity in the infrastructure behind the trading apps. DriveWealth, which serves Mexico’s Flink and 70-plus other online trading apps around the world, has hundreds more partnerships in the pipeline, according to founder and chief executive Bob Cortright. DriveWealth provides the technology to power digital wallets and trading apps, and also provides clearing and brokerage service to its business partners.
“This is this is only beginning,” said Cortright. “The fact that you could have a smartphone in your hand in India, for instance, and buy $10 worth of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock at an instant, that's pretty game-changing.”

Venture capital investments in U.S. fintech companies hit a record last year with $20.6 billion invested, according to data firm PitchBook. Globally, around $41.4 billion was invested in fintech companies in 2020.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Scientists will meet on Thursday to advise South Africa's government on its next steps after a study suggested the dominant local coronavirus variant may reduce protective antibodies from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine by two-thirds.
The laboratory study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is another worry for the country hardest-hit by the pandemic on the African continent after it placed AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccinations on hold earlier this month. 
Although its implications on the real-world efficacy of Pfizer's vaccine are not yet clear, the study comes after clinical trial data on the AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) (J&J) and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) vaccines showed reduced efficacy against the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant, first identified late last year.
South Africa has been counting on the Pfizer shot, developed with German partner BioNTech, to step up its vaccination programme after administering the first J&J doses on Wednesday.
It is considering swapping or selling its AstraZeneca doses, after a small local trial, where participants were on average 31 years old, showed the vaccine offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the 501Y.V2 variant. 
Officials are more confident about the J&J shot because it was shown to be effective against severe illness in the local leg of a large global trial.
The study published on Wednesday took into account all key mutations of the 501Y.V2 variant. A paper published in late January assessed the impact of only three key mutations of the variant.
Scientists say that because the new study's findings come from a laboratory, it is not easy to extrapolate what they might mean in the real world. 
Peter English, a consultant in communicable disease control, said it was ""far from proven"" that the Pfizer vaccine would be less effective against the 501Y.V2 variant. He said cellular immunity - as well as antibodies - was important in protecting against the virus and that scientists did not know the level of neutralising antibodies needed for immunity.
""Our scientists will be meeting to discuss it (the study) and they will advise the minister,"" health ministry spokesman Popo Maja said.
Barry Schoub, chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on vaccines, said the committee would discuss the study alongside information on other vaccines.
Asked to comment on the findings, he said: ""The Pfizer vaccine is enormously effective at 95%, so even if there is quite a significant reduction there still will be quite a bit of remnant efficacy left. 
""It is very likely that it will protect to a reasonable extent, certainly against severe illness and mild to moderate to some extent,"" he said.
""STRONG ENOUGH""
Richard Mihigo, an immunisation official at the World Health Organization's Africa office, told a news conference the antibody response to the variant in the Pfizer study was ""strong enough"".
Linda-Gail Bekker, co-lead investigator of the South African arm of J&J's global trial, said she would recommend rolling out the Pfizer vaccine but monitoring it in the same way as the J&J shot, which is being administered in an ""implementation study"" targeting up to 500,000 health workers to further test it.
Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday South Africa was expecting 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine initially and about 7 million doses by June.
A spokesman for regulator SAHPRA said Pfizer's registration application was under review and declined further comment.
South Africa, with nearly 1.5 million cases and about 48,500 deaths, has recorded almost half the COVID-19 fatalities and over a third of confirmed infections in Africa. It lagged richer Western nations in launching its immunisation campaign.

The government plans to vaccinate 40 million people - two-thirds of the population.

544,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 12:07PM ET</span>",How Amsterdam is stealing a march on rivals as Brexit trading hub,"By Tommy Wilkes, Toby Sterling, Abhinav Ramnarayan and Huw Jones
AMSTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) - All the talk was of Frankfurt or Paris luring London's financial business as Britain peeled away from the EU. Yet it is Amsterdam that is proving the most visible early winner.
Data last week showed the Dutch capital had displaced London as Europe's biggest share trading centre in January, grabbing a fifth of the 40 billion euros-a-day action, up from below a tenth of trading pre-Brexit.
Yet that is just one of several areas the city has quietly stolen a march on its rivals as it attracts businesses from Britain, evoking memories of its history as a global trading powerhouse in the 17th century.
Amsterdam has also overtaken London to become Europe's number one corporate listing venue so far this year, data shows, and the leader in euro-denominated interest-rate swaps, a market estimated to be worth about $135 trillion in 2020. 
""There is a whole culture of trading, and to be close to that was very positive,"" said Robert Barnes, CEO of London Stock Exchange-owned share trading platform Turquoise, which has selected the Dutch capital over Paris for its post-Brexit hub. 
""You have some of the big institutional banks, you have specialist trading firms, a dynamic retail community. But it's also in the heart of continental Europe."" 
Cboe Europe, an equities exchange, told Reuters it was launching an equities derivatives venture in Amsterdam in the coming weeks to emulate the trading model built in its Chicago home. 
Asked why the company chose Amsterdam over rivals, Cboe Europe President David Howson said the Netherlands was where he saw ""substantive growth"" for his industry in Europe. He also cited the wide use of English in the city and Dutch regulation being friendly to global investors, in contrast to some European countries' preference for championing domestically-focused firms. 
""You need core Europe to be competitive on a global scale,"" said Howson. ""A more insular Europe or too much national interest makes that a difficult thing."" 
Yet while the arrival of such businesses may bring higher tax revenues from trading volumes and private investment in infrastructure, the city is not experiencing a jobs boom, as many companies relocating there tend to be highly specialised, and smaller employers.
Turquoise's new Amsterdam operation, for instance, sits in the former head office of the Dutch East India Company, the trading megacorporation that fuelled Amsterdam's rise to its former finance fame - yet it only employs four staff. 
The Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, which has led the effort to woo Brexit business, told Reuters it estimated about 1,000 new jobs had been created by financial firms moving operations to Amsterdam since Britain left the EU. 
That's a fraction of the 7,500 to 10,000 jobs estimated to have left London for the EU since 2016, when Britain voted the leave the bloc, and a drop in the ocean compared with the British capital's financial workforce, which numbers over half a million.
Many investment banks with their large staffs have looked elsewhere on the continent, deterred in part by Dutch laws that limit banker bonuses.
Some senior bankers also don't believe the recent shift in share and derivatives trading threatens London.
""The main pool of capital that is managed out of London today is unchanged from six months or a year ago, so I don't think you had an exodus that should make people stand up and say, does London have a problem,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Chief Executive Jes Staley said on Thursday during an earnings call. 
HOW IT'S GETTING AHEAD
Amsterdam leads the European listings table this year, having attracted $3.4 billion-worth of initial public offerings (IPOs), Refinitiv data shows. That included Poland's InPost, which raised 2.8 billion euros in the biggest European IPO in 2021 so far.
Spanish fintech form Allfunds, Dutch web startup WeTransfer and two ""blank-cheque"" firms - one backed by ex-Commerzbank chief executive Martin Blessing and another by French tycoon Bernard Arnault - are planning to list on Euronext Amsterdam. 
At least three technology companies from Central and East European are also considering listings as Brexit dents London's allure, bankers told Reuters.
    Banking sources working on the two blank-cheque, or special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), said Dutch regulations were closest to rules in the United States, making it easier to appeal globally.
In the euro-denominated interest rate swaps market, platforms in Amsterdam and New York have grabbed the bulk of business lost by London, whose share fell from just under 40% in July to just over 10% in January, IHS Markit data shows. 
That made the Dutch capital the biggest player, an advance from last July when platforms in the city commanded just 10% of the market.
Amsterdam will also become home to the European carbon emissions trading, worth a billion euros a day in trading volumes, when the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) moves the market from London later this year. 
Graphic: Trading centres - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopazlzeva/trading%20centers.JPG
BIG BANKS AND BONUSES
The Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, which began analysing where Amsterdam could capitalise after Britain's 2016 decision to leave the EU, said it had identified certain financial sectors where it believed it could have an edge. 
""We focused on specialist areas ... that were trading and fintech,"" said spokesman Michiel Bakhuizen, adding that the city played up the strength of its low-latency digital trading infrastructure. 
""The big investment banks were always going to move to Frankfurt and Paris because of the Dutch legislation that is in place for bank bonuses,"" he added, referring to a 2015 law limiting variable pay to a maximum of 20% of base salary.
This drive to focus on specialist areas rather than appeal more broadly could be reflected in the number of companies relocating. 
In response to Brexit, 47 firms have shifted operations entirely or partly to Amsterdam from London, according to preliminary data compiled by New Financial, a think-tank.
That is lower than the 88 firms that have moved business to Paris and the 56 to Frankfurt.
Companies to have shifted operations to the Netherlands include CME, MarketAxess and Tradeweb. A handful of asset managers and banks including Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) are also relocating there.
By contrast, those firms that have moved departments and staff to Frankfurt have mainly been big investment banks, including JP Morgan, Citi and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), while Paris has mostly welcomed banks and asset managers, according to New Financial. 
'WAY TOO EARLY TO CALL'
William Wright, New Financial's managing director, notes that although fewer firms have made the move to Amsterdam, the city's share ""is highly concentrated by sector, with Amsterdam having a clear lead in areas like broking, trading, exchanges and fintech"".
Amsterdam's apparent success, however, may be flattered because Brexit has so far hit trading hardest, and such business may be easier to move.
""The early data on the impact of Brexit is mainly trading-based, hence Amsterdam looks like it is doing particularly well,"" Wright added. ""And I'm not making a call on Amsterdam for IPOs yet as I think it's way too early.""
Sander van Leijenhorst, Brexit programme manager at the AFM Dutch financial regulator, said authorities would actually have preferred London retaining its dominance because of the efficiencies that come from concentrating everything in a single European hub, he said. 
But once the implications of Brexit became clearer, it was obvious that Amsterdam - home to the world's oldest stock exchange - would appeal, he added.

""There was already a group of traders here. They tend to come together, they tend to flock together.""

545,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>",Investors seed indoor farms as pandemic disrupts food supplies,"By Rod Nickel
(Reuters) - Investors used to brush off Amin Jadavji's pitch to buy Elevate Farms’ vertical growing technology and produce stacks of leafy greens indoors with artificial light.
""They would say, 'This is great, but it sounds like a science experiment,'"" said Jadavji, CEO of Toronto-based Elevate.
Now, indoor farms are positioning themselves as one of the solutions to pandemic-induced disruptions to the harvesting, shipping, and sale of food. 
""It's helped us change the narrative,"" said Jadavji, whose company runs a vertical farm in Ontario, and is building others in New York and New Zealand. 
Proponents, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), say urban farming increases food security at a time of rising inflation and limited global supplies. North American produce output is concentrated in Mexico and the U.S. Southwest, including California, which is prone to wildfires and other severe weather.
Climate-change concerns are also accelerating investments, including by agribusiness giant  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN), into multi-storey vertical farms or greenhouses the size of 50 football fields. 
They are enabling small North American companies like Elevate to bolster indoor production and compete with established players BrightFarms, AeroFarms and Plenty, backed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. 
But critics question the environmental cost of indoor farms' high power requirements.
Vertical farms grow leafy greens indoors in stacked layers or on walls of foliage inside of warehouses or shipping containers. They rely on artificial light, temperature control and growing systems with minimal soil that involve water or mist, instead of the vast tracts of land in traditional agriculture.
Greenhouses can harness the sun's rays and have lower power requirements. Well-established in Asia and Europe, greenhouses are expanding in North America, using greater automation.
Investments in global indoor farms totaled a record-high $500 million in 2020, AgFunder research head Louisa Burwood-Taylor said.
The average investment last year rose sharply, as large players including BrightFarms and Plenty raised fresh capital, she said.
A big funding acceleration lies ahead, after pandemic food disruptions - such as infections among migrant workers that harvest North American produce - raised concerns about supply disruptions, said Joe Crotty, director of corporate finance at accounting firm KPMG, which advises vertical farms and provides investment banking services.
""The real ramp-up is the next three to five years,"" Crotty said. 
Vegetables grown in vertical farms or greenhouses are still just a fraction of overall production. U.S. sales of food crops grown under cover, including tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce, amounted to 790 million pounds in 2019, up 50% from 2014, according to the USDA. 
California's outdoor head lettuce production alone was nearly four times larger, at 2.9 billion pounds.
USDA is seeking members for a new urban agriculture advisory committee to encourage indoor and other emerging farm practices. 
PLANT BREEDING MOVES INDOORS
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), one of the world's biggest seed developers, aims to provide the plant technology to expand vertical agriculture. In August, it teamed with Singapore sovereign fund Temasek to create Unfold, a California-based company, with $30 million in seed money.
Unfold says it is the first company focused on designing seeds for indoor lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, spinach and cucumbers, using Bayer germplasm, a plant's genetic material, said Chief Executive John Purcell. 
Their advances may include, for example, more compact plants and an increased breeding focus on quality, Purcell said. 
Unfold hopes to make its first sales by early 2022, targeting existing farms, and start-ups in Singapore and the United Kingdom. 
Greenhouses are also expanding, touting higher yields than open-field farming.
AppHarvest, which grows tomatoes in a 60-acre greenhouse in Morehead, Kentucky, broke ground on two more in the state last year. The company aims to operate 12 facilities by 2025.
Its greenhouses are positioned to reach 70% of the U.S. population within a day's drive, giving them a transportation edge over the southwest produce industry, said Chief Executive Jonathan Webb.
""We're looking to rip the produce industry out of California and Mexico and bring it over here,"" Webb said.
Projected global population growth will require a large increase in food production, a tough proposition outdoors given frequent disasters and severe weather, he said.
New York-based BrightFarms, which runs four greenhouses, positions them near major U.S. cities, said Chief Executive Steve Platt. The company, whose customers include grocers Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), plans to open its two largest farms this year, in North Carolina and Massachusetts.
Platt expects that within a decade, half of all leafy greens in the United States will come from indoor farms, up from less than 10% currently. 
""It's a whole wave moving in this direction because the system we have today isn’t set up to feed people across the country,"" he said.
'CRAZY, CRAZY THINGS'
But Stan Cox, research scholar for non-profit The Land Institute, is skeptical of vertical farms. They depend on grocery store premiums to offset higher electricity costs for lighting and temperature control, he said.
""The whole reason we have agriculture is to harvest sunlight that’s hitting the earth every day,"" he said. ""We can get it for free.""
Bruce Bugbee, a professor of environmental plant physiology at Utah State University, has studied space farming for NASA. But he finds power-intensive vertical farming on Earth far-fetched.
""Venture capital goes into all kinds of crazy, crazy things and this is another thing on the list.""
Bugbee estimates that vertical farms use 10 times the energy to produce food as outdoor farms, even factoring in the fuel to truck conventional produce across country from California. 
AeroFarms, operator of one of the world's largest vertical farms, a former New Jersey steel mill, says comparing energy use with outdoor agriculture is not straightforward. Produce that ships long distances has a higher spoilage rate and many outdoor produce farms use irrigated water and pesticides, said Chief Executive Officer David Rosenberg.
Vertical farms tout other environmental benefits.
Elevate uses a closed loop system to water plants automatically, collect moisture plants emit and then re-water them with it. Such a system requires 2% of the water used on an outdoor romaine lettuce operation, Jadavji said. The company uses no pesticides.

""I think we're solving a problem,"" he said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. chemicals maker Dow Inc has put German infrastructure assets up for sale in a potential 800 million euro ($966 million) deal as it seeks cash for investment elsewhere, sources close to the matter told Reuters. 
Chief Executive James Fitterling last month said that Dow would continue to offload infrastructure companies from its balance sheet and make use of the funds for capex, smaller acquisitions or share buybacks. 
While Dow would sell the infrastructure at petrochemicals sites in Stade, Schkopau und Boehlen, it would continue to produce plastics and intermediates there, paying usage fees to the new owner. Dow is the main user but not the only one operating in the three chemical parks. 
Chemical parks typically provide infrastructure for the likes of electricity, steam, natural gas and other services to resident producers. 
""Dow has informed employees in Germany that it is exploring opportunities related to certain site infrastructure assets and services at its Stade, Schkopau and Boehlen sites, but no final decision has been made"", a company spokesman said. 
In a similar deal in 2019, Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and Lanxess sold integrated chemical site operator Currenta to Macquarie in a 3.5 billion euro deal.
Dow has sent out information packages to prospective bidders including KKR, Blackstone (NYSE:BX), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Brookfield Asset Management, Macquarie, First Sentier and DIF Capital Partners, the sources said.
The business is being marketed with an annual sales figure of 300 million euros with core profit of about 65 million euros.
Bidders could value the infrastructure assets at about 12-13 times core earnings, the sources added.
Dow is working with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on the divestiture the sources said. 
Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp said on Thursday they are launching the first phase of their partnership with codeshares on nearly 80 routes from New York and Boston.
The joint announcement came even as the U.S. Department of Justice and attorneys general in New York, Massachusetts and other jurisdictions continue to review the proposed tie-up. 
""American and JetBlue intend to cooperate with those investigations, but are proceeding with plans to implement this alliance,"" American said in its annual report released late Wednesday.
New York-based low-cost carrier JetBlue and international major American are hoping the partnership, announced in July, will give them more competitive heft in the U.S. Northeast as the industry recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, which has decimated travel.
""The alliance is also essential to getting our planes back in the air profitably and crewmembers working again,"" said JetBlue's head of revenue planning, Scott Laurence.
The two airlines are also introducing 33 new routes in the first phase of their alliance, which American's chief revenue officer, Vasu Raja, called ""the first step to delivering the best customer proposition with the biggest network in New York and Boston.""
Codesharing allows travelers to book with one airline for flights operated by a partner. The two airlines will also begin offering reciprocal benefits on their loyalty programs this spring. 
Following a U.S. Department of Transportation review, American and JetBlue agreed to divest some slots at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) near Washington and will refrain from coordinating on some markets.
JetBlue pilots voted earlier this week to reject a tentative agreement that would have given the airline contractual relief to implement the partnership. JetBlue said it still planned to move forward.

The union representing American Airlines' pilots said on Thursday it was still analyzing the codesharing announcement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - One area of focus from a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Thursday will likely be on the role short selling played in the GameStop (NYSE:GME) market mayhem.
Executives from trading platform Robinhood and hedge funds Melvin Capital and Citadel will be grilled following the retail-driven trading frenzy that sparked wild gyrations in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks.
Short selling, details of which are included in the memorandum https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20210218/111207/HHRG-117-BA00-20210218-SD002.pdf about the hearing, can be a positive move, as it can be used in hedging positions, more accurately valuing prices of stocks and exposing frauds, like Enron and Theranos.
But Vlad Tenev, broker Robinhood's chief executive officer, recently pointed out that some of the stocks involved in the ""meme stock"" rally were more than 100% shorted, implying that more shares were shorted than were available to trade. 
""I just think that's pathological,"" he said on the All-In Podcast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU late last Friday. ""You end up with this situation that could destabilize the financial markets.""
HOW DOES SHORT SELLING WORK? 
Typically, shorting a stock is a bet that the share price is going to fall.
Short sellers borrow shares from brokers and then sell them into the market, with the agreement that they will buy the shares back and return them to the lender at an agreed upon time. The shares can come from the brokers' own inventories, or from customers that have allowed the brokers to lend out their shares.
When it's time to return the shares, if the stock price has fallen, the short seller can buy the shares back at a lower price than they originally paid for them, locking in a profit. 
If the price has risen, the short seller must buy back the shares at the higher price, incurring a loss.
In the meantime, the short seller pays the lender interest on the value of the stock, giving the lender extra income.
IS IT RISKY TO LEND OUT SHARES?
Not really. The borrower posts collateral, typically https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/glossary/content/glossary/shortsale/collateral.htm 102% of the prior day's settlement price. The borrower can also request the shares back at any time.
HOW CAN MORE THAN 100% OF A COMPANY'S SHARES BE SHORTED?
Once the short seller borrows the shares from the lender and then sells them back into the market, the new owner of the shares is free to lend them out, just as the previous owner did, and have no idea they are on the other side of a short sale.
Settlement time is two days after the transaction. In that time, the same shares can be lent out again, and again. This makes it possible, on paper, for more than 100% of the float of a stock to be shorted. 
According to financial analytics firm S3, GameStop's peak short interest was 141.8% of its float on Jan. 4. 
S3 argued in a recent research note that the traditional method of calculating the percentage of float is flawed because it uses stale data. U.S. investors are required to mark their shares shorted and regulators report these figures twice a month, with a 10-day delay, S3 said.
There have been calls since the GameStop saga to improve transparency around short selling through more frequent reporting.
WHAT'S A SHORT SQUEEZE?
When the price of a heavily shorted stock soars, short-sellers are forced to buy the shares back at a higher prices to close out their positions, pushing the stock price even higher.
Shorting shares in GameStop cost hedge funds a total $12.5 billion over January, according to financial analytics firm Ortex. 
ARE THERE RESTRICTIONS ON SHORT SELLING?
Yes. In 2004, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prohibited naked short selling, which is the practice of shorting shares before having borrowed them, except in some cases, such as when a market maker is providing liquidity.

553,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 11:00AM ET</span>",Retail trading boom sparks 500%-plus rally in small German brokers,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - The retail trading boom has fired up the stocks of some small German brokers, including one run by around 50 people, which reported a 10-fold rise in annual profit after an almost similar jump in its share price in less than a year. 
From being among the smallest players by market capitalisation in its field to boasting a 1,200% rise in its shares, Lang & Schwarz is the latest example on how lockdown boredom and high savings rates in Europe have triggered a surge in stock investing by non-professionals.
The hype around the record breaking run in bitcoin and Wall Street darlings like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), or the Reddit-fuelled surge in GameStop (NYSE:GME) and cannabis stocks in 2021, has given another impulse to the boom driving meteoric gains in Lang & Schwarz, as well as Tradegate and Baader Bank since March 2020.
Germany, the most populous country in Europe and where financial literacy is high, has emerged as a hot spot for fund managers investing in the sector's stock.
""We haven't seen such a boom since the end of the 1990s,"" said Roger Peeters and Christoph Frank, executive partners at pfp Advisory in Frankfurt, which holds a stake in Lang & Schwarz.
""In Germany there are a number of companies from platforms to stockbrokers and focused banks which could gain a lot of profit from this development. The crucial question is: how sustainable is the development?,"" they added. 
After initially surging on Thursday Lang & Schwarz shares saw some profit taking. The stock however remained 7% below the record close marked earlier this month. Shares in Baader Bank, a market maker and brokerage, and Tradegate, a retail bank and trading firm, also eased after rising around 850% and 500% respectively from March lows.
""A big part of the success of these companies is tied to an explosion of volumes in 2020/2021 due to the pandemic and the large liquidity on markets,"" said Michele Pedroni, senior portfolio manager at DECALIA in Geneva.
Baader Bank saw accounts on its trading platform more double in 2020 and is upbeat on this year, while Tradegate more than doubled its dividend after pre-tax profit jumped 568% last year.
Online broker Sino, whose shares have soared nearly six-fold from March, has recorded a further improvement of trading activity in January after orders processed in the three months to December rose 177%.
Lang & Schwarz said late on Wednesday that in January it managed 6 million trades, a record monthly number that was also higher than the volume it handled in all of 2019. 
Pedroni said that beyond the pandemic's short-term volume boost, some of these platforms have earned new clients and that should represent a benefit over a longer time frame.
Meanwhile, Lang & Schwarz, cautioned that there were no assurances this trend would continue throughout 2021.
But the ongoing buzz prompted  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to upgrade Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) to ""outperform"" citing among other reasons the activity in Tradegate, in which the stock market operator has a stake.
""Increased retail trading participation for Tradegate even brings a growth story to (German share trading platform) Xetra"".

555,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 10:51AM ET</span>",Walmart's investment year will hold back profit growth; shares slide,"By Aishwarya Venugopal and Richa Naidu
(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc expects full-year sales and profit growth to slow as it reinvests in its business, after revenue soared to $560 billion last year as people stocked up on groceries during the pandemic.
The world's biggest retailer, which employs 1.5 million people in the United States, also said it is raising wages to more than $15 per hour on average. About half of Walmart's hourly U.S. workers will earn $15 an hour or more, though there are some roles that will still start at $11 an hour, the company said.
Shares in Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart were down 5.6% on Thursday. The company has invested heavily in online, advertising and healthcare businesses over the past year, using pandemic-led sales momentum to diversify beyond brick-and-mortar retail. 
""Guidance was muted, locking in gains from last year but stalling profit expansion in favor of critical investments in people and platform,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Stephanie Wissink said.
Walmart forecast adjusted net sales to grow in the low single digits in fiscal 2022 which ends Jan. 31, much lower than the 8.5% growth seen in the preceding year. It also expects earnings per share to be flat-to-slightly up, below the 2.2% growth analysts had been expecting, according to Refinitiv.
""We're going to invest more aggressively in capacity and automation to position ourselves to earn the primary destination with customers, we are absolutely playing offence here,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at Walmart's investor day conference. 
Walmart expects capital expenditure to increase 27% to about $14 billion this year, focusing on key areas like supply chain and automation.
WAGE HIKE, STIMULUS BOOST
Walmart's announcement to increase wages comes at a time when pressure to increase the federal minimum wage has gathered fresh momentum. President Biden has made the issue a priority and reiterated his support for a base wage hike. He is also pushing to get $15 minimum wage added to his COVID rescue package.
""People who we are raising wages for tend to have been with us for a longer period of time than someone who might be earning the entry wage,"" McMillon said. ""We will raise our starting wage rate over time.""
Driven by an early holiday season and government stimulus checks, fourth-quarter sales at Walmart's U.S. stores open at least a year surged 8.6%, excluding fuel, well above analysts' expectations for a 5.6% rise.
The retail industry is expecting another wave of stimulus-driven consumer spending in coming months as the U.S. Congress considers the Biden administration’s recovery plan that includes sending a $1,400 check to households.
“The guidance that we're going to give this morning really doesn't include any material stimulus because we just don't know what will happen. If we get more stimulus certainly that's a tailwind for us,"" Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters in an interview. 
Walmart missed expectations for fourth-quarter profit as it took on about $1.1 billion in pandemic-related costs during the quarter, including higher wages for warehouse workers, bonuses for store employees and costs related to keeping its stores clean. 
Online sales rose 69% in the quarter, blowing past a 35% increase in the year-earlier period, but slower than a 79% surge in the third quarter.
The retailer has relied on its scale and strengthening online presence during the pandemic to attract new customers looking for a one-stop shop for their daily needs.

Operating income rose 3.1% to $5.49 billion in the quarter, while adjusted earnings were $1.39 per share. Analysts on average were expecting the company to earn $1.51 per share.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said Thursday it is investing $210 million to expand engine production in West Virginia and add 100 new jobs.
The Japanese automaker said it would boost capacity by 70,000 engines a year at the Buffalo, West Virginia plant, up from the nearly 1 million transmissions and engines it produces annually for vehicles assembled in North America.
The investment will increase assembly capacity of its four-cylinder engine line. The plant makes four- and six-cylinder engines for Avalon, Camry, Corolla, Highlander, Lexus ES, Lexus RX350, RAV4 and Sienna.
The investment comes as automakers around the world are shifting more focus to electric vehicles and away from vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.
Toyota says hybrid vehicles, which includes internal combustion engines, will be a key part of its vehicle strategy in the coming decade as other automakers focus more heavily on battery electric vehicles, which only run on electric power.

Toyota said last week that 16% of its U.S. sales were hybrid vehicles in 2020, a figure that will jump to at least 20% in 2021.

NEW DELHI/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) has frozen all projects it was working on with Mahindra & Mahindra while it finalises a new India strategy, three people familiar with the U.S. carmaker's plans told Reuters, weeks after the two companies called off their planned joint venture.
""The options could include working out a new relationship with Mahindra or ending the relationship and related vehicles completely,"" one of the sources said.
The two other sources said they expect Ford to make a decision in about a month on whether to proceed with Mahindra in a different form or not, adding Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley wants to see a path to greater profitability in India.
Ford and Mahindra had proposed a joint venture to develop at least three sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) for India and emerging markets, as well as share suppliers, powertrains and technology. The $275 million deal, which would have ended most of Ford's independent operations in India, was called off on Dec. 31.
Since Farley became CEO in October, Ford has pushed harder to remake itself globally as part of an $11 billion restructuring, including ending manufacturing in Brazil, and speeding up the rollout of electric vehicles. With so much on Farley's plate and limited financial resources, India is a lower priority, the first source said.
Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford entered India 25 years ago, but it has just 3% share in a market dominated by Suzuki Motor Corp's and Hyundai Motor's extensive line-up of mainly low-cost cars. 
The tie-up with Mahindra would have given Ford a better chance against rivals by allowing it to launch new vehicles faster, at reduced costs and with lower investment, company officials and analysts previously said.
Ford said its independent Indian operations will continue. 
""We are reviewing our businesses strategy, making choices and allocating capital consistent with the plan to achieve an 8% company adjusted EBIT margin and generate consistently strong cash flow,"" spokesman Kapil Sharma said. ""We will have more details to share at a later date."" 
For Mahindra it would have been an opportunity to enter new global markets, but it walked away from the deal over concerns its return on investment would be too low.
Mahindra said in a statement that the automakers are looking at ways to collaborate. ""We have defined a timeline till the end of March for this work to be completed,"" the company said.
STRATEGIC RETHINK
Ford is weighing all programmes it had planned for the joint venture with Mahindra and will review which ones it plans to keep from a profit standpoint, the second source said. 
The most crucial was a mid-sized SUV to be built by Mahindra on its vehicle platform and using its powertrain. Ford planned to launch this in 2022 with a target to sell around 50,000 units annually in India, two sources said. Mahindra, too, has asked suppliers to freeze work on this, they said.
Ford is also negotiating new terms, including costs, for an engine Mahindra was to supply for its EcoSport SUV later this year, one of the people said. 
For two other SUVs that Ford is building for launch in 2023 and 2024, the plan had been to use Mahindra engines. If it walks away from that deal, Ford will need to find another supplier or invest in upgrading its own engines, two sources said.
It will come down to a cost versus profit analysis and that ""hinges on discussions with Mahindra,"" one of the sources said.
At a town hall earlier this month, Dianne Craig, president of international operations, said Ford was exploring all options when asked about the company's plans following the end of the Mahindra relationship.
Ford's average sales in India have languished at around 90,000 units a year prior to the economic slowdown in 2019 and the pandemic in 2020. But exports are nearly double what it sells in the domestic market and that helps it make money.
While Ford India reported pre-tax profits over the last three years, its biggest hurdle in India is low plant utilisation of around 53% over a five-year average. 
Even as it thinks about bringing global products to India - its Territory SUV in China is an option - Ford will need to look at several factors including competition, new fuel efficiency rules and its ability to make money in a price-sensitive market to ensure success.
India's competitiveness as an export base for affordable cars will also play a role, two sources said.

""If Ford decides to invest more in India it needs to know by when it can recover that investment,"" one source said.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>","Fed up with loans, COVID-hit Spanish restaurants seek direct aid","By Jesús Aguado and Emma Pinedo
MADRID (Reuters) - Evaristo Pose says he has lost 86,000 euros ($104,000) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing him to dip into his savings to keep his central Madrid restaurant ""Dominguez"" afloat.
The restaurant, which caters mostly to office workers in the Spanish capital, suffered an 80% drop in revenue last year. Like many other Spanish restaurateurs, Pose, 46, wants direct state aid to compensate him for restrictions that have forced him to stay shut or operate at reduced capacity. 
While the government says it is preparing new measures to bolster corporate solvency, Pose is not sure how much longer he will be able to keep his five remaining staff after putting seven employees on furlough schemes.
The hospitality sector is complaining that, while other countries have helped small businesses with measures such as a valued-added tax cut for the catering industry in Germany or a reduction in social security charges in France, Spain has mainly provided state-backed loans.
""I didn't want to take on loans because that would have just meant piling up more debt, I want direct aid,"" said Pose.
His restaurant, which was serving 180 meals per day before the pandemic, is now dishing up just 30, with most customers either working from home or fearful of eating out.
Around 300,000 restaurants and bars - hallowed institutions in the nation's life - have been affected by restrictions and a third of them could go bust in the first quarter of 2021, leading to up to 1.1 million direct and indirect job losses, according to the Hospitality Industry Association. 
Spain's tourism-dependent economy shrank a record 11% last year, driving unemployment up to 15.5%.
Emilio Gallego, secretary general of the hospitality association, said the sector's situation was critical and demanded 8.5 billion euros in urgent direct aid to help cover fixed costs, such as rent or taxes. 
Part of the funding the Spanish government is preparing could come from the European recovery programme for cohesion and the territories, known as REACT-EU, Gallego said. Spain has already started distributing this aid among its regions.
But he said more measures would be needed to get the country spending again once enough people have been vaccinated. That could include ""vouchers for families, cash for consumer spending, to spend a weekend away or to eat in a restaurant"".
COMPENSATION LAWSUIT
Begona Fraire, owner and chef of ""Etimo"" in Madrid's upmarket Salamanca district, has launched a platform called 'lahosteleriadetodos.org', where hundreds of bar and restaurant owners have joined forces to file a lawsuit against the government.
""We are all going to end up a little poorer after the pandemic, but if we manage to survive and get the government to help us ... I think this would do a lot to reduce unemployment and bring back tourism,"" said Fraire, who booked a loss of more than 100,000 euros last year.
Advised by Spanish law firm Cremades & Calvo-Sotelo, restaurateurs are seeking compensation worth 65% of their average annual revenue in the three years before 2020, when they say they suffered losses of 67 billion euros, according to documents from the lawsuit filed on Thursday.
Spanish Industry Minister Reyes Maroto told reporters in Seville on Thursday that she respected all hospitality sector initiatives, adding that the sector had been one of the most helped and that the government was now working on further solvency measures it hopes to announce by March.
But some restaurant owners say they fear their businesses will not survive.

Juan Jose Lopez, 62-year-old owner of ""La Tasquita de Enfrente"" restaurant and one of the signatories of the lawsuit, said the measures to curb the pandemic may have been effective, but ""totally disproportionate to owners as they have pushed us to the brink of insolvency"".

560,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 10:00AM ET</span>",AstraZeneca vaccine faces resistance in Europe after health workers suffer side-effects,"By Caroline Pailliez and Johan Ahlander
PARIS (Reuters) - Health authorities in some European countries are facing resistance to AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine after side-effects led hospital staff and other front-line workers to call in sick, putting extra strain on already-stretched services.
Such symptoms, as reported in clinical trials for the AstraZeneca shot, can include a high temperature or headache and are a normal sign that the body is generating an immune response. They usually fade within a day or so.
The other shots approved in Europe, developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), have been linked to similar temporary side-effects, including fever and fatigue.
But with the AstraZeneca shot the latest to be rolled out, health authorities in France have issued guidance to stagger giving the shot, two regions in Sweden paused vaccinations, and in Germany some essential workers are refusing it.
A spokesman for AstraZeneca said: ""Currently, the reactions reported are as we would expect based on the evidence gathered from our clinical trial programme."" 
People receiving the vaccine are closely monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities, the Anglo-Swedish drug maker said, adding that it was continuing to keep a close eye on the situation. 
""There have been no confirmed serious adverse events,"" the spokesman said.
'MORE SIDE-EFFECTS'
In France, which started administering the AstraZeneca shot on Feb. 6, staff at a hospital in Normandy experienced stronger side-effects than seen with the alternative vaccine from Pfizer and German partner BioNTech.
""AstraZeneca caused more side-effects than the Pfizer vaccine,"" said Melanie Cotigny, communications manager at Saint-Lo hospital in Normandy.
""Between 10% and 15% of those vaccinated may have side-effects from this vaccination, but it is only a feverish state, fevers, nausea and within 12 hours it goes away."" 
Following similar reports from other hospitals, the French medicines safety agency said on Feb. 11 that such side-effects were ""known and described"" but should be subject to surveillance with regard to their intensity. 
It also issued guidance to stagger vaccinations of front-line staff working together in teams to minimise the risk of disruption to operations.
The agency put out the advice after receiving 149 alerts of often strong flu-like side-effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine. During this period a total of 10,000 people received the shot nationwide.
Some U.S. hospitals and other organisations with front-line staff adopted a similar strategy when the country's vaccination programme started in December. The United States is administering shots from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.
In Britain, home to the AstraZeneca vaccine developed at Oxford University, the policy has been to make vaccinations readily available to hospital staff. As many work shifts, that naturally spaces out the process. 
The issues in France highlight how some doctors and hospitals are still learning how best to administer vaccines as governments race to tame the pandemic and get shots in arms as quickly as possible.
It's also the latest setback for the French vaccination campaign which has been criticised for a slow start. Last week, the government said just over 3% of the population had received their first dose.
In Sweden, two of 21 healthcare regions paused vaccinations of workers last week after a quarter called in sick after getting the AstraZeneca shot. 
The Sormland and Gavleborg regions said that around 100 out of 400 people vaccinated had reported fever or fever-like symptoms. Most cases were mild and in line with previously reported side-effects.
Both regions said they would resume vaccinations, and the Swedish Medical Products Agency saw no reason to change its vaccination guidelines.

AstraZeneca's vector-based vaccine is the third to win regulatory approval in the European Union.
As part of the European Medicines Agency's positive recommendation on Jan. 29, the watchdog concluded it was about 60% effective, compared to more than 90% for the vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.
It also deemed the product safe to use and it will monitor reports of side-effects as a matter of routine.
In Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn responded on Wednesday to reports that essential workers were reluctant to receive the AstraZeneca shot after some experienced strong side-effects, saying it was both safe and effective.
""I would be vaccinated with it immediately,"" Spahn told reporters. 
Like most European countries, German states typically do not offer people a choice of which vaccine they will get, leading in some cases to people not turning up to appointments to get the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Germany has taken delivery of 737,000 doses from AstraZeneca but only administered 107,000, according to figures from the health ministry and the Robert Koch Institute that leads its pandemic response.
""This vaccine is an excellent way to prevent serious COVID disease,"" said the health ministry in the eastern state of Saxony. ""Still, we note that there are still vacant vaccination dates for AstraZeneca. 

""From our point of view, it is wrong that this vaccine is available but not being used,"" it said, adding that it was reallocating spare shots to teachers and public health workers.

561,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 09:47AM ET</span>",Wall Street Falls at Open as Valuation Concerns Resurface; Dow Down 230 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell sharply at the opening on Thursday, after an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims sparked fears that trades anticipating an economic recovery in the course of the year may have gone too far, too fast. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 231 points, or 0.7%, at 31,382 points. The S&P 500 was likewise down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.0%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said initial jobless claims rose to 861,000 last week, instead of falling to 765,000 as expected. The news blunted the optimism that had been prompted by a strong retail sales report for January, which had been released on Wednesday. The figures suggested that the sharp rise in consumer spending enabled by stimulus checks was masking a much more severe weakness in the labor market, a point made repeatedly by Federal Reserve officials in recent weeks. 
Early trade was also overshadowed by a weaker-than-expected report from Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The big-box retailer's stock fell 6.1% after the company said sales will hardly grow in the next 12 months, after posting a solid 8% rise in the 12 months through January.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, both favorites of tech investors in recent years, also slipped by 1.7% and 1.0% respectively amid signs of rotation out of a sector that is richly priced and into names with less stretched valuations. Such rotations had appeared to gain an important endorsement earlier this week in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa)'s latest investment report, which showed that Warren Buffett's firm had trimmed its exposure to Apple and redeployed some of the proceeds to  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX),  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and insurance company Marsh & McLennan  (NYSE:MMC).
Chevron and other energy stocks gave up some of the gains they had posted in the wake of the spike in natural gas and oil prices that has been caused by the cold snap in Texas and other states.
Among other movers, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell 2.0% after the company's dispute with the Australian government over a new law that forces it to pay publishers for the news it carries took another twist. The social media giant blocked government information on the pandemic along with Australian media reports as it suspended the sharing of news, opening itself up to a fresh angle of criticism. 
One standout gainer was Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock. The cloud computing company stock rose 7.5% to a new all-time high after reporting better than expected earnings after the bell on Wednesday and upholding its forecast for 30% annual growth over the next four years. Before the results, the company - which still expects to be loss-making in the current quarter - was valued at over 30 times trailing 12 months sales. "

LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Asda ended its 22 years under Walmart (NYSE:WMT) ownership with accelerating underlying sales in the Christmas quarter, driven by strong demand for premium ranges.
Asda, now owned by the Issa brothers and private equity group TDR Capital, on Thursday reported a 5.1% rise in same-store sales over the three months to Dec. 31 - an improvement on third-quarter growth of 2.7%.
All of Britain's major supermarket groups performed strongly in the Christmas period, with coronavirus restrictions closing the hospitality sector and forcing many people to work from home.
""Asda’s growth during the period was driven by a notable shift in shopping behaviour, with customers trading up and spending more on premium categories at Christmas to treat themselves after a difficult year,"" it said.
Asda highlighted December sales of premium lines up 30% year on year and a 76% jump in online sales during the quarter.
The billionaire brothers and TDR completed the purchase of a majority holding in Asda from Walmart on Tuesday in a deal giving it an enterprise value of 6.8 billion pounds ($9.5 billion).
The deal still requires regulatory approval, with the parties subject to an enforcement order from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to ensure Asda continues to operate independently from its buyers while it conducts its investigation. 
The CMA has set an April 20 deadline for a ruling. The brothers and TDR have said they ""remain confident"" of a positive outcome.
The brothers and TDR are contributing only 780 million pounds, with the rest of the deal financed through 3.5 billion pounds of debt, the sale of Asda's 322 petrol forecourt sites to their own EG Group for 750 million pounds and the sale of its distribution centres.
While the brothers and TDR have called the capital structure ""robust"", some within Asda are uncomfortable with the level of debt, which is higher than rivals, and the planned sale of the petrol stations, said one source with knowledge of the situation.
The brothers have pledged to invest more than 1 billion pounds in Asda over the next three years.

Walmart will retain an equity investment in Asda, with an ongoing commercial relationship and a seat on the board.

Black, who founded Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc 31 years ago and turned it into one of the world's largest private equity groups, was cleared of any wrongdoing, but said he would retire by July and only keep his role as chairman.
An independent review conducted by law firm Dechert LLP found Black was not involved in Epstein's criminal activities. But it concluded Black paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017, according to the review.
Apollo said in January it plans to change its corporate governance structure, doing away with shares with special voting rights that currently give Black and other co-founders effective control of the firm.
The revelations of Black's ties to Epstein also led the firm's executives to warn in October that some investors had paused their commitments to Apollo's funds as they awaited the review's findings.
The company, however, said in January that despite the controversy, its assets under management grew by $22 billion in the final quarter of 2020 to $455 billion.
Clayton will assume the newly created role on March 1, Apollo said, adding that he was selected due to his professional experience and understanding of private and public capital markets.

Clayton was the SEC chairman from May 2017 to December 2020 and under his leadership the SEC pursued changes to regulations that critics saw as burdensome or hindering corporate growth, often in the face of opposition from Democrats and investor advocates. (https://reut.rs/3atC6IM)

569,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 07:11AM ET</span>",The Wall Street players at the GameStop hearing,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and John McCrank
BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The public will get the rare opportunity on Thursday to hear from big hedge fund managers who generally operate out of the spotlight, along with other players in the GameStop (NYSE:GME) trading frenzy who are scheduled to testify in the U.S. Congress. 
Founders of hedge funds Citadel and Melvin Capital Management and trading app Robinhood are due to speak at the hearing which will be livestreamed https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=407107. So are Keith Gill, who helped fuel the surge in GameStop with Reddit posts using the tag Roaring Kitty, and Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman.
The issues to be discussed are detailed in a memo https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20210218/111207/HHRG-117-BA00-20210218-SD002.pdf. 
GRIFFIN 
Founder and CEO Ken Griffin https://www.citadel.com/leadership/kenneth-c-griffin, 52, built both the Citadel LLC hedge fund and market making business Citadel Securities by investing in technology, data and traders. The businesses operate separately from each other. 
During the financial crisis Citadel's hedge fund stumbled badly to end 2008 with a 55% loss. The hypercompetitive Griffin rebounded, and in 2009 the flagship hedge fund gained 62%. Over its three decades the hedge fund has returned an average 19% a year.
In January, Citadel's hedge fund and securities trading businesses became central figures in the GameStop story for two reasons: Its order flow from Robinhood, the app many retail traders used to buy GameStop, and its role bailing out Melvin Capital after Melvin's short position on GameStop soured. 
Citadel Securities, led by Peng Zhao, competes with other market makers for Robinhood’s order flow and receives a large percentage of orders based on execution quality. It also pays Robinhood to process orders it receives. 
Griffin threw Melvin a $2 billion financial lifeline when it stumbled, saying he has ""great confidence"" in the team. In return he will get exposure to the fund's future returns in addition to a share of the revenue for years. 
The move was reminiscent of other times Griffin took advantage of trouble. In 2006, he bought an ailing energy portfolio from Amaranth Advisors and in 2007 he snapped up Sowood Capital’s credit portfolio.
TENEV 
Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev, 34, co-founded online broker Robinhood Markets Inc in 2013 with the goal of ""democratizing finance for all,"" by offering commission-free trading.
Tenev was born in Bulgaria, grew up in the Washington, D.C. area, and earned a math degree at Stanford University in California. He dropped out of a PhD program at UCLA to join his Stanford roommate Baiju Bhatt in business ventures. The pair started two New York-based trading software companies before founding Robinhood back in California. Lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic turbo-charged Robinhood's growth, especially among younger investors. The company boasts more than 13 million users and is valued at more than $20 billion, Reuters reported in December, with an IPO expected this year.
Lawmakers are likely to question Tenev about the trading app's decision to restrict trading during the GameStop frenzy, and Robinhood's role in the ""gamification"" of stock trading, which may promote risky trading among retail investors and has attracted scrutiny in Washington.
Tenev has faced heavy criticism from some Robinhood customers and has even been the target of death threats, according to Bloomberg. Robinhood declined to comment.
PLOTKIN 
Gabriel Plotkin, one of the world's most successful hedge fund investors, stated his aim succinctly in August on a YouTube video: ""Just get better every day."" He stuck to that motto for years, with 30% average annual returns from 2014 to 2020 at Melvin Capital, the fund named after his grandfather, a small businessman. 
    Plotkin honed his craft at SAC Capital Advisors. He left when SAC pleaded guilty to insider trading charges but did not cut ties with founder Steven A. Cohen who was among his first investors and had $1 billion invested in Melvin last year. 
    Over time, Plotkin developed expensive tastes, say people who know him. Last year he paid $44 million for side-by-side properties overlooking Miami's Biscayne Bay and in 2019 he bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Hornets basketball team. 
In January, the hedge fund lost 53% and its size shriveled from $12.5 billion to $8 billion largely because of a bet that GameStop's stock would fall. GameStop rose instead thanks to the Reddit rally.

Plotkin's short position in GameStop enraged some people so much that he received death threats. After GameStop's Reddit rally swamped Melvin with red ink, stunned investors, regulators and lawmakers want answers to Plotkin's risk management and how he had left his fund so vulnerable.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening slightly lower Thursday, consolidating after recent gains amid cautious trading ahead of key unemployment data, while the cold snap keeps oil prices elevated.  
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 80 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.4%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 100 points, or 0.7%. 
Stock markets struggled for a broad direction on Wednesday. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, to close at a record high of 31,613.02, the S&P 500 ended marginally lower and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.6%. 
Data Wednesday pointed to a strong economic recovery, with retail sales climbing 5.3% on the month in January and producer prices climbing more sharply that expected, but the Federal Reserve’s minutes from its last meeting emphasized that its monetary stance will nonetheless remain easy for some time.  
With this in mind, investors will likely pay careful attention to the weekly initial jobless claims, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).  These are expected to be around 765,000 for last week, which would be down from the 793,000 reported the previous week. Continuing claims are expected to be 4.1 million, down only slightly from 4.5 million the prior week.
Also due at the same time are housing starts for January, which are expected to be 1.66 million, down slightly from the prior month’s 1.67 million.
The corporate earnings season is starting to wrap up, but retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and hotel chain Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR)  all release its fourth-quarter numbers before the opening bell.  Walmart stock fell 4.8% in premarket after earnings fell some 9% short of forecasts and the company predicted a slowdown in sales growth this year. 
Aside from this, investors will likely focus Thursday on the Congressional hearing over the GameStop (NYSE:GME) saga on Capitol Hill, with the leaders of Melvin Capital, Citadel, Robinhood and Reddit expected to testify.  
Oil prices extended recent gains Thursday, as although the winter storm that crippled the Texas electrical grid is moving out of the state, freezing temperatures remain, hampering attempts to restore power.
U.S. Energy Information Administration oil inventory data is scheduled for release later. Stocks are expected to drop by 2.4 million barrels , following on from the industry's own estimate which showed a drop of 5.8 million on Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $61.46 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $64.63, both contracts having earlier climbed to their highest levels since January 2020.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,781.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at $1.2068.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were battling to avoid a second day of declines on Thursday as hints of rising inflation led by a one-year high in oil prices and the strongest copper prices in nearly a decade kept traders in check after a boisterous run up.
Europe's share markets managed to scrape together some early gains as commodities bulls drove drillers and miners up 2.5% to offset disappointing earnings numbers from companies including Airbus and Orange. 
Wall Street futures were stuck in the red, though, and most of Asia's indexes had dipped overnight. China returned from its Lunar New Year holiday to the sight its central bank draining 260 billion yuan ($40.31 billion) from money markets, raising concern about backdoor policy tightening. 
Government bond yields were taking a breather after the inflation-driven sell-off in global fixed income, although the commodities charge kept petro-currencies like the Canadian dollar, Norwegian crown and Russian rouble edging higher. 
""The clear theme right now is the reflation rotations and gyrations in markets all over the place,"" said Arnab Das, Invesco's global market strategist . 
Strong U.S. retail sales on Wednesday, signs the Federal Reserve plans to maintain its record low interest rates and a ""go big"" U.S. stimulus plan are all stoking optimism despite the coronavirus pandemic.
A deep freeze in Texas has continued to drive up oil prices too, as the unusually cold weather hampers output in the largest U.S. crude-producing state. 
Brent crude topped $65 a barrel for the first time in over a year on Thursday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $61.80 a barrel. Both are up over 300% since last April.
Benchmark copper prices on the London Metal Exchange rose as much as 2.4% to $8,595 a tonne as well. That is their strongest level since April 2012 and nearly double what they fell to in March last year as COVID worries erupted. 
Gold, considered an inflation hedge, snapped a five-day losing streak. Emerging-market stocks broke their longest winning streak since June as investors seized an opportunity to cash in some gains. 
In South Africa, shares were set for their worst day in three weeks after a study showed that  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine might not be effective against the country's aggressive COVID variant.
The world's best-performing currency this year - the Turkish lira - climbed another 0.5% as the central bank maintained its 17% interest rates and reiterated it could raise them again if needed.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse plans lending drive after smaller-than-expected fourth quarter loss,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on Thursday said it plans to up lending volumes and capitalise on a boom in share listings to shore up revenue, after low interest rates and legal charges tipped the bank into the red in the fourth quarter.
Switzerland's second-largest lender posted a 353 million Swiss franc ($392.8 million) net loss for the last quarter after booking 757 million francs in legal charges, beating analysts' forecasts for a 566 million franc loss but leaving annual profit down 22%.
The bank is now looking to boost its wealth management business by building up its China onshore presence and expanding elsewhere in Asia-Pacific, Chief Financial Officer David Mathers told Reuters in an interview.
It is also looking to allocate more capital to its international wealth management division outside Asia to ramp up lending, and said it saw net interest income beginning to steady after interest rates put pressure on the business last year.
The bank's shares were down 0.8% by 1045 GMT, as analysts pointed to mixed results.
The earnings cap a tumultuous year for Credit Suisse, which began with the ousting of Tidjane Thiam as chief executive over a spying scandal, and then the onset of the pandemic just as his replacement Thomas Gottstein took the helm.
Wealth managers have profited richly from bumper trading and client demand for greater counsel during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping rivals UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and Julius Baer Gruppe AG post windfall gains. 
Credit Suisse however faced setbacks in its core business last year everywhere except Asia.
Outside Asia, only Credit Suisse's investment bank managed to increase profits in 2020, as higher expected lending losses, headwinds from negative interest rates and a strong Swiss franc bit into earnings.
In the fourth quarter, revenue from fixed-income trading was down 8% year-on-year at 713 million Swiss francs, while equity sales and trading earnings were 5% lower at 498 million Swiss francs, underpeforming strong gains at some other investment banks. 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) on Thursday reported a stellar investment banking year, with strong revenues from its equities and fixed income businesses in line with U.S. peers.
Credit Suisse said it had started 2021 with its strongest January in a decade, with pre-tax income up across all divisions and investment bank and trading activities showing particular strength.
Factoring out one-off gains that boosted results in 2019 and set it back in 2020, it said it would have seen a 6% pre-tax profit gain for last year.
The Zurich-based bank is targeting 10% annual earnings growth in its wealth management business over the next three years.
REVERSAL OF FORTUNES
Gottstein, who became chief executive last February as the novel coronavirus was surging in China, is reconfiguring Credit Suisse's investment banking business and targets branch closures and a digital overhaul of its home business to cut costs.
Its standalone international wealth management unit, which covers rich clients outside Asia and Switzerland, saw net revenue fall 17% in 2020 as bumper trading failed to offset the impact of lower interest rates and a depressed U.S. dollar.
The division was also hit by a 414 million franc fourth-quarter impairment on a hedge fund equity stake, which impacted its struggling asset management business.
Its Swiss private client business, covering both wealthy home-market customers and the bank's only retail accounts, saw pre-tax profit dip 16% on weaker revenue and higher provisions for loan losses.
Its Asia-Pacific business meanwhile saw revenue rise 4% on higher transaction fees and the region's stronger recovery from the pandemic. That however failed to offset a jump in lending provisions, resulting in a 10% profit decline.
In a reversal of fortunes, Credit Suisse's investment bank, which has been the focus of overhaul efforts over the past five years, saw a surge in 2020 revenue, helping the business to its second consecutive year of profit gain.
The bank proposed a dividend of 0.2926 francs per share, up 5.4%, and said it had started a buyback in January as part of a total 1.0 billion-1.5 billion francs in buybacks it is targeting for this year.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>","Column: What you need to know about Medicare’s solvency problem, and how to fix it","By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The most urgent retirement issue facing the new Biden administration and Congress is not Social Security reform or figuring out how to boost savings in 401(k)s and IRA accounts.
Instead, it is a ticking clock in the Medicare program. Our health insurance program for seniors has a solvency problem - not ten or 20 years from now, but in just a few years. 
The financial stress impacts just one part of Medicare - Part A, which pays for hospital bills. Unlike other parts of Medicare, Part A is funded mainly through the Medicare payroll tax; parts B and D are financed through a combination of general government revenue and enrollee premiums.
The Medicare trustees projected last year that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will become insolvent in 2024 - less than three years from now. Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast a somewhat longer insolvency date due to an improving economic outlook - 2026. But we will have to wait and see what the Medicare trustees have to say a bit later this year. 
An easy way to understand the problem is by thinking of the trust fund as a checking account balance that receives Medicare’s payroll tax payments, and uses it to pay the bills. Without changes to expected spending or trust fund revenue, the checking account will run dry in 2024, and would have sufficient funds from current tax payments to meet just 90% of its obligations.
Shortfalls are nothing new for Medicare Part A - they generally are the result of rising healthcare costs. But this is only the second time insolvency has been predicted within five years. The financial cliff has drawn closer due to declining payroll tax receipts during the economic downturn. What to do about the problem? 
THE  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) OPTION: ADDITIONAL REVENUE
Plenty of options are available. We could add new revenue, raise the share of costs shouldered by enrollees, or cut benefits - or reduce payments to healthcare providers. The Commonwealth Fund - a foundation focused on healthcare policy - recently published a series of blog posts by Medicare experts https:// that does a good job of laying out these options and more. (https:// The solutions that make the most sense to me involve additional revenue. Cutting Medicare benefits just makes no sense, considering the precarious financial health of many retirees: half of Medicare beneficiaries lived on incomes below $29,650 in 2019 and 25% had incomes below $17,000, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation https:// (https:// Some of the Commonwealth Fund writers advocate further use of private-market competition to solve the problem, but I find these arguments unconvincing. The idea served up most frequently is premium support, a holdover idea from the last decade that would replace Medicare’s system of defined benefits with a defined government contribution - some would call it a voucher - that enrollees would use to buy in to either Original Medicare or privately offered Advantage plans.  Yet evidence shows that the marketplace approach already in place for prescription drug and Medicare Advantage plans does not work well https://nyti.ms/2OuhJm2 (https://nyti.ms/2OuhJm2). And in parts of the country where Original Medicare is more expensive than Advantage, this approach would create a lopsided playing field.  Injecting new revenue can be done without adding substantially to the burden of low- and middle-income households. The payroll tax rate that funds Part A (2.9% split evenly by employers and workers) could be lifted very gradually over a ten-year period - for example, a 1 percentage-point hike over ten years.  “It wasn't recommended by many of our expert contributors,” said Dr. Gretchen Jacobson, vice president for Medicare at Commonwealth. “But the payroll tax is the primary source of income for the trust fund, so any kind of increase does help to build up that base.” Moreover, the payroll tax rate for Medicare has not been changed since the late 1980s, even as the enrolled population and per-capita spending doubled. (The cap on the amount of wages subject to tax was eliminated in the early 1990s, making the tax more progressive and raising additional revenue.)  A more popular revenue idea suggested by Commonwealth’s experts would direct some or all revenue raised by the net investment income tax (NIIT) on high-income individuals into the Part A trust fund. The NIIT is a 3.8% tax on net investment income https:// and is paid by single tax-return filers with modified gross income of $200,000 and $250,000 for joint filers (https:// Currently, revenue collected through the NIIT goes into the government’s general coffers. That could shift enough revenue over a ten-year period into Part A to eliminate much of the shortfall. A solvency fix also could present an opportunity to improve benefits. For example, a reform package could add a hard cap on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, or add dental, vision and hearing benefits to Original Medicare. It also could include addition of a long-term care benefit, perhaps the most significant uncovered risk for most retirees.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>","Nestle outshines peers thanks to pet food, health products","By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle is aiming to boost organic sales growth towards 4% this year, the food giant said on Thursday, after strong demand for pet food and health products in the Americas helped its growth outshine peers last year.
Consumers have kept buying packaged food throughout the pandemic and the maker of Maggi soups and Nescafe instant coffee has fared better than some rivals by shedding underperforming businesses and investing in growth areas such as plant-based food, coffee and health science.
""We're seeing continued improvement in organic growth for the third year in a row now,"" CEO Mark Schneider told reporters on a call. 
""There's a possibility to cross over the 4% point (this year), which would be great, but in light of the uncertainties it's hard to commit to that right now.""
Schneider said pet food had had a stellar year and offered great opportunities to grow organically and through occasional bolt-on acquisitions.
He said he was not happy with the performance in China, where organic sales fell, and said teams were working hard to improve this year, with the recent Yinlu divestiture helping. 
Chief Financial Officer Francois-Xavier Roger said the group expected Asia, including China, to return to mid single-digit growth this year.
The Swiss group wants to achieve sustained mid single-digit growth in the medium term after organic sales grew 3.6% in 2020, ahead of consensus and peer Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s 1.9% underlying sales growth.
France's Danone is expected to post negative like-for-like growth on Friday. 
Nestle guided for a ""continued moderate"" improvement in its underlying trading operating margin this year. This is not a surprise, RBC analysts said, but could temper some more upbeat expectations also for the wider consumer staples sector.
Nestle improved the margin to 17.7% last year, within its mid-term target range of 17.5-18.5% it had already reached a year ago.
The company has been selling underperforming businesses and just offloaded its mainstream water brands in North America to private equity firms for $4.3 billion. 
Schneider reaffirmed Nestle's commitment to the rest of the water portfolio and also to confectionery.
Net profit fell slightly to 12.2 billion francs due to a non-recurring gain in the year-ago period, but beating expectations. Nestle proposed its 26th consecutive dividend increase to 2.75 Swiss francs per share. It also has a share buyback programme under way.
Shares in Nestle were flat at 1029 GMT, outperforming a slightly weaker European food sector index.

579,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 05:22AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Glasses Half Full at Barclays, Credit Suisse","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- ‘Diversity is strength’ appears to be the main takeaway from the current quarter of bank earnings in Europe.
The message was driven home again on Thursday by  Barclays  (NYSE:BCS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group, both of which reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter, albeit the latter’s reports also showed that the benefits of diversification come at a cost too.
The U.K.-based bank became the latest to announce the resumption of shareholder payouts, with a 1 penny cash dividend and a further 4 pence of share buybacks worth a total of 700 million pounds ($974 million).
Together with similar announcements from the likes of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Santander (MC:SAN) over recent weeks, that shows that the fog of Covid is gradually lifting, even though the slow pace of vaccine rollouts in the Eurozone mean that recovery there will be delayed by three months or more.
Credit Suisse’s results were - as always - more idiosyncratic, a comment on its own ability to get itself into and out of trouble. The bank swung to a fourth-quarter loss of 353 million Swiss francs thanks to losses on a New York hedge fund and a whopping 757 million litigation charge for past misconduct.  Strong performances in markets and in the key wealth management division helped rescue the quarter.
As with Barclays, the numbers were generally better than expectations, despite falling short of year-earlier comparisons. And as with Barclays, Credit Suisse did well in 2020 by hanging on to its investment banking division, whose trading and syndication performance helped offset the dismal performance of retail and commercial banking in a world of low or sub-zero interest rates.
Barclays’ investment bank revenue rose 22% last year, its best performance in six years, on the back of sustained high levels of volatility in markets. Shareholders will be relieved that they resisted the campaign by activist investor Edward Bramson (generously funded by Barclays’ rivals on Wall Street) for Barclays to ditch an arm that has provided a vital source of profit in an extraordinary year.
For sure, Barclays and Credit Suisse won’t be able to count on rivals continuing to pull out of investment banking at the same pace as they have in recent years. But even so, Barclays CEO Jes Staley was confident enough to push back against suggestions that the returns are likely to prove volatile.
Global capital markets have doubled in size in the last decade, creating a larger pool of activity, he told Bloomberg TV.
“There will be more consistency to the investment banking results than some people might speculate,” Staley said.
Barclays (LON:BARC) shares in London were still down 3.4% in London by mid-morning, while Credit Suisse (SIX:CSGN) shares were down 1.1% amid broad declines in European markets.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Barclays resumes dividend as annual profit halves,"By Lawrence White and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) has resumed modest shareholder payouts after a year-long hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, setting expectations other British lenders will follow suit when they report 2020 earnings in the next few days.
The resumption came as Barclays' profit fell by half, much less than forecast as a strong performance by its investment bank offset provisions against bad loans from the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Barclays shares, however, fell as much as 5%, after the payout plans and a vague outlook set out with no profit targets left investors underwhelmed.
The bank said its returns are likely to improve 'meaningfully', without giving any numbers, and said pressure on income at its loss-making consumer business was likely to continue over the medium term.
The investment bank outperformance is also unlikely to last, analysts warned, with further pain ahead as government stimulus packages for households and businesses are phased out.
""Overall a good set of numbers, but the focus is likely to be on the 2021 outlook statement which is very light on detail and so could lead to some disappointment,"" analysts at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said.
""There are some worrying signs in Barclays' retail arm, which has been battered by lower margins and the fact that people have been taking on less credit and paying down debts during coronavirus,"" said Adam Vetesse, analyst at investment platform eToro.
Barclays reported a profit before tax for 2020 of 3.1 billion pounds ($4.29 billion), well above an average of analyst forecasts of 1.96 billion pounds.
Barclays' investment bank had a stellar year, which in common with U.S. peers reported strong revenues from its equities and fixed income businesses as customers traded frantically in volatile markets in 2020.
The fixed income, currencies and commodities unit reported a 53% increase in income, as swings in global interest rates and prices of commodities such as oil drove trading.
Equities saw a 31% rise in income while banking fees rose by 8%.
That performance drove the bank's bonus pool up 6% for the year, although CEO Jes Staley's pay fell from 5.9 million to 4 million pounds as the bank failed to hit its overall profit goal for the year.
DIVIDENDS RETURN
Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also saw fourth-quarter profits sail past analysts' estimates, as coronavirus-induced volatility coupled with the impact of the U.S. elections boosted trading.
Barclays' European rival  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) meanwhile reported a comparatively weaker performance from its investment bank on Thursday.
Barclays saw impairments from bad loan provisions related to the pandemic dip to 492 million pounds in the fourth quarter, giving a full year total of 4.8 billion pounds.
The lender's consumer, cards and payments division reported a loss for the year of 1.1 billion pounds, mainly due to pandemic-linked provisions.
Barclays said on Thursday it would pay a full-year dividend of 1 pence per share and buy back 700 million pounds ($969.4 million) worth of stock, a vote of confidence in its balance sheet after regulators in December gave the green light for payouts.
The decision by Barclays to resume payouts will raise expectations that its peers will follow suit when they report earnings in the coming days.
Natwest is due to report on Friday, while HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) follow next week.
The Bank of England (BoE) had told Britain's seven biggest lenders in March to suspend dividends and share buy-backs until the end of 2020, to help them maintain capital buffers against the expected hit to their loan books from the pandemic.
The BoE said in December that banks looked strong enough to resume payouts, albeit within temporary caps.
Barclays gave no update on a probe by Britain's financial regulators into links between Staley and U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. 
Staley said at the time he regretted his links to Epstein, which began in 2000 while he was employed by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).

(Reuters) - European shares inched higher on Thursday as mining stocks tracked a jump in commodity prices and helped outweigh the impact from a clutch of disappointing earnings reports from companies including Airbus and Orange.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.1%, with miners jumping 2.5% as copper prices surged to their highest in nearly a decade. [MET/L]
Technology, retail and auto stocks were also among the top gainers in early trading, rising between 0.5% and 1.0% on hopes of a bumper U.S. fiscal stimulus package.
The benchmark STOXX 600 jumped to a one-year high this week as optimism around a global economic recovery fuelled demand for beaten-down sectors such as energy and banks, but recent expectations of a rise in inflation have fanned concerns that central banks could start tightening monetary policy.
However, bond yields in Europe and the United States pulled back slightly on Thursday after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting showed the central bank's commitment to maintaining an accommodative policy.
Investors are now focusing on the European Central Bank, which is due to release the minutes for its January meeting at 1230 GMT. [MKTS/GLOB]
Bank stocks, which typically track bond yields, fell 0.5% after hitting a near one-year high in the previous session.
""While the potential for a large stimulus package has raised some inflation concerns, we consider that the increase will likely only be transitory,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""Instead, recent trends primarily reflect optimism over the economic recovery and the reflation trade.""
Meanwhile, a slate of underwhelming European corporate earnings reports on Thursday revealed the extent of the damage from prolonged coronavirus-induced lockdowns and a slower-than-expected pace of vaccinations in the continent.
Planemaker Airbus fell 3.8% as it posted an annual loss and withheld a dividend due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while Orange, France's biggest telecoms group, lost 4.1% after reporting a drop in core operating profit in the fourth quarter.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) shed 3.5% even as it resumed modest shareholder payouts after a year-long hiatus.
In a bright spot, Swiss banking software system developer Temenos surged 14.2% and was on course for its best day in almost a year as it launched a share buyback programme of up to $200 million.

Overall, analysts expect earnings at STOXX 600 companies to decline by about 20% in the fourth quarter before rebounding nearly 43% year-on-year in the current quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) expects significant improvements in sales and operating profit in 2021 and will make up for lost production caused by a semiconductor chip shortage by the end of the year, the German carmaker said on Thursday.
The outlook sent shares in the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars up 2.5% in early trading.
Bottlenecks causing a shortage of semiconductor chips will hurt its sales mostly in the first quarter, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said. Much of the auto industry has struggled to maintain production levels because of the chip shortage.
The automaker also confirmed its preliminary financial results for 2020 and said economic conditions in it key markets should continue to return to normal and that it expected no further setbacks as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Like its rivals, Daimler is racing to bring more electrified models to market to meet tightening CO2 emissions standards in Europe and China. 
Chief Executive Ola Källenius said during a video conference on the carmaker's results that sales of electric vehicles in 2021 could double as a percentage of Daimler's overall sales.
Sales of plug-in hybrids and fully-electric vehicles made up 7.4% of Mercedes-Benz car sales in 2020, up from 2% in 2019.
Thanks to cost savings and a faster-than-expected recovery in the auto sector, Daimler said last month that its group earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for 2020 came to 6.60 billion euros ($7.95 billion).
Daimler said this month it planned to spin off Daimler Truck, the world's largest truck and bus maker, as it seeks to increase its investor appeal as a focused electric, luxury car business.
CHINA DEMAND SALVAGES YEAR
Daimler ended 2020 with adjusted free cash flow of 9.2 billion euros versus 2.7 billion a year earlier and its net liquidity improved to 17.9 billion euros from 11 billion.
Plant shutdowns in the first half of 2020 to slow the spread of the coronavirus led many in the industry to expect a disastrous year, but a market rebound spurred by China helped much of the industry recover far more quickly than expected.
Like its German rivals BMW and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Daimler benefited from Chinese consumers snapping up high-margin luxury vehicles, helping out premium brands like Mercedes-Benz and Audi during 2020.
""China had a remarkable recovery,"" Källenius said. 
Mercedes-Benz sales jumped more than 22% in China in the fourth quarter and 11.7% in 2020 despite the pandemic, hitting record sales of 770,000 vehicles.
While Daimler said it expected its premium car business to increase more than 7.5% in 2021, it said it expected its sales in China this year to grow at a slower pace of between 2% to 7.5%.
Daimler said it expects group revenue and operating profit for 2021 to rise more than 7.5%, with an adjusted margin from its Mercedes cars and van business of between 8% and 10%.

PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus axed its dividend for a second year and predicted flat deliveries this year as it braces for more coronavirus uncertainty after posting a 2020 loss.
The planemaker's decision to restore key business targets is the latest evidence of recovery hopes being watched by financial markets following the pandemic, which severely hurt air travel. 
Rival Boeing (NYSE:BA), mired in a separate crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX that saw Airbus reclaim the title of largest global jetmaker, is not yet giving detailed views.
But analysts expressed concerns that the deliberately cautious delivery forecast from Airbus jarred with the same company's plans to start unwinding cuts in jet production, albeit at a slower pace than initially planned.
Shares in Airbus fell 3.4% in early trading.
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the forecast was for ""at least"" 566 deliveries, unchanged from last year when production was 40% below its peak. This will give investors some visibility in a world in which the pandemic seems to be getting worse in the short term, he said.
The actual level of deliveries will depend on demand from airlines rather than supply chains or funding, he added.
A collapse in demand from carriers worldwide has left almost 100 jets sitting outside Airbus factories, down from a peak of around 145. But any shortfall in deliveries compared to factory production could drive the costly stockpile higher again.
""...we remain cautious about the pace at which the airline industry can rebuild its balance sheet to the point where aircraft demand rises significantly,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sandy Morris wrote.
ORDER BOOK HIT
In a sign of the strain on airline finances, Airbus sliced 100 billion euros ($120.5 billion) or 20% off the value of its unfilled order book to 373 billion euros. 
While the coronavirus crisis has raised doubts over the ability of airlines to honour contracts, Airbus said the decrease also reflected an unusually low set of new orders during the crisis and a weakening of the U.S. dollar. 
Airbus posted a 2020 operating loss of 510 million euros, weighed by charges booked in previous quarters, notably for restructuring and the closure of the loss-making A380 programme.
On a widely watched adjusted basis, Airbus stayed in the black but saw operating profit drop 75% to 1.7 billion euros as plunging airline demand drove revenues down 29% to 49.9 billion euros. 
The company's helicopter division outperformed.
For 2021, Airbus predicted 2021 adjusted operating profit of 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion).
Stronger than expected jet deliveries in the fourth quarter helped Airbus generate 4.9 billion euros in cashflow before M&A and customer financing, beating a quarterly break-even target.
For the year as a whole, Airbus spent 6.9 billion euros, as the impact of the coronavirus crisis came hard on the heels of a record 3.6 billion euro bribery fine agreed in early 2020. Airbus said it expected free-cashflow breakeven in 2021.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday, as investors focused on corporate earnings with the likes of banking giants  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) reporting.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.1%.
European markets have rallied strongly of late, helped by the belief that the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines will lead to a sharp increase in economic growth and also by a strong earnings season.
At the end of last week,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) calculated that 60% of the European companies have beaten EPS estimates, while 18% have missed so far.
“This is a very strong outcome, and puts 4Q20 on track to deliver the broadest beat on data back to 2007,” the U.S. investment bank said in a research note. “Banks have been a key source of net beats, with 80% of the sector beating so far.” 
The sector received less shareholder support Thursday, with Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) stock falling 0.5% after the Swiss bank recorded a 353 million Swiss franc ($392.79 million) net loss for the fourth quarter, weighed down by provisions for a legal dispute over property debt in the United States.
Barclays (LON:BARC) stock fell 1.5% as the U.K. bank reported a halving of its annual profit. That said, it still resumed dividend payouts after a year-long hiatus due to the pandemic, while also announcing a share buyback of up to 700 million pounds.
Elsewhere, Airbus (PA:AIR) stock fell 3.2% after the European plane maker posted a full-year loss for 2020 and withheld a dividend. Orange (PA:ORAN) stock slumped 5% after France's biggest telecoms group reported a drop in core operating profit in the fourth quarter.
In Germany, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) stock climbed 0.9% after ending talks with Liberty Steel about potentially selling its steel division and saying it will try to make the business sustainable on its own. Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) stock rose 2.2% after the car manufacturer said it expects significant improvements in sales and operating profit in 2021, making up for lost production caused by a semiconductor chip shortage by the end of the year.
The economic data slate is largely empty as far as Europe is concerned, but not so in the U.S. Weekly initial jobless claims are expected to be around 765,000, which would be down from the 793,000 reported the previous week, while housing starts for January are forecast to be 1.66 million, slightly lower than the previous month.
Oil prices extended recent gains Thursday, as the arctic blast hitting Texas and other oil-producing states continued to hamper production.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 03:20AM ET</span>",Japan must toughen regulation if 'joint approach' e-commerce law falls short: lawmaker,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese policymakers must keep open the option of toughening regulations on technology giants if an e-commerce law introduced this month does not work as expected, said a lawmaker overseeing the ruling party's deliberations on competition policy.
Japan on Feb. 1 joined a global trend towards increased scrutiny of possible antitrust activity by big tech names with legislation requiring disclosure of information such as terms of contracts with business partners, how search rankings operate and reasons for suspending or refusing vendors.
The law, which offers leeway in how much information companies must submit, comes as authorities in Europe, Australia and elsewhere confront the clout of global e-commerce and social media firms, concerned of their significant market dominance.
""If this joint regulatory approach isn't sufficient, we have to make rules going a step further,"" Tatsuya Ito, a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
Ito, who oversees competition policy in the LDP's powerful policy research council, described the law as ""light-touch"", saying policymakers must assess how it is working before taking any further steps or expanding its scope.
Japan's e-commerce market was worth 19 trillion yen ($180 billion) in 2019. Its app store market reached $20.2 billion in 2020, showed data from App Annie.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc and Rakuten Inc were the largest e-commerce operators in 2018, while the app store market was split between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, showed a 2019 report from the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC).
Under the new law, operators of shopping sites and app stores with annual Japan revenue of at least 300 billion yen and 200 billion yen respectively must submit annual reports to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
The ministry can then issue improvement orders if operators do not follow its recommendations, or refer operators to the JFTC if it suspects antitrust activity.
Critics, however, said the law lacks teeth when compared with those planned by the European Union, under which regulators can impose fines and even break up firms.
Antitrust expert Yosuke Okada, a professor at Hitotsubashi University, said the law is more of a cooperation type of regulation aimed at gathering information on firms' operations.
""It isn't a framework in which businesses are regulated in great detail,"" he said.
Moreover, any imposition of fines would likely require large-scale reform of anti-monopoly law, Ito said.
""It's important to see how much results can be got while moving ahead with making rules and responding to digital platformers,"" he added.
Separately on Wednesday, the antitrust watchdog outlined actions in digital advertising that may constitute abuse of any dominant bargaining position. Such actions include inappropriate use of personal data and unilateral change to contract terms.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening in a mixed fashion Thursday, with investors focusing on corporate earnings ahead of key U.S. economic data.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1%, and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%.
European markets have rallied strongly of late, helped by the belief that the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines will lead to a sharp increase in economic growth.
Also helping the tone has been the strong earnings season to date, suggesting that the corporate sector has weathered the latest shutdowns far better than the first round.
At the end of last week,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) calculated that 60% of the European companies have beaten EPS estimates, while 18% have missed so far.
“This is a very strong outcome, and puts 4Q20 on track to deliver the broadest beat on data back to 2007,” the U.S. investment bank said, in a research note. “Banks have been a key source of net beats, with 80% of the sector beating so far.” 
This continued Thursday, as although  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) recorded a 353 million Swiss franc ($392.79 million) net loss for the fourth quarter, weighed down by provisions for a legal dispute over property debt in the United States, this was still ahead of expectations.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) also beat expectations,  announcing a share buyback of up to 700 million pounds.
Elsewhere, Air France-KLM announced a 7.1 billion euro ($8.5 billion) net loss for 2020. Airbus also posted a full-year loss for 2020, resulting in the European planemaker withholding a dividend, but it also restored its business targets after generating cash in the fourth quarter.
In a busy day for corporate earnings, investors will also be watching out for results from the likes of Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), Orange,  Carrefour  (PA:CARR),  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY),  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Nestle.
The economic data slate is largely empty as far as Europe is concerned, but not so in the U.S. Weekly initial jobless claims are expected to be around 765,000, which would be down from the 793,000 reported the previous week, while housing starts for January are forecast to be 1.66 million, slightly lower than the previous month.
Oil prices extended recent gains Thursday, as the arctic blast hitting Texas and other oil-producing states continued to hamper production.
Additionally, U.S. crude oil stocks fell by 5.8 million barrels last week, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute, when a draw of just over 2 million barrels had been expected.
U.S. Energy Information Administration oil inventory data is scheduled for release later on Thursday, delayed by a day after Monday’s holiday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $61.59 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $64.90, both contracts climbing to their highest levels since January 2020.

PARIS (Reuters) - Renewed COVID-19 lockdowns are pushing Air France-KLM deeper into the red, the airline group warned on Thursday, as it chalked up a 7.1 billion euro ($8.5 billion) net loss for 2020 and postponed a key mid-term profitability goal.
The airline group expects to fly 40% of its pre-crisis capacity in January-March, as tougher travel curbs in France and beyond widen losses from the 407 million euros in negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) recorded in the fourth quarter.
The past year has ""tested the Air France-KLM Group with the most severe crisis ever experienced by the air transport industry,"" Chief Executive Ben Smith said.
The worsening travel outlook threatens to ruin Europe's critical summer season and leave major carriers in need of another round of funding support, analysts warn.
Air France-KLM last year received 10.4 billion euros in loans and guarantees from France and the Netherlands and is negotiating the terms of a state-backed recapitalisation, with EU regulators pushing for airport slot concessions.
The Air France business recorded a 989 million-euro operating loss last quarter, more than six times wider than KLM's 152 million-euro deficit. Performance disparities have in the past sharpened Franco-Dutch tensions between the airlines and their government shareholders.
The cargo business, a bright spot for many airlines as grounded flights push up freight prices, saw unit revenues more than double in the fourth quarter.
The quarterly net loss of 1 billion euros was less than the 1.31 billion deficit analysts expected, according to the company's own consensus polling. Revenue fell 64.3% to 2.36 billion euros on a 78% traffic decline.
Operating cash flow was a negative 2.12 billion euros last quarter, and net debt increased by 4.9 billion over the year to 11.05 billion as of Dec. 31, against 9.8 billion in liquidity.
Air France-KLM cut its workforce by 10% or 8,700 full time-equivalent positions in 2020 and expects to eliminate a further 6,000 ""in coming years,"" it said.
The group also flagged a likely further postponement of the 7-8% operating-margin objective it had pushed back last July by a year to 2025. The goal is ""unchanged but delayed,"" it said on Thursday, giving no new target date.

Amsterdam has attracted companies in trading and finance, medicine and agriculture, as well as logistics and distribution looking to secure their European operations as Britain departed the European Union.
The agency said 78 ""Brexit"" companies moved to the Netherlands last year, the same number as in 2019 lifting the total since the 2016 Brexit referendum to 218.
A record 550 businesses are currently in discussions with the agency about a relocation or expansion in the Netherlands, up from 425 last year.
Amsterdam is already poised to be Europe's number one corporate listing venue this year and in January data showed it displacing London as Europe's biggest share trading centre.
The 2020 arrivals are expected to generate a combined 6,000 jobs and 544 million euros ($654.98 million) of investments in the first three years, the agency said.
They include British companies, but also businesses from America and Asia that are shifting European operations, it said.
""Not only are the amount of contacts continuing to grow, the number of Brexit companies that have opted for the Netherlands is also increasing,"" the agency said in a statement. ""In effect, the uncertainty of recent years has not disappeared.""
Even after a divorce deal was reached between Brussels and Britain, Amsterdam has remained a popular destination, along with rivals Frankfurt and Paris.

There were signs that the bond market sell-off is beginning to ease, with yields on two-year Treasuries dropping to a record low and the ten-year yield extending a pullback from a one-year high.
Positive U.S. data that was released overnight, and indications of a continued accommodative stance from the Federal Reserve, also continued to boost shares.
The data said that core retail sales grew 5.9% month-on-month in January, compared to the 1% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 1.8% fall recorded in December. The Producer Price Index grew 1.3% month-on-month in January, higher than the forecast 0.4% growth and December’s 0.3% growth.

The merger could significantly hurt competition in commercial risk, reinsurance and employee benefits broking and advisory services in Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. 
The pandemic has triggered a sharp rise in claims for insurers and hit their investment portfolios, which along with falling valuations have sparked several deals in the insurance industry.
Aon bid for Willis in March last year in an all-stock deal, which was the insurance sector's largest ever.
Representatives of Aon and Willis declined to comment on the matter. 
The regulator said the deal may lead to price increases or reduced service levels for large or high-value commercial insurance customers and may also limit the insurance coverage and pricing smaller brokers could get for their customers.
It was particularly concerned about the effects of the merger on reinsurance broking services, which it deemed vital for the Australian economy. 
Australian insurers have been hit by claims from natural disasters such as wildfires and hailstorms and have bumped up their reinsurance covers in recent times to help shield the impact of these unforeseen large-scale payouts. 
The European Commission had raised similar concerns about the deal in December, but suspended its investigation in February as it waited for the U.S. insurance broker to provide data required for the case.

The ACCC said feedback on the issues it had raised was due by March 12.

(Reuters) - Wall Street hedge fund managers, the chief executives of Robinhood and Reddit and a YouTube streamer known as Roaring Kitty on Wednesday defended their roles in GameStop (NYSE:GME)'s Reddit-fueled stock rally before they face a grilling by lawmakers.
They insisted that while the market turmoil around the stock was unprecedented, there was no foul play, according to official testimony published by the House Financial Services Committee a day before a scheduled hearing. (https:// Last month's Reddit rally drove massive volatility in GameStop and other shares, prompting the post-trade clearing houses that guarantee trades to call for billions of dollars in collateral from Robinhood and other retail trading platforms. In response, many suspended buying in the affected stocks on Jan. 28. This outraged lawmakers, who questioned if the trading platforms were siding with hedge funds that had bet against the shares over Mom and Pop investors.  Vladimir Tenev, CEO of online brokerage Robinhood, wrote in his testimony that the decision to halt buying was solely due to the need to meet regulatory capital requirements.  Gabriel Plotkin said he was ""humbled"" when his hedge fund Melvin Capital Management suffered significant losses on the short end of the trade, but insisted his firm did not push Robinhood to suspend trading. Likewise, Ken Griffin, CEO of hedge fund Citadel LLC and majority owner of Citadel Securities, a market maker that handles most of Robinhood's customer orders, disputed speculation that his firm tried to influence Robinhood's decision. ""I want to be perfectly clear: We had no role in Robinhood’s decision to limit trading in GameStop or any other of the 'meme' stocks. I first learned of Robinhood’s trading restrictions only after they were publicly announced,"" he wrote. Keith Gill, who touted his GameStop investment for months on his Roaring Kitty YouTube channel and Reddit, insisted his position was solely based on publicly known fundamentals of the business and it was ""preposterous"" to suggest he sought to entice unwitting investors to buy shares. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company had analyzed traffic on the Reddit sub-feed WallStreetBets where users congregate to discuss stocks. The company found no bots, foreign agents or bad actors played a significant role in a traffic that helped drive interest in GameStop.

He provided extensive detail on demands from clearing houses for the firm to put up billions of dollars in additional collateral to meet regulatory requirements.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 08:00PM ET</span>",Boeing reminds pilots to monitor planes closely following Indonesia crash-bulletin,"(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co issued a technical bulletin to airlines reminding them to ensure pilots closely monitor the airplane's state and flight path to prevent a loss of control in flight, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The bulletin, dated Feb. 15., was sent after Indonesia issued a preliminary report into a Jan. 9 Sriwijaya Air crash that killed all 62 people on board a 737-500.
It was not explicitly linked to that crash and covers all modern Boeing models but it addresses one of the potential areas of interest for investigators following the accident, pending the discovery of the cockpit voice recorder memory unit.
""Continual crew awareness of airplane attitude, airspeed, flight control position and thrust settings is fundamental for airplane upset prevention and can reduce the effect of startle or surprise caused by rapid unexpected changes,"" the bulletin said.
Manufacturers have periodically issued such reminders and Boeing said it regularly communicates with customers on how they can safely and confidently operate their airplanes.
""In close coordination with investigative and regulatory authorities, these latest communications reinforce the importance of industry-wide and Boeing guidance and training materials on aircraft upset prevention and recovery,"" the U.S. planemaker said.
Bloomberg first reported on the issuance of the bulletin.
Boeing, which was criticised for blaming pilots over a 2018 737 MAX crash in Indonesia later tied to a faulty system, has not issued any comment on the causes of the Sriwijaya crash.
According to an industry-wide safety analysis issued by Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) last year, loss of control in-flight represents the largest category - or 33% - of all accidents since the start of the jet age.
Safety experts caution it is too early to say what caused the Sriwijaya crash. Most accidents are caused by a chain of separate factors.
The Sriwijaya preliminary report found the plane had an imbalance in engine thrust that eventually led it into a sharp roll and then a final dive into the sea. 
When the plane reached 8,150 feet (2,484 m) after take-off, the left engine throttle lever moved back while the right lever stayed in its original position. 
One of the pilots was speaking to air traffic control and there is no evidence in the report that they noticed a difference in thrust.

At about 10,900 feet, the autopilot disengaged and the plane rolled to the left more than 45 degrees and started its dive, crashing around 25 seconds later, the report said.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) will block news content from being read and shared in its news feed in Australia, drawing a line in the sand against a proposed Australian law that would require it and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google to pay the country's news publishers for content. 
The move, announced in a blog post on Wednesday, represents a divergence in responses among the big tech giants to demands by news publishers, which have blamed the companies for destroying their advertising business. (Blog: https:// Australia Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had a ""constructive discussion"" with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, adding the talks with the company on the proposed media payment law would continue. ""(Zuckerberg) raised a few remaining issues with the government's news media bargaining code and we agreed to continue our conversation to try to find a pathway forward,"" Frydenberg said in a tweet. The Australian federal government has said it plans to put the legislation, which effectively force Google and Facebook to strike deals with media companies or have fees set for them, to a vote in the coming weeks. Google has also threatened to shut down its search engine in the country to avoid ""unworkable"" content laws even as it has secured deals with publishers in the United Kindgom, Germany, France, Brazil and Argentina for its Google News Showcase product.  On Wednesday, Google reached a landmark global deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), owner of the Wall Street Journal and two-thirds of Australia's major city newspapers, to develop a subscription platform and share advertising revenue. Facebook said the proposed legislation ""fundamentally misunderstands"" the relationship between itself and publishers, arguing that news outlets voluntarily post their article links on Facebook, which helped Australian publishers earn about AU$407 million in 2020 through referrals. Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, tweeted on Wednesday that the relationship was not as voluntary as it seems, and most publishers feel obligated to be on Facebook due to its dominance.  Facebook, which has long been criticized for allowing misinformation to flourish on its platforms, now finds itself in a peculiar position of also blocking the news media that has provided a fact check on false content. ""Nobody benefits from this decision as Facebook will now be a platform for misinformation to rapidly spread without balance,"" said a spokesman for Nine, an Australian television network. ""This action proves again their monopoly position and unreasonable behaviour."" 
Starting on Wednesday, Australian users will not be able read or share news content on Facebook news feeds, and Australian news publishers will be restricted from posting or sharing content on Facebook pages.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Antitrust regulators will likely lengthen their investigation into  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT)'s proposed purchase of rocket maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD) Inc, industry executives said, since the deal would give the No. 1 defense contractor ownership of a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry. 
The $4.4 billion dollar deal, announced late last year, has raised eyebrows because Lockheed would take over a company that produces 70% of the solid fuel rocket motors and other propulsion products used in everything from antiballistic missiles, to air-to-air missiles.
On Thursday the chief executive of one of Aerojet's biggest customers, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, said his company would speak with anti-trust regulators because they have ""concerns"" about the deal.
""If that merger actually happens, you don't have an independent supplier in the solid rocket motor side,"" Greg Hayes said at the Barclay's Industrial Select Conference on Wednesday. Hayes said, ""we're going to make our concerns known to [antitrust enforcers]and the Department of Defense, and we'll see how this whole thing plays out."" The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the deal for the government, the people said. 
Lockheed competes against Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) when it sells tactical missiles, often fired from jets, to the Pentagon. 
Lockheed's CEO, Jim Taiclet, said the deal could put Lockheed into a strong position in the growing propulsion and hypersonic weapons market. 
Still, Taiclet has said Lockheed would simultaneously remain a partner to Aerojet's current customer base by ""providing outstanding propulsion products for the entire industry."" 
The merger, announced on Dec. 20, is in its 60-day antitrust review period that expires at midnight Thursday and is widely expected be extended by the FTC, allowing the agency more time for review.

Lockheed has anticipated the deal could take until the second half of the year to close.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Gabriel Plotkin will on Thursday explain his hedge fund's massive losses in the GameStop (NYSE:GME) trading frenzy, and he plans to tell U.S. lawmakers that Melvin Capital Management follows securities laws, does not manipulate stocks and conducts extensive research before making bets.
Plotkin, long one of the hedge fund industry's most admired traders, became one of the financial industry's most vilified players last month when an army of retail investors pushed the video retailer's stock much higher after his hedge fund bet that it would fall.
Plotkin will deliver prepared remarks and answer questions for the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services, giving his most detailed public description yet of events that unnerved markets for days.
In the prepared testimony released on Wednesday, Plotkin said his firm, named for his grandfather, is paid to take a view on a company's future. Corporations that ""create jobs, grow the economy, and develop new products for consumers,"" are added to the portfolio as long positions while others with less certain business models or outlooks might be shorted, or bet against.
Melvin Capital had been short GameStop, which sells new and used video games in stores, for six years, believing its business model was being ""overtaken by digital downloads through the internet,"" Plotkin said. He closed the position in January.
He said he follows all rules for shorting and was not part of ""any effort to artificially depress or manipulate downward the price of a stock.""
When GameStop's share price marched higher from $17 to a peak of $483, Melvin Capital found itself in trouble so deep that the firm had to cover its short positions and sell other parts of the portfolio to limit losses.
In four weeks in January, the fund lost 53%, roughly the same amount it had earned in the entire year of 2020. Plotkin's mentor Steven A. Cohen and Kenneth Griffin, who runs hedge fund Citadel LLC, gave Melvin Capital a $2.75 billion dollar lifeline, Plotkin said, although he insisted the fund was not ""bailed out"" and did not seek ""a cash infusion.""
Plotkin, part owner of the Charlotte Hornets professional basketball team, took a contrite tone in his statement, saying it is his duty and job to earn back the money he lost for the college endowments, charitable foundations and retirees who entrusted him to oversee their nest eggs.

""I am personally humbled by what happened in January,"" Plotkin said, adding ""Investors in Melvin suffered significant losses. It is now our job to earn it back.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's attorney general filed a lawsuit on Wednesday to shut down the cryptocurrency platform Coinseed Inc for allegedly defrauding thousands of investors, including by charging hidden trading fees and selling ""worthless"" digital tokens.
Attorney General Letitia James said Coinseed traded cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin without registering as a broker-dealer, and sold ""CSD"" tokens without authorization to raise money for its mobile application startup.
James also sued Coinseed Chief Executive Delgerdalai Davaasambuu and former Chief Financial Officer Sukhbat Lkhagvadorj, saying they overstated the midtown Manhattan-based company's management experience, while Lkhagvadorj misrepresented himself as a former Wall Street trader.
Coinseed's fraud totaled more than $1 million, according to James, who is also seeking restitution for investors.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related lawsuit against Coinseed and Davaasambuu over the tokens, which both regulators said were sold from December 2017 to May 2018.
""I'm 100% sure that the suit is full of false accusations,"" Davaasambuu said in an email, referring to James' lawsuit. ""It's very strange that they're blaming the very nature of how a startup works.""
Lkhagvadorj could not immediately be reached for comment.
Both defendants have residences in Long Island City, New York, but Davaasambuu has expressed an intention to return to his native Mongolia, James said.
""Unregulated and fraudulent virtual currency entities, no matter how big or small, will no longer be tolerated in New York,"" James said in a statement.
The attorney general said Coinseed had touted the CSD token as ""a great opportunity for young people who want to make money in the crypto market,"" and that the mobile app was ""guaranteed"" to help push its market value higher.
""In truth, nearly three years later, the CSD token has not been listed anywhere,"" her lawsuit said.

James' lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court alleged violations of the Martin Act, a New York state securities law. The SEC's lawsuit is in Manhattan federal court.

Investing.com -- As bitcoin soared above $52,200 on Wednesday, central bankers confirmed the economic recovery will take some time, leaving no doubt rates will remain near zero amid massive moves to stimulate growth.
The minutes of the Federal Reserve’s January rate-setting meeting said the economy is still far from employment and inflation goals.
Retail sales rebounded in January, rising 5.3% from a decline in December, topping economists forecast for a 1.1% increase. Job data due out on Thursday could show some progress in getting people back to work -- or not.
Still, with vaccines rolling out and another round of stimulus from Washington, the reopening trade could just be in the early innings. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average set another record high, as energy helped offset tech-driven declines. The U.S. energy sector is getting a boost from a cold snap in the South that interrupted operations in oil and natural gas.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow. 
1. The weekly jobless readings
Initial jobless claims are expected to be around 765,000, which would be down from the 793,000 reported the previous week, but the trend is still elevated and indicates businesses are still struggling with the pandemic fallout.
Continuing claims are expected to be 4.1 million, down only slightly from 4.5 million the prior week. Both numbers get reported at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
2. Housing starts
Another sign of recovery is home buying, something that was a hot topic last year as families left cities for the relative space of the suburbs. 
Housing starts for January are expected to be 1.66 million, down slightly from the prior month’s 1.67 million. But the trend is clearly on the upswing over the last several months after hitting below 1 million in June and May of last year. The data also comes out at 8:30 AM ET.
3. Oil inventories
With Crude Oil WTI Futures oil above $60 this week after a cold snap in the U.S. South disrupted production, we get inventory data for the prior week.
Crude stocks are expected to drop 2.4 million. A drop in inventory can be seen as a positive sign for demand. The data is expected out at 11:00 AM ET after a holiday delay of one day. The industry's own estimate on Wednesday said crude stocks dropped 5.8 million barrels last week.

Investing.com - Tilray jumped in after-hours trade Wednesday after the marijuana producer reported fourth-quarter results that markedly beat expectations on strong demand from abroad.  
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) jumped more than 14% in after-hours trade.
The company reported a Q4 loss of 2 cents per share on revenue of $56.56 million, much improved from the $2.14 loss per share and revenue of $46.9 million seen last year. That was also ahead of analysts consensus forecasts for a loss of 14 cents a share on revenue of $56.0 million.  
The beat on the top and bottom lines were led by its cannabis business, with sales rising 46% to $41.2 million, mainly driven by the acceleration of international medical sales, up 191%, and Canadian adult-use sales, up 49%.
""Canadian medical sales grew 26% and there were no bulk sales to other license producers. Hemp segment revenue decreased 18% to $15.3 million (C$20.5 million) primarily due to a shift to private label product with a large customer and the impact of COVID-related changes to consumer shopping patterns,"" the company said.
Total cannabis kilogram equivalents sold decreased 54% to 6,901 kilograms from 15,039 kilograms in the prior year’s fourth quarter, but the average cost per gram sold increased 37% to $3.24. 
The surge in Tilray post-market close lifted other cannabis stocks higher. Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA), Canopy Growth Corp (NASDAQ:CGC) and Aurora Cannabis Inc (NYSE:ACB) were all sharply higher.
Cannabis stocks have been on a wild ride of late, going on a Reddit-fueled rally earlier this month, before giving back some gains. The stronger quarterly results from cannabis producers of late, however, will likely add further conviction for Redditors to hold, or ""diamond hands,"" the cohort of cannabis stocks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq closed lower while the S&P 500 was little changed on Wednesday as investors rotated out of technology shares and concerns about inflation added some pressure on stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose, however, aided in part by gains in shares of  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) Those stocks gained after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc disclosed major investments in the companies on Tuesday. Verizon shares climbed 5.2%, and Chevron shares advanced 3%. 
Technology shares led losses on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp weighed most on both indexes. The S&P 500 tech index ended 1% lower.
Conversely, energy rose 1.5% to lead gains among S&P 500 sectors as a halt in Texas oil production boosted crude prices. A strong rebound in U.S. retail sales helped consumer discretionary stocks advance 0.7%. 
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq pared losses while the Dow added to gains after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's January policy meeting. 
All of the meeting's participants supported the decision to maintain an accommodative monetary policy. The Fed has pledged to pin interest rates near zero until inflation rises to 2% and looks set to exceed that goal.
""The market is accurately reflecting the combination of continued low interest rates and a continued accomodative Fed,"" said Oliver Pursche, president of Bronson Meadows Capital Management in Fairfield, Connecticut.
Yet the Fed's accomodative stance, coupled with President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion package for pandemic relief, has some analysts warning of a coming surge in inflation. As a result, some investors have worried that the Fed may have to change course sooner than expected. 
Those fears, which have been bolstered by a sharp rise in benchmark Treasury yields, have contributed to recent market declines, with investors taking profits from market-leading technology stocks.
Inflation pressures may force the Fed to revise its policy in the future, said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. But, he added, ""It's a high threshold we have to cross in order to get them to react."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.27 points, or 0.29%, to 31,613.02, the S&P 500 lost 1.26 points, or 0.03%, to 3,931.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 82.00 points, or 0.58%, to 13,965.50.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co shares jumped 5.2% after a report said the lender won Fed acceptance for its proposal to overhaul its risk management and governance.
U.S.-listed shares of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc slid 3.3% after the Canadian e-commerce software giant hinted at slower revenue growth in 2021 as vaccine rollouts encourage people to return to stores after a year marked by an upsurge in online shopping.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.60-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 177 new highs and 10 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.31 billion shares, compared with the 15.99 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

""There's more coming in March, with additional supports from the reopening and vaccinations, so this is just the beginning.""
Cyclical stocks - those that move in tandem with the pace of the economy - rose with higher oil prices as the cold snap sweeping across the U.S. offset reports that Saudi Arabia plans to boost oil output and ditch its recent production cut.
Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN),  Cabot Oil & Gas  (NYSE:COG) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) were among the biggest gainers in the energy sector.
Chevron was also boosted by a regulatory filing on Tuesday showing that Berkshire Hathaway invested $4.1 billion in Chevron.  
Financials were flat on the day as high-flying bank stocks, which have largely led the gains for the sector, struggled to turn positive after Treasury yields took a breather. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), however, rallied more than 5% as the Federal Reserve is reportedly set to approve the bank's plans to overhaul its governance functions. The approval would bring the bank closer to the removal of an asset cap limiting the bank to $1.95 trillion in assets.
Technology stocks stifled gains in the broader market as the pick up in yields has some suggesting it may be time to be cautious on growth stocks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An American father and son accused of helping former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee trial in Japan have asked U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to halt their impending extradition to the East Asian country.
On Saturday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency request by lawyers for U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, to pause a lower court order that cleared the way for them to be extradited.
A Feb. 3 letter to Blinken seen by Reuters Wednesday from the Taylors' lawyers said ""we do not believe there is any good reason to surrender these two American citizens.""
The Justice Department declined to comment. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The letter suggested the charges ""are explained by the government of Japan’s desire to save face, or at least to be perceived to be doing something to address their embarrassment."" The letter asked at a minimum that the extradition be delayed until the men received their second COVID-19 vaccine doses.
The Taylors' lawyers argue their clients could not be prosecuted in Japan for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that, if extradited, they faced the prospect of relentless interrogations and torture. 
The Japanese embassy did not immediately reply for a request for comment.
A federal appeals court in Boston declined to prevent the Taylors' extradition while they appealed lower-court rulings. The U.S. State Department approved their extradition in October.
The Taylors were arrested in May at Japan's request after being charged with helping Ghosn flee trial in Japan. On Dec. 29, 2019, the former executive escaped by hiding in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan. 
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he had engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.
Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, received $1.3 million for their services. 

The Taylors, who have been held without bail since their arrests, waged a monthslong campaign to press their case against extradition in the courts, media, State Department and White House with the aid of a collection of high-powered lawyers and lobbyists.

615,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 03:18PM ET</span>",Chinese Markets Reopen With Stocks Primed to Hit All-Time Highs,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese financial markets are likely to extend this year’s rally when they open for the first time after a Lunar New Year break on Thursday, with stocks hovering near a record.
The CSI 300 Index is within 70 points - or 1.2% - from its 2007 closing peak, and there are promising omens for it to break through that barrier. Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong have gained 3.5% since onshore markets last traded, while the offshore yuan has been steady after hitting its strongest level versus the greenback in 32 months this week.
Even though the Chinese equity benchmark is trading at its highest valuation in nearly six years, traders remain bullish about the market, driven by strong corporate earnings, ample cash in China’s financial system and low borrowing costs. The economy’s ongoing recovery from the grip of the pandemic means that Thursday’s reopening will provide a stark contrast to 2020, when Chinese markets plunged by the most value on record after an extended Lunar New Year break.
“The market will stay bullish,” said Kingston Lin, managing director of the asset management department at Canfield Securities in Hong Kong. “The only matter is how much it will rise.”
Traders had bid the CSI 300 Index up to 13-year highs in January, but momentum cooled as investors shifted a record level of money into Hong Kong stocks as domestic prices surged. The city’s $7.7 trillion equity market also stands to benefit from the reopening of trading links with the mainland, after an influx of mainland cash helped propel a world-beating rally for the Hang Seng Index. The gauge, which saw its best start to year since 1985, is up 14%.
One key expectation is that the People’s Bank of China will conduct medium-term lending facility operations on Thursday, with 200 billion yuan worth of loans due to expire.
How China’s central bank balances support for an uneven economic recovery without fueling excessive speculation is a key driver of investor sentiment. Traders were rattled by January’s liquidity squeeze when the PBOC withdrew cash from the financial system for the first time in six months, but authorities have drip-fed funding since then to calm money markets and suppress interest rates.
While there are signs China’s economic recovery from the pandemic remains unbalanced, it is outpacing the rest of the world, having roared back to pre-pandemic growth rates in the fourth quarter.
“We’re all talking about the global pandemic recovery but the speed of recovery in China has been faster than any other country,” said Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. “While there are still sufficient funds in the market, more foreign investors will continue eyeing Chinese markets.”

(Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover said on Wednesday it would cut 2,000 jobs from its global salaried workforce, just days after announcing its luxury Jaguar brand will be entirely electric by 2025 and e-models of its entire lineup will be launched by 2030.
""The full review of the Jaguar Land Rover organisation is already underway,"" the company said in an emailed statement. 
""We anticipate a net reduction of around 2,000 people from our global salaried workforce in the next financial year,"" it said. 
However, it added that the organisational review did not impact hourly paid, manufacturing employees. 
JLR, owned by India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), said earlier that its Land Rover brand will launch six fully electric models over the next five years, with the first in 2024.
Known for its iconic, high-performance E-Type model in the 1960s and 1970s, Jaguar faces the same challenges as many other carmakers as it transitions to electric vehicles while trying to retain the feeling and power of a luxury combustion engine model.
Last month, Tata Motors said it was concerned by semiconductor shortages and Brexit-related supply disruptions as its luxury car sales recover, although the Indian automaker added these had not yet hit production. 
Tata Motors posted three straight quarters of losses as the COVID-19 crisis dented sales, exacerbating uncertainties over Britain's exit from the European Union, weak demand and rising costs, but had bounced back to clock a profit in its third quarter to the end of December.

The 2,000 reduction in JLR's non-factory jobs was reported earlier on Wednesday by Sky News.

Investing.com – The Dow hovered near record highs Wednesday as rising energy stocks and data pointing to underlying strength in the economic recovery offset weakness in tech-led growth stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.12%, or 38 points, and remained close to its record intraday high of 31,608.63. The S&P 500 was down 0.25%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.90%. 
Retail sales rebounded in January, rising 5.3% from a decline in December, topping economists forecast for a 1.1% increase, underpinned by stimulus boost to consumer spending.
""January's performance was very impressive … fiscal stimulus is the clear driver, and today's report is proof that there's significant propensity to spend stimulus payments,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. ""There's more coming in March, with additional supports from the reopening and vaccinations, so this is just the beginning.""
The signs of the strength in the consumer, the backbone of the economy comes as the Federal Reserve minutes suggested that it will likely ""take some time"" until the central banks thinks about tightening monetary policy measures. 
""With the economy still far from those goals, participants judged that it was likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,"" the Fed's minutes showed.
Cyclicals stocks were in favor, led by gains in energy on higher oil prices as the cold snap sweeping across the U.S. offset reports that Saudi Arabia plans to boost oil output and ditch its recent production cut.
Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN),  Cabot Oil & Gas  (NYSE:COG) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) were among the biggest gainers in the energy sector.
Chevron was also boosted by report released Tuesday, showing that Berkshire Hathaway invested $4.1 billion in Chevron.  
Financials were flat on the day as high-flying bank stocks, which have largely led the gains for the sector, struggled to turn positive as Treasury yields paused on their recent rally.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), however, rallied more than 5% as the Federal Reserve is reportedly set to approve the bank's plans to overhaul its governance functions. The approval would bring the bank closer to getting its asset cap, which limits the bank to $1.95 trillion in assets, removed.
Technology stocks stifled gains in the broader market as the pick up in yields has some suggesting it may be time to be cautious on growth stocks.
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) slipped 2% even as its fourth-quarter results topped analysts' estimates, following a pandemic-fueled pick up in business moving operations online.
Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) jumped 2%, meanwhile after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded its rating on the company to buy from neutral, citing increased visibility into the company’s growth.
The sluggish day on Wall Street for stocks has not drowned out the bullish sentiment, with analysts saying a potential correction was unlikely to reverse the longer-term upward trend.
""[W]e would note that some type of pullback / consolidation phase is warranted at this stage,  … Corrections are standard throughout the course of every structural / secular bull cycle, and we believe the S&P in particular has enough bandwidth to sustain a correction of -10-15% without negating its longer-term uptrend,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said."

Shares in the lender jumped 6% on Wednesday. The bank declined a Reuters request for comment. 
The approval is a key step in getting a regulatory asset cap lifted, which has hindered Wells Fargo's growth since 2018.
Wells Fargo has been in regulators' penalty box since 2016 when details of a sales scandal first emerged, leading to the departure of two chief executives, billions of dollars in litigation and remedial costs and the U.S. Federal capping its balance sheet at $1.95 trillion.
A Federal Reserve spokesman declined to comment. But the original enforcement action adopted in 2018 lays out the lengthy process the bank must undertake to be relieved of the cap, including overhauling its board effectiveness and risk management. 
Under the public order, the Fed must sign off on any plan to address shortcomings at the bank and verify its implementation. After that, an independent third party must come in and review the plan and its implementation. Only then would the Fed board consider voting to lift the asset cap.

Last month, Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said the bank was making progress on getting the asset cap removed but it still had ""a significant amount of work to do"".

BERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - German venture capitalist Klaus Hommels launched a blank cheque company in Frankfurt on Wednesday through his firm Lakestar, offering a route to the stock market for European tech startups that does not entail crossing the Atlantic.
The early investor in Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) is seeking to raise up to 275 million euros ($331 million) for a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, that would then take over a firm worth between 750 million and 4 billion euros.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money via a stock market listing, and then seeks to merge within two years with a privately held company that becomes publicly traded as a result. 
Hommels, 54, is the latest to embrace a trend that began in the United States and has spread to Europe, with former UniCredit boss Jean-Pierre Mustier teaming up with French tycoon Bernard Arnault to launch a SPAC in Amsterdam.
The founders of Berlin e-commerce pioneer Rocket Internet and meal kit company Hellofresh also plan SPACs. Unlike Hommels, however, they plan to do so in the United States.
The promoters of Lakestar SPAC 1 SE are seeking backing from institutions via a private placement prior to listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Books are expected to close on Thursday on the sale of 27.5 million shares priced at 10 euros, each with a third of a warrant attached, Lakestar SPAC 1 said in a statement. A warrant confers the right to buy a share at a set price at a later date.
EUROPEAN AGENDA
In designing Frankfurt's first SPAC, Hommels worked closely with exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) on a design that supports his wider agenda - to help companies keep a European identity and attract backing from European investors.
""If we don't have the product, the U.S. will create products for European companies,"" Hommels told Reuters in an interview.
""Then you would have a structural sellout of European companies. They lose their European centre of gravity, their tax substance - they lose everything.""
Hommels said the SPAC, headed by Lakestar adviser Stefan Winners, did not rule out buying a company in the group's own portfolio but declined to be more specific. 
The Swiss-based investor has invested in Berlin freight tech company Sennder and travel firms GetYourGuide and Omio. Lakestar has also backed UK fintech Revolut and was instrumental in Spotify's innovative U.S. direct listing.
ALIGNED INTERESTS
As the SPAC mania trickles into Europe, Amsterdam is widely expected to be the venue of choice thanks to its favourable regulatory environment. 
Two major SPACs -- one backed by ex-Commerzbank chief executive Martin Blessing and the other by Mustier and Arnault -- are both listing in the Dutch capital.
But Deutsche Boerse executives are confident Frankfurt will win business as well.
""The requirements for SPAC transactions in Germany are similar to other jurisdictions,"" said Renata Bandov, head of capital markets at Deutsche Boerse. ""We expect a small number of transactions in the medium term – a lot depends on how the first ones are received by the wider market,"" she added. 
Hommels said the team running the Lakestar SPAC would be primarily rewarded through so-called earn-out payments triggered when its investors achieve returns of 20% and, later, 40%.
That contrasts with U.S. SPACs that typically compensate their promoters when a takeover deal is done.
""The biggest litmus test is if you have deferred compensation,"" said Hommels. ""And I'm happy to do this test.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) advised on the deal.

622,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo Wins Fed’s Nod for an Overhaul Plan Tied to Cap,"(Bloomberg) --  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. has taken a significant step forward in its three-year quest to satisfy a Federal Reserve order that triggered a costly cap on the bank’s growth.
Fed officials have privately signaled to the scandal-ridden lender that they accept its proposal for overhauling risk management and governance, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf’s team submitted the revised plan -- thousands of pages long -- in September, after his predecessors stumbled in clearing what turned out to be a surprisingly high hurdle.
The nod from the Fed marks the firm’s most meaningful progress yet in addressing lapses that prompted the central bank to impose an unprecedented cap on the firm’s assets, limiting it to its size at the end of 2017. Winning acceptance is the second of four steps toward getting the sanction lifted.
Still, much work remains for the San Francisco-based company to move beyond its scandals. A number of top executives privately expect Wells Fargo won’t escape the asset cap until late this year at the earliest, while key Fed officials see the process dragging into 2022 or beyond, Bloomberg reported in December.
Representatives for Wells Fargo and the Fed declined to comment on whether the plan has been accepted. Under Scharf, the bank has refused to provide an estimate for when it might satisfy the regulator.
“The Federal Reserve will determine when the work to fulfill the requirements of the consent order is done to their satisfaction,” a Wells Fargo spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We are focused on doing the work. We maintain strong levels of liquidity and capital, and we are committed to using our financial strength to help support the U.S. economy and our clients while operating in compliance with the asset cap.”
The Fed’s cap has dragged on Wells Fargo’s shares since it was imposed in early 2018, and cost the fourth-largest U.S. lender billions of dollars in profits that it could have generated had it simply grown at the pace of the industry. Scharf, who took the helm in late 2019, has made satisfying regulators his top priority, a key step toward pursuing other elements of his strategy. The shares have soared since late October, with some investors speculating the Fed would soon lift the asset cap.
Wells Fargo shares surged as much as 7.7% Wednesday to their highest level in almost a year after Bloomberg reported Fed officials’ acceptance.
But the road ahead remains long. To get the cap removed, executives must submit plans to bolster board effectiveness and risk management, get those plans approved by the Fed, adopt and implement the plans and undergo a third-party review that could take months. Following that, the full Fed board will have to agree to end the sanction.
The asset cap, Janet Yellen’s final act as Fed chair, is now seen as the harshest tool in the regulators’ arsenal short of forcing a lender out of business. It bit harder last year by limiting Wells Fargo’s ability to finance clients and counter lower interest rates with balance-sheet growth.
When the restriction was first imposed in 2018, Wells Fargo executives publicly predicted the firm would satisfy the requirements by the end of that year. They later extended that timeline twice, then threw out the guidance entirely. Scharf and his leadership have adopted a cautious tone, emphasizing that much work remains, in an effort to avoid raising expectations or antagonizing the regulator.
“I do believe that we’re making progress,” Scharf said on a conference call last month. “But if you look at the words that are required in the consent order, they’re really clear, which is execute and implement that, and we’ve got significant work to do.”

623,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>",COVID response drives $24 trillion surge in global debt: IIF,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The COVID pandemic has added $24 trillion to the global debt mountain over the last year a new study has shown, leaving it at a record $281 trillion and the worldwide debt-to-GDP ratio at over 355%. 
The Institute of International Finance's global debt monitor estimated government support programmes had accounted for half of the rise, while global firms, banks and households added $5.4 trillion, 3.9 trillion and $2.6 trillion respectively.
It has meant that debt as a ratio of world economic output known as gross domestic product surged by 35 percentage points to over 355% of GDP. 
That upswing is well beyond the rise seen during the global financial crisis, when 2008 and 2009 saw 10 percentage points and 15 percentage points respective debt-to-GDP jumps.
There is also little sign of a near-term stablisation.
Borrowing levels are expected to run well above pre-COVID levels in many countries and sectors again this year, supported by still low interest rates, although a reopening of economies should help on the GDP side of the equation.
""We expect global government debt to increase by another $10 trillion this year and surpass $92 trillion,"" the IIF report said, adding that winding down support could also prove even more challenging than it was after the financial crisis.
""Political and social pressure could limit governments' efforts to reduce deficits and debt, jeopardizing their ability to cope with future crises."" 
""This could also constrain policy responses to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and natural capital loss,"" it added.
Graphic: Global debt surges to new record high - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqgwxgvx/Pasted%20image%201613519778223.png
EUROPE DEBT 
Debt rises were particularly sharp in Europe, with non-financial sector debt-to-GDP ratios in France, Spain, and Greece increasing some 50 percentage points.
The rapid build-up was mostly driven by governments, particularly in Greece, Spain, Britain and Canada. Switzerland was the only mature market economy in the IIF's 61-country analysis to record a decline in its debt ratio. 
In emerging markets, China saw the biggest rise in debt ratios excluding banks, followed by Turkey, Korea, and the United Arab Emirates. South Africa and India recorded the largest increases just in terms of government debt ratios.
""Premature withdrawal of supportive government measures could mean a surge in bankruptcies and a new wave of non-performing loans,"" the IIF said. 
However, sustained reliance on government support could pose ""systemic risks"" as well by encouraging so-called 'zombie' firms - the weakest and most indebted corporates - to take on even more debt.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Fortnite creator Epic Games has taken its fight against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to European Union antitrust regulators, escalating its dispute with the iPhone maker over its App Store payment system and control over app downloads.
The two companies have been in a dispute since August, when the game maker tried to avoid Apple's 30% fee on some in-app purchases on the App Store by launching its own in-app payment system.
That prompted Apple to kick Epic's Fortnite game off the App Store and threaten to terminate an affiliated account that would have effectively blocked distribution of Unreal Engine, a software tool used by hundreds of app makers to create games.
Epic Games founder and Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said Apple's control of its platform had tilted the level playing field.
""The 30% they charge as their app tax, they can make it 50% or 90% or 100%. Under their theory of how these markets are structured, they have every right to do that,"" he told reporters.
""Epic is not asking any court or regulator to change this 30% to some other number, only to restore competition on IOS,"" he said, referring to Apple's mobile operating system.
The company also accused Apple of barring rivals from launching their own gaming subscription service on its platform by preventing them from bundling several games together, even though its own Apple Arcade service does that.
Apple said its rules applied equally to all developers and that Epic had violated them.
""In ways a judge has described as deceptive and clandestine, Epic enabled a feature in its app, which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines that apply equally to every developer and protect customers,"" the company said in a statement.
""Their reckless behaviour made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to the European Commission,"" it said.
EUROPEAN GATEKEEPERS
Epic Games' EU complaint drew support from lawmaker Rasmus Andresen at the European Parliament, which will in coming months seek to reinforce EU tech rules proposed by the Commission to rein in U.S. tech giants.
""We as legislators need to ensure that these platforms who act as gatekeepers in the digital market have to respect a predefined set of rules in order to guarantee fair competition and balanced market powers,"" he said in a statement.
Apple has in recent months made changes to its practices by lowering fees for some developers and giving them a way to challenge its rulings. Such measures have not satisfied the company's critics. 
Fortnite is expected to return to the iPhone at some point in the mobile Safari browser as part of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s streaming game service.
Epic first pursued legal action against Apple in the United States and the two parties have in recent weeks have been trading documents and conducting depositions ahead of a trial scheduled for May.
The European Commission, which is investigating Apple's mobile payment system Apple Pay and the App Store, confirmed receipt of the complaint.
""We will assess it based on our standard procedures,"" a Commission spokeswoman said.
Epic Games has also complained to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal and to the Australian watchdog. 

Big companies such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH) have also criticised Apple's App Store fees and rules.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 09:16AM ET</span>",Analysis: Europe braces for pandemic reality to hit banks,"By John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Unpaid debt from pandemic-stricken borrowers has ravaged profits at Europe's big banks and kick-started a debate among politicians about whether they may ultimately need state help.
Reflecting on the pandemic impact, many bank executives say the worst is behind them, with Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) CEO Frederic Oudea and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnafe predicting an imminent rebound.
""Optimism is ... a weapon of war,"" Philippe Brassac, chief executive of Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) said in January, decrying ""doom-mongers"". ""And this war, we can win.""
All three French lenders saw profits shrink last year and profits at Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) and Dutch bank ING also dipped. 
While executives voice confidence, European officials worry the banks' problems have barely begun.
They fear more borrowers will default when government support, including billions of euros of loan guarantees in France, Spain and elsewhere, is unwound.
Officials spelt out their concerns in a report presented to euro zone finance ministers who met on Monday, warning of ""wide-scale corporate distress"".
In the document, they highlighted the extent to which banks rely on governments to help borrowers.
Were it not for government support, they estimated roughly a quarter of EU firms could have been in trouble at the end of last year and cautioned that banks' provisions for such losses did not reflect the ""underlying deterioration"".
Roughly 587 billion euros ($712 billion) of loans were under moratoria and 289 billion euros of credit had been given on the back of public guarantees, they said, from a tally late last year.
""We have to avoid a sharp rise in insolvencies,"" Paolo Gentiloni, the European Union's economy commissioner, told journalists after the ministers' gathering. 
The same unease is felt at the European Central Bank, which supervises lenders.
In January, it said banks were setting aside less for bad loans than rivals in the United States and it suspected some were not taking sufficient measures, skewing the calculation of risk to convey brighter prospects for the future.
Both continents have unleashed billions to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic, although in Europe, a patchwork of independent states, the type of assistance, whether grant or guarantee, depends on which country is giving it. 
France, Italy and Spain have issued billions of guarantees on loans, while Germany made generous grants.
Jerome Legras of Axiom Alternative Investments said the upbeat message of bankers jarred with that of regulators: ""The message from the supervisor is almost the exact opposite.""
The rosy picture painted by some executives is also at odds with data collected by the European Datawarehouse, which has analysed half a trillion euros of European mortgage loans.
Its survey last December calculated that one fifth of loans in the United Kingdom had required a payment break, followed closely by Portugal as well as Italy, with more than 12%, and Ireland with around 10%. 
One euro zone official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while banks were largely robust, ""some ... may run into problems or have to be wound up"".
Despite the concern of European officials, deep divisions remain over how to respond.
Although the 19-country euro zone bloc agreed to put the central bank in charge of supervising lenders after the financial crash more than a decade ago, they remain at odds on what to do if lenders run into trouble.
Wealthy countries, such as Germany, are reluctant to help poorer ones, such as Italy or Greece, by establishing a joint rescue net.
Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, told journalists on Monday that the ESM fund, set up during the great financial crash to help countries in trouble, could be used in winding up banks from next year.
""We have created a strong second line of defence,"" he said, pointing to the knock-on impact of rising insolvencies on banks and governments.
Deciding on joint action such as resorting to the ESM, however, is highly political. Efforts by the European Central Bank, for example, to set up a pan-euro-zone bad bank to help lenders warehouse and sell off troubled loans have made scant progress.
In the meantime, many bankers hope for the best.
""There will be light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Steven van Rijswijk, CEO of ING. ""Where the tunnel ends we do not know.""

(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's investors and analysts are likely to look past the retail giant's slowest same-store sales growth since the start of the coronavirus crisis, when it reports quarterly results on Thursday and instead focus on the company's ambitions to diversify beyond retail.
Walmart's online sales nearly doubled and comparable sales growth touched high single digits each quarter in 2020 as Americans bought groceries and other essentials during the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the retailer also heavily invested in advertising and health services.
""They are thinking broader picture about their customers, so it's not so much each transaction, but how do we think more holistically,"" said Chad Oviatt, director of investment management at Huntington Private Bank.
Walmart is starting to merge other parts of its business with its main retail and e-commerce business, he added. 
The company started to change its media strategy in 2019 by cutting ties with its external advertising partner and taking the business in-house as Walmart Media Group and now renamed Walmart Connect, with annual advertising revenue expected to be nearly $1 billion in 2020.
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart has also bolstered its presence in healthcare with its own insurance business and an expansion of its healthcare centers in the United States that provide low-priced medical services such as dental care and counseling for customers.
""We are encouraged to see Walmart expand its vision beyond retail and e-commerce, with a focus on building a powerful ecosystem, including advertising, merchant services, health services and digital payments,"" Telsey Advisory analyst Joseph Feldman said in a note.
""These new elements of the ecosystem are more profitable than traditional retail and collectively should help strengthen its relationship with customers and generate profitable market share gains,"" he said.

Walmart will report fourth-quarter results on Thursday, with analysts expecting same-store sales of 5.80%, according to Refinitiv estimates, the slowest for the year.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",Pay gap for U.S. female executives narrows but persists,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Even women who make it to the top ranks of U.S. corporations face a persistent pay gap compared with men in leadership roles, a new study of corporate filings found.
Among companies in the Russell 3000 index, covering most of the investable U.S. stock market, the highest paid women earned 84.6 cents for every dollar earned by male counterparts in 2019, up from 81.5 cents in 2015, according to a paper from researcher Morningstar Inc due out Wednesday.
Author Jackie Cook said the narrower difference pointed to progress that should continue as companies file disclosures in coming weeks showing 2020 compensation. 
But the persistent gap reflects a lack of top female leaders and how those now in place often hold lower-paid posts like heads of marketing or human resources. To change, companies must add more women at all levels to maintain a diverse pool for promotions, she said.
""Companies can't just solve for this at the top of the ladder, they have to look at the entirety"" of their workforces, Cook said.
Her analysis traced five years of pay disclosures by 2,384 Russell 3000 companies from 2015 to 2019. Most recently, women held just 12% of the 'named executive officer' positions, up from 9% in 2015. At companies in the sample, 47% had at least one woman in their top ranks in 2019, up from 35% in 2015.
The female executives were still well paid, with median compensation of $1.76 million in 2019, and their gap with male counterparts narrowed faster than did the pay gap for working women overall.
According to the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank, the 52.1 million U.S. women who worked full-time, year-round earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2019, up from 80 cents in 2015.
Gender and race-based pay differences have received more attention amid social justice protests and the brutal economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A recent report from the National Women's Law Center found 2.3 million women left the U.S. labor force since the start of the pandemic, leaving their participation rate at 57%, the lowest since 1988.
Women have made faster gains in corporate boardrooms, where the percentage of Russell 3000 directors who are women stood at 23% as of November, according to researcher Equilar. Boardroom diversity has been a bigger focus of asset managers and directors can serve at more than one company.
Morningstar's Cook pointed to a number of high-profile companies with no women listed among top-paid executives as of 2020, including online retailer Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the third-most valuable U.S. company, and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT), the asset manager known for its ""Fearless Girl"" campaign.
Asked about Cook's study and comment, an Amazon representative noted a report on the company's website that found women at Amazon earned the same pay as men ""performing the same jobs."" The page also states, ""We continue to prioritize pay equity.""

In a statement e-mailed by a spokesman, State Street said it remains ""focused on representation of women and other underrepresented groups particularly in senior, higher paying roles demonstrated by women comprising 29% of our management committee and 4 of our 11 Directors.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Wednesday, remaining near record levels amid rising investor optimism over the economic recovery as Covid-19 vaccination program ramps up.  
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 8 points, or 0.03%, S&P 500 Futures traded 1 points, or 0.01%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 18 points, or 0.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high Tuesday, its eighth record this year. The S&P 500, meanwhile, fell 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.3%, with these two indices closing not far below record levels. 
Stock markets have benefited from the expectation of the Biden administration delivering a $1.9 trillion stimulus package this month, while the government also announced Tuesday plans to acquire an additional 200 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, enough to inoculate most Americans by summer.
That said, U.S. stock markets have posted strong gains very quickly, and a 10% pullback seems “very plausible” with markets balanced on a risk-reward basis, said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), in a research note Tuesday.
With this in mind, investors will look carefully at the minutes of January’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, at 2 PM ET (1900 GMT). The central bank decided to keep its easy money policy in place last month, and the minutes could provide clues as to how long the members think this will continue to be the case.  
The main release on the economic data slate is January retail sales, at 8:30 AM ET (1350 GMT). This is expected to show a rebound of 1.1% compared with a decline of 0.7% in December. Out at 8:15 AM ET are industrial production data for January, which are expected to show a fourth straight monthly rise.
In corporate news, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP),  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI) and  Hilton Worldwide  (NYSE:HLT) release earnings Wednesday, but energy stocks will remain in focus as a deep freeze in the South has cut electricity to millions of households.
This cold snap also pushed oil prices higher Wednesday, cutting output from oil and gas fields in the U.S. state of Texas, the country's biggest oil-producing region.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $60.66 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.4% to $64.22, not far removed from the 13-month highs earlier this week.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute will be studied carefully later in the session.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Wednesday said its car lineup in Europe will be all-electric by 2030 as the U.S. automaker races to get ahead of CO2 emissions targets and looming bans in some countries on fossil fuel vehicles.
The carmaker said it will invest $1 billion over the next 30 months to convert its vehicle assembly plant in Cologne, Germany, to become the U.S. automaker's first electric vehicle facility in Europe.
""This reinforces our commitment to the European region,"" Stuart Rowley, head of Ford's European operations, said during a news conference. 
Ford said its first European-built, all-electric passenger vehicle will be produced at the facility from 2023 and is considering building a second model there. 
The carmaker has a strategic alliance with Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), under which Ford will use its German partner's MEB electric vehicle platform to build some models. Rowley said the model out of Cologne will be the first to use Volskwagen's MEB platform. 
The No.2 U.S. automaker said that by 2026 it will have electric versions of all its passenger cars on sale in Europe and that by 2030 two=thirds of its commercial vehicle sales in Europe will be fully electric or plug-in hybrids. 
The company said it will have plug-in hybrid or fully-electric versions of its entire commercial vehicle range available by 2024.
Ford currently dominates the U.S. and European markets for gasoline-powered commercial vehicles with shares of 40% and almost 15%, respectively.
The carmaker said its commercial vehicle business is ""key to future growth and profitability."" 
Ford said this month it was ""doubling down"" on connected electric vehicles and said it will invest $22 billion in electrification through 2025, nearly twice what it had previously committed to EVs.
This week Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), said its luxury Jaguar brand would be entirely electric by 2025 and the carmaker will launch e-models of its entire lineup by 2030.

Although occupancy rates have bounced back from April 2020 lows thanks to a relative easing of lockdowns, emerging variants of the virus have hindered a swift recovery for U.S. hotel operators. 
""Rising COVID-19 cases and tightening travel restrictions disrupted the positive momentum we saw throughout the summer and fall,"" Chief Executive Officer Christopher Nassetta said in a statement.
Analysts expect a wider rollout of COVID-19 vaccines later this year to first aid a rebound in leisure travel, leaving hotel chains including Hilton and larger rival Marriott which rely more on business travel, struggling for longer.
Hilton, the first major hotel chain to report earnings, said fourth-quarter revenue per available room (RevPAR) - a key measure for a hotel's top-line performance - fell about 59% to $40.68, and was below the company's expectation of about $45 per room.
Net loss attributable to Hilton stockholders was $224 million, or 80 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with net income of $175 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, Hilton lost 10 cents per share, missing analysts' estimates for a profit of 3 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue plunged 62% to $890 million, below Wall Street's estimate of $1.03 billion.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ryanair on Wednesday lost its fight against the state aid granted to rivals including Air France and Sweden's SAS after a top European court said such schemes were not discriminatory amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The judgment from the Luxembourg-based General Court is the first to deal with aid measures cleared by the European Commission under easier rules aimed at helping European Union governments prop up companies hit by the health crisis.
The court said the French and Swedish schemes were in line with the bloc's rules. The airline industry has been one of the hardest-hit by virus-related restrictions and lockdowns imposed by governments worldwide.
""That aid scheme is appropriate for making good the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and does not constitute discrimination,"" the court said, referring to the French scheme.
For the Swedish scheme, it said: ""The scheme at issue is presumed to have been adopted in the interest of the European Union.""
Ryanair said it would appeal to the EU Court of Justice in a process likely to take several years.
The company had taken issue with the European Commission for clearing a French scheme allowing airlines to defer certain aeronautical taxes and Sweden's loan guarantee scheme for airlines. Both schemes benefited their flag carriers.
Europe's biggest budget airline has filed 16 lawsuits against the Commission for allowing state aid to individual airlines such as Lufthansa, KLM, Austrian Airlines and TAP, as well as national schemes that mainly benefit flag carriers.
EU competition enforcers have to date cleared more than 3 trillion euros ($3.6 trillion) to help virus-hit companies across the 27-country bloc.
The cases are T-238/20 Ryanair v Commission and T-259/20 Ryanair v Commission.

644,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 06:07AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Kering Slumps as Gucci Loses Its Allure,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The troubles at Gucci-owner  Kering  (OTC:PPRUY) continue.
The luxury fashion group turned in another disappointing quarter in the three months through December, as the closure of many of its boutiques due to lockdown measures in Europe and North America continued to depress sales.
Revenue at Gucci, which typically accounts for two-thirds of group revenue, was a particular disappointment, falling 10.3% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter. The group’s chief financial officer Jean-Marc Duplaix told a conference call that lockdowns in Europe had meant that the trend had continued at the start of this year.
It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Kering had set its sights on narrowing the valuation discount between itself and arch-rival LVMH (PA:LVMH) after starting to unwind the mistimed acquisition of sports gear maker Puma, which it bought at the peak of the previous cycle in 2007. But in the two years since that spin-off, Kering’s shares have risen only 33%, while LVMH’s have more than doubled, as Bernard Arnault’s empire has gone from strength to strength.
It’s not just LVMH that has left it in the dust. Kering, with over 13 billion euros in revenue, now has a market value less than Hermes, which has less than 7 billion.
Kering (PA:PRTP) stock fell more than 7% in early trading in Paris before trimming losses to be down 6.9% by late morning.
Gucci has had a good run, to be sure. It more than doubled revenue in the four years before the pandemic, and its popularity with Chinese buyers appears to have offset its declining appeal in Europe, where it has suffered from perceptions of being too flashy.
But the latest quarter also showed revenue at Yves St Laurent and Bottega Veneta also growing below expectations, suggesting that the company has a broader problem. Online sales, for example, still only accounted or 13% of the total, despite a 67% increase last year. That suggests that the company has done less well than Hermes and others in reducing dependence on its boutiques and travel hub sales.
Chairman Francois-Henri Pinault is having none of it, however. In his statement accompanying the results, he said that “I am convinced that our strategy and business model are perfectly in sync with the current and future trends of the Luxury universe.”
For those who believe that the first step to solving a problem is acknowledging that you have one, that statement may jar more than a little."

LONDON (Reuters) - Retail investors should avoid using unverified information from social media to buy and sell stocks, the European Union's markets watchdog said on Wednesday.
Retail investors following the Reddit forum WallStreetBets in the United States piled into  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) last month, sending shares in the retailer rocketing at the expense of prominent investors who had bet against the stock, ringing alarm bells in Europe.
Although market rules and structures are different in the EU, it cannot be ruled out that similar circumstances may occur in the bloc as well, the European Securities and Markets Authority said in a statement.
There are already signs that more retail investors are piling into European stock markets.
ESMA said increased participation of retail investors in Europe is helping to deepen the EU's capital market, but they face significant risks when buying shares that are very volatile, the watchdog said.
Investors should first gather information from reliable sources and know how much losses they can bear, ESMA said.
Organising or executing coordinated strategies to trade or place orders at certain conditions and times to move a share’s price could constitute market manipulation, ESMA said.
""Similarly, special care should be taken when posting information on social media about an issuer or a financial instrument, as disseminating false or misleading information may also be market manipulation,"" it said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google is teaming up with the European Investment Fund (EIF) and two other organisations in Latin America and Asia to provide $75 million in funding to small- and medium-sized companies suffering from the impact of COVID-19.
The funds are part of an $800 million initiative announced in March last year in response to the pandemic.
Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said on Wednesday that it would invest in two EIF funds, giving $15 million in loan capital to 1,000 European small businesses and $10 million in EIF's venture capital fund backing 200 life sciences companies.
The EIF is part of the European Investment Bank group, the lending arm of the European Union.
In Latin America, Google will work with the Inter-American Development Bank to allocate $8 million to small companies.

It has also set up a $26 million loan fund with Kiva, an organisation that crowdfunds loans, to help businesses in Africa, the Middle East and Indonesia. Indian companies will get $15 million.

Shares of Hyundai jumped 21% between its initial confirmation of talks on autonomous vehicles between the two firms and an announcement last week that the talks were off.

MILAN/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The rally in stock markets stalled on Wednesday as a surge in U.S. Treasury yields on optimism about a swift economic recovery put pressure on lofty company valuations.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields reached a one-year high to trade near pre-pandemic levels, as vaccine progress and encouraging economic data begin to drive investor focus on inflation. 
The MSCI world equity benchmark fell 0.1% by 0908 GMT, as a weaker start of trading in Europe offset a brief surge in Asia overnight.
The index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, ended flat on Tuesday to snap 11 straight positive sessions.
S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were both little changed. Ten-year Treasury yields , up nearly 40 basis points this year, rose as far as 1.3330% before easing to 1.2838%.
""Regarding the bond market sell-off, things are finally starting to get serious as real yields are on the rise, driven by bets ... of central banks tightening sooner than previously expected,"" said Arne Petimezas, analysts at AFS in Amsterdam. ""Risk-assets are now becoming vulnerable to a pull-back.""
In the short term, however, investors expect central banks to keep monetary policy loose and minutes later on Wednesday from the U.S Federal Reserve's January meeting are expected to reinforce that view. 
""Recent remarks by (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell and several other Fed officials show that the FOMC is very comfortable with its current policy stance,"" wrote UniCredit strategists.
The gap between 10-year and two-year U.S. yields also reached its widest in nearly three years in anticipation of short-term rates going nowhere. [US/]
Besides a cooling in stock-market exuberance, gold and the Japanese yen have been other casualties of rising rates. 
Gold, which pays no income and was last down 0.5% on the day, tends to fall when yields rise, and it touched a two-week low on Wednesday. [GOL/]
The yen is sensitive to U.S. rates because Japanese yields are anchored and higher U.S. returns can attract investment flows out of yen and into dollars. It fell to a five-month low against the dollar and has lost 2.7% this year.
The euro fell 0.2% to $1.2075. Sterling, which has been surging as vaccinations roll out rapidly across the United Kingdom, was last down 0.1% at $1.3892. The dollar index rose 0.05%.
Bitcoin, which some see as a hedge against inflation, rose to a high of $51,300 and was last up 3.6% after first crossing $50,000 on Tuesday. Analysts, however, warned of risks of tighter regulation and further volatility ahead in the cryptocurrency market. 
Gains in commodity prices have been another big driver of inflation expectations. They've caught a further boost from a Texas cold snap that has shut down about a fifth of U.S. oil production and sent energy prices higher. [O/R] 
Brent crude futures rose 0.9% to $63.9 a barrel, their highest in 13 months. U.S. crude futures rose 0.7% to $60.45 a barrel. Copper prices were around their highest level since 2012.

Global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) rode higher commodity prices to post its best annual earnings since 2011 and declare a record dividend. That sent its shares surging to a record high.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Shipping group Maersk said on Wednesday it would accelerate plans to decarbonise sea-borne container shipping by putting the world's first vessel powered by carbon-neutral fuel into operation in 2023, seven years ahead of its original plan.
The shipping industry, which carries around 80% of global trade and accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, pledged last year to have ships and marine fuels with zero carbon emissions ready by 2030.
""Fast-tracked by advances in technology and increasing customer demand for sustainable supply chains, Maersk is accelerating the efforts to decarbonise marine operations with the launch of the world's first carbon neutral liner vessel in 2023,"" the company said in a statement.
The consumption of oil for transportation is one of the top contributors to the emissions that cause climate change and Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, faces the challenge of ensuring an adequate supply of alternative fuel.
""Our ambition to have a carbon neutral fleet by 2050 was a moonshot when we announced it in 2018,"" Chief Executive Soren Skou said. ""Today we see it as a challenging, yet achievable target to reach.""
The company is beginning with one of its feeder vessels - a relatively small ship that can carry up to 2,000 containers - that will be powered by climate-friendly methanol, although it will be able to use fossil fuel as a back-up if required.
Going forward, all its new vessels will have dual fuel technology installed, it said.
In addition to methanol produced from plant waste, Maersk said it experimenting with ammonia, normally used for fertilizer, and other alternatives.

Two of the world's biggest fertilizer producers, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) and Yara, said last month they were reconfiguring ammonia plants in the United States and Norway to produce clean energy to power ships.

    Japan's second-biggest automaker by sales will announce the decision after a board meeting as early as Friday, the people said, requesting anonymity because the information is not public. Mibe will be confirmed as president and representative director at an annual shareholders' meeting in June, they said.
Mibe, who is a director at Honda, will replace Takahiro Hachigo, who has held the CEO role for six years. Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Seiji Kuraishi will remain in his post to support Mibe, the people said.
Honda said in a statement on Wednesday that it is not true the company has decided to change its CEO. 
It was not immediately clear whether Hachigo would retain a position at Honda with Mibe as CEO.
Mibe, 59, joined Honda in 1987, taking part in engine development as well as managing powertrain and drivetrain businesses. His career includes an operating officer stint in 2014 and he is currently also in charge of intellectual property and standardisation.
After becoming Honda research and development president in 2019, he and Hachigo pushed forward structural reform at the research unit, with electrification in mind.
Hachigo became CEO in 2015, a rare appointment for Honda considering he had not headed the research and development arm as is typical for Honda CEOs.
He spearheaded restructuring plans to simplify and improve efficiency in developing cars, seeking ways to cut model variations and production costs. 
During his tenure, the automaker consolidated vehicle and motorcycle development operations, while shifting the research unit's focus to new mobility and robotics.
Earlier this month, Honda hiked its full-year operating profit forecast 23% to 520 billion yen ($4.91 billion) as it trimmed costs while demand in China and elsewhere gained momentum. Larger peer  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp also raised its forecast by a bigger-than-expected 54% to a record $19 billion.

""Combined with sharp rises in energy and commodity prices, there is growing concern that higher prices will not only choke off any post-pandemic recovery, but they could also crimp future consumer spending due to higher living costs,"" said Michael Hewson, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
The benchmark STOXX 600 has rebounded more than 50% since a coronavirus-driven crash in March as a raft of monetary and fiscal stimulus fuelled a recovery in global financial markets, but has lagged its U.S. counterpart due to fears of the business impact from prolonged lockdowns.
While central banks, including the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve, have signalled their intention to keep monetary policy loose over the next few months, market participants have started to factor in a rise in inflation as economic data improves.
European banks rose 0.3% on Wednesday as the so-called ""reflation trade"" pushed up bond yields.
Investor attention this week will remain on consumer confidence, retail sales and business activity data from across the euro zone, while January inflation figures for the bloc are due next week.
In company news, shares of French conglomerate Kering sank 8.2% to a three-and-a-half-month low as it said revenue for the whole group fell 8.2% in the fourth quarter. The broader European retail index lost 3.1%.
Lucky Strike maker British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) shed 5.8% even as it reported a stronger-than-expected annual profit, while Nivea maker Beiersdorf tumbled 6.6% after it said it did not expect a recovery in profitability in 2021 even though sales should rise.
Overall, analysts expect earnings at STOXX 600 firms to have fallen 19.9% in the fourth quarter, steeper than the 18.2% estimate issued last week, according to Refinitiv data. Still, earnings are expected to rebound nearly 43% in the first quarter.

At 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1%, and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.2%.
European markets have rallied strongly over the last week or so, amid growing hopes the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and the coming of spring will result in the reasonably prompt ending of the severe restrictions in place to combat the spread of the virus. 
That said, regional leaders have been cautious about lifting restrictions, wary of new and more infectious strains of the virus that came to light in the U.K. and South Africa.
However, investors are now beginning to turn their focus away from virus-related stats, looking carefully at climbing bond yields as higher rates could prompt some to rotate out of equities and into bonds. 
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 9 basis points on Tuesday to top 1.3%, a level not seen since February 2020. 
In corporate news, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock rose 1.5% after the world’s biggest producer of iron ore announced a record $6.5 billion final dividend after reporting a 20% jump in annual profit in 2020. 
This continued a good run for the sector, as earnings from rivals BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) had been received positively by the market on Tuesday.
Elsewhere,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) stock slumped 8.4% as sales at the French fashion house, the owner of Gucci, fell more than expected in the fourth quarter, as the coronavirus pandemic hurt tourist travel and shopping habits globally.
British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) stock fell 6.2% after the cigarette maker said cigarette volumes dropped 4.6% over the year to end-December with revenues down 1.1%. 
In economic data, U.K. CPI climbed 0.7% on the year in January, a small rise from the 0.6% seen in December, after prices only fell by 0.2% on the month.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, remaining at elevated levels on the back of the cold snap cutting output from oil and gas fields in the U.S. state of Texas, the country's biggest oil-producing region.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $60.45 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $63.91, both contracts having hit 13-month highs earlier this week.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute will be released later in the session.

654,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 03:42AM ET</span>",Gucci stumbles as Kering gears up for brand's 100th year,"By Silvia Aloisi and Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - Sales at  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Gucci fashion brand fell more than expected in the fourth quarter, underperforming some rivals starting to recover even as the COVID-19 pandemic keeps consumers from travelling abroad and shopping. 
Gucci accounts for 60% of revenues and 80% of profits at the French conglomerate, and has been one of the industry's top performers in recent years, making it a major focus for analysts and investors. 
Despite a rebound in key luxury market Asia, which fuelled resurging sales at rivals such as LVMH's Louis Vuitton, Gucci stumbled in late 2020, and Kering said a weak European performance had dragged on its brands. 
Kering shares were down more than 7.5% in early trading. 
The conglomerate said momentum should pick up in 2021, when Gucci will launch new products and collaborations to chime with its 100th anniversary.
Kering, which also owns Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, said overall revenue fell 8.2% to 4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in October-December, down 5% on a comparable basis and missing analysts' consensus forecast cited by UBS for growth of 1%. 
Gucci's sales were down 10.3% in the quarter on a comparable basis, when analysts had expected a 4% drop. 
""To just look at 2020, quarter after quarter, is to take a short term view. We have a lot of actions to return to a path of growth, taking advantage of the recovery,"" Kering's finance chief Jean-Marc Duplaix told reporters. 
Investors are keeping a close watch on the extent to which Gucci is losing steam after a hugely successful, quirky makeover under designer Alessandro Michele, which saw its revenues more than double and profits treble between 2015 and 2019.
Analysts said the earnings miss at Gucci, partly as it trims its wholesale exposure and sales via third parties such as department stores, was likely to weigh on the group's share price and trigger some changes to bolster the brand.
""We believe Gucci management will work hard to open a successful 'new chapter' of growth in the coming year aimed at capturing an older, non-millennial demographic and rebalancing product/price/age mix with a slight change in aesthetics and merchandising,"" said Thomas Chauvet of Citi.
DECENT START
Duplaix said trends across China and Asia as well as the United States remained supportive in the first weeks of the year for the luxury market, although Europe was tougher.
Kering can also find some comfort in the positive performance of its other, smaller brands, with Bottega Veneta in particular growing 2020 sales by nearly 5%. 
The company has relied on e-commerce to reach customers, an area luxury goods group had been slow to develop but which has sped up dramatically. Online business accounted for 13% of Kering's retail sales in 2020, up from 7% a year earlier. 
Duplaix said the group was happy with how 2021 had started but gave no figures for current trading, including the key Chinese New Year holiday which this year fell in mid-February.

Artisan Partners, which said it had built up a stake of more than 3% in the Activia yoghurt maker, also said that Danone's Asian Mizone unit could be offloaded.
""Medical nutrition must be separated from baby nutrition, two businesses that have nothing to do with each other,"" Jan Bennink, an adviser for Artisan Partners, told Le Figaro.
Bennink also said Danone's brands Evian, Badoit and Volvic were key priorities for the company.

Danone came under more pressure last week to make management changes as some shareholders voiced criticism of weak returns at the food group and demanded it split the roles of chief executive and chairman.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 03:00AM ET</span>","BOJ should tailor ETF purchases to reduce distortions, says government panel member","By Leika Kihara and Takahiko Wada
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan has room to be more creative in how it buys exchange-traded funds (ETF) to mitigate market distortions caused by the programme, said Kimie Harada, a government panel member and an expert on the country's market functions.
The BOJ has been buying ETFs for a decade as part of efforts to reflate growth and pull Japan out of deflation. It kept ramping up purchases to prevent a slump in stock prices from hurting household and business confidence, and discourage them from boosting spending.
Harada said in an interview with Reuters that buying tailor-made ETFs instead of standardised ones would allow the BOJ to remove small-cap and low-float stocks from its purchases to prevent its huge presence from distorting price moves.
It would also slash fees the BOJ pays to asset management firms, as they are cheaper for tailored-made ETFs than standardised ones when the size of transaction is big, she said.
The BOJ might find idea is worth considering when it conducts a review of its policy tools in March, said Harada, a panel member of Japan's banking regulator and a professor at Chuo University.
""It's been clear for some time that the BOJ's ETF buying is unsustainable,"" she told Reuters on Wednesday. ""The BOJ has no awareness it has become a huge investor in Japan's stock market, which is problematic.""
The central bank now holds 47 trillion yen ($444 billion) of the asset, and has become the biggest owner of Japanese stocks.
The bank currently pledges to buy ETFs at an annual pace of 6 trillion yen and by up to 12 trillion yen, a commitment that forces it to keep buying even when stock prices are booming.
BOJ policymakers have said the March review would aim to make the ETF-buying programme more nimble, so it can buy smaller amounts or even stop buying when markets are calm.
Harada said the BOJ's dominance is making Japan's stock market less attractive for foreign investors.
In the long run, the BOJ must remove ETFs from its balance sheet, such as by moving them to a separate entity or selling them to a planned new state fund to aid universities, she said.
""It's very dangerous for the BOJ to keep its balance sheet loaded with risky assets,"" she said. ""Buying ETF is a pretty unusual policy with huge demerits, which is why no other central bank has followed suit.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening in a mixed fashion Wednesday, with investors growing wary of rising bond yields even amid continuing positive news surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
European markets have rallied strongly over the last week or so, amid growing hopes the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and the coming of spring will result in the reasonably prompt ending of the severe restrictions in place to combat the spread of the virus. Regional leaders have however been cautious about lifting restrictions, wary of new and more infectious strains of the virus that came to light in the U.K. and South Africa.
The number of virus-related deaths is falling throughout the continent, with France, for example, reporting Tuesday that its seven-day moving average of deaths fell to 381, the first time the average was below 400 since late January.
However, investors are now beginning to turn their focus away from virus-related stats, looking carefully at climbing bond yields as higher rates could prompt some to rotate out of equities and into bonds. 
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 9 basis points on Tuesday to top 1.3%, a level not seen since February 2020. 
In corporate news, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) continued the positive week for investors in mining stocks. The world’s biggest producer of iron ore announced a record $6.5 billion final dividend after reporting a 20% jump in annual profit in 2020. 
Earnings from rivals BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) had been received positively by the market on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, sales at fashion house  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the owner of Gucci, fell more than expected in the fourth quarter, as the coronavirus pandemic hurt tourist travel and shopping habits globally.
British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) will also be in the spotlight Wednesday with the cigarette maker releasing its final results for 2020. U.K. officials ended a corruption investigation into the company’s Africa business last month. 
In economic data, U.K. CPI climbed 0.7% on the year in January, a small rise from the 0.6% seen in December, after prices only fell by 0.2% on the month.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, remaining at elevated levels on the back of the cold snap cutting output from oil and gas fields in the U.S. state of Texas, the country's biggest oil-producing region.
The deep freeze halted Texas oil wells and refineries on Monday and forced restrictions on natural gas and crude pipeline operators, resulting in blackouts throughout the state.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $60.30 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $63.67, both contracts having hit 13-month highs earlier this week.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute will be released later in the session.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,791.95/oz as the returns on bonds became more attractive, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2079.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 01:35AM ET</span>",Traders chase sky-high returns in leveraged exchange traded products,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Frenzied speculation in the shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) may have subsided, but it is business as usual in a small corner of the market where traders looking to turbocharge their gains dabble in what may be some of the market's most volatile funds.
Leveraged and inverse exchange traded products (ETPs) - which aim to magnify the moves of an underlying index or stock several times over - account for only around 1% of the $5.9 trillion universe of U.S.-listed exchange traded products, according to CFRA. 
Yet some of these ETPs are drawing heavy interest from both professional traders and retail investors, though no definite numbers are available on their participation rates. But it is another sign of the voracious appetite for risk that has gripped markets in the wake of unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve, expectations of another fiscal package from lawmakers and a rally that has boosted the S&P 500 Index about 80% from its March lows. 
In recent weeks, investors looking to capitalize on the sharp rise in the PHLX Semiconductor index have poured money into the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares, which seeks to amplify daily moves in the chip index threefold. 
The fund is up about 1,000% over the last 11 months compared with a rally of about 150% in the chip index. It has logged inflows for five straight weeks, the longest such stretch since April, helping boost its assets to a record $3.27 billion. 
Meanwhile, assets in the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF, which provides leveraged exposure to short-term volatility futures, hit a record $2.5 billion on Friday, up about 50% since Feb. 3.
Another leveraged ETF, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ which targets 3X the one-day return on the Nasdaq 100 Index, has nearly doubled its assets over the last 9 months to $11.13 billion, according to data from ProShares. 
The inflows to these funds come amid signs that investors are becoming increasingly willing to take risks, less than a year since a COVID-19 driven sell-off lopped about a third off the S&P 500 Index.
Although these ETPs are leveraged, investors risk only the amount they invested, unless they bought on margin. Still, when the market moves against some of these trades, the losses can be quick and staggering.The latest fund manager survey by BofA Global Research showed cash allocations down to their lowest level since March 2013, allocations to stocks and commodities at their highest level in around a decade and a record in the net percentage of investors taking higher-than-normal risk.
""Investors are seeing volatility and looking to participate from a short-term perspective,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, referring to flows into leveraged and inverse ETPs.
ETPs track an underlying security, index, or financial instrument and trade on exchanges like stocks. Exchange traded funds, which contain investments that can include stocks and bonds, are the most popular type of ETPs.
Analysts caution that leveraged and inverse ETPs, many of which are extremely volatile, are designed to be used as quick in-and-out trading vehicles, not as buy-and-hold securities.
Long-term holding of some of these ETPs can rack up significant losses. For instance, UVXY, which appreciates sharply when stocks turn volatile, tends to fall steadily in value when markets remain calm.
Leveraged and inverse ETFs accounted for more than 20% of the ETF closures in 2020, FactSet data showed, when many struggled to deal with intensely volatile markets. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission in October put off proposals for controls on the sale of leveraged exchange traded funds to retail investors, saying it would study the issue later.

""I thought maybe, when I saw some of these close at the end of last year, the industry might be taking a different look toward these products,"" said Lois Gregson, senior ETF Analyst at FactSet. ""But we have seen different ones open up.""

Halkbank has been at the centre of a major dispute between Ankara and Washington. It was indicted in a separate case in New York in 2019, accused of helping Iran evade American sanctions. 
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote agreed to dismiss the case brought against Halkbank by 876 plaintiffs who were victims or related to victim of ""an overseas terrorist attack committed by a group linked to Iran.""
The court accepted Halkbank's request that the case be dismissed, saying the case could be handled by a court in Turkey.
It ordered the sides to submit an agreement by March 2 to litigate the case in Turkey.
""Dismissal shall be conditioned on Halkbank's agreement to accept service in Turkey, submit to the jurisdiction of Turkish courts, and waive any statute of limitations defense that may have arisen since the filing of this action,"" the court said.
In the main case against Halkbank, U.S. prosecutors accused the lender of using money service providers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions on Tehran, enabling oil and gas revenue to be spent on gold and facilitating sham food and medicine purchases.

Halkbank has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges brought in 2019.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 12:10AM ET</span>",BlackRock warns heavy polluters over emissions data before shareholder meetings,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Polluting companies must disclose the full scope of their greenhouse gas emissions or risk confrontation with investors at their annual shareholders meetings, the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said on Wednesday. 
The warning is the first time BlackRock has publicly sought the release of so-called Scope 3 emissions data, part of its plans to hold companies more to account over climate change.
Scope 3 refers to emissions generated by a company's products or services, rather than just its own operations. For an oil company, for example, this would include the emissions created when its gasoline is used in a car.
The news comes weeks after BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink made climate central to his annual letter to company CEOs, and follows a December move to scale up the number of companies it talks to on the issue.
That more than doubled the number of heavy-emitting companies facing intensive talks to 1,000, although not all would face a vote against directors in the current season of shareholder meetings, with votes dependent on specific circumstances.
""Where corporate disclosures are insufficient to make a thorough assessment, or a company has not provided a credible plan ... we may vote against the directors we consider responsible for climate risk oversight,"" BlackRock said. 
""We may also support shareholder proposals that we believe address gaps in a company's approach to climate risk and the energy transition,"" it said.
BlackRock has been criticised by activists for not ensuring change happens more quickly, particularly given it is often a major shareholder or even the biggest in firms it invests in.
Katrin Ganswindt, a campaigner with environmental group Urgewald, said BlackRock should ditch holdings in companies that did not comply with its demands over emissions.
""Potentially voting against boards is an important way for the world's largest asset manager to take its massive responsibility seriously. However, without the actual threat of exclusion, this policy update remains yet another paper tiger,"" she said.
BlackRock has previously told companies it wants to see their plans for prospering in a low-carbon economy, but the latest missive provides more detail about what that entails.
On target-setting, it wants to see shorter-term goals over the next five years and medium-term targets over 10 years to ensure companies' longer-term plans are solid.
It also wants decision-makers to be well-versed on climate.

""We expect directors to have sufficient fluency in climate risk and the energy transition to enable the whole board – rather than a single director who is a 'climate expert' – to provide appropriate oversight of the company’s plan and targets,"" BlackRock said.

“Our current caution reflects several factors, including ebullient sentiment readings, stretched valuation levels and slipping earnings revision momentum,” the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist wrote Tuesday. “With limited upside even to others’ bullish targets, a neutral stance is realistic.”
Citigroup has a year-end target of 3,800 for the S&P 500 and the strategy team expects the index to trade in a 3,600 to 4,000 range. The benchmark closed around 3,933 Tuesday, just off an all-time high.

U.S. stocks are not in a bubble and comparisons with the early 2000s don’t stack up as the economy is exiting, not entering, a recession and the Federal Reserve isn’t raising rates, according to Levkovich. That suggests a deep selloff in stocks is unlikely, he said.
“While they can back off 10%-20%, we do not envision a 50%-plus collapse,” he wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Tuesday over its handling of worker safety issues around the COVID-19 pandemic at two warehouses, just days after the retailer filed its own lawsuit seeking to block her case. 
In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, James said Amazon's drive for faster growth and higher profits led to its ""flagrant disregard"" of steps needed to protect workers from the coronavirus at a Staten Island fulfillment center and a Queens distribution center, both in New York City.
James also accused Amazon of illegally retaliating when employees began to complain, including last March when it fired activist Christian Smalls purportedly for violating a paid quarantine when he led a protest over conditions at the Staten Island warehouse. 
""Throughout the historic pandemic, Amazon has repeatedly and persistently failed to comply with its obligation to institute reasonable and adequate measures to protect its workers,"" the lawsuit said. 
""Amazon has cut corners in complying with the particular requirements that would most jeopardize its sales volume and productivity rates,"" it added.
James sued four days after Amazon filed its own lawsuit in Brooklyn federal court to stop her from suing.
Amazon said in its lawsuit that federal labor and safety laws took precedence over New York's in addressing workplace safety, and that James was overstepping her authority.""We care deeply about the health and safety of our employees, as demonstrated in our filing,"" Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in response to James' lawsuit. 
""We don't believe the Attorney General's filing presents an accurate picture of Amazon's industry-leading response to the pandemic,"" Nantel added.Amazon also faced scrutiny last March when workers protested conditions at the Staten Island warehouse. New York City announced its own probe at the time.

The attorney general's lawsuit seeks to require Amazon to upgrade its protections for workers, reinstate Smalls, and pay damages to him and another worker who allegedly faced retaliation.

However, some investors expressed concerns over rising interest rates weighing in on some sectors.
The fiscal and monetary stimulus expectations contributed to a steepening yield curve for Treasuries, with the ten-year U.S. Treasury yield on Tuesday rose above 1.3% for the first time since COVID-19 took a global hold in February 2020.

668,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 09:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: BP offers employees shares in rallying cry for low-carbon shift,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major BP (NYSE:BP) is launching its first share award scheme to rally its more than 60,000 employees around CEO Bernard Looney's plan to shift to renewable energy following a bruising year of mass layoffs, bonus suspensions and spending cuts.
The distribution of the shares, which will be locked for four years, will take place throughout 2021. 
The cost of the programme was not yet clear but BP said it would not impact its $2.5 billion cost savings target or plans to reduce debt to $35 billion this year. 
Looney, who took office a year ago, held a company-wide town hall meeting last Tuesday where he announced that all employees would receive shares, the first such programme in BP's history, according to a company spokesman.
""Whether you are a barista in New Zealand, a drilling engineer in Azerbaijan, a pump clerk in South Africa or an analyst in India – over 60,000 people in 66 different countries will receive a share in BP's future,"" Looney said in an internal message seen by Reuters that followed the town hall meeting.
The London-based company's shares have risen nearly 10% so far this year, lifted by stronger crude oil prices. [O/R] 
But over the past year since Looney took office, the shares have lost nearly 40%, hitting a 26-year low in October, due to a collapse in energy prices and a tepid reception from investors to Looney's plan to ""reinvent"" the 111-year old company, shifting it away from oil to wind and solar power.
Looney has said that the share collapse highlighted the need for change, and that the focus should shift to BP's execution of its strategy.
Last year marked one of the toughest in the industry's history, and for BP in particular. The company plunged into a $5.7 billion loss, its first in a decade, after it slashed the value of its oil and gas assets by nearly $20 billion.
BP also laid off around 10,000 employees, or roughly 15% of its global workforce, as part of Looney's plan to increase renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 while reducing its oil output by 40% in a drive to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 
Graphic: BP's annual profits - https://graphics.reuters.com/BP-RESULTS/ygdpzalwrvw/chart.png
BP intends to offset any shareholder dilution that may result from the plan, a company spokesman said. Employees will not be able to sell the shares before 2025.
While the majority of employees will get outright shares, around 5,000 mid-management and senior employees will receive share options, which means that at the end of the vested four-year period they will only be entitled to receive gains made by the shares.
BP is also expected to return to paying bonuses to around 30,000 employees for 2021 after suspending all bonuses last year in response to the collapse in energy prices due to coronavirus, Looney said in the company-wide town hall meeting last week.

The disclosure - which comes after a flood of retail trading drove GameStop and other shares to extreme highs in late January and squeezed hedge funds like Melvin Capital that had bet against it - does not reflect January's moves when Melvin said it liquidated its GameStop position.
Separately, the hedge fund reported a stake of 300,000 Class A shares in Airbnb as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing.
While investors may be especially interested in Melvin's position in GameStop, the firm also adds and sheds many other stock names every quarter, making the so-called 13F filings that detail quarterly holdings closely watched. 
In the fourth quarter Melvin added a new position in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by buying 4.6 million shares. 
The fund, founded by Gabriel Plotkin, also increased its investment in financial company Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) by 168% during the quarter. 
It raised its stake in Visa (NYSE:V) by 59%. The hedge fund also put on a new call option on Mastercard and increased the call option on Visa by 110%.
Stocks that may get a boost once life returns to some semblance of normal as a COVID-19 vaccine is rolled out also got a boost in the portfolio. 

For example, the fund's stake in hotelier  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) was raised by 125% during the quarter. Similarly the firm bought more shares in  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), raising its holdings by 21%.

JD Logistics Inc.’s initial public offering could raise at least $5 billion and value the unit at about $40 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. Details of the proposed spinoff haven’t been finalized, the company said in an IPO prospectus filed to the stock exchange. JD.com’s shares gained more than 5% in Hong Kong Wednesday.
E-commerce operators like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. have benefited as Covid-19 lockdowns drove consumers online and galvanized demand for the services that deliver parcels to doorsteps. Chinese e-commerce revenue should surpass 50% of the country’s total retail sales this year -- a first anywhere in the world, according to researcher EMarketer.
JD Logistics’s imminent IPO would be a milestone for its parent, which spent years building one of China’s largest courier services to ensure on-time delivery and retain control over its shipping network. That inhouse operation, which spanned more than 800 warehouses across the country as of Sept. 30., has been credited for speeding JD.com’s recovery from early Covid 19 disruptions.
“The spin-off and separate listing will help JD.com crystallize the value of its logistics arm, which it had invested in heavily for more than a decade,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “The funds raised can aid JD Logistics’s expansion without burdening JD.com. Going forward investors and management can focus on two distinct businesses, e-commerce and logistics, which have different growth and profitability profiles.”

Chinese e-commerce sales have increased several fold during the pandemic, making companies that help handle shipping and deliveries particularly attractive, Elysia Tse, head of Asia Pacific research and strategy at LaSalle Investment Management, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this month.
JD Logistics’s net loss narrowed to 11.7 million yuan ($1.8 million) in the nine months ended September from more than 80 times that a year earlier. Revenue grew 43.2% to 49.5 billion yuan, according to its filing.
BofA Securities Inc.,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Haitong International Capital are the joint sponsors of the proposed IPO, according to the prospectus.

Guangzhou, China-based EHang's shares closed 62.7% lower at $46.30 on Nasdaq. 
Wolfpack Research, which specializes in short-selling, or betting that shares will fall, said EHang is ""an elaborate stock promotion"" and that the producer of unmanned aerial vehicle technology has lied about its products, manufacturing, revenues and partnerships.
In response, EHang said the Wolfpack report contains ""numerous errors, unsubstantiated statements, and misinterpretation of information.""
The drone maker also said it is in compliance with the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq.

EHang's stock had soared from around $13 a share in early December to $124.09 on Friday. The stock made its U.S. debut in December 2019 after an initial public offering priced at $12.50 share.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fifteen U.S. states sued the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Tuesday after it agreed last month under then-President Donald Trump to an auto industry request to delay the start of dramatically higher penalties for companies that fail to meet fuel efficiency requirements.
The state attorneys general, including from California and New York, filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit over the decision announced in the final days of the Trump administration.
NHTSA said last month it expected the final rule to cut future burdens on industry by up to $1 billion annually.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said on Twitter the decision ""cements the Trump (administration's) legacy of putting industry ahead of public health.""
A spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Department, NHTSA's parent agency, declined to comment on the legal challenge but said it is ""reviewing this and other recent rules for consistency with the environmental, equity and other policy directions of this new Administration.""
A group representing major automakers did not immediately comment on Tuesday.
Last month, the Sierra Club and National Resources Defense Council also sued NHTSA for delaying penalties.
Trump's move followed an appeals court ruling in August overturning the administration’s 2019 decision to suspend a regulation more than doubling penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel efficiency requirements.
Congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation. In response, NHTSA issued rules hiking fines to $14 from $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon a new vehicle consumes in excess of required standards.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, now known as Stellantis NV, paid a $79 million civil penalty for failing to meet 2017 fuel economy requirements, after paying $77.3 million for not meeting 2016 requirements.
Environmental groups urged the Trump administration to retain the increased penalties, noting U.S. fuel economy fines lost nearly 75% of their original value because they had been increased only once - from $5 to $5.50 in 1997 - since 1975.

President Joe Biden has also ordered a review of the Trump administration's decisions to roll back vehicle emissions standards through 2026 and bar California from setting vehicle tailpipe emissions limits.

(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp pilots voted to reject a tentative agreement that would have given the airline contractual relief to implement its planned partnership with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc,, their union said in a statement on Tuesday.
New York-based budget carrier JetBlue and international major American Airlines announced plans for a strategic tie-up in July to give them more muscle in the U.S. Northeast as the industry plots its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
For any agreement to proceed, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) representing JetBlue pilots said management must provide assurances over job safety.
""Job security, especially during turbulent points in our industry, is a main concern of every pilot,” Chris Kenney, chairman of the JetBlue unit of ALPA, said.
""We are disappointed in the results of the vote,"" a JetBlue spokesman said, noting the company and ALPA had worked together on the tentative agreement. 
""We are committed to our alliance with American Airlines and plan to move forward so we can deliver its benefits to both crewmembers and customers,"" he said. 
The tentative agreement gave some relief from restrictions in 2018 collective bargaining on the types of tie-ups JetBlue could undertake in exchange for an additional pay raise and some enhancement in job security, the union said.
American Airlines' management has told its pilots the deal would comply with their clauses on scope, or the amount of flying that can be done by other carriers, but the union is concerned about the impact it would have on jobs for domestic flights, a union spokesman said.
""We've never seen a code share at American that has led to more mainline jobs,"" said Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association representing American's pilots.

American has said the deal, which is currently under U.S. regulatory review, will help boost its international flying operations.

(Reuters) - Many U.S companies, including FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), were forced to temporarily shut operations on Tuesday as a bone-chilling winter storm caused power outages and gas shortages in parts of the country.
The rare deep freeze swept the southern North America over the three-day Presidents Day holiday weekend, leaving millions without power and sending front-month gas futures to an over three-month high.
General Motors canceled the first shift at its plants in Spring Hill, Tennessee, Bowling Green in Kentucky, Fort Wayne in Indiana and Arlington in Texas, factories that make some of its most profitable pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles including Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade.
""We will be making decisions at the respective plants later this morning regarding their production status for 2nd shift today,"" a GM spokesman said.
Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor also scrapped the first shift at some of their U.S. plants. Jeep maker Stellantis said it suspended production at its Toledo assembly complex in Ohio.
GM's smaller rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) said it had stopped production of best-selling F-150 pickup trucks at its Kansas City assembly plant until Feb. 21 to conserve its supply of natural gas.
Some other Ford facilities that suspended operations included Hermosillo assembly plant in Mexico, Flat Rock factory in Michigan and Ohio assembly plant in Avon Lake, Ohio.
Package delivery company  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) said operations at its Dallas hub in Texas and Worldport air hub at Louisville International Airport were back to normal. 
The company said it did not have any coronavirus vaccine shipments in its network on Monday night.
UPS rival FedEx said severe weather was affecting its ability to deliver packages in certain cities.
Poultry producer  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) said it suspended operations at its Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana (Hammond) processing plants Monday and Tuesday. 
A spokeswoman for  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), the biggest U.S. meat company by sales, said the firm had suspended or scaled back operations at some facilities.

The freeze also wreaked havoc on the U.S. energy sector, bringing operations to a halt at the Houston Ship channel, while several oil refineries remained offline.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Tuesday announced two major new investments, revealing an $8.6 billion stake in the phone company  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and a $4.1 billion stake in oil company  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
The investments were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock holdings as of Dec. 31.
Berkshire also disclosed a new $499 million stake in the professional services company Marsh & McLennan Cos.
To make room, Berkshire reduced its investments in several companies including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), though at approximately $121 billion the iPhone maker remains by far its largest common stock holding.
Verizon shares rose 3.0%, Chevron rose 2.2% and Marsh was unchanged in after-hours trading following Berkshire's filing.
Tuesday's filing signals where Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler see value, without saying who bought what. Buffett normally handles larger investments such as Verizon and Chevron. 
""They are Buffett-esque investments,"" said Steven Check, who invests $1.3 billion at Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California, including $300 million in Berkshire. ""Verizon has a low price-earnings ratio, and while oil prices are recovering the stocks still have a long way to go.""
The filing also shows Berkshire deploying some of its cash hoard, which totaled $145.7 billion as of Sept. 30.
Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream, but has gone five years since its last big acquisition.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate had begun investing in Verizon, Chevron and Marsh by last year's third quarter.
As it had several times before, Berkshire won permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delay revealing the stakes, to avoid having investors piggyback on its wagers before it was done buying.
Tuesday's filing showed Berkshire, a major investor in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), cutting back on other banks, reducing its stake in  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and shedding JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC).
Berkshire also invested more in drugmakers Abbvie Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co and Merck & Co while selling a small stake in COVID-19 vaccine maker  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) It also shed mining company Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) Corp.
Doug Kass, managing partner of Seabreeze Capital Investment Inc in Palm Beach, Florida, said the Verizon investment ""makes sense"" reflecting the company's dividend payout and wireless revenue growth prospects.
He said the lowered bank stakes may reflect Buffett's concern about persistent low interest rates, and loan losses related to the coronavirus.

Berkshire is expected to release year-end results and Buffett's annual shareholder letter on Feb. 27.

Morningstar's credit ratings business allegedly violated disclosure and internal controls requirements in 30 commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions from 2015 to 2016 when the agency allowed analysts to make undisclosed adjustments to key stresses in its modeling, the SEC said. 
A spokesperson for Morningstar Inc did not respond immediately to request for comment. 
Ratings agencies came under criticism after the U.S. financial crisis as inflated ratings of mortgage-backed securities helped fuel a U.S. housing bubble. In the wake of the crisis Congress charged the SEC with overseeing the ratings agencies, but the agency struggled with the oversight due to insufficient resources and technology changes, Reuters previously reported.
Morningstar previously paid $3.5 million to settle SEC charges it violating conflict of interest rules designed to separate credit ratings and analysis from sales and marketing.
U.S. laws require rating agencies to disclose their ratings methodologies and stick to those frameworks, the SEC said on Tuesday. But according to the SEC's allegations Morningstar analysts frequently made undisclosed adjustments to lower the stress applied to their models. 
Those change benefited issuers that had paid for the ratings, allowing them to pay investors less interest, the SEC said.

The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York against Morningstar Credit Ratings LLC. Morningstar Inc now operates credit ratings through its subsidiary DBRS Morningstar.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of small hedge funds were in a position to profit from the Reddit rally that sent shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other out-of-favor stocks rocketing higher last month at the expense of prominent investors who had bet against the stocks, according to securities filings released Tuesday. 
Hedge funds including Maverick Capital, Shellback Capital, Landscape Capital Management, and Engineers Gate Manager LP were among those that added a new position or increased their stakes in GameStop during the quarter that ended Dec. 30, according to a regulatory filings known as 13-Fs. Had each fund sold its shares of GameStop near the record closing price of $347.15, they would have banked gains of 1,600% or more. 
Shellback, for instance, could have seen its 200,000 shares reach a value as high as $69.5 million had it held through Jan. 27, a gain of nearly 1,750% from its market value of $3,768,000 at the end of December. 
Hedge fund Senvest, which told the Wall Street Journal that it scored a $700 million profit on the GameStop position, increased its position in the company by 56% when it bought 1.8 mln shares.
Maverick, increased its stake by 164%, or 2.9 million shares, leaving it with 4.7 million shares, regulatory filings show. 
The filings do not include short positions and funds may also have been short, which would have diminished profits from long positions. 
GameStop shares surged as investors following the Reddit forum WallStreetBets bought the stock hoping to punish hedge funds such as Melvin Capital Management that had taken short positions in the stock. Melvin lost more than 50% in January, requiring a $2.75 billion capital infusions from hedge funds Point72 Asset Management and Citadel. 
Other hedge funds that entered January with bearish bets against GameStop included Maplelane Capital and Sculptor Capital, according to securities filings. 
Maverick, Shellback Capital, Landscape Capital Management, and Engineers Gate Manager LP and Senvest did not respond for requests to comment for this story. 
OTHER BETS
Along with positions in GameStop, hedge fund managers navigated a quarter that included the addition of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to the benchmark S&P 500 and President Donald Trump's unsuccessful attempts to overturn the result of the Nov. 3 presidential election. 
Tesla's inclusion in the S&P 500 forced index-tracking funds to buy shares, boosting its shares during the fourth quarter. Some hedge fund such as Coatue Management significantly cut back their stakes during the same time period, leaving them less likely to gain from the company's 13.4% gain for the year to date. 
George Soros’ Soros Fund Management exited its position in  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) while Kerrisdale Capital, whose founder told Reuters this year the company is enjoying a turnaround, cut its stake by 29%.
Shares of the company are up nearly 37% for the year to date. 

Tiger Global, meanwhile, appeared to be betting big on several newly-public companies, raising its stakes in GoodRx Holdings Inc, DoorDash, Snowflake Inc, Airbnb, and  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Tuesday backed first-ever fuel efficiency standards for new airplanes finalized by the Trump administration in its waning days that a dozen U.S. states have challenged as too lenient, and that President Joe Biden's administration is reviewing.
The largest U.S. planemaker asked a U.S. appeals court in Washington for approval to intervene on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is being sued over its decision to finalize the first-ever standards regulating greenhouse gas emissions from airplanes. The plaintiffs, 12 states, the District of Columbia and three environmental groups, want tougher emissions rules.
The states said last fall the EPA rule lags ""existing technology by more than 10 years and would result in no GHG reductions at all compared to business-as-usual.""
Airplanes have been the largest source of transportation greenhouse gas emissions not subject to rules. In 2016, the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) agreed on global airplane emissions standards aimed at makers of small and large planes, including Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and  Boeing Co , which both endorsed the rules.
Boeing noted the ICAO emissions standards effort began under former President Barack Obama's administration, in which Biden was vice president.
The planemaker argued that it is ""essential"" rules ""be reasonably achievable, given the billions of dollars it costs to design, build, and certify new airplanes.""
""Attempts to overturn regulation directly aligned with successful cooperative international efforts to combat climate change, supported by more than 190 countries, will only discourage future international agreements,"" Boeing said in a statement.
The EPA declined to comment on Boeing's filing.
In January, the Trump EPA said it did not expect the rule to result in emissions reductions and did not project it would ""cause manufacturers to make technical improvements to their airplanes that would not have occurred"" otherwise.
The Environmental Defense Fund has said the EPA’s ""do-nothing rule is totally inadequate in light of the climate crisis.""
The new rules apply to new-type designs as of January 2020 and to in-production airplanes or those with amended type certificates starting in 2028.
Airplanes covered by the rule account for 10% of U.S. transportation greenhouse gas emissions and 3% of total U.S. emissions. 
Separately, industry group Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) in a letter released Tuesday urged the Biden Administration ""to continue to prioritize multilateral solutions"" on airplane emissions.

AIA also urged the Federal Aviation Administration to develop regulations to allow U.S. manufacturers to certify aircraft to the global CO2 standard. ""Our industry is ready to work with the Biden Administration to improve the sustainability of air travel,"" AIA wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a record closing high on Tuesday as cyclical sectors gained on the prospect of more fiscal aid to lift the U.S. economy from a coronavirus-driven slump.
The Nasdaq, however, dipped as technology stocks moved lower, while concerns over rising interest rates kept the benchmark S&P 500 little changed.
Sectors poised to benefit the most from a reopening economy, including energy and financials, had the biggest percentage gains. President Joe Biden has pitched a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill and is pressing Congress to pass it in the coming weeks in order to get $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans and bolster unemployment payments.
The S&P 500 banking index climbed as the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries hit its highest since February 2020. [US/]
""We came into this week with a positive perspective on the Biden administration's attempt to deliver a sizeable package,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""Markets have greeted that with positive moves.""
Conversely, utilities and real estate were among the S&P 500 sectors with the biggest percentage losses. Utilities and real estate, because of their steady earnings and high dividend yields, are often considered bond proxies and tend to move in tandem with Treasuries. Shares of homebuilders, which are rate-sensitive, also fell.
Technology stocks slipped as well. That sector includes many stocks with high earnings multiples, which may also come under pressure with rising yields, according to some market analysts.
The S&P 500 backed off from session highs as yields rose on Tuesday, which reflected investor worries about the day's surge in bond yields, said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. Equities would likely tolerate a gradual ascent in rates, but a sprint higher could create turbulence, in his view.
""Even though interest rates are still really low, the stock market is going to be very, very sensitive to changes,"" he said.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.52 points, or 0.2%, to 31,519.92, the S&P 500 lost 2.38 points, or 0.06%, to 3,932.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 47.98 points, or 0.34%, to 14,047.50.
A sharp drop in new coronavirus infections, progress in vaccinations and a stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings season have reinforced hopes of a quick business recovery this year.
This week's earnings reports from  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc, Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) Corp, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc, Norwegian Cruise Lines and TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP) will be closely watched for signs of a pickup in global travel demand.
Shares of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related firms including Silvergate Capital (NYSE:SI) Corp, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Marathon Patent Group surged as bitcoin briefly climbed past $50,000.

Investors will also focus this week on the minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting, where it reaffirmed its pledge to maintain a dovish policy stance.

Investing.com – The Dow closed at another record high Tuesday, led by a rally in energy stocks following a cold snap across parts of the U.S. and ongoing investor optimism over the economic recovery as Covid-19 infections continue to fall.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.20%, or 62 points, though had gained about 150 points intraday to hit record high of 31,608.63. The S&P 500 was down 0.08%, and had also climbed to record high intraday. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.34%.

Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Apache (NASDAQ:APA) and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) rallied sharply, with the latter up more than 6%.
Financials were also in favor as bank stocks continued to benefit from the melt up in U.S. government bond yields amid falling Covid-19 infections and a step up in vaccinations. The U.S. Treasury 10-year yield topped 1.300% for the first time since Feb. 27. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) climbed more than 2%, while  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) gained more than 3%.
Higher interest rates are seen as a boon for banks, boosting net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest they paid out.

684,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 03:59PM ET</span>","Fed Minutes, Retail Sales, Bitcoin Bounce: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks continued their record-setting march higher and bitcoin briefly traded above $50,000, a key psychological hurdle as the cryptocurrency quickly gains mainstream acceptance.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both touched new all-time intraday highs after traders returned from a three-day weekend in the U.S., only to lose steam late in the session.
Among the day’s standouts, energy stocks gained as a storm and deep freeze in the South cut electricity to millions of households. Bank stocks also rose on Tuesday on optimism for the economic recovery.
More vaccines are slated for delivery as more Americans get their first doses and new cases and deaths continue to fall.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. FOMC minutes
Last month the Federal Reserve kept its easy money policy in place as it continued efforts to boost the economy. On Wednesday, we get a closer look at its deliberations at that meeting with the release of the Federal Open Market Committee’s January minutes at 2:00 PM ET (1900 GMT).
Business activity slowed again with Covid’s surge late last year, but now vaccines promise better days ahead. President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which is still being debated on Capitol Hill, could offer another boost to a recovering economy, though the Fed has pledged it will do what it can to support growth.
2. Retail sales for January
Another barometer for the health of the American consumer is retail sales, and the data for January are due out Wednesday at 8:30 AM ET (1350 GMT). 
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the retail number to be 1.1% compared to a decline of 0.7% in December.
3. Bitcoin surges past $50,000
The increasingly popular cryptocurrency pierced through $50,000 and then settled back in the high $48,000s, but that didn’t stop people from talking about it all day. Bitcoin surged more than 300% last year and is up about 70% this year as high-profile companies jump in.
Last week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) sent the crypto surging after saying it bought $1.5 billion worth of it. ON Tuesday, a business intelligence company called MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) said it was going to sell $600 million of convertible notes to invest the proceeds in more bitcoin. It did a similar deal in December.
Investors are undoubtedly wondering just how much further bitcoin can go. Some experts believe it could double from here, especially if companies follow Tesla and others and invest in it as an inflation hedge.

(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) said on Tuesday it would return to selling individual health insurance plans on the online marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as Obamacare, saying the market had stabilized.
CVS Health's Aetna (NYSE:AET) insurance unit and other large health insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) exited these online exchanges in 2017 and 2018, due to financial losses and uncertainty as Republicans took aim at former U.S. President Barack Obama's signature law.
More than 11.4 million people signed up in 2020 for these plans, which provide government subsidies based on income levels.
""We've been studying the individual market for a while. Some of the remedies have been put in place. Clearly there's a big market,"" CVS Health's recently-appointed Chief Executive Officer Karen Lynch said at a post-earnings conference call. 
The move by CVS comes as President Joe Biden told the U.S. Supreme Court last week that the ACA should be upheld and Democrats consider expanding coverage to more people.
Lynch made the comments during a company conference call where the company said it expects 2021 adjusted profit between $7.39 and $7.55 per share, versus $7.50 in 2020. 
Analysts' had expected 2021 profit of $7.54 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. CVS shares fell 4.7% to $70.68 in afternoon trading.
Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said the share move seemed overdone given that the 2021 financial outlook was in line with the company's previous comments.
COVID-19 
CVS said that COVID-19 vaccinations and testing would contribute $400 mln to $500 mln next year. 
The company has administered over three million COVID-19 vaccines in long-term care facilities and is now giving 250,000 shots per week in its pharmacies under a broader federal program. 
The vaccines are two-dose regimens requiring 15 minutes' observation for each patient on site, adding the potential for additional sales, the company said.
Lynch said it will increase dose vaccinations and expand into more pharmacies and states as soon as March or April if supply increases as hoped. It plans to offer 20 million to 25 million shots per month. 
During the conference call, CVS executive vice president Alan Lotvin said that based on conversations with pharmaceutical makers, CVS estimates about 500 million doses of vaccines would be made available between now and the end of June. 
Most vaccine will be from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently considering a vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Inc. that could be authorized in a few weeks and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc is also hoping to apply to the FDA in coming months.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.30 per share in the reported quarter, beating estimates of $1.24 per share.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday said  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) is not entitled to recoup half a billion dollars of its own money that it mistakenly wired lenders of Revlon Inc, in what he called ""a banking error of perhaps unprecedented nature and magnitude.""
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said the Aug. 11, 2020, transfers were ""final and complete transactions, not subject to revocation.""
Citigroup plans to appeal. ""We believe we are entitled to the funds and will continue to pursue a complete recovery of them,"" a spokeswoman said.
The blunder was the latest misstep involving internal controls at Citigroup, which federal regulators fined $400 million in October over longstanding deficiencies.
Acting as Revlon's loan agent, Citigroup had wired $893 million to the cosmetic company's lenders, appearing to pay off a loan not due until 2023, when it intended to send only a $7.8 million interest payment.
The New York-based bank blamed human error for the gaffe, and some lenders returned money they were sent.
But 10 asset managers, including Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management, refused, and Citigroup sued to recoup approximately $501 million they received.
The bank said Revlon's lenders knew or should have known the transfers were a mistake, and that Revlon, controlled by billionaire Ron Perelman, could not afford such a big payment.
But in a 101-page decision, following a six-day trial in December, Furman said the transfers were a ""discharge for value,"" matching ""to the penny"" what the lenders were owed.
""The non-returning lenders believed, and were justified in believing, that the payments were intentional,"" Furman wrote. ""To believe otherwise - to believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion - would have been borderline irrational.""
Furman left in place a temporary ban on the lenders' using the transferred funds, reflecting Citigroup's expected appeal.
In a joint statement, the lenders' lawyers Adam Abensohn and Robert Loigman said they were ""extremely pleased"" with the decision.
Administrative agents typically distribute interest payments and perform back-office services for clients.
Industry groups have said a ruling against Citigroup could expose banks to excessive liability risks.
The Loan Syndications and Trading Association, whose roughly 530 members include Citigroup and some Revlon creditors, said such a ruling could destabilize the $1.2 trillion U.S. syndicated loan market.
Shortfalls in Citigroup's internal controls were a factor in Chief Executive Mike Corbat's planned early retirement this month.

The case is In re: Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-06539.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. passenger airline traffic fell 60.1% in 2020 to the lowest number since 1984 as the COVID-19 pandemic devastated demand for air travel, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Tuesday.
In total, there were 368 million passengers in 2020, down from 922.6 million in 2019. The previous yearly low was 351.6 million in 1984, the department said.
December air travel fell 62%, slightly more than the decline in November, the department said. For all of 2020, U.S. domestic air travel fell by 58.7%, while international travel fell 70.4% as many countries imposed significant travel restrictions. U.S. airlines say air travel demand remains down more than 60% through early February.
Airlines for America, an industry trade group representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and others, said the nine largest U.S. airlines lost $46 billion before taxes in 2020 and said that passenger volumes are unlikely to return to pre-COVID-19 levels before 2023 or 2024.
U.S. citizens are still barred from travel to much of Europe and other countries, and business travel remains severely depressed. The number of flights operated by U.S. carriers remains down about 45%.
A $1.9 trillion COVID-10 relief bill making its way through Congress would allocate another $14 billion to extend payroll assistance to U.S. airlines to keep thousands of workers on the job through Sept. 30.

Congress has previously approved $40 billion in payroll assistance for U.S. airlines and $25 billion in low-interest loans.

695,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 11:09AM ET</span>",Hunt for the Future Faangs Vaults Invesco ETF to $1 Billion Club,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors chasing the next tech wave are driving a divergence in fortunes for two of Invesco’s exchange-traded funds.
The Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (ticker QQQJ) crossed the $1 billion-in-assets milestone last week, just four months after launching, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s absorbed roughly $343 million in inflows so far this year, while the $162 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (ticker QQQ) -- the world’s fifth-largest ETF -- has posted outflows of about $1.1 billion in 2021.
After a dominant performance in 2020 from the group of Faang stocks -- which includes giants such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. -- investors are on the hunt for the tech rally’s next leaders, said CFRA Research’s Todd Rosenbluth. QQQJ is populated by mid-cap stocks that “may have potential to one day join the Nasdaq 100,” according to Invesco’s website.
“After the strong run for the megacap growth stocks in 2020, investors have sought the next wave of companies in 2021, many of which are found in QQQJ,” said Rosenbluth, CFRA’s director of ETF research. “Further, as the new ETF has grown in size, investors have more confidence in its liquidity.”
So far, those investors plowing money into QQQJ have been rewarded. The fund has soared 40% since its October low, compared with QQQ’s 25% rally over that time period.
QQQJ’s biggest holdings include  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc. and CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) Inc., which have climbed 46% and 16% year-to-date, respectively. Meanwhile, Apple and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., which are up 1.5% and 10% so far this year, are QQQ’s largest weights.
With the march above $1 billion, QQQJ is joining a still-exclusive club in the $5.9 trillion ETF universe. About 496 of the 2,330 U.S. listed ETFs -- or 21% -- have over $1 billion in assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The bifurcation in QQQ and QQQJ reflects a broader cooling of demand for large-cap stocks, according to Chris Zaccarelli of Independent Advisor Alliance. That tilt can also be seen in the small-cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ticker IWM), which has absorbed $122 million year-to-date, while the $339 billion  SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust  (ticker ASX:SPY) has shed about $8.9 billion in 2021.
“Investors have gone beyond the megatech rally of 2020 and have looked for companies further down the market-cap scale,” said Zaccarelli, the firm’s chief investment officer. “They are looking for more opportunities from outperformance from the up-and-comers than from the established players.”

OSLO (Reuters) - Nasdaq Clearing has appealed a fine from Sweden's financial supervisory authority over deficiencies uncovered in the wake of a trader's default in 2018, the Nasdaq subsidiary said on Tuesday.
The financial watchdog on Jan. 27 issued a warning and a 300 million Swedish crowns ($36.19 million) administrative fine to Nasdaq Clearing for insufficient follow-up of memberships, miscalculations of trading margins and over its risk management.
Nasdaq Clearing said in a statement it had decided to appeal the decision as it disagreed with several of the fundamental assessments that underpinned the decision as well as its conclusions.
""Fundamentally, it is our belief that while the member default showed that improvements could be made, it also showed that our system worked and that the security walls and the default waterfall were sufficiently robust, even in such a stressful and highly unlikely event,"" it said.
Nasdaq Clearing said the matter was now the subject of an appeals process at the Stockholm administrative court and that it would refrain from further comments at this stage. 
Following the default, Nasdaq had launched a comprehensive programme to strengthen its resilience and robustness, it said last month. 

The trader default followed big fluctuations in market spreads, when power prices in the Nordic region - which depends on hydroelectric power - fell amid heavy rain while German prices spiked along with the cost of carbon, Nasdaq said at the time.

Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) said on Tuesday it had decided to begin a formal process aimed at divesting Reebok as part of a five-year strategy it plans to present on March 10, when the company will also publish 2020 results. It will report Reebok as a discontinued operation from the first quarter of 2021.
A banking source said the business could be worth around 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).
""Reebok and Adidas will be able to significantly better realize their growth potential independently of each other,"" Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said in a statement .
The company bought Boston-based Reebok for $3.8 billion in 2006, but its sluggish performance led to repeated calls from investors to dispose of the brand.
In the meantime, Adidas managed to eat into Nike's dominance in the United States with its core brand, helped by partnership with celebrities like Kanye West, Beyonce and Pharrell Williams (NYSE:WMB).
After Rorsted took over as CEO in 2016, he launched a turnaround plan for Reebok, which helped it return to profitability, but its performance continued to lag that of the core Adidas brand and it was then hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Reebok's net sales fell 7% in the third quarter of 2020 to 403 million euros ($488 million), after falling as much as 44% the preceding quarter. In 2019, Adidas wrote down Reebok's book value by nearly half, compared with 2018, to 842 million euros.
Options for Adidas include spinning Reebok off as a stand-alone public company, or selling the brand to private equity, another major sports retailer or a multibrand player like VF Corp (NYSE:VFC).
Reebok's recent collaborations with celebrities like Cardi B and a refreshed focus on women's apparel have put the brand in a better place, analysts say.
Adidas said in November it was expecting a drop in overall sales for the end of 2020 as the reimposition of lockdowns in Europe offset a return to growth in China and strong demand for running gear and products designed by Beyonce.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher after the long weekend, with risk appetite emboldened by a sharp drop in coronavirus cases and reassurances about enduring support from the Federal Reserve.
By 10:45 AM ET (1545 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 123 points, or 0.39%. The S&P 500 was up 0.31% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.46%. All three indices hit record highs in the first minutes of trading.
The moves came after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard played down suggestions that the Fed’s loose monetary policy was fueling an asset bubble, either in stocks or in assets such as Bitcoin, which topped $50,000 for the first time earlier in the day. Bullard dismissed the current action in stocks as “just normal investing.""
MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), a software maker that has reinvented itself essentially as a vehicle for holding bitcoin, fell 0.9% after filing for a $600 million issue of convertible notes.

BHP ADRs rose 6.9% and Glencore ADRs rose 7.0% to their highest since April 2019. In both cases, a surge in Chinese demand for their products enabled the groups to absorb heavy impairments.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 10:16AM ET</span>","Kidnap capital Mexico eyes biometric phone registry, sparking privacy fears","By Cassandra Garrison
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A plan by Mexican lawmakers to put millions of cell phone users' data in a biometric registry, billed as a tool to fight kidnapping and extortion, has sparked a backlash from telecoms companies and rights groups who warn it could lead to stolen data and higher costs. 
Already approved in the lower house of Congress, the reform is in line with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's vow to counter crime using intelligence methods rather than force, but critics say it reveals the pitfalls of governments seeking to gather more citizen data for law enforcement purposes.
The bill is scheduled to be taken up in the current session in the Senate, where the ruling MORENA party and allies hold a majority.
Under the plan,  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and other carriers would be responsible for collecting customers' data, including fingerprints or eye biometrics, to submit to a registry managed by Mexico's telecoms regulator.
But a telecoms industry group that counts some major companies as members warned in an open letter that the reform could increase phone theft as criminals look to get around the registry by stealing devices and could risk customers' safety if personal data were misused.
America Movil -- owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim -- AT&T and Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) declined to comment.
The Mexico Internet Association, which includes Slim’s Telcel wireless company as a partner, said the registry would cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars to implement, could put jobs at risk and create a human rights violation by compromising personal data protection. 
Rights groups describe the plan as no better than a similar registry, which did not include biometric data, that Mexico dismantled in 2012 after a review found extortion calls, many of which come from inside prisons, actually increased by 40% after the data was leaked on the black market. 
The new reform could lead people being exploited by bad actors and potentially wrongly convicted of crimes, according to Irene Levy, the president of Mexican telecommunications watchdog Observatel. 
""El Chapo Guzman is not going to say, 'This is my phone number and I am El Chapo Guzman,'"" Levy said, referring to the Sinaloa Cartel kingpin who is in prison in the United States. 
""What criminals do is ask someone to go and buy certain telephone lines, and when there is a crime committed with these numbers, this boy or girl - who took the money out of necessity and registered without knowing the consequences - will go to jail.""
Given the government's strong support in Congress, the bill has a good chance of being passed, said Jorge Bravo, a political science professor at Mexico's National Autonomous University (UNAM). However, a rethink is possible if public concern grows ahead of June mid-term elections.
EXTORTION CALLS
However, Maria de los Angeles Huerta, a lawmaker with the ruling MORENA party, said the registry was needed to help fight kidnapping in Mexico, which has the highest incidence of the crime in the Americas and the third-highest globally, according to international consultancy Control Risks. 
Criminals have been known to use up to 17 prepaid phones to carry out one kidnapping, making it nearly impossible for police to track them down, Huerta said. 
The reform's supporters argue there is too little control of the country's more than 120 million mobile lines, 83% of which use pre-paid SIM cards available at corner stores. 
As things now stand, you can ""buy a card and put it on your phone.... make an extortion call and then throw the phone in the garbage,"" said Huerta.
The registry would make it harder for mobile users to remain anonymous by requiring proof of identification alongside hard-to-fake biometric data for anyone opening a new line. That information would then be available to law enforcement upon request. 
Huerta called it a necessary tool in Mexico's fight against extortion. 
""Biometric data is not so falsifiable. If you are a horrendous criminal, you can tell your mother to open (a line), but at least you're going to find the criminal's mother, right?"" she said.
The new registry would mandate the installation of biometric equipment, either to capture fingerprints or iris scans, anywhere mobile lines are sold. 
While 155 countries around the world maintain cellphone user registries, Mexico's collection of biometric data would go further than most. 
Only about 8% of countries with registries also require biometrics, mainly for prepaid SIM card users, according to global telecoms industry lobby GSMA. Mexico's registry would collect biometric data from all cellphone users in the country including from postpaid customers who are normally seen as unlikely criminals. 
Many of those countries which do retain biometric data have questionable records on human rights, including China, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. No Western countries collect biometric data from cellphone users. 
Still, Mexico could serve as a model for other countries in the region, including Chile, where SIM registration is under consideration, experts said. 
The reform implies a sweeping change for telecoms companies by making them responsible for the cost of collecting the data and then submitting it to the registry. 
Others say the registry will obstruct mobile access for indigenous people who may lack official forms of identification.
Peru introduced fingerprint collection in 2016 for a regulator-managed registry, but it led to complications in rural areas where mobile phone penetration was already a challenge. 
If users fail to submit the data, mobile carriers will have to cut their lines, further isolating people who rely on their phones for internet access, said Elena Estavillo, a former commissioner of the IFT, Mexico's telecoms regulator.
""We should highlight this as something very worrying because it can be a circumstance that discourages or, for some people, makes it impossible to have access to these services, which is a fundamental right,"" Estavillo said.

The first non-family member to head the hotel chain, Sorenson, 62, had earlier this month stepped back from full-time role to treat the cancer that was diagnosed in 2019. 
Marriott said he died on Monday and that it will appoint a new CEO in the next two weeks.
Sorenson took charge in March 2012 and led the $13 billion acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts in 2016, resulting in Marriott becoming the world's biggest hotel chain with over 1 million rooms.
""He had an uncanny ability to anticipate where the hospitality industry was headed and position Marriott for growth,"" Executive Chairman JW Marriott, Jr said in a statement.
During Sorenson's tenure, the company's shares have jumped 242%, despite the 15% dent over the past year due to the coronavirus crisis that brought travel to a near halt.
In his absence, Stephanie Linnartz, group president, consumer operations, is overseeing the company's lodging division, while Tony Capuano, group president for global development, is in charge of the U.S. and Canada lodging business.

""Given the leadership of the Marriott family and of Arne, the executive bench at Marriott is arguably the strongest in the industry and will have the knowledge and leadership to carry on the Marriott way,"" Macquarie Research analyst Chad Beynon said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Cairn Energy (OTC:CRNCD) has filed a case in a U.S. district court to enforce a $1.2 billion arbitration award it won in a tax dispute against India, a court document showed, ratcheting up pressure on the government to pay its dues.
In December, an arbitration body awarded the British firm damages of more than $1.2 billion plus interest and costs. The tribunal ruled India breached an investment treaty with Britain and said New Delhi was liable to pay.
Cairn asked the U.S. court to recognise and confirm the award, including payments due since 2014 and interest compounded semi-annually, according to the Feb. 12 filing seen by Reuters.
The case marked a first step in Cairn's efforts towards recovering its dues, potentially by seizing Indian assets, if the government did not pay, a source with knowledge of the arbitration case told Reuters.
""If Cairn wins the case, it will be a step towards attaching and seizing Indian assets overseas, especially in the U.S.,"" the source said.
Reuters reported last month that Cairn was identifying India's overseas assets, including bank accounts and even Air India planes or Indian ships, that could be seized in the absence of a settlement. 
Cairn declined to comment but pointed to a Feb. 9 Twitter post where it said Chief Executive Simon Thomson was looking forward to meeting India's Finance Minister in Delhi next week.
""We would request, along with others, that the Indian government move swiftly to adhere to the award that has been given,"" Thomson said in the video posted on Twitter by Cairn. 
""It is important for our shareholders who are global financial institutions and who want to see a positive investment climate in India. I am sure that in working together with the government we can swiftly draw this to conclusion and reassure those investors,"" he said.
India's finance and external affairs ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Cairn aims to enforce the award under international arbitration rules, commonly called the New York Convention, and recover losses caused by India's ""unfair and inequitable treatment of their investments"", the court filing showed.
The company has registered its claim against India in the Netherlands and France, telling regulators in the two countries that they may receive court orders to seize of some Indian assets, and the firm was preparing to do the same in Canada and United States, Reuters reported last month.
India lost another major international arbitration case last year against Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) over a $2 billion retrospective tax dispute.

The government has challenged the arbitration verdict in the Vodafone case. It has yet to say how it will proceed in Cairn's case where it has to make a significant payment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to join a march propelling global shares to record highs on Tuesday, with investors dumping government bonds in a bet that COVID-19 vaccinations and U.S. stimulus will deliver a durable economic recovery after a year of lockdowns.
Bitcoin added to the bullish mood, climbing above $50,000 for the first time.
The MSCI's global stock index was up 0.18% at 686.30 points after hitting a record high of 686.41 points earlier in the session. A positive close would mark the 12th consecutive day of gains for the first time since January 2004.
U.S. stock futures hit record highs as investors piled into banks, energy companies other sectors that would benefit from an economic recovery. S&P500 futures were up 0.5%.
Expectations of a strong economic recovery and looser fiscal and monetary policy in the United States pushed yields on safe haven U.S., German and UK government bonds higher, with gold also taking a knock.
The 10-year Treasury yields topped 1.25% for the first time in 11 months.
""I think it's a global reflation trade very much in play, that risk-on positive investor sentiment is still very much with us,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at MUFG.
U.S. President Joe Biden is pushing ahead with his plan to pump an extra $1.9 trillion in stimulus into the economy.
""I think this most recent leg up is a reflection of the fiscal stimulus package in the U.S. is going to be larger, a supportive backdrop,"" Halpenny said.
EUROPEAN ECONOMY STIRS
The pan-European STOXX 600 hit its highest since late February 2020, lifted by some good economic data.
The ZEW investor sentiment index in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, rose by far more than expected in February on expectations that people will flock back to shops and other retail outlets in the coming six months.
Euro zone gross domestic product fell less than initially estimated in the last quarter of 2020 and employment edged higher against the previous three months.
Prospects for a recovery lit up commodities, with the European mining index hitting its highest level since July 2011.
""The big picture is that there is an awful lot of enthusiasm for recovery when it comes to the vaccine programme,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
Recovery hopes in Britain sent sterling to 2-1/2 year highs, just short of $1.40 against the dollar.
The euro crept 0.3% higher to $1.21590.
The U.S. dollar index, at 90.242, was mired at a three-week low as growing optimism about recovery sent investors into riskier currencies, including the euro and British pound.
Market sentiment in Europe was helped by gains overnight in Asian shares, with Japan's Nikkei blue chip index up 1.28% at a 30-year high.
Ord Minnett adviser John Milroy said that while share markets were positive, investors were becoming wary of the future risk of inflation due to central bank and government stimulus programmes in place around the world.
""There is a clear sense with rates staying low for some time yet and investor appetite for equities staying strong we will likely see markets hold up for some time yet,"" Milroy told Reuters.
Investors are looking to the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, due to be published on Wednesday, for confirmation of its commitment to maintain its dovish policy stance over the near future. That in turn is set to keep a lid on bond yields. 
Oil prices jumped to a 13-month high as a deep freeze due to a severe snow storm in the United States not only boosted power demand but also threatened oil production in Texas. 

Brent crude was trading at $63 a barrel, off 0.47%, after rising to its highest since January 2020 in the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.3%, to $59.65 a barrel.

MILAN (Reuters) - The deepest crisis in aviation history might seem the worst time to relaunch an airline. But for Alitalia the turmoil could provide just the opportunity to drive through reforms that politicians and unions have refused to accept in the past.

""Alitalia has tried in the past to cut domestic point-to-point routes, but local politicians or the government always demanded they be restored,"" said a company source close to CEO Fabio Lazzerini, named in November to lead the revival. 
The pandemic offers ""the first real big opportunity"" to make Alitalia competitive, the source said – thanks also to cheap plane deals and rival airlines' rising debt piles.
But there's still a mountain to climb, with travel likely to remain subdued for some time to come, low-cost airlines vowing to come out of the downturn fighting, and a new Italian prime minister bringing fresh uncertainty to the political backdrop. 
Alitalia was placed in administration in 2017, after three reorganisation attempts in the nine years since privatisation. Last March, as the pandemic foiled a planned sale to investors, the government announced its renationalisation. 
Founded in World War Two's aftermath, Alitalia was long relied upon to connect Italian cities and resorts, a role now steadily usurped by low-cost carriers. In 2019, Ryanair's Italian traffic was almost twice Alitalia's 21.77 million passengers, with easyJet (LON:EZJ) a close third. 
The new business plan includes the ""elimination of all hub bypass routes"" lacking international connections – between Sicily and Turin, for instance – according to the recent submission to senators, first reported in the Italian press. 
Despite many past bailouts, it adds: ""radical restructuring (to) reposition only in profitable markets has never been implemented."" 
The question now is whether Alitalia can forge a viable future as a leaner network carrier focused on international markets that are likely to be crowded when a recovery comes.
LONG-HAUL BET 
The plan targets an operating breakeven in 2023 and a 7% operating (EBIT) margin two years later on revenue of 3.4 billion euros ($4.1 billion), with a fleet growing steadily back to 110 aircraft, close to pre-crisis size. In 2014-18, Alitalia's operating losses averaged 475 million euros annually. 
A workforce of 9,500 – compared with 11,000 in 2019 – will be hired on new contracts rather than carried over, according to the presentation, and the state's return on investment ""might be (about) 10%"" when the plan ends in 2025. 
Industry experts voiced scepticism about a strategy reliant on long-haul and corporate travel markets that are expected to remain depressed for some time. 
""The first to recover will be short-haul routes,"" said James Halstead, an airlines investment analyst turned industry adviser. ""Business and long-haul flights will take much longer."" 
Alitalia is disadvantaged by geography against rivals based in Dubai, Paris or London, having chosen Rome over Milan as its connecting hub ""for political reasons"", Halstead said. ""Rome is badly placed for intercontinental routes."" 
Budget carriers will also apply more pressure. ""Italy is very high on the agenda,"" Ryanair finance chief Neil Sorahan told Reuters this month, after the carrier announced new Italian bases and capacity plans.
MILAN SWEETENER 
Lazzerini aims to boost traffic through a new deal with current partner Air France-KLM, Lufthansa or another European player – by leveraging the ""negotiating power"" of coveted Milan-Linate airport slots, his plan says. 
Air France-KLM and Lufthansa had no immediate comment, but a source close to one of the groups said they would be vying with each other for an Alitalia deal that includes Milan access. 
The relaunch also needs swift Italian decisions on existing Alitalia jobs that successive governments have dodged, instead committing another 5 billion euros to the airline since 2017, by the reckoning of Andrea Giuricin, a transport economist at Milan's Bicocca University. 
""It no longer makes sense to have a flagship airline, since the market is European,"" Giuricin said. 
Union tensions have flared over Lazzerini's resistance to retaining the old workforce, while delays in transferring planes and other assets threaten to derail his plan. The holdups could mean launching with fewer jobs and a smaller fleet than the 52 earmarked jets, the management source cautioned. 
European Union officials have also questioned key aspects of the plan including continuation of in-house maintenance and handling in Rome and use of the Alitalia brand, according to correspondence reported by Italian newspapers and seen by Reuters. 
It remains unclear how these challenges will play out under Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank chief appointed last week as Italy's prime minister. His predecessor Giuseppe Conte had backed state intervention and renationalisation to avoid mass layoffs. 
Whatever happens, a relaunched Alitalia will face ever tougher competition in long- and short-haul services, aviation consultant John Strickland said. ""Entry costs may be at a long-time low, but that alone is no guarantee of successful execution.""

709,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>","Ex-Goldman Sachs analyst, brother charged in UK with insider trading","By Huw Jones and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog said it has started fraud and insider dealing proceedings against two brothers, one who worked as a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst, the other as a lawyer at Clifford Chance.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the proceedings against Mohammed Zina, 32, and his brother Suhail Zina, 33, relate to six offences of insider dealing and three offences of fraud by false representation, making an alleged profit of 142,000 pounds ($197,834).
""Mohammed Zina was employed by Goldman Sachs International as an analyst in the Conflicts Resolution Group in their London office. Suhail Zina was a solicitor at Clifford Chance, also in London,"" the FCA said in a statement on Tuesday.
Goldman Sachs said the protection of confidential client information is of paramount importance for the bank, and it has worked very closely with the FCA.
""Neither the firm nor any other current or former employee of the firm is the subject of an investigation into the matters giving rise to the proceedings,"" Goldman Sachs said.
The bank's conflicts resolution group checks if the lender has any actual or perceived conflicts of interest in its advisory, financing, lending and other activities. 
Clifford Chance, a member of the elite group of ""magic circle"" law firms, said Suhail Zina left in 2018, declining further comment.
The FCA said the alleged offences took place between July 2016 and December 2017, and involved trading in ARM Holdings (LON:ARM), Alternative Networks, Punch Taverns, Shawbrook, HSN, and Snyder's Lance, companies that were involved in merger and acquisition deals during that period.
The fraud charges relate to three personal loans obtained from Tesco (OTC:TSCDD) Bank, totalling 95,000 pounds.
""The loans were stated to be for funding home improvements. Instead, the loans funded the alleged insider dealing,"" the FCA said.
Mohammed and Suhail Zina appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday and the case was sent to Southwark Crown Court for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 16 March, the watchdog said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen pushing higher Tuesday, continuing recent gains amid growing confidence the country’s ramped-up vaccination program will lead to a prompt economic recovery.
At 7:25 AM ET (1225 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 200 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 21 points, or 0.5%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 68 points, or 0.65%. 
The U.S. stock market was closed on Monday for Presidents Day, but February is still on track to be the strongest month for the major Wall Street indices since November. 
Stock markets have benefited from the expectation of additional stimulus from the new administration, with a $1.9 trillion package working its way through Congress, as well as its focus upon delivering vaccinations to the American public as quickly as possible.
The U.S. inoculation campaign has gained considerable momentum since a sluggish start in December, with 52.9 million total vaccines administered so far, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday.
America has far exceeded the countries of continental Europe in terms of the percentage of the populations vaccinated, but optimism is growing even across the pond. 
Investor morale in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, rose sharply in February on expectations consumption will take off in the coming months, the ZEW economic research institute said earlier Tuesday.
The U.S. economic data slate is largely empty Tuesday, with just February’s NY Empire State Manufacturing index due, but Wednesday will see a large data dump, including January retail sales, PPI, industrial and manufacturing production numbers. 
The key release, however, is likely to be the minutes from the last meeting of the Federal Reserve, with investors keen for clues as to when the central bank will consider starting pulling back its accommodative policy stance.
In corporate news, the earnings season has been generally positive, but is coming to a close. That said, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), AIG (NYSE:AIG) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) are among the names reporting Tuesday.
Oil prices pushed higher in the U.S. Tuesday, as the severe cold spell in large parts of America resulted in heavy demand for power as well as disrupting supplies in Texas, the biggest crude producing state.
The deep freeze halted Texas oil wells and refineries on Monday and forced restrictions on natural gas and crude pipeline operators, resulting in blackouts throughout the state.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $59.75 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.3% to $63.09, both contracts having traded earlier not far removed from their highest levels since January last year.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,816.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2167.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ryanair's fight against state aid for airlines will put loosened EU rules to the test on Wednesday when the bloc's second-highest court decides on support offered to Air France and SAS.
Under European Commission state aid rules loosened since the start of the pandemic, EU countries have offered more than 3 trillion euros ($3.65 trillion) in aid to companies in various sectors across the 27-member bloc.
In its first judgments on those rules, the Luxembourg-based General Court will assess a French scheme allowing airlines to defer certain aeronautical taxes. It will also rule on Sweden's loan guarantee scheme for airlines. 
Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget carrier, has filed 16 lawsuits against the Commission, both against state aid to individual airlines such as Lufthansa, KLM, Austrian Airlines and TAP, as well as against national schemes that mainly benefit airlines.
Ryanair in its filings to the court faulted EU competition enforcers by allowing EU countries to grant aid only to airlines with EU operating licences issued by their countries.
EU flag carriers generally need only one operating licence from their home country to operate across the bloc.
Ryanair said the Commission also erred in assessing the proportionality of the aid to the damage caused by the pandemic.
Furthermore, the EU executive did not open a formal investigation into the schemes, thereby violating Ryanair's procedural rights and also failed in its duty to provide reasons for approving the schemes, it said.
The cases are T-238/20 Ryanair v Commission and T-259/20 Ryanair v Commission.

LONDON (Reuters) - Cash levels in investment portfolios have hit the lowest since just before the so-called taper tantrum of 2013, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s February fund manager survey, which also showed investors to be overwhelmingly bullish on the economic outlook.
World stocks have been notching successive record highs in 2021, with central banks remaining supportive and governments injecting money into the system to get economies up to speed after the damage caused by COVID-19.
""The only reason to be bearish is ... there is no reason to be bearish,"" Michael Hartnett, BofA's chief investment strategist, told clients, who have the highest equity and commodity allocations in a decade.
A net 91% of them expect a stronger economy, the best ever reading in BofA's survey published on Tuesday, which covered 225 fund managers with $645 billion in assets under management.
Investors showed they had the capacity to increase risk, taking their cash levels down to 3.8%, the lowest since March 2013, just before the U.S. Federal Reserve sparked a market tantrum by signalling its intent to wind down, or taper, the bond-buying programme it launched during the 2008 crisis.
However, investors hear echoes of the 2013 situation, and see another taper tantrum as the second biggest ""tail risk"" after delays in the rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
Despite these issues simmering in the background, and the huge gains across markets, BofA's survey, conducted between Feb. 5 and 11, found only 13% of its participants concerned about a U.S. equity market bubble. About 53% said U.S. equity markets were in a late-stage bull market while 27% saw it in the early stages.
Notably, a net 25% of the investors surveyed said they were taking ""higher-than-normal"" risks -- the highest percentage ever. ""Long tech"" was the ""most crowded trade"", followed by ""long bitcoin"" and ""short U.S. dollar"".
Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", the CBOE Volatility Index, dipped below 20 on Friday for the first time in almost a year.
""As volatility breaks down, this provides just one more of the many reasons for stocks to rally,"" said Saxo Bank market strategist Eleanor Creagh. ""With the USD and volatility on the decline, asset managers will gross up positioning.""
The buying spree prompted the MSCI all-country world stocks index to register its 12th consecutive day of gains, its longest rising streak in 17 years.
In contrast, a survey by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) showed investors agreeing that there were many bubbles in financial markets, with bitcoin and U.S. tech stocks topping the bubble talk.
The survey did, however, suggest ""taper tantrum"" fears were receding. Some 26% foresaw such an event this year, down from a third in January.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 06:42AM ET</span>",UK watchdog voices concern over $9.2 billion eBay-Adevinta deal,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog on Tuesday raised concerns over Adevinta's planned acquisition of U.S. e-commerce group eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s classified ads business, sending the Norwegian company's shares down 4.3%.
The $9.2 billion deal announced in July would create the world's largest classifieds group, but Adevinta and eBay must first resolve the Competition and Markets Authority's concerns (CMA) to proceed with the takeover.
""The CMA is concerned the merger could lead to a loss of competition between Shpock, Gumtree and eBay's marketplace, with only Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Marketplace remaining as a significant competitor,"" the CMA said in a statement.
""This could reduce consumer choice, increase fees or lower innovation in the supply of platforms that allow people to buy and sell goods online.""
U.S. group eBay owns UK online auction sites Gumtree and ebay.co.uk while Adevinta owns Shpock.
With the sale of its classifieds business, eBay will acquire a 33.3% voting stake in Adevinta and positions on the Adevinta board, the CMA also noted. 
Britain accounted for less than 10% of the consolidated revenue of eBay's classifieds business and 1% of Adevinta's consolidated revenue, Adevinta said.
In the latest CMA merger investigation involving large digital companies, the watchdog said it is ""thoroughly examining deals to ensure that competition is not restricted and consumers' interests are protected"".
The CMA this month said Viagogo must sell StubHub's international business after its $4.05 billion purchase of eBay's ticket-reselling business.
Adevinta and eBay will together propose legally binding solutions to resolve the regulator's concerns before the deadline of Feb. 23, Adevinta said. 
The CMA would then have five working days to consider whether to accept the companies' proposals or to refer the deal for an in-depth investigation. 
Adevinta shares were down 4.3% at 1121 GMT, lagging a flat Oslo benchmark index. 

The company said it would provide a further update in early March after the CMA's decision.

715,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>","StockBeat: BHP, Glencore Payouts Bolster Commodity Supercycle Talk","By Geoffrey Smith  
Investing.com --Anyone looking at BHP Group (NYSE:BHP)'s results this morning could be forgiven for thinking that the new commodities supercycle is upon us.
The Australian-based, London-listed miner is churning out cash like never before, announcing a $5.1 billion special dividend after the first half of its fiscal year, a period in which prices for iron ore have soared to their highest in over eight years on the back of seemingly limitless demand from China.
That’s actually more than the company’s net profit for the period, which was hit by $2.2 billion of asset writedowns, and reflects BHP’s commitment to pay out on the basis of underlying profit, rather than reported net income.
And there seems to be plenty more yet where that came from. In a statement accompanying the results, CEO Mike Henry nodded to “policymakers in key economies signalling a durable commitment to growth and signalling ambitions to tackle climate change.”
“These factors, combined with population growth and rising living standards, are expected to drive continuing growth in demand for energy, metals and fertilisers,” Henry said.
Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) also weighed in, restoring its dividend after saying its underlying profit for last year was in the region of $2.5 billion. By contrast with BHP, its asset impairments generated a net loss of around $1.9 billion. However, the dividend reinstatement is a reasonably clear sign of confidence about the near-term outlook.
Certainly, plenty of factors that could generate a new supercycle – a generalized boom resulting from a solid and synchronized economic upswing across the world – seem to be in place: firstly, U.S. fiscal and monetary policy are extraordinarily expansive, cheapening the dollar. That alone tends to act as rocket fuel for most commodity prices.
Second, the $1.9 trillion stimulus plan currently in the works in the U.S. may – although this is not certain – support a boom in infrastructure investment in the world’s largest economy that would broaden the geographic sources of demand for commodities.
Thirdly, there has been no truly significant expansion of capacity in many of the world’s metals markets since the last boom and bust cycle, and iron ore in particular has had its fair share of bottlenecks caused by incidents like the dam disasters in Brazil. South America’s copper mines, too, struggled to sustain output last year as Covid-19 swept through their workforces. In oil, massive cuts to upstream investment last year have prepared the conditions for a sharp tightening in the near-term supply-demand balance.
Fourthly, the transformation to a greener economy has caused a structural upward shift in demand for copper, nickel and silver, which are all needed in bigger quantities for electric cars, photovoltaic panels and the like.
This factor seems to be a more powerful one even than the weak dollar: Saxo Bank research points out that the spread between gold and platinum has moved sharply in the latter’s favor recently, something that seems largely due to its industrial applications. Platinum futures have surged some 30% since late January, easily outperforming gold, and hit their highest since 2014 on Monday.
But this fourth argument is a double-edged sword. The advance of green technology is the main reason why BHP and Glencore have been disposing or writing down the value of their oil and coal assets.  As Capital Economics’ Caroline Bain argues, it certainly suggests that not all commodities will enjoy the same degree of uplift. Not only oil, but agricultural products used for biofuels face long-term headwinds as electric vehicles take market share from internal combustion ones.
In a note to clients, Bain argues that for now, the recovery looks much like the one that followed the 2008 crisis, in its reliance on Chinese stimulus spending.
“We expect that this is likely to run out of steam later this year, as stimulus is withdrawn, and that prices will fall back,” Bain said in a note to clients, pointing out that by 2015, most commodity prices were back at their 2009 lows."

PARIS (Reuters) - Former UniCredit boss Jean-Pierre Mustier is teaming up with France's richest man Bernard Arnault to launch a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) aimed at European financial deals, as a boom in blank cheque vehicles spreads from the United States. 
French investment firm Tikehau Capital SCA is sponsoring the SPAC alongside Mustier, Financiere Agache, a group belonging to Arnault, as well as banker Diego De Giorgi, formerly of UniCredit and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
The four of them will be equal partners in the venture, sources familiar with the situation said. The SPAC will be listed in Amsterdam, and is the first of several being planned by this group. 
""We see SPACs as a natural extension of our toolbox now. We plan for repeated issuance and not just a one-off opportunistic one,"" said one of the sources. 
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with a privately held company, that then becomes publicly traded as a result.
SPACs have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies, especially in the United States, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds raised.
Overall, 144 SPACs have raised $45.7 billion so far this year, based on data from SPAC Research, with backers including high-profile investors, politicians and sports personalities.
The huge roster of deals there has meant that there have been concerns over a saturation of that market, which helped fuel the decision to list in Europe instead. 
""We looked at the U.S. market and decided to do it in Amsterdam instead. We thought our proposal was differentiated by taking it to Europe, particularly when we are looking to target European companies,"" said the source. 
""But we have looked to replicate a U.S. structure so global investors understand it, and Amsterdam seemed best suited for that. You may have also seen that Amsterdam has taken over London in terms of (stock market) flows,"" he added. 
Bankers agreed that Amsterdam is emerging as the destination of choice in Europe, as regulations there are closest to the United States, where protections for SPAC investors are better than in many jurisdictions. 
For example, Dutch regulations allow investors to redeem their investment if the target eventually identified is not to their liking.
In the financial services arena, other big name sponsors are also emerging. Former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) CEO Tidjane Thiam is also launching a SPAC that will list in New York and focus on financial services, while Martin Blessing, a former chief executive officer of Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY), is planning one listed in the Netherlands.
The Tikehau SPAC will target areas such as financial technology or fintech, fund management, insurance and other diversified financial services. 
This follows the first one launched in France in December by Xavier Niel, former Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) banker Matthieu Pigasse and entrepreneur Moez-Alexandre Zouari, aimed at deals in the health and food industries. 
Mustier, who also had a spell running French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s investment banking arm, left UniCredit this month. 
In nearly five years at the helm, Mustier rebuilt UniCredit's capital reserves and cleaned up its balance sheet, but failed to find sustained profit drivers or lift the bank's depressed stock price.

Arnault is best known as the founder of luxury goods group and Louis Vuitton owner LVMH. His personal holding company, Financiere Agache, is a long-standing investor in Tikehau, the investment firm said.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher in early trade on Tuesday, as strong results from mining groups reinforced talk of a new 'supercycle' in commodities amid hopes for a broad and synchronized global recovery.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.4%.
BHP Group PLC (LON:BHPB) stock fell 0.3% after the world’s largest listed miner had to write down the value of its coal business which is up for sale or spin off. That said, the mining giant did report its best first-half profit in seven years and declared a record interim dividend, helped by strong demand for iron ore from China.
 Glencore  (LON:GLEN) stock also rose 2.4% after the commodity trading and mining company reported a return to profit in the second half of 2020 and said its dividend would resume this year.
Successful rollouts of Covid-19 vaccines in many countries, with the U.K. leading the way among the developed world, have raised hopes of a relatively quick economic recovery as restrictions on business and social life are lifted.
Adding to this, the World Health Organization authorized the AstraZeneca/University of Oxford Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Monday, expanding access to this comparatively inexpensive shot to less developed countries around the world.
At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package continues to work its way through Congress.
However, despite this optimism, the immediate economic picture in Europe remains challenging. 
Passenger-car sales fell 28% across Germany, the U.K., France, Italy and Spain, Europe’s five biggest markets, in January as lockdowns shut down dealerships and customers shied away from large purchases. 
The region’s fourth-quarter GDP release is due later in the session, but most eyes will be on the German ZEW Economic Sentiment index for February as a more current gauge of consumer confidence.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, as the severe cold spell in the U.S. resulted in heavy demand for power as well as disrupting supplies in Texas, the biggest crude producing state.
The deep freeze halted Texas oil wells and refineries on Monday and forced restrictions on natural gas and crude pipeline operators, resulting in blackouts throughout the state.

The first and most famous cryptocurrency, bitcoin hit $49,938 and has gained roughly 70% this year, most of that after electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said it bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin and would accept the currency as payment.
Tesla's move was the latest in a string of large investments that have vaulted bitcoin from the fringes of finance to company balance sheets and Wall Street dealing desks, as U.S. firms and traditional money managers have started to buy a lot of it. 
The soaring cryptocurrency, which was near worthless a decade ago when software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas, surpassed $20,000 only in mid-December, but has so far struggled to crack $50,000 after a few attempts.
""Bitcoin has been range bound for the past four or five days, suggesting either stalling momentum or a consolidation period,"" said Justin d'Anethan, sales manager at digital asset company Diginex in Hong Kong.
""We believe in the latter,"" he said, since strong recent demand has been drawing down bitcoin's finite supply.
Bitcoin last traded just short of its new record at $49,045 while rival cryptocurrency ethereum also held near its own record top of $1,879 made last week. 
Besides Tesla, bitcoin has drawn unprecedented flows from big and small investors in recent months and posted new milestones on the path to greater takeup as a mode of exchange.
The cryptocurrency was created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity is unknown and is based on blockchain technology which acts like public ledger of transactions. It began circulating in 2009, mostly among speculators - something which is beginning to change.
Business software firm MicroStrategy made the first of several multimillion-dollar bitcoin purchases in August and a number of Wall Street fund managers, such as billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, now sound positive on the asset.
PayPal is allowing customers to use bitcoin at its merchants and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) preparing to do likewise, moves which bring both opportunity and risk. 

""The more mainstream the digital currency becomes, the more we should expect regulators to pay attention,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to set the path out of a third lockdown which has closed all non-essential shops on Feb. 22.
""The short term need is for us to have some clarity. We need to have confidence that when we re-open again we will stay open,"" Rose, the current chairman of Ocado (LON:OCDO) and a former boss of Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY), told BBC radio.
""Businesses are not designed to stop and start, you just cannot do that.""
Rose also called on finance minister Rishi Sunak to resist tax rises in his March 3 budget statement.
""The second thing the government needs to do is make sure we don't do anything stupid,"" he said.
""Let's not change tax rates, let's not do anything with VAT, let's make sure that we actually give people the confidence of knowing that nothing will change in the short term.""

Rose said the government should also maintain its furlough support scheme for workers and extend a business rates holiday for retail.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2% by 0802 GMT, after jumping 1.3% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020. The index is about 14% below its all-time high.
Glencore jumped 3.3% after reinstating its dividend, while BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) rose 0.3% as the world's largest listed miner posted its best first-half profit in seven years and declared a record interim dividend.
The European mining index jumped 1.5% to its highest level since July 2011.

Investor focus will shift to a flash reading of the euro zone's fourth-quarter GDP estimate later in the day, with Reuters economists expecting the economy to have contracted 5.1% year-on-year.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",Future Group creditors scramble to recover $2.5 billion loans amid Reliance deal woes: bankers,"By Nupur Anand
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Future Group's creditors are exploring options to recover more than $2.5 billion in loans, amid worries the Indian retailer's planned sale of assets to Reliance Industries could fail, four bankers with knowledge of the matter said.
Future may face liquidation if the deal, already mired in legal wrangling, falls through and banks are actively discussing an alternate one-time restructuring option that could include an easier repayment tenure and fresh capital infusion, the people said on condition of anonymity as the talks are private.
""Without Reliance, there is no future for Future,"" one of the bankers at a major state-owned lender said.
Bankers have discussed a restructuring plan in the past week and are drawing up a blueprint, the sources said.
Future's top financial creditors include India's largest lender State Bank of India, along with smaller rivals Bank of Baroda and Bank of India. 
The three banks, Future Group and Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Future, India's No.2 retailer with more than 1,700 stores, has been hit hard by the pandemic and agreed to sell most of its retail assets to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance in a $3.4 billion deal.
The transaction, however, has faced legal hurdles with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) alleging that Future, by agreeing to sell assets to Reliance, was violating terms of a deal the U.S. firm had struck with a Future Group entity. 
Future denies any wrongdoing.
The deal was temporarily blocked by a New Delhi court but subsequently the order was struck down. Amazon has now taken the matter to India's Supreme Court.
The Future-Reliance deal will help creditors recover up to 80% of their dues, the four bankers estimate. 
The troubled retailer's over $2.5 billion debt includes loans from banks and money owed to operational creditors. 
'BLEAK SCENARIO'
Future, which last year availed a loan moratorium amid the pandemic, has since defaulted on repayments, the sources said.
The defaults, coupled with the legal battle, are now forcing banks to seriously explore a one-time restructuring plan under an inter-creditor agreement signed last year, they added.
""Even though the restructuring plan was discussed in the 3-4 meetings we had, we hadn't given it much thought because it was always plan B. Now with the Reliance deal stuck, we need to take it seriously,"" a second banker said.
Although the restructuring plan is still being firmed up, it may include providing easier repayment options to Future, including a moratorium for a few quarters, the bankers said.
Banks may also look at conversion of debt to equity, two of the bankers said.
The plan being discussed, however, would need Future to bring a ""sizeable"" amount of capital to the table and need lenders to pump in fresh funds, the two bankers added. 

""One's looking at a very bleak scenario because there's no cash flow happening at Future,"" the first banker said, adding lenders are wary about putting in more money into the retailer.

Biyani is also embroiled in a legal battle with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) over the sale of Future's retail assets to Reliance Industries.
""Future Group promoters have been asked to deposit a sum of 110 million rupees as an interim measure,"" Future Corporate Resources said in a statement, adding that the tribunal had stayed the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) order.
SEBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The regulator had said Biyani and his brother Anil had traded in shares of their Future Retail firm through a group company on the basis of unpublished price-sensitive information.
SEBI said its investigation showed the two opened a trading account for a company called Future Corporate Resources Pvt Ltd, which traded in shares of Future Retail before a demerger of some businesses of the latter boosted its share price.
Challenging the order on Monday before the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Future said the information was already in the public domain and that while the shares were bought in March 2017, the actual terms of the restructuring began in April.
The case will next be heard on April 12, Future Corporate Resources said. 

Amazon has appealed in India's Supreme Court to block the Future-Reliance deal, saying it violates some pre-existing contracts with Future.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Tuesday, extending the recent rally on expectations of improved economic growth, thanks to continuous fiscal and monetary support as well as global Covid-19 vaccine rollouts.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1%, and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
European markets are set to receive a positive handover from Asia, as world equities extend their bull run for a 12th consecutive session. 
Successful rollouts of Covid-19 vaccines in many countries, with the U.K. leading the way among the developed world, have raised hopes of a relatively quick economic recovery as restrictions on business and social life are lifted.
Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package continues to work its way through Congress, in a further boost to market sentiment.
However, despite this optimism, the immediate economic picture in Europe remains challenging. 
Passenger-car sales fell 28% across Germany, the U.K., France, Italy and Spain, Europe’s five biggest markets, in January as lockdowns shut down dealerships and customers shied away from large purchases. 
The region’s fourth-quarter GDP release is due later in the session, but most eyes will be on the German ZEW Economic Sentiment index for February as a more current gauge of consumer confidence.
In corporate news, BHP Group (LON:BHPB) will be in focus after the world’s largest listed miner reported its best first-half profit in seven years and declared a record interim dividend, helped by strong demand for iron ore from China.
Dutch conglomerate DSM (AS:DSMN) will also be in the spotlight after its fourth quarter net profit was more than halved after booking higher one-off costs.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, as the severe cold spell in the U.S. resulted in heavy demand for power as well as disrupting supplies in Texas, the biggest crude producing state.
The deep freeze halted Texas oil wells and refineries on Monday and forced restrictions on natural gas and crude pipeline operators, resulting in blackouts throughout the state.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $60.20 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $63.53, both contracts not far removed from their highest levels since January last year.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,822.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2140.

TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. buyout firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc is set to win approval for an initial public offering (IPO) of Japan's WingArc1st Inc as early as Thursday, two people with knowledge of the matter said, its third attempt to list the software firm.
A successful listing of WingArc1st, which develops and sells business software including cloud-based offerings, would be the first time an IPO that had failed twice in Tokyo was eventually completed.
The Tokyo-based company is likely to list by mid-March with a market capitalisation of around 50 billion yen ($475 million), the people said, declining to be identified as the information is not yet public.
It was not clear how much of WingArc1st Carlyle aims to sell, nor the amount Carlyle aims to raise.
Carlyle and the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined to comment on the matter. A WingArc1st spokesman said the software developer is considering listing and declined to comment further. 
Carlyle bought WingArc1st from Japan's  Orix  (NYSE:IX) Corp for an undisclosed sum in 2016. It shelved IPO plans in 2019 because of market conditions and again last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Carlyle owned 47.3% of WingArc1st as of February 2020. It has since sold stakes to trading house Itochu Corp and other investors, data compiled by Refinitiv showed.
Carlyle now looks likely to take advantage of the Japanese stock market's surge to its highest in 30 years. A successful IPO would be Carlyle's eighth in Japan. 
The Tokyo Stock Exchange said that while 18 Japanese companies including WingArc1st postponed their IPOs last year because of the coronavirus, 11 of them have successfully listed by the end of January.
Kioxia Holdings Corp, the world's second-largest maker of flash memory chips, in September also shelved its IPO plan as U.S.-China tensions impacted the global chip market.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp shares closed at a record high on Tuesday, surpassing a peak reached at the height of the dot-com bubble, as online backers celebrated the recovery in the value of the firm's tech portfolio.
Shares in SoftBank, a heavily weighted component of the Nikkei 225 index which is trading at 30-year highs, closed up 4% at 10,420 yen, above the record 10,111 yen reached in February 2000.
Underpinned by buybacks and with retail investors buying its shares and baseball-themed junk bonds, SoftBank's shares have been supported by a growing number of portfolio companies listing in ebullient markets. 
The Japanese conglomerate's comeback, during which its shares have climbed almost 300% from lows hit last March as the COVID-19 pandemic roiled its portfolio, have led to celebration among its online backers. 
""Roses are red, violets are blue, SoftBank haters, don't know what to do,"" wrote one prominent supporter on Twitter recently posting under the name ""Masa Capital"". 
""SoftBank will reach 11,000 yen by April,"" wrote another on Tuesday. The group's shares hit an intraday high of 11,000 yen in February 2000 before crashing. 
Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's own social media posts are centred on aphorisms, favouring quarterly presentations over Twitter to transmit his message, in contrast to the memes that have made Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk a retail investor favourite. 
SoftBank's climbing share price has pushed its market cap above $200 billion, in marked contrast to a year earlier when it slipped behind Sony Corp (T:6758) to third place in the index. 

In the latest effort by a SoftBank-backed firm to tap markets seeing record equity raising, South Korean e-commerce firm Coupang last week filed to list in the United States and is aiming for a $50 billion valuation, a source said.

The committee is examining how an apparent flood of retail trading drove certain stocks to extreme highs, squeezing hedge funds like Melvin that had bet against those shares.
Here are some of the stocks involved in the initial frenzy and how they have fared since, as of Friday's close: 
** Shares of GameStop - which had been heavily touted on Reddit’s WallStreetBets - rose by as much as 2,460% on the year to a high of $482.25 in January, as some institutions that had bet on declines in the stock were forced to unwind their positions amid a flood of buying. The stock pared most of that rally earlier this month but remains 178% higher on the year. 
** AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings' stock surged after the company said bankruptcy talks were ""completely off the table."" At the rally's apex, its shares touched $20.36, an 860% jump from Dec. 31. Friday's closing price put the stock up 164% in 2021.
** Shares of Canada’s Blackberry (TSX:BB) rallied as much as 334% but had pared that to a 97% year-to-date advance as of Friday. The company announced late last month that it was expanding its partnership with China-based search platform Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)
** At one point, home furnishings retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY)'s had jumped by 204% year-to-date, but its advance has since cooled to 59%. 
** Pharmaceutical firm CEL-SCI Corp shares hit a zenith of $40.77, a 247% advance on the year, a gain that has since shrunk to 100%.
** Finland-based Nokia (NYSE:NOK) joined the short squeeze stampede, at one point touching a 150% year-to-date gain at $9.79 per share. That advance was recently a more modest 7%.
** Consumer electronics company Koss Corp was also caught in the mania, soaring by 3,605% at one point. The stock is now up 330% so far in 2021.

** Shares of cannabis companies - which have already notched big rallies on hopes of decriminalization under U.S. President Joe Biden - have been among the latest to experience wild fluctuations. Weekly volumes in cannabis stock options soared to an all-time high by Thursday, according to CBOE Global Markets, and U.S.-listed shares of Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Inc and Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc, along with Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL), were at one point up on the year by 711%, 367% and 736%, respectively.

Redefine Meat has developed technology to produce plant-based meat substitutes on 3D printers. The investment will let it set up a large-scale pilot line before rolling out industrial 3D meat substitute printers to distributors later this year, it said in a statement.
Plant-based meat alternatives are growing fast as consumers look to reduce their meat intake to help their health, animal welfare and the environment.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Nestle have launched plant-based burgers and sausages relying on other technologies, while 3D meat printing companies like Redefine Meat or Spain's Novameat try to tackle the biggest challenge yet: creating a beef steak made from plants. 
CPT Capital, an early supporter of Redefine Meat, and new investors including Losa Group, Sake Bosch, and K3 Ventures also joined the A-series funding round, Redefine Meat said.
Co-founder and Chief Executive Eshchar Ben-Shitrit said this was a ""major step"" for the company that intends to partner with meat distributors around the world to get products to customers.

It teamed up with Israeli meat distributor Best Meister last month for distribution to restaurants and butchers in Israel. It plans to enter Europe, starting with Germany and Switzerland, in the coming months, followed by Asia and North America later this year.

733,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 15, 2021 11:36PM ET</span>","BHP Lifts Outlook, Pays Record Dividend During Supercycle Talk","(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) boosted its outlook for the global economy as the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines gathers pace, backing its optimism by rewarding investors with a record $5.1 billion first-half dividend payout and fueling expectations for a new commodities supercycle.
“The deployment of vaccines in key economies, albeit with some uncertainty as to timing and efficacy, removes a material amount of downside risk to the short term demand and price outlook for our portfolio commodities,” the company said Tuesday when reporting a 16% lift in first-half profit.
The biggest miner’s comments come as talk of a burgeoning commodities’ boom gathers pace with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) saying a new supercycle may have begun. On the broader stage, global equities are on course to rise for 11 straight sessions -- the longest stretch since 2009 -- as investors take comfort in progress on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.
“With Chinese demand looking robust and the rest of the world (ROW) on an improving trajectory, a precondition for maintaining robust price performance is in place. Where the price recovery is more nascent, there is potential for a further uplift,” BHP said.
Read: Commodity Supercycle Talk Is About to Be Put to the Test
Iron ore futures surged 70% last year, boosted by China’s stimulus-driven recovery and supply disruptions in Brazil. “Our analysis indicates that before prices can correct meaningfully from their current high levels, one or both of the Chinese demand/Brazilian supply factors will need to change materially,” BHP said.
“Buoyant iron ore prices underpin strong upgrade momentum for BHP,” analysts at Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) Ltd said in a report, while noting that the underlying profit result was below the bank’s forecast. The steel-making ingredient accounted for about 70% of earnings in the first half.
Still, BHP said China’s demand for iron ore was likely to be lower in the second half of 2021 as crude steel production plateaus and scrap-to-steel ratios rise. China’s ore stockpiles hit their highest since November heading into the lunar new year holiday, while Beijing has also pledged to rein in steel output this year.
BHP also expects a “constructive” short-term demand outlook for copper, which is seen benefiting from the shift to cleaner energy. The metal climbed to its highest level since 2012 on Monday. There was also potential for supply disruptions in key producer Chile, due to an escalation of Covid cases there.
“The energy transition that the world must effect will also be relatively commodity intensive -- it’s going to mean increased demand for many of the commodities BHP produces,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry said on a media call when asked about the liklihood of a new supercycle. Add to that the lack of exploration success and investment across the minerals and oil and gas sectors in recent years and “it points to a pretty constructive future for commodities,” he said.
BHP shares rose as much as 2.5% in Sydney on Tuesday, while its main rival Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Group added up to 3.8%.

(Reuters) - A judge in Hawaii on Monday ordered Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA to pay more than $834 million to the state for failing to warn non-white patients properly of health risks from its blood thinner Plavix.
Judge Dean Ochiai in Honolulu concluded the companies engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices from 1998 to 2010 by failing to change the drug's label to warn doctors and patients despite knowing some of the risks.
Hawaii Attorney General Clare Connors, whose office sued the companies in 2014, said the ruling ""puts the pharmaceutical industry on notice that it will be held accountable for conduct that deceives the public and places profit above safety.""
Bristol-Myers and Sanofi, which produced Plavix in a partnership, in a joint statement vowed to appeal, saying the decision was ""unsupported by the law and at odds with the evidence at trial."" They called Plavix safe and effective.
Ochiai, who presided over a four-week, non-jury trial conducted entirely over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ordered Bristol-Myers and Sanofi to each pay $417 million in penalties.
Hawaii alleged the companies violated state consumer protection laws by marketing Plavix without disclosing that the drug could have a diminished or no effect for some people, particularly of East Asian and Pacific Island ancestry.
Plavix is prescribed to prevent strokes and heart attacks. The blood thinner needs to be activated by the body's own enzymes, which can vary genetically.
Studies have shown that about 14% of Chinese patients are unable to metabolize the drug properly, compared with 4% of Black and 2% of white patients.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010 issued a new Plavix warning label to reflect that information.

Bristol-Myers and Sanofi still face a similar lawsuit over Plavix by the state of New Mexico.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Tuesday morning, with a rally in global shares continuing Tuesday. Bonds fell further, however, as optimism grows over the COVID-19 vaccines rollout.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.48% by 11:09 PM ET (3:09 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.12%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 were up 0.28%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index Index jumped 1.55%.
Chinese markets are closed for a holiday and U.S. markets were closed for a holiday overnight. The U.K. led gains in European stocks overnight, still glowing after hitting a milestone of inoculating 15 million Britons against COVID-19 on Feb. 14.
Ten-year Treasury yields jumped to 1.24%, their highest level in almost a year, with Australian equivalents following suit.
Global shares are set to record gains for a twelfth consecutive session, with the Treasury yield curve testing its steepest levels in over five years. Investor bets on improved economic growth and benign inflation are increasing, thanks to continuous government spending and global COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.
Some investors struck a note of caution amid all the optimism.
“Yields are a long way off causing damage to growth or the equity market outlook … earnings are growing, and secular themes are driving returns. However, complacency is dangerous,” Axa Investment Managers chief investment officer of core investments Chris Iggo warned in a note.
Other investors also strongly recommended keeping an eye on bond yields.
“If U.S. bond yields keep rising, that could start to unsettle stocks,” Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) DS Asset Management chief strategist Masahiro Ichikawa told Reuters.
On the central bank front, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) released the minutes from its February meeting earlier in the day. The minutes showed that RBA believes that lifting inflation to more comfortable levels will take a significant and sustained tightening in the labor market, a tough task expected to take years to achieve. RBA also acknowledged that wage growth had been too subdued for years before COVID-19 imposed its own restraints on pay.
The U.S. Federal Reserve will also release the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s January meeting on Wednesday. Retail sales figures are also due on the same day.
European Union finance ministers will meet later in the day to discuss the region’s current economic situation and outlook. The region’s GDP and Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW) Economic Sentiment index are due to be released later in the day.
Meanwhile, oil prices soared to a 13-month high, with a severe snowstorm in the U.S. leading to a deep freeze and increased power demand, in turn threatening oil production in the state of Texas."

China's reliance on commodity-intensive stimulus measures to sustain economic growth has sent prices of the steel making ingredient to multi-year highs, while the COVID-19 vaccination push has brightened outlook for global trade this year.
The world's largest listed miner said in a statement it expects a continuation of strong Chinese demand in 2021, and recovery in the rest of the world's global crude steel production. 
""It's a pretty solid result,"" said portfolio manager Andy Forster of Argo Investments. 
""Relative to expectations, it looked pretty good, strong cash flows and dividend, projects operationally performing well,"" he said. ""Strong iron ore and copper should set it up for a pretty good second half as well."" 
BHP is the first of its Australian peers to report this week, with all expected to cash in on sky high prices for iron ore. Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) reports on Wednesday and Fortescue on Thursday. Last month, BHP forecast record annual iron ore output.
The company declared an interim dividend of $1.01 per share, up from last year's payout of $0.65 per share. 
Its underlying profit from continuing operations for the six months ended Dec. 31 rose to $6.04 billion from $5.19 billion last year. It missed a consensus of $6.33 billion, however, from 17 analysts compiled by research firm Vuma Financial.
BHP acknowledged that its coal business, which is under review for sale or spin off, has taken a hit due to a trade spat between Australia and China that the miner does not expect to be resolved any time soon. 
""We're certainly not banking on any near-term resetting of that policy,"" Chief Executive Mike Henry told reporters on a results call.
BHP is expected to make an investment decision soon on its $5.3-$5.7 billion Jansen potash project in Canada and the Scarborough natural gas project off Western Australia, in which BHP will invest $1.4-1.9 billion. 

Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) expects both to be approved, ""but we believe M&A options will be considered as well,"" it said in a report.

The casino operator said the state gambling watchdog gave it a notice in a letter after its Sydney casino breached a clause of the VIP Gaming Management Agreement. 
The watchdog has now begun a consultation process and invited Crown to address the authority, it said.
A report issued last week calling for sweeping changes to Crown's board and culture was the culmination of a year-long inquiry commissioned by the NSW gambling watchdog that found criminal conduct took place at Crown's Melbourne casino. 

Since then, Crown's chief executive and three other directors have resigned, while another broke links with major shareholder James Packer, whose influence on the company was also criticised.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Norway wealth fund tells firms: put more women on your boards,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, wants the companies it invests in globally to boost the number of women on their boards and to consider setting targets if fewer than 30% of their directors are female, top fund officials told Reuters.
One of the world's largest investors, the fund holds stakes in around 9,200 companies worldwide, owning 1.5% of all listed stocks. It has set the pace on a host of issues in the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) field.
Boards where either gender has less than 30% representation should consider setting targets for gender diversity and report on progress, the fund said in a position paper shared with Reuters ahead of its publication later on Monday.
""We may phrase it politely, but it is pretty clear what we think,"" Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen said in an interview. 
""What we want to see is better representation of women on the boards,"" added Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund's chief governance and compliance officer.
""Diversity is good for the board because it brings better perspective, it is better for decision-making and increasingly important for the legitimacy of companies,"" said Smith Ihenacho. 
""It (a lack of female representation) could also be a red flag, that a company does not have a good process to recruit the best director.""
Most other big institutional investors have a general request for boards to be diverse, and some are increasingly prepared to oppose boards they consider are not diverse enough, but they typically have not set precise targets for female representation.
VOTING
In 2003 Norway became the first country in the world to impose a gender quota, requiring nearly 500 firms, including 175 firms listed on the Oslo bourse, to raise the proportion of women on their boards to 40%.
Some other countries have followed along similar lines, such as Britain, which is aiming for 33% representation on FTSE 350 boards. 
Starting with the upcoming AGM season, the Norwegian fund will apply pressure by voting against appointments to the nomination committees of companies that do not have at least two women on the board. 
""We will start with developed markets and at companies where women are underrepresented, at large and mid cap companies in the U.S. and Europe,"" said Smith Ihenacho.
She did not name names, but candidates for attention this year may include British carmaker Aston Martin and used car online auction firm Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) in the United States, which have one woman, respectively, on their boards. 
The fund will refrain from voting against if companies can have a ""very good explanation, like a clear plan, with clear targets, or because of a recent resignation that affected the gender balance on this board"", said Smith Ihenacho.
Last year the fund voted against the nomination committees of 16 companies, all large and mid cap companies in the United States and Europe, because they had all-male boards, she said. One of them was London-listed Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), fund data showed. The firm has since then appointed two women to its board.
Dialogue with companies and voting at AGMs is the focus of the policy, she added, rather than divesting from companies that do not comply with the policy.
Still, the fund can, and does, divest from companies that do not comply with its positions on ESG issues it prioritises: last year, it divested from seven companies over tax transparency.
The fund only has a specific target on gender diversity currently and not on other aspects such as age or ethnicity, for example, because the latter can vary in relevance from sector to sector or from country to country, said Smith Ihenacho.
""But what is relevant for all countries is that women in general are underrepresented and that is why we have a target (on gender),"" said Smith Ihenacho. 
Globally, 17% of company boards do not have a single woman, she said.
""We really think diversity creates better thinking and better creativity and better business, really,"" said Tangen. 

""The more diverse the group of people who sit together, the more creative solutions you get and so the better business. You get better innovations, better solutions. It is just good.""

740,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>","Learjet, the private plane synonymous with the jet-set, nears end of runway","By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Learjet, the sleek private jet used by celebrities for decades, is ending production this year, following a slump in demand due to competition from newer and less-expensive rivals. 
Long before COVID-19 hit demand in 2020, the arrival of less-expensive similar-sized models from  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) and  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT)'s Cessna eroded Learjet demand.
Created by American entrepreneur Bill  Lear  (NYSE:LEA), the Learjet 23 first took off from Wichita, Kansas in 1963, forging a new market for modern business aircraft with owners like Frank Sinatra, while shattering speed records. 
Some 3000 Learjets, which seat up to nine passengers, have since taken to the skies with a bullet-shaped nose, capable of flying close to the speed of sound at Mach 0.81.
Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF), which acquired Learjet in 1990, said last week production would end this year. But it will service the plane, which accounts for about 42% of its in-service fleet of just under 5,000 business aircraft, according to JETNET data.
Learjet's performance, described by some private pilots as the closest they'd ever get to flying a fighter jet, couldn't beat rivals' lower cost.
""Less equipped aircraft at smaller price points drove demand,"" Bombardier spokesman Mark Masluch said.
Embraer's Phenom, for example, listed for about $9 million, compared with a Learjet 75, at around $13 million.
""Customers want a nice Mercedes in that segment, but I don't know if they want a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) anymore,"" said aerospace analyst Rolland Vincent, comparing Learjet to the Italian sports car.
Meanwhile, wealthy buyers increasingly sought larger-cabin jets, like General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream and Bombardier's own Global series with showers, beds and ranges connecting far-flung cities without refueling.
LOSING GROUND
Keeping older planes relevant through upgrades in an industry that covets the latest model is a useful lesson for planes like Bombardier's Challenger 650, said Vincent. 
Masluch said the 650 remains competitive in its market space and appeals to certain segments. 
""It's been a cash cow for them,"" Vincent said of the 600 plane family which first flew in 1978. ""But cash-cows have a way of getting fat.""
Bombardier's plans for a larger Learjet 85, made of lightweight composites, didn't materialize, ending in a $1.2 billion write-down in 2015.
Bombardier tried to compete on price in 2019, by launching the Liberty Learjet 75 at $9.9 million. 
The plane nabbed an order as an air ambulance, a niche vocation for the Learjet.
Still, Learjet lost ground, with just 11 deliveries last year, compared with 112 deliveries in 2001, according to JETNET data and Bombardier.
""At the end of the day there were more current options out there,"" said Guardian Jet managing partner Don Dwyer.
But the fast and sleek Learjet will always have its supporters, said Adam Twidell, chief executive at Private Fly.

The global booking service for charter flights still gets requests from passengers to ""'keep my Lear waiting,'"" he said.

741,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: UK auditing Indian vaccine site amid scramble for shots-sources,"By Neha Arora, Krishna N. Das and Euan Rocha
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Britain's drug regulator is auditing manufacturing processes at Serum Institute of India (SII) which could pave the way for AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine to be shipped from there to the UK and other countries, according to two sources close to the matter.
SII, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, is currently mass producing the AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in conjunction with Oxford University, for dozens of poor and middle-income countries but not the UK, which has been getting its supply of the shot primarily from domestic facilities. 
If the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) gives SII's manufacturing process for the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot a greenlight it would allow the drug to be exported to the UK and to other countries which recognise MHRA's clearances, one of the sources said.
Reuters could not determine what was the rationale for the audit. SII did not respond to a request for comment on it. The MHRA confirmed that an inspection was happening but declined further comment. 
""Due to commercial confidentiality we do not comment on inspections that are still ongoing,"" the regulator's chief executive Dr June Raine said in a statement to Reuters.
The two sources, who asked not to be named as the matter is private, said the audit should be relatively routine for SII, as its site already supplies other vaccines to the UK.
The inspection comes as countries around the world scramble to secure vaccine supplies amid supply disruptions and delivery cuts from leading drugmakers such as  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca.
It was not immediately clear whether an MHRA approval would allow the UK or AstraZeneca to route SII volumes of COVISHIELD - the brand name under which SII markets the AstraZeneca shot - to the EU, which has been pressuring the UK for supply from AstraZeneca's facilities in the UK, amid shortages in Europe.
AstraZeneca executives told EU officials last week that to accelerate supplies to the bloc, it could provide it with some doses manufactured outside Europe, two EU sources told Reuters. One said the SII could be a supplier.
AstraZeneca, which has previously tapped SII to help fulfill some of its vaccine orders from Brazil, South Africa and Saudi Arabia, did not respond to a request for comment on whether it needs SII to help meet commitments in the UK, or in any other nations that would recognise an MHRA certification. 
It was not immediately available to comment on the reported offer to supply the EU with shots from the SII.
INSPECTIONS
The EU's drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), audits sites from which it plans to source medicines but during the global pandemic, with multiple COVID-19 vaccines being developed, it is also partly leaning on inspections carried out by some other international regulators.
""Inspection outcomes for Covid-19 vaccines conducted by the MHRA will be considered by EMA,"" said the regulator. Any such approved sites would also need an EMA sign off before they can export to the EU, the regulator told Reuters.
MHRA declined to comment on specifics, but Raine said it was collaborating ""with international partners in response to the global pandemic and on matters of mutual interest.""
The UK has expressed an interest in purchasing vaccines from SII, according to the second source, along with a government official in New Delhi. The two sources said the volumes or timelines for any such purchases were unclear.
A UK government spokeswoman said: ""Any discussions that have taken place between the UK Government and India on vaccines are not related to securing extra vaccine supply to the UK.""
The UK has so far ordered 100 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine. 
""Most countries have approached us and India's government,"" SII told Reuters, but it did not comment on any UK outreach. ""We are trying our best to meet demand, and supply the vaccine to as many countries as possible, keeping India as the priority.""

SII's chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, told Reuters in late January, his family-owned firm was keen to support AstraZeneca's supply needs but its primary focus was on India and other poorer nations in Asia and Africa. He said at the time SII had no plans to divert supplies to Europe.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares rose for the 11th day in a row to reach a fresh peak on optimism about the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and new fiscal aid from Washington, while tensions in the Middle East drove oil to a 13-month high.
As more people are vaccinated across key markets such as the United States, and with U.S. President Joe Biden looking to pump an extra $1.9 trillion in stimulus into the economy, the so-called reflation trade has gathered steam in recent days.
On Friday, the Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", ended at its lowest level for nearly a year, helping to drive a 0.4% gain for MSCI's broadest measure of world stocks on Monday.
Taking its cue from a stronger, albeit holiday-thinned, Asian session, Europe's major indexes were a sea of green in early deals, with Britain's FTSE 100 up 2.2%.
With China and Hong Kong markets closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, Japan's Nikkei led the way, climbing 1.9% to reclaim the 30,000-point level for the first time in more than three decades.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were also higher, up 0.5%, although U.S. stock markets are closed on Monday for the Presidents Day holiday.
Later in the week, all eyes will be on the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, where policymakers decided to leave rates unchanged, for hints about the likely direction of monetary policy.
Those concerned about the impact of market exuberance on the outlook for inflation will also have fresh data to parse, with Britain, Canada and Japan all due to report. Friday will also see major economies, including the United States, release preliminary February purchasing managers' indexes (PMI).

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The Mexican arm of drinks company Anheuser-Busch InBev accused U.S. firm Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) in a lawsuit filed on Monday of breaching a deal on the use of the Corona brand name by applying it to a product other than beer.
Constellation has used the name for its Corona Hard Seltzer, a sparkling water with alcohol and flavouring, one of several seltzer drinks that have become very popular in the United States.
The case is the latest in an increasingly competitive and litigious U.S. brewing market.
Grupo Modelo filed its suit in the U.S. district court of the southern district of New York on Monday, according to a court filing. AB InBev, which confirmed the filing, said it had failed to settle the matter with Constellation directly. 
When AB InBev took full control of Grupo Modelo in 2013, it agreed with U.S. antitrust regulators to sell Grupo Modelo's business in the United States to Constellation, including the Corona brand. AB InBev retained rights to Corona and other Modelo brands in Mexico and elsewhere.
Modelo said the licensing arrangement for Corona only extended to beer and did not include hard seltzer.
Constellation said it was ""very surprised"" by the development and said Modelo's claims, including that its seltzer should not be classified as a beer, were without merit and were an attempt to restrain a strong competitor.
It said it had ""fully and completely"" complied with the terms of the sub-licence agreement and would vigoroustly defend its rights. 
Constellation launched Corona Hard Seltzer in February 2020 and said in October the brand had a 6% share of the U.S. seltzer market, making it the fourth-biggest brand in the segment.
The top spots are held by Mark Anthony Brands' White Claw, Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM)'s Truly and Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light Seltzer.
AB InBev's U.S. arm Anheuser-Busch won on appeal in May in a long-running case against rival  Molson Coors  (NYSE:TAP) over adverts highlighting the use of corn syrup in the Molson Coors' drinks Coors Light and Miller Lite.

A U.S. court also ruled this month that Anheuser-Busch should stop marketing new Michelob Ultra Organic Seltzer as the first and only seltzer certified as organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture after a challenge from an Oregon-based brewer.

LONDON (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover's luxury Jaguar brand will be entirely electric by 2025 and the carmaker will launch e-models of its entire lineup by 2030, it said on Monday, as it joined a global race to develop zero-emission vehicles.
JLR, owned by India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), said its Land Rover brand will launch six pure electric models over the next five years, with the first one coming in 2024. 
Known for its iconic, high-performance E-Type model in the 1960s and 1970s, Jaguar faces the same challenge as many other carmakers - making the transition to electric vehicles while retaining the feeling and power of a luxury combustion engine model.
JLR said it will keep all three of its British plants open as it electrifies its range. ""It's time to re-imagine the next chapter for both brands,"" Chief Executive Thierry Bollore said.
Shares in Tata Motors rose as much as 3% after the announcement. 
JLR said its electric plans for Jaguar would be centred at its Solihull plant, but dropped plans to build the XJ, the brand's flagship full-size car, at its Castle Bromwich facility in central England. 
Bollore, who took over as CEO in September, said the Castle Bromwich plant would focus instead on ""non-production"" activities in the long term. He provided few details.
JLR said it will spend around 2.5 billion pounds ($3.5 billion) annually on electrification technologies and the development of connected vehicle services.
The company said it was also investing in developing hydrogen fuel cells in anticipation of a future shift to hydrogen to power vehicles. 
The carmaker will have prototypes using hydrogen fuel cells on Britain's roads within the next year, it said, as part of a long-range investment plan.
Car groups worldwide are pursuing zero-emission strategies to meet stringent CO2 emission targets in Europe and China. 
Luxury car brand Bentley Motors, owned by Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said in November its model range will be fully electric by 2030, and last month General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it aimed to have a zero-emission lineup by 2035. 
A number of countries have also announced bans on new fossil-fuel vehicle sales. In the United Kingdom, that ban should take effect in 2030.
JLR said it was a ""on a path towards"" a double-digit operating profit and positive cash flow, and aims to achieve positive cash excluding debt by 2025.

751,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",UBS investment bank co-chief Novelli to join Euronext as chairman,"ZURICH/PARIS (Reuters) - Piero Novelli is to leave his job as co-chief of UBS Group's investment bank to become chairman of stock exchange operator Euronext, leaving his colleague Robert Karofsky in sole charge of the division at the Swiss bank.
Novelli, an Italian, is a high-profile dealmaker who advised on many big cross-border corporate mergers, including Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR)'s purchase of Indesit, completed in 2014.
Novelli's appointment was triggered by Euronext's acquisition of Borsa Italiana in October.
As part of the deal, Euronext agreed to have an Italian representative sitting at its supervisory board while a second Italian candidate was meant to be proposed as an independent member of the supervisory board and become the chairman of the combined group. 
Karofsky, an American, joined UBS in 2014 after stints at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). He led the global equities business before joining Novelli to run the investment bank.
The pair became co-leaders of the UBS business in September 2018, when Andrea Orcel left UBS.
""Under their leadership, the investment bank achieved its best fourth-quarter and full-year results since 2012, finishing 2020 with an exceptional return on attributed equity of nearly
20%,"" UBS said in a statement.
""I want to personally thank Piero for his contributions to reshaping our investment bank and successfully co-leading the business, employees and our clients through the pandemic,"" CEO Ralph Hamers said.
""Our world-class investment bank is critical to the success of our group strategy and I am confident Rob is the right leader to help us achieve our strategic ambitions."" 
In a memo to staff seen by Reuters, Karofksy hailed the duo's partnership and friendship.
""Our strategic ambitions remain clear, and we should all stay focused on providing a seamless service to our clients ... to maximize growth opportunities and deliver the full capabilities of UBS,"" he wrote.
Euronext said that Novelli is also a lecturer at a number of top universities and supported the Italian healthcare system during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis.
Euronext, which aims to close its 4.3 billion euro ($5.22 billion) acquisition of Borsa Italiana from the London Stock Exchange in the first half of 2021, reported higher-than-expected annual revenue this month.

Data published this month showed that Euronext's Amsterdam hub had displaced London as Europe's biggest share trading centre after Britain left the EU's single market following the Brexit deal.

The lender also said it would encourage clients not to buy or produce beef or soy farmed in the Cerrado, a vast tropical savanna eco-region covering 20% of Brazil, only financing those which adopt a strategy of zero deforestation by 2025.
Environmental campaign groups said BNP Paribas' move sent a strong signal to companies trading commodities in the region, but pressed for faster action.
""Financial institutions exposed to the agricultural sector in Brazil must contribute to this fight against deforestation. This is the case for BNP Paribas,"" the bank said in a statement.
Soy and beef are two of the largest drivers of global deforestation. Population growth and rapidly expanding middle classes in countries like China have fueled an explosion in demand for soy and increases in consumption of meat and dairy.
Some scientists warn the Amazon forest, which spans nine countries, is hurtling towards a death spiral as deforestation continues apace. An area of Amazon rainforest the size of Israel was felled last year, according to Amazon Conservation.
Half of the Cerrado has already been cleared and is one of the planet's most threatened ecosystems, four environmental NGOs said in a joint statement.
""BNP Paribas is giving traders five more years to clear forests with impunity,"" Klervi Le Guenic of Canopee Forets Vivantes said.

BNP and other European lenders including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Dutch bank ING committed last month to stop financing trade in crude oil from Ecuador after pressure from activists aiming to protect the Amazon.

753,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2021 08:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Equinor considers more US asset sales in global strategy revamp,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Nerijus Adomaitis
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's Equinor is looking to sell more assets in the United States and exit several other countries as part of a major global reshuffle as it tries to return to profit after writing down $25 billion of U.S. assets over the past decade.
While the company, like other energy majors, has been hit by last year's fall in oil and gas prices, Equinor's new head of international business, Al Cook, said it lacked scale in the U.S. shale market and had underestimated the strength of local competition. 
Equinor disposed of its operated shale assets in the Eagle Ford in 2019, and last week said it had agreed to sell its assets in the Bakken shale oil province in the states of North Dakota and Montana for around $900 million.
""All our operated onshore positions in the U.S. are under the same kind of review that we've done in the Bakken,"" Cook, told Reuters in an interview.
""We've got an operated position in the Utica, we've got an operated position in the Austin Chalk, those are under very active review right now,"" he added.
As of the second quarter of 2020, Equinor had around 232,000 net acres in the Appalachian Basin, including 27,000 acres it operates, and around 114,000 net acres in Louisiana Austin Chalk, roughly half of which is operated.
    Cook said Equinor was slow to realise U.S. production was not cost effective at low oil prices as the country essentially took over OPEC's swing producer role. 
However, Equinor will keep and possibly expand its operations in the Gulf of Mexico, its large non-operated position in Appalachian gas and its wind business in the U.S. northeast - following a similar strategy to that in the UK where it is a major gas supplier and wind power producer.
    ""We think that can become a profitable, low carbon business which will flourish under the kind of measures President Joe Biden is taking in the U.S. ... and in time we will look at converting that natural gas into a hydrogen business,"" Cook said.
    ""FAT CHICKEN, SHARP BEAKS""
    Equinor currently has a presence in more than 20 countries outside Norway, generating a third of its total production or around 700,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
    Cook - who joined Equinor in 2016 after a decade at BP (NYSE:BP), including working as chief of staff for then CEO Bob Dudley - said that while he hopes overseas output will rise, it was likely to be from fewer countries.
    ""With the low oil price, our chickens came home to roost, and we found out that they've got very fat and they have very sharp beaks...and they caused a billion dollar write downs.""
Equinor has already exited or announced it will exit from around 10 countries since the end of 2019, including South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, Uruguay, Turkey, Australia and the United Arab Emirates. 
In a major shift, it will no longer seek ""material"" operated onshore positions abroad, but instead partner with experienced local operators such as Rosneft in Russia, YPF in Argentina and Chesapeake in the Appalachian, Cook said.
It will also focus on previously developed areas with a faster return on investment and less on frontier exploration. 
    ""We can't do exploration where we say one day this would produce oil and gas, because one day the world will not need all oil and gas,"" Cook said.
The company has recently written down the entire value of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) development in Tanzania. 
""We have to look at what we are good at. We are good at subsurface, we are really good at finding oil and gas... we are good at offshore environments with big waves and high winds,"" he said, adding that was a good fit with Norway, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and the UK, as well as with Canada and Azerbaijan.

""We want to produce more, at least in the next decade, but we want to produce with fewer emissions.""

PARIS (Reuters) - French tycoon Vincent Bollore will retain strong influence over Universal Music Group as a major shareholder following its planned 30-billion-euro ($36 billion) spin-off on the stock market by media conglomerate Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) . 
Vivendi is seeking to extract the most value from its crown-jewel asset, the world's biggest music label and home to singers such as Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, as the music industry rebounds from a long downturn thanks to streaming revenues. 
The French conglomerate outlined plans at the weekend to distribute 60% of Universal's capital to its current shareholders via a listing in Amsterdam.
The news triggered a rally in Vivendi's shares in early Paris trading on Monday, valuing the group close to 31 billion euros ($38 billion).
Vivendi's market value is about the same as the enterprise value that it placed on Universal before it sold two blocs of 10% in the music label to a consortium led by Chinese group Tencent, in March 2020 and January this year. 
""The whole transaction is aimed at freeing up the hidden value of Vivendi, whose market value has been inferior to that of Universal's itself lately,"" a source close the matter said. 
At the end of this IPO process, which has to be approved by a shareholders meeting at the end of March, Universal's three biggest shareholders would be Vivendi (20%), the Tencent-led consortium (20%) and Bollore (16%). 
As Bollore controls Vivendi via a 27% stake, this means directly and indirectly he will control some 36% of Universal. 
Vivendi had previously said that it would list Universal by the start of 2023 at the latest.
However several institutional investors pressed the conglomerate to move more quickly, to take advantage of financial markets flush with cheap money, prompting Bollore to accelerate the timetable, according to the same source.
Bollore chose Amsterdam over other international financial centres, such as New York, to list the company, because it is ""neutral"" and more attractive to potential investors from China, including Tencent, which had been targeted by the previous U.S. administration, the source close to the matter added. 
MUSIC STREAMING BOOM
Universal's capital distribution will take the form of a special dividend, under the plans to list the music label, which competes with the likes of Warner Music Group and  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) Music Entertainment.
Several analysts welcomed the proposals, citing investors' unabated appetite for content providers after the listing of Warner, and the revival of the music industry on the back of streaming revenues.
""This is what many shareholders have wanted and is a better outcome than Vivendi selling some of its UMG stake in an IPO,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note, adding that it estimated Universal's value was about 40 billion euros. 
After a 15-year downturn, the music industry has rebounded in the past five years, with global recorded music revenues increasing by 8.2 percent in 2019 to $20.2 billion, according to the latest annual report by record industry trade group IFPI.
Streaming revenues have represented the bulk of the growth over the pas few years, pushing the share of streaming revenues to 56% in 2019, driven by 341 million paid subscribers.
Music streaming Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), the market leader, and rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music are the driving forces behind that trend.

Investing.com --Tradition has it that the biggest rewards in finance go to fast movers. Vivendi’s spinoff of Universal Music Group - whose stable of artists ranges from Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish to Andrea Bocelli - might be the exception that proves the rule.
The French conglomerate has dragged out the sale process for over three years, a period in which the worldwide adoption of streaming as the medium of choice for music consumers has driven a real transformation of UMG’s business and prospects.
It’s now being paid handsomely for its procrastination.
Even though the development has been in the works for what seems like an eternity, the news, released at the weekend, was still able to push (PA:Vivendi's) stock sharply higher in Paris on Monday. Having struggled for weeks with resistance around its pre-pandemic high, the stock surged over 16% to a new record high by midday in Europe.
 Vivendi  (OTC:VIVHY) expects to distribute 60% of UMG shares to its shareholders in the form of a special dividend by the year end, a move aimed at unlocking as much value as possible for shareholders while reducing its own capital gains tax liability.
It’s looking at a valuation of at least 30 billion euros ($36 billion), roughly in line with the price that it has extracted from Tencent (NYSE:TME) for two successive 10% blocks. The second of those sales came in December last year, raising the Chinese company’s stake to 20%.
Intriguingly, in Saturday’s statement, the company referred to “interests expressed by other investors at potentially higher prices.” That doesn’t seem impossible, given that rival Warner Music (NASDAQ:WMG), with just over half of UMG’s revenue, is valued at $15.9 billion.
The proceeds from the sale to Tencent, plus the higher value of its remaining stake in UMG, will allow Vivendi to go ahead with buybacks that it has promised for a long time. It’s also talking about acquisitions again, although it gave no details in Saturday’s press release.
What’s left of Vivendi after the spin-off is likely to be of little interest to non-French investors: the 30 billion euro valuation ascribed to UMG accounted for nearly 90% of the conglomerate’s value as of Friday’s close, despite representing only 45% of sales. Despite signs of progress at its Canal+ TV unit, neither it nor the Havas communications company has anything like the same earning power.
The newly-listed company will be quoted on the Amsterdam stock exchange, which a Financial Times article last week suggested had been the main beneficiary of European investors moving their liquidity out of London since the Brexit transition period ended."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo, a business partner of former U.S. president Donald Trump, launched on Monday construction on a movie studio as part of a tourism complex on Java island that is set to receive tax breaks.
Lido City is the umbrella project located around 60 km (37 miles) south of the capital Jakarta in the Bogor area, where the Trump Organization will operate luxury villas, a resort and a golf course. 
The project has been designated a special economic zone (SEZ) for tourism, which means it can benefit from corporate tax cuts, luxury goods sales tax cuts and get some leniency on permits, PT MNC Studios International said in a statement.
""For around 1,000 hectares in Bogor Regency, a special economic zone permit has been obtained,"" MNC Group executive chairman Tanoesoedibjo said in a text message, adding the movie studios will be wholly controlled by his company.Tanoesoedibjo told local media he hoped the Movieland studios will become a creative hub and Indonesia's version of Hollywood. 
Indonesia's National Council for Special Economic Zones, which recommended President Joko Widodo approve the status, projected Lido City could attract $2.4 billion in investment and 3.17 million tourist per year through 2038.
Businesses investing 1 trillion rupiah ($71.92 million) or more in SEZs are eligible for tax holidays of up to 20 years that could be extended for two more years with a 50% tax cut. 
It was not clear whether the Trump Organization would benefit from tax breaks since MNC has not disclosed any profit-sharing schemes over the management of the properties. Trump Organization is also partnering with MNC on another project in Bali.
In a 2019 visit to Indonesia, Donald Trump Jr dismissed any risk of conflict of interest in the Southeast Asian country and said the projects were among the last the Trump Organization signed up before his father became president. (https://reut.rs/2N7qClh)
The former U.S. President kept ownership of his global business empire, but handed off control to his two oldest sons through a trust while in office.

In economic news, Eurozone finance ministers will meet virtually later Monday to discuss the bloc’s economic recovery. The Deutsche Bundesbank will release its monthly report on the German economy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese shares surged on Monday to close at over 30-year high on rising expectations for a rebound in corporate earnings and economic growth.
The Nikkei index ended up 1.91% at 30,084.15, reclaiming the psychologically important 30,000 level for the first time since August 1990. Energy, healthcare, and industrial shares led the gains.
The broader Topix rose 1.04% to 1,953.94 to close at its highest since June 1991.
Shares of companies that have reported positive earnings rose, as investors continued to bet on sectors expected to perform well as the global economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.
Japan is expected to start coronavirus vaccinations this week, which is also supporting stock prices. However, Japanese stocks have rallied 8% so far this month, and some analysts warn that the market may be overheating.
""Stocks have risen so fast you could say they've broken the speed limit,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""Earnings growth has already been priced in for at least a year from now. There is reluctance to chase the upside from here, but stocks won't fall too much.""

The pandemic has shattered Rolls-Royce's finances because it is paid by airlines on a flying-hours basis, and the company warned in January that the start of this year was even more difficult than expected.
The aero-engines maker said Kakoullis would start on May 3. 
Chief Executive Warren East said his experience made him a good fit. 
""Panos delivered significant transformational change at Deloitte, streamlining and simplifying the business and we look forward to benefitting from his expertise and experience as we deliver on our fundamental reorganisation,"" East said. 
Rolls's current CFO Stephen Daintith, who resigned last year after being poached by online retailer group Ocado (LON:OCDO), will leave Rolls-Royce on Mar. 19. Ben Fidler, currently acting deputy CFO, will be interim CFO in the six weeks until Kakoullis arrives.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sandy Morris said of the appointment: ""We suspect the market might have been more immediately reassured by a familiar name, one with corporate experience, but it is hard to question Mr Kakoullis's experience, technical credentials and knowledge of driving the adoption of AI and advanced analytics.""
Despite the deepening travel crisis due to new strains of the coronavirus, Rolls has said its liquidity of 9 billion pounds gives it confidence.
It is selling assets worth 2 billion pounds and cutting more than 1 billion pounds in costs by axing 9,000 jobs, closing factories and planning a two week operational shutdown in the summer of some units.

Kakoullis joined Deloitte as a graduate and worked there until May 2019. He has since worked for PA Consulting.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai Airports' chief executive warned on Monday it would be another tough year for the Middle East's busiest hub, Dubai International, after passenger numbers slid 70% in 2020. 
The airport, the base for airline Emirates and a major source of income for Dubai, handled 25.9 million passengers last year, mostly in the first quarter before the COVID-19 pandemic struck. 
""We are planning for it to be a tough year. That's undoubtedly the case ... anyone that doesn't think it's going to be a tough year has clearly not being observing what's been going on,"" chief executive Paul Griffiths told Reuters.
The number of flights handled in 2020 fell 51.4% to 183,993 while the amount of cargo dropped 23.2% to 1.9 million tonnes.
Aviation executives and analysts expect it will take years for the industry to recover, with international travel restrictions continuing to cripple global demand. 
Griffiths, who has run state operator Dubai Airports since 2007, said he was optimistic travel demand would increase as vaccine rollouts gathered pace globally. 
That could see Dubai airport handle more passengers this year than in 2020, though he cautioned it would be a ""long time"" before the airport returns to pre-pandemic figures. ""Intercontinental travel will continue to be a challenge.""
Dubai was the world's fourth-busiest airport in 2019, according to industry group Airports Council International.
Last year's 25.9 million passengers would not have qualified for the top 20 airports by passengers in 2019.
Unlike many other regions, Dubai and the wider United Arab Emirates has no scheduled domestic flight network to cushion against the downturn in international travel.
London's Heathrow airport and Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, for example, handled 22.1 million and 22.3 million passengers respectively in 2020. 
There has been no unified global approach to tackling the deadly pandemic that has killed over 2.5 million. 
That, compounded with fears of contracting the virus, has crippled the travel industry as countries have closed borders and imposed tough entry restrictions.
Griffiths said countries should move to a ""secure risk management"" strategy as opposed to ""risk avoidance"" where tough measures have been focused on eliminating the virus.

The operation, which was identified in December and that the U.S. government has said was likely orchestrated by Russia, breached software made by SolarWinds Corp, giving hackers access to thousands of companies and government offices that used its products.
The hackers got access to emails at the U.S. Treasury, Justice and Commerce departments and other agencies.
Cybersecurity experts have said it could take months to identify the compromised systems and expel the hackers.
""I think from a software engineering perspective, it's probably fair to say that this is the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen,"" Smith said during an interview that aired on Sunday on the CBS program ""60 Minutes."" 
The breach could have compromised up to 18,000 SolarWinds customers that used the company's Orion network monitoring software, and likely relied on hundreds of engineers. 
""When we analyzed everything that we saw at Microsoft, we asked ourselves how many engineers have probably worked on these attacks. And the answer we came to was, well, certainly more than 1,000,"" Smith said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average rose above the 30,000 level for the first time in more than 30 years on Monday, as it regained the ground lost during decades of economic stagnation.
Japanese stocks have capitalised on an anticipated global rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic this year, with the abundance of cyclical shares, such as electronic parts makers, attracting global investors.
The break of 30,000 could open the way for test of all-time high of 38,957, touched at the end of 1989.
The Nikkei's epic downfall since then even dwarfed the Wall Street's worst bear market after the Great Depression. The Dow Jones Industrial Average took 25 years to recover to its previous peak. 
None of the Japanese banks that topped the list of companies with biggest market capitalisation in 1990 exist now, as they subsequently suffered massive loan losses and repeated mergers to survive.
Tokyo Electric Power Co, the biggest firm outside banks back then, became irrelevant for investment in 2011 after the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster.
Today, the market is led by  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), one of the country's last bastion of exporters, followed by Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group, which was not listed three decades ago, and tech companies.
Foreign ownership of Japanese shares has grown to almost 30% from 4% in 1990, as domestic banks and companies have unwound cross shareholdings.
The last time the Nikkei traded above 30,000 was Aug. 3, 1990, a day after Iraq's surprise invasion of Kuwait poured cold water on investors expecting the peace will prevail after the end of Cold War in late 1989.
Compared to the 1988-1990 period, most investors see the Nikkei's rise above 30,000 as less frothy. The market is traded at about 17 times expected earnings, higher than recent years but not about 50 times in 1990.
Still, some players see a similarity. 
""Somehow, there is a similar feel now. At the time we had a crazy bubble and the Bank of Japan did a monetary easing in a scale that had been previously unthinkable,"" said Hiroaki Hayashi, managing director at Fukoku Capital Management.

""Then we had the collapse of the Soviet Union and the world entered a new era. Now, we have the bitcoin and GAFA shares soaring while fiscal policies around seem unsustainable. The world order is looking shaky too, as evident in the changing U.S.-China relations.""

The source was speaking after French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche said Artisan Partners would meet as early as Tuesday afternoon with Danone's lead independent board member-elect Gilles Schnepp, independent lead board director Michel Landel and possibly some other Danone board members.
Danone, the world's largest yoghurt group, which reports its 2020 earnings on Friday Feb.19, could not be immediately reached for comment.
Earlier this week Artisan Partners, which said it had built up a stake of over 3% in Danone, making it the third-largest shareholder, criticised the company's strategy and share price performance in a letter it made public, demanding Danone split the roles of chief executive and chairman.
The move follows similar demands from activist investor Bluebell, which has not disclosed its holding but last month called on Danone Chairman and Chief Executive Emmanuel Faber to step down.

Shares in Danone, whose revenue and margins have lagged those of rivals such as Nestle, lost nearly 30% last year. Emmanuel Faber has been Danone chief executive since 2014 and took on the chairman's role as well three years later.

The House Financial Services Committee is examining how a flood of retail trading drove GameStop and other shares to extreme highs, squeezing hedge funds like Melvin Capital that had bet against it.
The witness list was announced on Friday by Representative Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) and includes Keith Gill, who also goes by Roaring Kitty, Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad  Tenev, Citadel CEO Kenneth Griffin, Melvin CEO Gabriel  Plotkin and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman. 
The virtual hearing, entitled “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,"" will take place on Thursday at 12 p.m. ET (1700 GMT), according to the press release and will be livestreamed https://financialservices.house.gov/live. Waters, a Democrat, is chair of the House Committee on Financial Services. 
""We are working with the House Financial Services Committee and plan to testify,"" Reddit's Huffman said in a statement. A spokesperson for Melvin confirmed that Plotkin plans to testify. 
Representatives for Citadel and Robinhood did not respond to requests for comment. Gill could not be reached for comment. 
Robinhood, Reddit, Melvin and Citadel have been at the center of the GameStop saga, which saw retail traders promote GameStop on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets. Robinhood emerged as a popular venue to trade the stocks but was criticized for temporarily restricting trading in the hot stock.
The GameStop surge resulted in massive losses for Melvin, after the hedge fund bet the retailer’s stock price would tumble. Citadel’s hedge funds, along with founder Griffin and firm partners, put $2 billion into Melvin.
Democrats and Republicans are united in their outrage by Robinhood's decision to suspend trading in the so-called ""meme stocks"" on Jan. 28. Tenev said the company had to impose the restrictions after wild trading in the stocks triggered a $3 billion margin call by Robinhood's clearing house, straining the company's balance sheet. 

Massachusetts securities regulators have also issued a subpoena seeking Gill's testimony.

Reuters reported in December that Apple may have progressed enough to build a vehicle for mass markets by 2024, helped by cost cuts in battery technology.

""Apple will not manage that overnight,"" he added.
While Apple's plans are not public, Diess said its intentions as such were ""logical"" because the company had expertise in batteries, software and design, and that it had deep pockets to build on these competencies.
""Still, we are not afraid,"" he said.

Volkswagen plans to develop software needed for autonomous cars in-house to ensure it can compete against tech firms in the field of electric car data.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal may have to provide more than the 500 million euros ($606 million) it budgeted for ailing airline TAP this year due to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic, its finance minister said.
Asked how much more the Portuguese government expects to spend on TAP this year, Joao Leao told Sunday's Jornal de Negocios: ""That is still being analysed"".
""The situation of TAP is very demanding ... that amount may have to be reconsidered because at the moment the pandemic is having a much stronger impact than expected,"" Leao said. 
In December, a government plan to rescue TAP proposed 2,000 job cuts by 2022 and pay cuts of up to 25%, while the airline would need around 2 billion euros in extra funds with state guarantees to cover its financing needs until 2024.
The redundancies may be lower if the European Union accepts an agreement in principle last week between the leaders of 15 unions and TAP's board.
However, if the EU executive rejects Lisbon’s proposal, TAP would have to immediately repay a 1.2 billion euro rescue loan agreed in June, which could lead to its insolvency.
Leao said the plan ""will imply a very significant structural change in the company to ensure that TAP becomes a profitable company and manages to survive this crisis"", adding that talks with Brussels needed to be completed ""as quickly as possible"".
TAP asked for state aid in April after suspending almost all of its 2,500 weekly flights at the height of the coronavirus crisis, and reported losses of more than 700 million euros for the first nine months of 2020.
Leao also said the government will maintain support measures to companies ""whatever the cost"" for as long as Portugal's economy is impacted by the pandemic crisis.
Portugal said last month it is likely to cut its 5.4% growth forecast for 2020 due to a new lockdown.

The expected arrival of Kakoullis comes at a challenging time for the company, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis as its airline customers have grounded planes.
In January the aero engines maker lowered forecasts for how much its engines will fly this year as tighter coronavirus travel restrictions inflict fresh pain on airlines, saying this would mean a cash outflow of 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion).
Rolls-Royce told Reuters it was not commenting on the report at this time.
The company has been searching for a new CFO since Stephen Daintith resigned last August, though he has remained at Rolls-Royce for the transition period before taking the CFO role at British online supermarket and technology group Ocado (LON:OCDO).

Kakoullis was partner at Deloitte UK for more than 20 years and managing director of the global audit and assurance business for four years at the Big Four accounting firm, his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile shows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday gave the green light for the extradition to Japan of an American father and son accused of helping former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee that country while awaiting trial on financial misconduct charges.
In a brief order, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer denied an emergency request by lawyers for U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, to put on hold a lower court order that cleared the way for them to be extradited. 
The Taylors' lawyers in a late Thursday filing reiterated arguments that their clients could not be prosecuted in Japan for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that, if extradited, they faced the prospect of relentless interrogations and torture.
Lawyers for the Taylors did not immediately comment on Saturday. The Japanese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.
A federal appeals court in Boston had declined on Thursday to issue an order preventing the Taylors' extradition while they appealed lower-court rulings. The U.S. State Department approved their extradition in October.
""The very least the U.S. courts owe the petitioners is a full chance to litigate these issues, including exercising their appellate rights, before they are consigned to the fate that awaits them at the hands of the Japanese government,"" defense lawyers wrote.
The Taylors were arrested in May at Japan's request after being charged with helping Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he had engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.
Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, received $1.3 million for their services. 
The Taylors, who have been held without bail since their arrests, waged a monthslong campaign to press their case against extradition in the courts, media, State Department and White House with the aid of a collection of high-powered lawyers and lobbyists. 
Their defense team included two lawyers with ties to former President Donald Trump: Abbe Lowell, who has represented Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House lawyer. 

Ghosn has said he has been helping everyone who helped him. And in a court filing, he sought to support the Taylors’ arguments against extradition, saying he himself had faced prolonged detention, mental torture and intimidation in Japan and that the Taylors would face ""similar or worse.""

Clinical trials of this vaccine, which will be based on a technology known as mRNA -- on which lean approved vaccines of Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) --, are expected to start this quarter.
In December last year, Sanofi had said it was targeting ""earliest potential approval"" of the shot in the second half of 2021, following positive preclinical data.
""This vaccine will not be ready this year, but it could be of use at a later stage all the more if the fight against variants was to continue,"" Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD) was quoted as saying.
The CEO gave no other details. Officials at Sanofi were not available for comment.
The news could mark another blow for Sanofi, already embattled with a delay for another COVID-19 vaccine candidate it hopes to bring to patients and for which the company has teamed up with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).
The two groups stunned investors last year by warning their traditional, protein-based COVID-19 jab showed an insufficient immune response in older people, delaying its launch towards the end of 2021.
To appease critics, Sanofi said last month it had agreed to fill and pack millions of doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from July.
Some 108 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and more than 2.4 million have died since first cases were identified in China in December 2019, according to a Reuters tally.

Countries worldwide have since the beginning of the year embarked on mass vaccination programmes, with mixed results, and are now confronted with the emergence of several variant strains which forces them to move even more quickly.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A clear cryptocurrency regulatory regime is urgently needed as major companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) embrace the alternative asset class, a top Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official said.
Hester Peirce, a Republican commissioner at the agency, also told Reuters in an interview that it was too soon to draw policy conclusions from a ""Reddit Rally"" in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other stocks, but it was ""wonderful"" that a new generation of investors was able to participate in the market.
Dubbed by crypto enthusiasts as the “Crypto Mom” due to her supportive stance on the asset class, Peirce has long advocated for regulators to create clear rules that would allow crypto assets to thrive without fear of breaking the law.
""It's not only that there have been calls for clarity for some time and that a new administration brings the chance to take a fresh look, but it also is a moment where it seems others in the marketplace are also taking a fresh look,"" she said. 
Bitcoin hit record highs this month after electric car-maker Tesla said it had invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency and BNY Mellon said it would help clients hold, transfer, and issue digital assets. Mastercard also said it would open up its network to some cryptocurrencies.
""That adds to the urgency of us taking some sort of action in this area to provide more clarity,"" said Peirce.
The market was plunged into crisis last month when Reddit users trading on low-cost retail platforms banded together to drive up the prices of GameStop and other stocks, squeezing hedge funds that had bet against those shares.
The resulting volatility triggered massive margin calls from “clearing” houses that guarantee trades, prompting several retail platforms to suspend buying in the affected securities. 
The incident sparked outrage among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Vlad Tenev, CEO of trading app Robinhood, Ken Griffin, CEO of hedge fund Citadel LLC and others involved in the saga will testify before Congress on Thursday. 
The SEC is examining the ""gamut"" of issues including market volatility, the role of retail brokers, and how the post-trade market functioned, said Peirce. 

""To see new investors participating in the markets is a good thing and of course we want them to be educated and skeptical,"" she said, adding that a wide range of market participants could actually help improve price formation.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla Inc will set up an electric-car manufacturing unit in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, according to a government document seen by Reuters on Saturday.
""The U.S. firm Tesla will be opening an electric car manufacturing unit in Karnataka,"" the state government said in a brief statement. 
The statement was part of a broader document outlining the highlights of India's budget to its people in the local language of Kannada. 
Last month, the electric carmaker incorporated  Tesla Motors  (NASDAQ:TSLA) India and Energy Private Limited with its registered office in the city of Bengaluru in Karnataka, a hub for global technology companies.
State Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had then said in a tweet, which was subsequently deleted, that Tesla would start its operations in India with an R&D unit in Bengaluru.
It was not immediately clear if the Saturday statement was referring to the same unit.
Tesla and the office of Karnataka state chief minister did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comments.
Musk has tweeted several times about the company's impending foray into India. In December, the Tesla CEO confirmed in an exchange on Twitter that Tesla will launch in the country in 2021.
India has been keen to reduce its oil dependence and cut down on pollution, but its efforts to promote electric vehicles have been stymied by a lack of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure such as charging stations.

To boost investment, India plans to offer $4.6 billion in incentives to companies setting up advanced battery manufacturing facilities, Reuters reported last year.

The recall covers some 2016-2021 model year CLA-Class, GLA-Class, GLE-Class, GLS-Class, SLC-Class, A-Class, GT-Class, C-Class, E-Class, S-Class, CLS-Class, SL-Class, B-Class, GLB-Class, GLC-Class, and G-Class vehicles, according to a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The German automaker plans to issue a software update that will be installed by dealers or over-the-air.

The automaker said ""a temporary collapse of the communication module's power supply caused by a crash might lead to the vehicle's position during a potential emergency call being incorrect."" Mercedes-Benz added that ""other functions of the automatic and manual emergency call function remain fully operational.""
Mercedes-Benz in Europe in October 2019 launched an investigation based on a report from the Mercedes-Benz eCall center of a single instance in the European market where the automatic eCall system relayed an inaccurate vehicle position.

Daimler announced the fund on Feb. 3 alongside plans to spin off the world's largest truck and bus maker, as it seeks to increase its appeal to investors as a focused electric, luxury cars business.
Daimler Trucks has operations around the world and last April announced a fuel joint venture with Sweden's Volvo Trucks.

""We will develop proposals for new projects for individual sites, with which we can support additional employment and the change to new drive technologies,"" he replied. 
Asked whether the money could be used for investments such as U.S. autonomous driving software start-ups, Brecht said: ""The money is not for any old acquisitions.""
As for potential spending in Sweden for the Volvo venture, he said: ""The fuel cell drive system will have to be produced at one of our (German) sites. There is no doubt about that.""
Daimler Trucks chief executive Martin Daum told Reuters on Tuesday that a full line of zero-emission commercial vehicles could be ready by 2027, but deploying them needed fresh investments. He also highlighted growth opportunities in China, India and other markets such as Indonesia.

The plan to list Universal represents part of a process launched by Vivendi's top shareholder French billionaire Vincent Bollore to cash in on the music industry's revival.
""Vivendi’s leading institutional shareholders have been pressing for a number of years for a split or the distribution of Universal Music Group (UMG) to reduce Vivendi’s conglomerate discount,"" Vivendi said in a statement.
The French conglomerate said the distribution would take the form of a special dividend.
UMG, a holding company currently being incorporated in the Netherlands, will apply for a listing on Euronext in Amsterdam.
The transaction has received a favorable response from the consortium led by China's tech group Tencent, which now controls 20% of UMG, having bought the stake in two successive waves that valued UMG at 30 billion euros ($36.35 billion), Vivendi said.
Vivendi said it would hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting on March 29 to modify the company's by-laws and make the distribution possible.

The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Wednesday sided with LG Chem in a trade secrets case, but permitted SK Innovation to import components for domestic production of lithium ion batteries for Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's EV F-150 program for four years, and for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) of America’s electric vehicle line for two years.
VW said Friday it will request its carve out be ""extended to at least four years to give an adequate transition period. Ultimately, however, it is our hope the two suppliers will settle this dispute outside of the courtroom.""
The German automaker has invested $800 million to build electric vehicles in Tennessee and hiring hundreds of employees. ""Volkswagen will take all necessary steps to allow us to fulfill our commitment to provide skilled jobs to proud Tennessee workers,"" the automaker said.
On Thursday, Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley publicly encouraged LG Chem and SK Innovation to reach a settlement. VW and Ford previously warned the dispute could disrupt supplies of the key EV parts and cost U.S. jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Georgia Governor Brian Kemp on Friday called on President Joe Biden to overturn the ITC ruling, warning the long-term prospects for the $2.6 billion SK Innovation battery plant in Jackson County, Georgia, would be ""harmed significantly."" The plant will eventually build batteries for Volkswagen and Ford.
The White House and SK Innovation declined comment.
LG Energy Solution counsel Dave Callahan said the company ""remains committed to negotiating a fair settlement for the theft of its trade secrets"" and said the Georgia plant will be able to operate. 

""The only obstacle to resolving this matter and securing the plant's long-term future is (SK Innovation's) refusal to acknowledge its wrongdoing and make amends,"" he added.

Waters, a Democrat, is Chair of the House Committee on Financial Services. 
Robinhood, Reddit, Melvin and Citadel have been at the center of the GameStop saga, which saw retail traders promote GameStop on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets. Robinhood emerged as a popular venue to trade the stocks but was criticized for temporarily restricting trading in the hot stock.
The GameStop surge resulted in massive losses for Melvin, after the hedge fund bet the retailer’s stock price would tumble. Citadel’s hedge funds, along with founder Griffin and firm partners, put $2 billion into Melvin. 
Democrats and Republicans are united in their outrage by Robinhood's decision to suspend trading in the so-called ""meme stocks"" on Jan. 28.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said late on Friday that outgoing Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat's compensation for 2020 would be $19 million, a 21% decrease from 2019, according to a regulatory filing. 
Company directors reduced Corbat's incentive pay for his failures to efficiently address the risk and control concerns of regulators, the bank said in a filing.
In October, the bank agreed to pay a $400 million penalty and draw up a sweeping remediation plan after U.S. regulators identified “several longstanding deficiencies” and operational lapses following an ""error"" that caused the bank to mistakenly distribute nearly $1 billion of its own funds.
Shortly after, the bank announced Corbat would retire earlier than expected and the bank would boost investment in its operational systems by $1 billion.
Incoming CEO Jane Fraser has highlighted improving risk and control systems as a priority. 
Additionally, members of the board considered the bank’s 2019 operating performance, market levels of pay for the CEO role at peer institutions, and Corbat’s leadership while deciding his compensation, according to the filing.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 07:16PM ET</span>","Investors eye shares of hotels, cruise lines as U.S. vaccinations pick up","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are watching next week's earnings reports from hotels, cruise lines and other businesses that have been hard hit by COVID-19 for indications of which companies could be the first to bounce back when the pandemic recedes. 
For nearly a year, money managers have largely looked past earnings in the travel and leisure sector, where coronavirus-fueled lockdowns and travel restrictions battered companies’ businesses and crushed their stock prices: shares of Marriott and Norwegian Cruise Lines, for example, are down 12% or more in the last year, compared to a nearly 17% gain for the S&P 500 through Friday afternoon. 
Next week’s numbers, however, may offer clues on which companies are in the best financial health and would benefit the most from economic reopening, while also allowing investors to better gauge where companies should be valued. 
""The results across the board are going to be bad, but it's really going to be about who is coming back,"" said Adam Trivison, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. 
The focus on travel and leisure companies comes as investors more broadly gauge the effectiveness of the U.S. vaccination effort and the degree to which it will help the economy get back on track.
The White House announced Feb. 2 that it will start shipping vaccines directly to retail pharmacies alongside regular shipments to states, increasing weekly supplies of shots to 11.5 million. Approximately 10.5% of the U.S. population through Feb. 11 had received at least one of the two shots required for full vaccination, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Will Hilkert, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Select Leisure fund, said that earnings results over the next two quarters will serve as a gut check for investors who had bet on the leisure sector as a play on the economy reopening. 
""Over the next six to nine months you're going to get a chance to make sure that what you think the world is going to look like after the pandemic is being matched by company fundamentals,"" he said. 
 Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc and Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) Corp are expected to release their results on Feb. 17, followed by Marriott, Norwegian Cruise Lines and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) on Feb. 18. 
Trivison, of Gabelli Funds, said he will be keeping an eye on hotel bookings in the group meeting business, which he expects to offer clues on the scale of employee travel in the week ahead. Business travelers typically make up 25% of a hotel chain's customers, though that number may be higher in destinations such as Orlando and Las Vegas. 
Historically high valuations in the hospitality sector may give some potential investors a pause before buying at current levels, said Daniel Kane, a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM) who bought shares of Marriott while its stock was tumbling last March and April. 
Most stocks in the hospitality sector are now trading based on estimates of their 2023 results, pushing their current valuations well above their long-term averages, said Robin Farley, an analyst at UBS. 
Marriott, for example, trades at a trailing price to earnings multiple of 240.7, while Hilton is currently unprofitable but trades at 515.7 its current fiscal year's full year earnings, according to Refinitiv data. 
Cruise lines, meanwhile, are not expected to become widely profitable again until 2022, when most international travel restrictions should be eased. Norwegian, for instance, trades at 35.2 times its 2022 estimated earnings, while  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) trades at 40.4 times its 2022 estimated earnings, according to Refinitiv. Marriott was trading at a trailing P/E of about 16 before widespread economic restrictions were put in place in March.
Chris Terry, a portfolio manager with Hodges Funds, has been paring back a position in Norwegian after shares of the company rallied following the vaccine approvals. He is now watching for the company to show incremental improvement in its upcoming earnings report to confirm that business is rebounding. 

""Going back a year ago, quarterly earnings were basically irrelevant,"" he said. ""Now we want to see that there's progress on the timetable to get revenues back to where they were in a meaningful way.""

The 28 filings for new special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) underscore their growing appeal on Wall Street. SPACs raised a record $82 billion last year, and the trend has gathered further steam in the early weeks of 2021.
Overall, 144 SPACs have raised $45.7 billion so far this year, according to data from SPAC Research, with backers including high-profile investors, politicians and sports personalities.
Starwood Capital Group's CEO Barry Sternlicht's Jaws Juggernaut Acquisition Corp filed for an IPO of up to $200 million on Friday. Other notable investors that launched SPACS included serial entrepreneur and billionaire Richard Branson and former BuzzFeed Chairman Ken Lerer.
Friday's filings count more than doubled a previous record of 13 deals on Feb. 5, SPAC Research said. 
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an IPO to merge with a privately held company that then becomes publicly traded as a result. 

SPACs have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds that will be raised.

793,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 06:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Google's $76 million deal with French publishers leaves many outlets infuriated,"By Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google has agreed to pay $76 million over three years to a group of 121 French news publishers to end a more than year-long copyright spat, documents seen by Reuters show.
The agreement between Google and the Alliance de la presse d'information generale (APIG), a lobby group representing most major French publishers, was announced previously, but financial terms had not been disclosed. 
The move infuriated many other French outlets, which deemed it unfair and opaque. Publishers in other countries will scrutinize the French agreement, the highest-profile in the world under Google's new program to provide compensation for news snippets used in search results. 
Agence France-Presse (AFP) and other French news providers that do not belong to the group are not part of the agreement and are pressing forward with various actions against Google.
The accord follows France's implementation of the first copyright rule enacted under a recent European Union law that creates ""neighbouring rights,"" requiring large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content.
In Australia, lawmakers have drafted legalisation that would require Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to pay publishers and broadcasters for content. Google has threatened to shut down its search engine in Australia if the country adopts that approach, which the company called ""unworkable."" 
The French documents seen by Reuters include a framework agreement in which Google will pay $22 million annually for three years to a group of 121 national and local French news publications after signing individual licensing agreements with each. 
The second document is a settlement agreement under which Google agrees to pay $10 million to the same group in exchange for the publishers' commitment not to sue over copyright claims for three years.
Publishers would commit to an upcoming new product called Google News Showcase that would allow publishers to curate content and provide limited access to paywalled stories.
Google declined to comment on terms of the deal. 
In January, the Reuters news agency, a division of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp, struck a deal with Google to be the first global news provider to Google News Showcase.
Reuters' French rival AFP has maintained its complaint with the French antitrust watchdog against Google, an internal source said. Last month, AFP's Chief Executive Fabrice Fries welcomed the deal between Google and APIG, but called on the tech company to extend such copyright deals to news agencies. 
MAKING GOOGLE PAY
Pressure is mounting on Google globally to pay for news content, as the industry's advertising and revenues have plummeted with the rise of digital platforms.
In Spain and Germany, publishers have tried but failed to charge Google for displaying excerpts, or snippets. German publishers lost a legal battle in 2019 for 1 billion euros worth of copyright fees since 2013.
The text of the EU ""neighbouring rights"" rule was aimed at creating a new sustainable stream of revenues for news publishers.
In the United States, the news industry is backing legislation that would allow it to negotiate collectively with the big platforms without violating antitrust law. In Congress, lawmakers recently issued a report saying dominant tech firms have harmed the news industry because they ""can impose unilateral terms on publishers, such as take-it-or-leave-it revenue sharing agreements."" 
Andrew MacLeod, chief executive of Canada's Postmedia, said publishers there are watching discussions in other parts of the world. ""We seek an outcome to grow and architect our future rather than relying on a handout.”
LACKING TRANSPARENCY
French publishers had little choice but to go along with the deal, three sources close to the matter, citing pressures from shareholders. 
The same sources said some publishers were upset Google refused to provide access to data showing how much money it generates from news.
""These opaque agreements don't ensure the fair treatment of all news publishers, since the calculation formula isn't made public,"" the union for independent online news publishers Spiil said this week. ""Google took advantage of our divisions to advance its interests."" 
Fees range from as large as $1.3 million for France's reference daily Le Monde to $13,741 for local publisher La Voix de la Haute Marne, documents show. They did not specify how the amounts were calculated.
Leading national dailies Le Monde, Le Figaro and Liberation and their groups negotiated about 3 million euros ($3.6 million) each per year on top of the fee in the agreement, notably by agreeing in November to sell subscriptions through Google, one source close to the matter said.
The head of Le Monde group Louis Dreyfus and Liberation's boss Denis Olivennes declined to comment. Representatives for Le Figaro were not immediately available for comment. 
The head of APIG, Pierre Louette, did not respond to messages seeking comment.

794,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 06:10PM ET</span>",U.S. tells G7 that it is back at the table to help with global recovery,"By David Lawder and William Schomberg
WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration told allies on Friday it was re-engaging with them to help steer the global economy out of its worst slump since the Great Depression, a contrast with the go-it-alone approach of Donald Trump.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told her peers from the Group of Seven rich democracies that Washington was committed to multilateralism and ""places a high priority on deepening our international engagement and strengthening our alliances.""
Yellen spoke to the G7 in a virtual video meeting, chaired by Britain, at which she called for continued fiscal support to secure the recovery, saying ""the time to go big is now.""
Britain said officials discussed giving help to workers and businesses hit by the pandemic while ensuring sustainability of public finances ""in the long term.""
As well as the United States and Britain, the G7 includes Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada. 
Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said the group had committed to continuing coordinated action to support the economy. ""The withdrawal of policy support is premature,"" he wrote on Twitter. 
Biden has proposed a further $1.9 trillion in spending and tax cuts on top of more than $4 trillion of coronavirus relief measures enacted by his predecessor Trump. 
British finance minister Rishi Sunak is expected to say next month that he will extend his economic rescue programs and that reining in public finances will have to be addressed later.
Britain said G7 officials also agreed that making progress on reaching ""an international solution to the tax challenges of the digital economy"" was a key priority.
Countries have been trying to revive attempts at a global approach to taxing giant digital firms - many of them American, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google - after progress was blocked by Trump's administration.
Britain called on G7 countries to agree a joint approach to taxing internet giants by mid-2021, a deadline agreed by the wider Group of 20 nations.
NEW IMF RESOURCES 
Some G7 countries are keen to back a new issuance of the International Monetary Fund's own currency, known as special drawing rights (SDRs), to help low-income countries hit by the coronavirus crisis, a step last taken in 2009.
Officials from the United States, the IMF's biggest shareholder, had signaled they were open to a new issuance of $500 billion, sources said on Thursday - another Biden shift away from Trump administration opposition.
A G7 source, who asked not to be named, said the United States told other countries it needed a few weeks to finalize the SDR increase.
The move is politically tricky for Yellen because it would provide new resources to all IMF members, including rich countries, China, and U.S. adversaries such as Iran and Venezuela, drawing Republican opposition.
""Over the last year, the G7 has not even spoken about special drawing rights, so considering that was part of this agenda, it certainly is progress,"" said Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a charity group that focuses on reducing poverty. ""In terms of getting to a strong global stimulus, SDRs have to be a part of the equation.""
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva did not mention SDRs in a tweet about the meeting, but said that G7 members were in ""full alignment"" on vaccines, fiscal stimulus, climate and ""comprehensive support for vulnerable countries.""
Sunak called on private creditors to give debt help to the poorest countries and said climate change and nature preservation would be priorities for Britain's G7 presidency. Britain is due to host the first in-person summit of G7 leaders in nearly two years in June. 
Yellen said the G7 should expect to see the U.S. Treasury's engagement on climate change to ""change dramatically relative to the last four years.""

The Treasury declined comment on a Wall Street Journal report that Yellen is considering Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy Treasury secretary, for a new high-level climate ""czar"" position at the department.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 05:35PM ET</span>",U.S. senators prod Biden administration on Nord Stream 2 pipeline sanctions,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators urged President Joe Biden to ensure the implementation of sanctions passed in January aimed at stopping the Nord Stream 2 Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline project, which a State Department spokesman reiterated on Friday was a ""bad deal"" for Europe. 
Senators Jim Risch, a Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, urged the State Department not to delay issuing a report to Congress required under sanctions passed in the annual defense policy bill, which they said was due by Feb. 16.
The report will identify companies involved in constructing, insuring and verifying Nord Stream 2. The law requires the sanctions to be imposed on the companies listed. 
""We look forward to working with you to bring an end to this dangerous project,"" the senators said in the letter, according to a copy seen by Reuters.
The letter made reference to ""press reports that the German government has put forth an offer that would require the United States to disregard statutorily-mandated sanctions,"" without giving details. Reuters has not confirmed the reports.
Russian state gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) is racing to finish the $11 billion project to bring natural gas to Europe via Germany ahead of the implementation of further U.S. sanctions. The company expects the project to be completed this year.
Work on the project stopped for a year after Washington imposed sanctions in late 2019.
Nord Stream 2 is more than 90% complete but requires additional tricky work in deep waters of the Baltic Sea off Denmark, where unexploded World War Two bombs lie on the seabed. 
The United States, which has opposed the project since the days of former President Barack Obama, says the project would increase Russian President Vladimir Putin's economic and political influence over Europe. 
The pipeline would avoid Ukraine, Slovakia and other countries, depriving them of lucrative transit fees. 
The project has become even more politicized after Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who was poisoned in August in Siberia and flown to Germany for treatment, was imprisoned by Russia last week.
The Trump administration pushed U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as an alternative for Europe to Russian gas. Russia, Germany and Nord Stream 2, a consortium of Gazprom and several Western companies, say the project is purely about commerce. 
'DIVIDES EUROPE'
The State Department has not said when it will put out the report. 
""It's a bad deal because it divides Europe, it exposes Ukraine and Central Europe to Russian manipulation, it goes against Europe's own stated energy and security goals,"" Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, told reporters.
But Price said ""sanctions are only one"" of many tools and that the department will work closely with allies and partners to reinforce European energy security and to safeguard against ""predatory behavior"".
Asked whether the department intends to meet the Feb. 16 deadline, Price said it is committed to engagement with Congress to ensure lawmakers ""have the information they need in as timely a manner as we are able to provide"". 
Backers of Nord Stream 2 sanctions said Congress would continue pushing the administration on the issue.
Several companies, including Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF), one of 20 insurers in a consortium backing the pipeline, have already dropped out of the project fearing U.S. sanctions.

""Congress knows who these companies are and will push back if they aren't included"" in the report, said Daniel Vajdich, president of Yorktown Solutions, a lobbying group.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 05:05PM ET</span>",Analysis: How McDonald's plans to bring back traffic with new cheaper chicken sandwiches,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) rolls out its new crispy chicken sandwich line on Feb. 24, it will swap out a higher-priced premium chicken sandwich from its menu, the company confirmed to Reuters. 
McDonald's three new sandwiches – all with a larger fillet and new potato bun – will start at $3.49 and top out at roughly $4.69, depending on the region, according to a U.S. franchisee who spoke on the condition of anonymity and a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst.
Soon to disappear from the menu: the more expensive Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which usually costs around $5.
McDonald's menu swap follows several years of declining customer traffic at its U.S. locations. The last year in which guest visits rose was 2017, when they increased by 1%, according to annual financial filings. 
The pricing strategies illustrate how the world's biggest restaurant brand stands to make more money selling higher quantities of a cheaper product than lower quantities of a more expensive one.
That scheme has long helped McDonald's beat competitors and is especially relevant as millions of Americans remain out of work because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Amid a consumer frenzy for chicken, McDonald's forthcoming sandwiches represent one of its most significant menu changes since it switched the Quarter Pounder to fresh beef in 2018. 
The company has said the sandwiches are precursors to even more new chicken items as McDonald's looks to regain customers who flipped to Popeyes, a unit of Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc , and Chick-fil-A. Both rivals charge about $3.99 for their fried chicken sandwiches. 
Kentucky Fried Chicken will switch to a new chicken sandwich nationally by the end of February.
McDonald's suggested price is a ""very solid defensive play,"" especially for a low-priced brand, said restaurant marketing consultant Chas Hermann. 
McDonald's ""can't go out at $3.99 and think they're going to move anybody back"" to their restaurants, he said.
If successful, the new sandwiches could help boost sales at an average location by as much as 4.2%, according to Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman.  
An average McDonald's location is currently selling about 50 Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwiches per day, she said.  
But McDonald's stores are expected to sell between 100 and 150 of the new sandwiches daily, or even more, according to Silberman and the franchisee. 
The company said pricing will differ by region and location and is influenced by various market conditions. 
Many McDonald's franchisees turn to consulting firm Deloitte for advice on how to set optimal pricing. 
For example, the franchisee told Reuters that Deloitte recommended a price of $3.69 for the spicy and crispy versions and $4.29 for the deluxe. But the person, who declined to be named, said they will mark up the menu price because of higher minimum wages in the area, and that they plan to charge $3.99 and $4.69 instead. 
As prices rise, customer visits sometimes fall. 

Customer checks at fast-food restaurants rose more than 3% year over year in 2018 and 2019, then shot up 10.5% in 2020, in part because the pandemic prompted people to place larger family-sized orders. The data, from Black Box Intelligence, does not show how much of the increase is from larger order sizes versus higher prices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq set record closing highs on Friday as investors bought energy, financial and materials shares and sold big tech stocks in anticipation of new fiscal aid from Washington to help the U.S. economy recover. 
The major indices traded in a tight range during the week in which investors rotated out of growth-oriented stocks that have dominated an almost year-long rally and bought cyclical and under-priced value stocks.
The S&P energy, financials and materials sectors rose on expectations they will benefit from a reopened economy, while heavyweights Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) were lower most of the session. All three closed higher in a late market surge.
Value and cyclicals outperform in a rising interest rate, higher-growth environment, which the U.S. economy is on the cusp of entering, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
""We're under-estimating the lag effect of all the money in the system as more and more vaccinations are delivered and as more of the country reopens"" from business shutdowns, he said.
""We are continuing this rotation that would be consistent with the new business cycle, and as (bond) yields go up, value and cyclicals will lead,"" Hayes said. 
The Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, closed below 20 for first time since February 2020.
A sharp drop in new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks have helped drive markets to new highs, though a near-term pullback could occur from the new coronavirus variants and potential snags in vaccine distributions.
The latest data showed U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in early February as households were still worried about the economy despite expectations for additional stimulus.
A Reuters poll showed the U.S. economy is expected to reach pre-COVID-19 levels within a year as the proposed $1.9 trillion fiscal bill helps boost economic activity, but employment will likely take more than a year to fully recover.
U.S. President Joe Biden turned to a bipartisan group of local officials for support on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan to help millions of unemployed workers and for schools to reopen.
The Lipper data late on Thursday showed U.S.-based stock funds attracted $22.9 billion in the week to Wednesday, the largest weekly inflow since March 2008.
U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday for the Presidents Day holiday.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.27 billion shares.

Bumble, backed by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, was valued at $15.69 billion on Friday, with its stock price nearly doubling from the initial public offering price of $43 per share, underscoring investor's insatiable appetite for tech shares in a buoyant U.S. equities market.
Wolfe Herd owns 21.5 million shares in Bumble, equating to a 11.6% stake, regulatory filings showed.
With the blockbuster IPO, Wolfe Herd, 31, became the youngest female CEO to ever take a company public as she rang the opening bell from Bumble's Austin-based offices with her one-year-old son by her side.
The women-first approach has set Bumble apart in a competitive online dating market, Wolfe Herd told Reuters on Thursday. 
Bumble users are more likely to pay for premium offerings to have a deeper level of connection or a different approach to connection, said Wolfe Herd, listing offering incognito mode as a popular feature for people to browse others' profile while being anonymous.
Wolfe Herd, who graduated with a degree in International Studies from the Southern Methodist University's Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, launched the Bumble app in 2014.
Wolfe Herd is also a co-founder of rival app Tinder, which she later sued, alleging that her co-founders subjected her to sexual harassment. Tinder parent  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH), which denied the allegations, paid about $1 million to settle the dispute.

Bumble's shares were up 13.5% in afternoon trade on Friday, after rising as much as 20.6% to $84.8 earlier in the session.

 Cabot Oil & Gas  (NYSE:COG), Hess (NYSE:HES), and Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) were among the biggest gainers, with the latter closing up nearly 4%.
Financials also participated in the broader climb in cyclicals, with bank stocks in the ascendency led by a 2% gain  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) thanks to ongoing expectations for stronger stimulus-led recovery that has boosted U.S. bond yields.
The recent jump in bond yields, however, has stoked some investor concern about whether rising rates will siphon away investment dollars from stocks. But experts stress that it is too early as yields still remain well off their prior year highs.
""If you think about where the rates have been over the past four decades … They have been on a continuously downward trajectory and from an investor's point of view if you're looking to add something that can generate income into your portfolio, you don't get a whole lot from that market [bonds] just yet,"" Johan Grahn, Head of ETF Strategy at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management said in an interview with Investing.com.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it was not currently planning to require people to take COVID-19 tests before domestic airline flights after the prospects of new rules raised serious concerns among U.S. airlines, unions and some lawmakers.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a briefing on Friday that ""reports that there is an intention to put in place new requirements, such as testing, are not accurate.""
Psaki spoke after the chief executives of major U.S. airlines, including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and United Airlines, met virtually with White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last month the agency was ""actively looking"" at expanding mandatory COVID-19 testing to U.S. domestic flights.
The CDC on Jan. 26 began requiring negative COVID-19 tests or evidence of recovery from the disease from nearly all U.S.-bound international passengers aged 2 and older.
Any CDC order would first need to be drafted and then reviewed by other federal agencies in the Biden administration, including the White House. 
The White House and officials told Reuters this week that no formal order had been circulated and that officials were not expected to endorse requiring negative COVID-19 tests before domestic flights, but added that decision could change at a later date.
""We had a very positive, constructive conversation focused on our shared commitment to science-based policies as we work together to end the pandemic, restore air travel and lead our nation toward recovery,"" Nick Calio, chief executive of the Airlines for America industry group, said in a statement after the meeting on Friday.
The White House has a separate interagency meeting scheduled for later Friday to discuss coronavirus issues. 
The meeting of airline CEOs, Zients and other administration officials involved in COVID-19 issues came after the industry strongly objected to the possibility of requiring COVID-19 testing before domestic flights.
Southwest Airlines warned such a requirement could put jobs at risk and a major aviation union said it could lead to airline bankruptcies.
One idea that has been under serious consideration is for the CDC to issue recommendations advising against travel to specific areas of the United States with high COVID-19 caseloads, although those travel recommendations would not be binding, officials said.

The CDC currently has a broad recommendation discouraging all non-essential air travel.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for two men accused of helping former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee Japan while awaiting trial on financial charges have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and delay their extradition.
Lawyers for U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, asked the court on an emergency basis to put on hold a lower court order that cleared the way for them to be extradited.
The Taylor's lawyers in a late Thursday filing reiterated arguments that their clients could not be prosecuted in Japan for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that, if extradited, they faced the prospect of relentless interrogations and torture.
A federal appeals court in Boston declined earlier Thursday to issue an order preventing the Taylors' extradition while they appealed lower-court rulings. The U.S. State Department approved their extradition in October.
""The very least the U.S. courts owe the petitioners is a full chance to litigate these issues, including exercising their appellate rights, before they are consigned to the fate that awaits them at the hands of the Japanese government,"" defense lawyers wrote.
The U.S. Justice Department had said the men could be turned over to Japan as early as Friday. But U.S. authorities now say the hand off will not happen while their request to the Supreme Court is pending, said defense lawyer Paul Kelly.
The Justice Department declined to comment beyond saying it was aware of the Supreme Court filing.
The Taylors were arrested in May at Japan's request after being charged with helping Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he had engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.

Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, received $1.3 million for their services.

(Reuters) - Republican members of the U.S. Senate's Banking Committee on Friday urged securities regulators to reject corporate diversity rules proposed by Nasdaq Inc.
In a letter to the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Republicans said the effort by the exchange operator to set boardroom diversity requirements for listed companies would interfere with boards' duties to their shareholders, violate securities disclosure principles and could impose costs on companies.
""While we think America’s corporations benefit from boards that avoid groupthink and offer a diversity of perspectives and commend firms that look to increase diversity among their boards, we do not think NASDAQ should be using its quasi-regulatory authority to impose social policies,"" stated the letter, signed by Pat Toomey, the committee's top Republican, and 11 other senators.
On Dec. 1 Nasdaq outlined rules that, if approved by the SEC, would require listed companies on its U.S. exchange to disclose boardroom diversity statistics and to have at least two diverse directors, including one woman, or explain why they do not.

The proposal comes as part of a broader debate about a lack of diversity among top U.S. executives. Among the top 200 companies in the S&P 500, African-Americans held only about 10% of board seats and Hispanic or Latino people held only 4% of board seats, a study last year found - representation below their respective shares of the U.S. population of 13% and 19%.
The lack of self-reported disclosure by corporate directors has complicated efforts to increase those numbers, partly by making it difficult for investors to measure boardroom representation.
Asked about the Republican's letter, Nasdaq spokesman Joe Christinat said that ""Our proposal is a market-led solution that should simplify and standardize disclosure requirements to avoid the type of regulatory overreach the critics fear.""

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Friday sued New York's attorney general to stop the state from filing its own lawsuit over the online retailer's early response to COVID-19, including its firing of activist Christian Smalls.
In a complaint in Brooklyn federal court, Amazon accused Attorney General Letitia James of overstepping her bounds by threatening to sue unless it met several demands including surrendering some profit and slowing down operations.
Amazon said federal labor and safety laws take precedence over New York's, and is seeking an injunction to block James from suing.
The Seattle-based retailer had drawn scrutiny 10 months ago when workers protested conditions at a Staten Island warehouse, and Amazon fired Smalls for violating a paid quarantine.
James said at the time that Amazon may have broken the law. New York City announced its own probe, and senators questioned Amazon's actions.
In a statement, James said she is still reviewing her legal options.
She called Amazon's lawsuit ""a sad attempt to distract from the facts and shirk accountability for its failures to protect hardworking employees from a deadly virus. Let me be clear: We will not be intimidated by anyone, especially corporate bullies that put profits over the health and safety of working people.""
It is rare for companies to file preemptive lawsuits to short-circuit threatened regulatory actions.
The lawsuit shows Amazon's belief it was unfairly maligned despite its many COVID-19 precautions, most recently tests and plans for vaccine administration, and how it will not back down from criticism of its workplace conditions.
According to the lawsuit, Amazon passed an unannounced city inspection of its Staten Island facility on March 30, 2020, the day of the protest, with the lead inspector concluding that complaints about safety were ""completely baseless.""
Amazon also accused James of ignoring evidence of its safety-related reasons for acting against Smalls, including photos of him not social distancing.

Smalls has said he would keep protesting until workers were protected. In November, he filed a class action lawsuit seeking damages for Black and Hispanic workers.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>",Florida consumers 'flabbergasted' as property insurers push for double-digit rate hikes,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Florida property insurers are jacking up rates by double-digit percentages, blaming the hikes on lingering damage from past hurricanes, a wave of litigation, and a law that encourages lawyers to sue by allowing courts to award them big fees. 
The rate increases in Florida, the third-largest property insurance market among U.S. states, are the highest in memory, according to some insurance agents and residents. One danger, they say, is that the new rates could make owning a home in Florida unaffordable.
""I was flabbergasted,"" said Karlos Horn, a 35-year-old law student who owns a four-bedroom, single-family home in Hendry County, Florida. He said his premium doubled to $200 per month last August.
That is equivalent to half of his $400 mortgage payment and the largest increase in his five years as an owner.
Florida's property insurance market, which collected $56.6 billion in premiums during 2019, is unique and covers complex risks including devastating hurricanes and the impact of climate change. Many insurers left the state after suffering big losses from hurricanes Katrina and Wilma in 2005, leaving about 60 small and mid-sized firms underwriting property policies there today.
Although there were no major weather events last year, some insurers are still grappling with claims from Hurricane Irma in 2017, said Logan McFaddin, an American Property Casualty Insurance Association executive who specializes in Florida.
They are also facing what McFaddin described as “out of control” litigation in Florida, partly because of a law that can require insurers to pay attorneys “excessive fees” in those cases. The practice has spurred a cottage industry of contractors and lawyers who sue insurers to replace a whole roof when only a few tiles are damaged, insurers say.
Other less dramatic problems, such as leaky pipes, happen at an ""abnormally high"" frequency in Florida, often causing severe damage, including mold, consistently gnawing at profits, said Charles Williamson, chief executive officer of Vault, a Florida-based insurance exchange for wealthy individuals. 
Insurers are also passing along to consumers the cost of hefty rate hikes for their own coverage, known as reinsurance, which kicks in after insurers pay a set amount of claims.
INSURER OF LAST RESORT
Florida's domestic property insurers reported a more than $1 billion underwriting loss for the first three quarters of 2020 and almost $500 million in negative net income, according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.
""Insurance carriers understand that their role in our marketplace is to pay claims,"" Florida Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier told Reuters. ""The challenge is when those claims are so much more expensive than they expect, it creates uncertainty, it creates turmoil - and that has to be addressed.""
Florida insurers requested 105 rate increases during the first ten months of 2020, Altmaier said. More than half of the increases that regulators approved were greater than 10%.
Last month, Altmaier testified before Florida lawmakers, including his views on roofing litigation. ""We need to really spend some time on this ... coming up with ways that we might be able to mitigate this kind of activity,"" he said.
Lee Gorodetsky, an insurance agent in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said he cannot recall such steep rate hikes during his 34-year career. ""The last two years have been the worst we've seen,"" he said.
As prices rise, more consumers are turning to Citizens Property Insurance Corp, Florida's insurer of last resort, which takes on high-risk customers who cannot obtain other insurance or must pay extremely high rates.
Citizens issued 545,000 policies as of Feb. 5, a 23% increase from a year ago, and it expects the number to grow to about 700,000 by year-end, a spokesman said. The growth signals an unhealthy broader market by showing that typical coverage is not as widely available, industry experts said. 
Insurers are hoping Florida’s state government will approve proposed legislation that would curb the elevated litigation costs they have seen in recent years. The bill, if passed, would add to other reforms enacted in 2019.
Measures would include limiting the fees insurers must pay lawyers in claims disputes, shortening time frames for filing claims and capping payouts for roof replacements.
However, the bill might also harm homeowners' ability to pursue legitimate claims, lawyers said. That would unfairly favor insurers, one lawyer said.
""It's a great business model that insurers can collect premiums and not get sued when they don't pay somebody right away everything that's owed,"" said Tampa lawyer Chip Merlin, who represents policyholders. ""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that that's good for the insurance industry.""

(This story refiles to correct 12th paragraph to show that more than half of rate increases that regulators approved were greater than 10%, not that regulators approved only about 10% of increase requests.)

810,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>",SoftBank-backed Coupang reveals revenue surge ahead of U.S. IPO,"(Reuters) - South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Inc, backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, on Friday filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange, hoping to cash in on strong demand for high-growth tech stocks as it reported a near-doubling of annual revenue and narrowing losses.
Coupang is aiming for a valuation of around $50 billion in its U.S. initial public offering (IPO), according to a person familiar with the matter.
This would make it the largest IPO in New York by a company based outside the United States since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding in 2014, Dealogic data showed. 
Founded in 2010 by Harvard graduate Bom Kim, Coupang made a splash in Korea with its 'Rocket Delivery' service, which promised delivery within 24 hours, shaking family-owned retail conglomerates such as Shinsegae and Lotte. 
Coupang was valued at $9 billion in its last private fundraising round in 2018, according to data provider PitchBook. 
In a regulatory filing, Coupang said total revenue jumped 91% in 2020 to $11.97 billion, while net losses narrowed to $474.9 million from $698.8 million. 
The company, viewed as a rival in South Korea to e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), received $1 billion in funding from SoftBank in 2015 and $2 billion from its Vision Fund in 2018.
Coupang's other investors include BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and billionaire investor Bill Ackman. 
The U.S. IPO market is at its strongest in more than two decades, and investors are flocking to buy shares in technology companies that have benefited during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Coupang plans to list under the symbol ""CPNG"". It has yet to provide a target asking price for its shares. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Allen & Co, JP Morgan, BofA Securities and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are among the underwriters.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Friday, but were still on track for their highest ever weekly close against a backdrop of an improving public health picture and a $1.9 trillion stimulus package grinding its way through Congress without much dilution. 
Stocks are also being supported by a broadly supportive earnings season. According to Refinitiv data, earnings per share for the S&P 500 is expected to have risen some 3.4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, despite all the headwinds from the global pandemic. Excluding the energy sector, earnings growth is an even more respectable 7.3%. Still, the mood music from the economic data on Friday was downbeat, with the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment index falling by more than expected to its lowest level since October.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15 points, or less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was down by fractionally more and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%. 
Among individual stocks,  Bumble  Inc (NASDAQ:BMBL) stock rose 4.0% on its second day of trading after a stellar debut for the dating site. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock, however, failed to build on its premarket momentum after posting a return to profit in the three months through December. It fell 0.7%
Elsewhere, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock tumbled after the company said it had delayed its latest test spaceflight. Another upsurge on speculation around Apple's purported ambitions in electric cars pushed battery technology group Quantumscape's (NYSE:QS) stock up 16%, its biggest move since a spike at the end of December. The same factor weighed on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which fell 1.7%, below the $800 mark for the first time in two weeks.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) initiated coverage of both Quantumscape and EV specialist Fisker at Buy on Friday, with analyst Adam Jonas' $70 target for the former more than 55% above its Thursday closing level. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was down 0.9%.
Volatility in cannabis stocks continued, with Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock rising 7.9% after two straight heavy falls, while Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) stock was down 6.5%. Aurora Cannabis  (TSX:ACB) was down 3.9% was while  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) stock rose 1.6%.
The sector has been the latest to attract the attention of an army of retail investors congregated on social media. Most have enjoyed handsome gains since election day in November, when a number of down-ballot liberalization measures at state level were passed. The Democrats' subsequent gain of the Senate has also made sweeping federal reform more likely, while a liberalization law in Mexico got its first hearing in parliament two days ago."
815,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 09:40AM ET</span>","Fed eyes trouble in commercial real estate, corporate debt in 2021 stress tests","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday unveiled the hypothetical recession it plans to test large banks against in its 2021 stress tests, which includes ""substantial stress"" in the commercial real estate and corporate debt markets.
The scenarios also envision a global recession where U.S. unemployment jumps to 10.75%, economic growth falls by 4%, and the stock market sheds 55% of its value. Nineteen of the nation's largest banks will be subject to this year's test, with results published sometime in the summer.
“The banking sector has provided critical support to the economic recovery over the past year. Although uncertainty remains, this stress test will give the public additional information on its resilience,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said in a statement. 
The 2021 test will mark a return to normalcy for the Fed, which resorted to testing banks twice last year after it became clear the economic impact from the coronavirus pandemic had actually exceeded the severe downturn envisioned by the Fed's original test.
But after both tests, the Fed said that it found the largest banks remained well-capitalized despite severe downturns, and in December it relaxed restrictions on capital payouts like stock buybacks.

The upcoming test will apply to 19 of the nation's largest banks, although smaller firms that are now tested on a two-year cycle could opt into this year's test if they so choose. Ten of the banks with the largest trading operations will also be tested against a hypothetical global market shock, while 12 of the firms with significant trading or processing operations will also be tested against the failure of their largest counterparty to test their resilience.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 08:35AM ET</span>","Analysis: Pawz and UFOs: Thematic ETFs boom, drawing punters and concern","By Saikat Chatterjee and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - From cat food to cannabis, it's boom time for quirky ETFs offering the chance to punt on niche themes in fast-growth sectors, but their huge gains are unnerving some who see them as another price-inflated asset that may threaten market stability.
While Reddit ""gamestonks"" have grabbed recent headlines, retail investors are also credited with large flows into exchange-traded funds - basically a tradable basket of shares - swelling their assets by more than $1 trillion last year, according to Refinitiv.
And growth has been especially notable in ETFs that aim to harness returns from themes that capitalise on societal and economic trends, from space travel to pet care, and marijuana to medical tech.
Such ETFs, which are bought and sold like shares, more than doubled their assets under management last year to $140 billion, Citi analyst Scott Chronert says, describing inflows as having gone ""nearly parabolic"". 
Thematic ETFs in EMEA alone have received $4 billion so far this year, according to the bank, a figure Chronert said would grow ""as investors continue to demand more precise positioning"".
The prominent ARK Innovation ETF, containing business disruptors Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), payments firm Square and genome editor Crispr Therapeutics, is up 350% since last March, while the Procure Space and ProShares Pet Care ETFs have also seen scintillating price gains.
The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NYSE:XLE) has risen 275% meanwhile, and cannabis-themed ETFs have enjoyed a bumper ride on a view the new U.S. administration will decriminalise the drug.
Graphics: Thematic ETFs on fast growing sectors surge - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/qmyvmwozxvr/Pasted%20image%201613056847961.png
eToro said it had seen an increase of over 400% in the opening of ETF positions globally on its platform last year, part of an overall trend of ""tremendous growth"" in retail investing.
""It is easier to invest in themes than particular stocks or broader indices and so tech disruptors, gaming, biotech, have become very popular with retail investors,"" said Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of consultancy ETFGI.
That's despite higher fees -- filings show the Ark Innovation ETF charges 0.75% versus 0.04% at Blackrock (NYSE:BLK)'s core S&P 500 index ETF.
Thematic ETFs are still a tiny part of the $8 trillion Exchange Traded Products industry. So why are some investors warning of stability risks? 
Some of it is down to what short-seller Carson Block, founder of Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Capital, calls the ""autopilot"" model of passive investing - buying more of a stock as its price rises and its index weight grows.
But when outflows hit, the ETF provider must sell shares to meet redemptions, potentially setting off a chain reaction as the share price falls. That passive selling could ""quickly overwhelm the market"" Block warned in an FT column this week.
The risk may be magnified in thematic ETFs which focus on just a handful of names. ARK Invest, which owns the Ark Innovation ETF, for instance owns more than 10% of outstanding shares in some companies, particularly biotech, Saxo Bank analysts note.
Ark Invest was not immediately available to comment.
Sebastien Lemaire, head of ETF Research at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) also says the pace of inflows could be concerning. 
""Some of these ETFs which have seen record inflows are quite concentrated on a relatively limited number of constituents.""
Any reversal, caused by ETFs tweaking holdings due to investor outflows or index rebalancing, could hammer the share price of smaller constituents with lower trading volumes.
Within the ARK Innovation ETF, daily January trading volumes in streaming platform  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc and virtual healthcare provider Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) averaged roughly three million shares and 500,000 shares respectively, well below the eight million units for the underlying ETF.
And holdings also overlap across funds. Tesla features in no less than 27 thematic ETFs, Citi notes, while chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) turns up in 45.
Thematic ETFs continue to mushroom, with 17 launched in Europe last year, while U.S. ETF specialist Global X launched six worldwide, focusing on sectors from gaming to telemedicine according to fund research firm Morningstar.
The concentration of risk may be even more extreme in ""three times long, three times short"" exchange traded strategies, where gains -- or losses -- can be three times the share performance. 
UK-based Graniteshares, which offers 3x long, 3x short exposure to 10 U.S. tech stocks and 10 UK blue chips, says $40,000 invested in its Tesla 3x long exchange traded product at its July 2020 launch would now be worth $1 million. 
Morningstar, while acknowledging recent dazzling returns, said its research shows thematic funds ""have historically struggled to survive and outperform global equity benchmarks over longer periods of time"".

It's the Lunar Year of the Ox. Since the same Chinese character can be used to denote a bull, some investors might see that as a good omen for world markets.
Higher bond yields could spoil the party at some point, but for now equity markets are charging on, not least in Asia, where Japan's Nikkei is at three-decade highs and Chinese blue-chip stocks a whisker off 2007 peaks. European and U.S. shares have rallied 50% and 80% respectively from March 2020 lows.
Markets are oiled, of course, by plentiful monetary and fiscal stimulus. But if vaccine rollouts and falling COVID case loads unleash pent-up consumer demand, economic recovery will follow. Those hopes have lifted copper, a reliable growth barometer, to eight-year highs.
Recovery won't be smooth, but then, oxen are reputed to be strong and patient. In China, too, they are having to be patient -- pandemic-linked curbs exclude the usual high-spending week- long holiday with travel and parties. Hopefully, next year.

2/CAPITOL HILL 
    Wall Street has been fixated on GameStop (NYSE:GME) and the retail trading frenzy unfolding on Reddit forums.
But on Thursday, action moves to Capitol Hill, when executives from companies at the center of the action - Robinhood, Melvin Capital and Citadel Securities - are expected to testify before a House panel https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=407107 exploring the trading turmoil.
    It could be the first of several investigations to uncover what happened when retail traders sent shares in otherwise nondescript companies like GameStop ""to the moon"", squeezing out hedge funds that had gone short on those companies.
For those who lost money or made fortunes from the ""stonks"", the hearings will be riveting. GameStop shares, meanwhile, have dramatically deflated, while short interest https://www.datawrapper.de/_/DkfMh- a measure of shares on loan - has slumped.

3/BANKING FOR BRITAIN 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) kicks off the reporting season for Britain's banks when it announces 2020 results on Feb. 18.
Investors want to see how loan books are holding up as the pandemic plays out. Government support schemes such as mortgage holidays and furloughs have largely deferred the pain, and with banks having taken hefty provisions already, the market is not expecting much deterioration in balance sheets. 
Lenders with investment banking arms, including Barclays and HSBC, could report a strong 2020, as they benefited from pandemic-induced market volatility. Analysts will question banks on when they will restore largely abandoned profitability targets and may renew calls for dividends to be resumed.
    Barclays is followed by NatWest on Feb. 19. HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) report on Feb. 23, 24 and 25 respectively.

Bonds have a track record of getting it right on the economy, so pay attention to what they say.
U.S., German and UK 30-year yields are up 20 to 30 basis points this year. Even Swiss 30-year yields have risen toward 0%, up 21 bps in 2021 so far. 
Okay, yields remain super low and not a sign of any inflation surge. But if the moves are a signal that extreme pessimism on the economy is abating, it will be a relief for policymakers. 
The reflation focus may increase bond markets' sensitivity to economic data. Flash PMIs, due on Feb. 19 across major economies, have taken a back seat lately. That may change.

820,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",Stock Funds See Biggest Inflows Ever as BofA Warns Top Is Near,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors poured a record amount of money into equity funds, especially technology stocks, prompting strategists at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). to warn that the exuberance may precede a correction.
Stock funds had inflows of $58 billion in the week through Feb. 10, led by investments into U.S. equities and the tech sector, according to BofA and EPFR Global data. Market players pulled almost $11 billion from cash funds and about $800 million from gold, while bonds got a $13 billion inflow, according to the Feb. 11 note.
BofA’s gauge of market sentiment-- the so-called Bull & Bear indicator-- is approaching levels of extreme bullishness, which can trigger a sell signal that hasn’t been set off since January 2018, according to the note. Since 2000, the median three-month return for global equities has been a 9% loss following 12 such sell signals, BofA strategists led by Michael Hartnett said.
The weekly flows data comes as global equities are trading near record highs, prompting some investors to consider whether it’s worth staying in the market or taking some profits. Powerful stimulus measures across the world, low bond yields as well as optimism that vaccination measures can lead to a reopening of major economies have strongly buoyed risk assets.
Seasonal patterns may also heighten the risk of a short-term pullback. Nomura quantitative strategist Masanari Takada today warned that the second half of February tends to see technical trimming of positions by speculative investors. He added that any market dip is likely to be “brief and shallow,” with the S&P 500 possibly falling about 5% from current levels to 3,725.
Region-wise, BofA’s report showed U.S. equity funds got a record inflow of $36 billion, emerging-market stock funds received $5.4 billion, Japanese funds had $1.7 billion additions and Europe had about $600 million inflows.
As for sectors and styles, tech stocks received a historically high amount of $5.4 billion, followed by energy with $1.9 billion, while U.S. large caps got $25 billion."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging lower Friday, consolidating after recent gains with investors remaining confident vaccinations and additional fiscal stimulus will result in a reasonably prompt economic recovery.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 19 points, or 0.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell slightly Thursday, after hitting an intraday all-time high of 31,543.82. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted small gains to both close at new record highs.
The major averages are on track to post another positive week, with the DJIA up 0.9% this week, bringing its February gains to 4.8%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have risen 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, this week, up 5.4% and 7.3% this month, on track to make February the strongest month since November.
Stock markets have benefited from the expectation of additional stimulus from the new administration, and a House committee on Thursday approved a proposal to give airlines another $14 billion as part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expects lawmakers to complete the bill’s legislation by the end of February, even with former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial taking up a lot of Congress’s time. 
Turning to vaccinations, the U.S. announced Thursday further deals for 100 million additional vaccine doses each from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA). This should increase the country’s vaccine supply enough by April to allow anyone who wants a shot to begin getting one, said Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease doctor. 
This earnings season has tended to be stronger than expected, and further evidence of this came from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) after the bell Thursday. The entertainment giant returned to profit in the fourth quarter, helped by its fast-growing streaming service.
On the economic data slate, Michigan consumer sentiment data are due at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT), while the Federal Budget is expected four hours later.
Oil prices slipped Friday, after both the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency cut their forecasts for world oil consumption in 2021, citing the lockdowns in major developed countries, particularly Europe, in the first half of the year.
Later Friday, Baker Hughes releases its weekly U.S. rig count, a rough guide to future crude supply, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s data on positioning ends the week’s events.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $57.86 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $60.75. Both contracts closed on Wednesday at their highest levels since January 2020.

With Democrats also taking of control of the Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer promised last week to make the issue a priority.
Federal decriminalization would allow interstate movement of cannabis products, making it possible for companies to begin operating in a similar fashion to the alcohol industry.
At the same time, banks and other financial institutions, previously restrained by the federal prohibition, will be able to work with cannabis companies, giving the industry access to much-needed financing.
However, experts caution against over-enthusiasm and say actual changes could require full legalization.
CANADA-CENTRIC
For now, no U.S. marijuana producer has been allowed to list on a U.S. exchange and U.S.-based investment and mutual funds have largely avoided investing in Canadian-listed producers. 
As a result, in contrast to GameStop, much of whose stock was held by major U.S. financial institutions, the companies driven higher in the past week tend to be owned by a much more diverse range of small hedge funds, investors and venture capitalists.
The biggest investor in Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) Inc, for example, is hedge fund Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Bay Capital, with a small stake of 1.26%, according to Refinitiv data. No other financial investor holds more than 1% of its shares. 
This means that the rally to date has likely already been driven by small - or ""retail"" - investors.
On Reddit's WallStreetBets thread, Sundial, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Inc and Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc were the three most discussed stocks on Wednesday, according to one regular count of the number of mentions. (https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/)
SHORT OF SHORTS
The huge rises in shares of GameStop, cinema operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and Blackberry (TSX:BB) Ltd last month were also the result of a squeeze on hedge funds and other investors who had taken out ""short"" bets on those stocks falling. 
After months of gains, short interest - the percentage of a company's shares that have been borrowed as part of short trades - in the marijuana companies is an average of just under 14%. Tilray, among the biggest gainers but also engaged in a complicated merger with rival Aphria, has the highest short interest, at just over 23%, according to financial analytics firm S3. 

That compares with the peak short interest as a percentage of the shares in GameStop on Jan. 4 at 141.86%, according to S3. That means that any squeeze on investors who have bet against the stock will have less impact.

826,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 05:58AM ET</span>",StockBeat: L'Oreal's 2020 Was a Thing of Beauty,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The wonder of French cosmetics giant L’Oreal (OTC:LRLCY) has been for a long time that it depends largely on everyday products but trades like a luxury stock. The group’s full-year results, released late Thursday, show just why that is.
In a year when the motivation for buying beauty products was sorely weakened by the pandemic L’Oreal gained market share without sacrificing profitability, and enters 2021 on a trend of accelerating sales.
The most important elements of that performance are the ‘how?’ and the ‘where?’
Consumer product groups have largely stood or fallen in the last year on the basis of their ability to distribute online. Those chained to their physical stores have been devastated by lockdowns, while those able and willing to adapt have survived. L’Oreal falls emphatically into the second category: e-commerce sales were up 62% across all divisions and geographies, and now account for over a quarter of total sales.
The other pillar of L’Oreal’s strength is its geographical distribution. It invested early and heavily in China, meaning that it has a high exposure to the only major economy to show overall growth last year. Sales in China grew 27% last year, and 56% of that came through online channels.
Management can hardly be begrudged congratulating itself on what it called a “spectacular” performance in the country.
On a worldwide basis, the figures are hardly less impressive: while the global beauty market shrank by around 8% last year, L’Oreal’s sales fell only 4%. Even more remarkably, the company defended its operating margin, which stayed flat at 18.6%, some achievement given the number of retail outlets that have been left unable to earn their keep.
Management were also sunny in their outlook, albeit while keeping their fingers crossed.
“We are confident in our capacity to outperform the market again this year and, subject to the evolution of the sanitary crisis, achieve a year of growth in sales and profits."" (our italics)
Of course, all this quality comes at a price for investors. The shares are priced at a handsome 43 times earnings – more than twice the multiple for Nestle or Unilever (NYSE:UL), in line with the likes of Christian Dior and Moncler, and at only a small discount to LVMH. L’Oreal (PA:OREP) stock in Paris rose 2.2% on the back of the results, amid broad declines in European stock prices on Friday.
The company could do more to justify that valuation by raising payouts to shareholders: it still sat on net cash of nearly 4 billion euros at the end of the year, and the dividend recommendation, up only 4%, is little to get excited about. Still, for those afraid that the current asset bubble has to burst sometime, L’Oreal has everything one could want from a defensive stock."

LONDON (Reuters) - From a burned-out bank boss to call centre workers isolated at home, the financial sector is suffering a surge in mental health issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the industry's cut-throat reputation, senior bankers have responded to the extra strain by rolling out additional help and opening up about their own vulnerabilities.
""It's okay to feel overwhelmed by what life is throwing at me and mine,"" wrote Susan Revell, deputy chair of the $41 trillion asset Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK)'s Europe, Middle East and Africa business.
In a handwritten note Revell, along with other BNY colleagues, shared personal experiences with the institution's 48,500 staff. She juggles work with caring for elderly relatives and other family struck with ill health and redundancy. 
""You can't pour from an empty cup,"" Revell told Reuters. ""If I'm not in good shape then I can't support either my family or my colleagues."" 
Her note encouraged colleagues from Brazil to Hong Kong to share their own stories and advice.
While banks have for several years been paying greater attention to wellbeing, new initiatives from free therapy to online yoga have proliferated during the pandemic - though they are not always reaching junior staff. 
In England, a major global banking centre, as many as 10 million people will need new or additional mental health support, The Centre for Mental Health charity says.
SPOTTING SIGNS
One high-profile bank boss to open up was digital lender Monzo's founder Tom Blomfield who found managing a fast-growing start-up too much once COVID-19 piled the stress on. The 35-year-old stepped down as CEO last year to become president and left completely in January.
""On the Friday that London went into lockdown, three separate funds phoned me up and said: 'Look, this investment's not going ahead,'"" he recounted to The Guardian.
""I was stressed, definitely. I suffered anxiety that impacted my sleep. Did I border on depression at times? I don't know ... There's this myth of the superhero founder who sleeps four hours a night and reads 500 books a year and is up hiking before dawn kind of garbage. If it's true, I've never met that person.""
Helping to reduce stigma, other executives to share their battles in recent years include Lloyds (LON:LLOY) CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio who took leave for stress-induced insomnia in 2011 and former Virgin Money (LON:VM) boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia who had post-natal depression. 
""Constantly talking about this helps to make it a safe environment to bring issues up,"" said Helen Cook, chief HR officer at NatWest where colleagues at all levels have shared and offered support among themselves.
Despite progress, charities and unions say employers must make extra effort to look out for staff.
Picking up on signs is hard with homeworking, so banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Lloyds have staff on the lookout virtually. 
""We train our mental health first aiders to look out for body language cues,"" said Goldman Sachs executive director Beth Robotham, who has spoken publicly about her own past anxiety attacks.
""In a virtual environment, lots of the same rules apply, but it's more difficult - for instance it's much easier to lose eye contact. But you may notice the person opts out of being on screen and you're not sure why, or they seem heavily distracted when they weren't before, or are showing up late.""
Recruiters say mental health is now more likely to come up in hiring discussions, but candidates are still rarely open about existing conditions.
""Examples from leaders are hugely influential and helpful. However, people who are still en route to proving themselves in their career are hesitant to do the same,"" said Sophie Scholes, a partner at headhunter Heidrick & Struggles (NASDAQ:HSII).
""This particularly applies to recruitment processes where candidates are nervous to self-identify and mostly would choose not to.""
Other evidence suggests old attitudes die hard in top ranks.
Bill Michael, UK chairman of big four accountancy firm KPMG, resigned on Friday after an investigation was launched into comments first reported by the Financial Times newspaper that he told consultants to ""stop moaning"" about the pandemic.
""I am truly sorry that my words have caused hurt amongst my colleagues,"" he said in a statement.
'ZOOM FATIGUE'
Among the raft of new initiatives, NatWest has seen 5,500 staff sign up for online therapy courses just six months since launch. 
Lloyds has signed up 13,000 people to meditation app Headspace, while Monzo offers online yoga and started classes on meditation and managing stress this year. 
BNY has increased leave for carers and introduced virtual ""tea and talk"" sessions.
""Every business in the world has now got mental health on its boardroom agenda. I never thought it would happen this quickly,"" said Poppy Jaman, chief executive of the City Mental Health Alliance.
""As we face a global mental health crisis, 2021 must be the year that every business takes action."" 
The limitations of online support have, however, been exposed during the pandemic.
""Banks like other sectors have done what they can to mitigate the impact of loneliness by setting up things like pub quizzes, yoga and meditation,"" said Paul Barrett, head of wellbeing at the Bank Workers Charity (BWC).
""But I'm not sure they work as well as they might because of 'Zoom fatigue'. If you're using a screen all day, do you then want to use it for a coffee morning?""
Set up in 1883 to support former and current bank staff, the BWC has seen a spike in calls to its helpline since the pandemic, especially for financial and relationship counselling.
Not all have accessed help, however. 
Trade union Unite recently supported a bank call centre worker who suffered from anxiety and said he was laid off for taking longer than the one minute gap allowed between calls. 
The union was unable to challenge the decision as the person had been there less than two years, Unite's national officer Dominic Hook said. Reuters was unable to verify the case.
""My fear is so many people don't see the support available and even if they do, they don't have the time to access it,"" Hook said.
Banks contacted by Reuters said mental health challenges should not hold people back in careers and support was accessible 24/7 through employee assistance helplines.
One of the most crucial messages is to tell people they can take time off or work flexible hours if struggling, said Emma Mamo, head of workplace wellbeing at mental health charity Mind.

""Providing staff with some downtime to rest and recuperate is absolutely vital and can prevent worsening stress, poor mental health, sickness absence, and even falling out of the workplace altogether in the long run,"" she said.

829,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 03:45AM ET</span>",European Stocks Lower as U.K. GDP Posts Record Slump,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Friday, ending the week on a cautious note after the U.K. recorded the biggest economic slump on record.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6%, and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.5%.
Official figures released earlier Friday showed the U.K. economy slumped 9.9% in 2020, the biggest annual fall in output since modern records began, as the coronavirus ravaged the dominant services sector.
Still, the news wasn’t as bad as it could have been, as Britain's gross domestic product actually grew 1.0% between October and December, better than the meager 0.5% growth widely expected.
This quarterly growth makes it unlikely that Britain will fall into recession this year, even though the economy is set to shrink sharply in early 2021 due to the effects of a third lockdown.
The U.K. is still also struggling with the end of its past trading relationship with the EU. The two sides locked in a standoff over how to implement the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland, despite more than three hours of talks between top officials on Thursday, while anecdotal data continue to point to much of London's financial trade draining away to the continent, at least in the short term.
Staying with politics, members of Italy's 5-Star Movement voted on Thursday to back Prime Minister designate Mario Draghi, opening the way for the former European Central Bank chief to take office at the head of a broad government of national unity. Draghi is expected to pick his ministers over the weekend.
Turning to the corporate sector, ING (AS:INGA) stock rose 4.8% after the Dutch bank reported better than expected fourth-quarter earnings, continuing a string of healthy results from European banks.
ASML (AS:ASML) stock rose 1.5% after the tech company said chip shortages were a symptom of broader increased demand that is placing strains on suppliers across the semiconductor sector. 
Elsewhere, L’Oreal (PA:OREP) stock rose 1.9% after the cosmetics company beat consensus with a 4.8% rise in currency-adjusted sales in the quarter, albeit the performance was entirely dependent on strength in China.
Oil prices slipped Friday, weighed by the more cautious tone taken by a couple of influential industry bodies on the subject of demand recovery from the pandemic this year.
Both the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency cut their forecasts Thursday for world oil consumption in 2021 by 100,000 and 200,000 barrels a day, respectively, citing the lockdowns in major developed countries, particularly Europe, in the first half of the year.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $57.55 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $60.48. Both contracts closed on Wednesday at their highest levels since January 2020.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,813.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2107.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index dipped 0.1%, after having gained nearly 4% so far this month.
 ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV jumped 5% after the largest Dutch bank reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter pre-tax earnings of 1.05 billion euros ($1.27 billion).
ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) NV rose 1.5% after the Dutch equipment maker said chip shortages slowing car production were a symptom of broader increased demand that is placing strains on suppliers across the semiconductor sector.
European technology stocks were 0.4% higher, among the few sectors in positive territory in early trading.

Market participants were hopeful that a proposed $1.9 trillion U.S. stimulus bill would be passed soon by lawmakers, with data showing a stalling recovery in the U.S. labour market strengthening the case for it. [MKTS/GLOB]

834,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 12:45AM ET</span>",Japan political 'village mentality' pierced as Tokyo Olympics Mori set to resign,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - In just a week, the metamorphosis was complete: former Japanese prime minister Yoshiro Mori went from being a political asset seen as vital to the Tokyo Olympics' success to a liability threatening the already cloudy outlook for the Summer Games.
Mori, 83, is set to resign on Friday as head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee after an apology for sexist comments failed to quell domestic and overseas outrage.
The groundswell of criticism from athletes, sponsors, volunteers, diplomats, media and ordinary Japanese pierced what one newspaper described as the ""village mentality"" of Mori's allies, including Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who had hoped an apology would put the controversy to rest.
""His colleagues sought to protect him, and if the criticism had only been in Japan, an apology might have worked,"" said independent political analyst Atsuo Ito. ""But the reaction was global.""
The resignation of such a powerful figure signals Japanese leaders' determination to do whatever it takes to stage the Games, despite persistent concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The hope is that Japan gets it, that the powers that be are not rigid and tone deaf and that yes, Japan will do what it takes,"" for a successful Games, said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF).
But Suga's handling of the affair could further dent his already battered public support, as was Mori's attempt to pick outspoken former Japan Football Association president Saburo Kawabuchi, 84, to succeed him.
At a Japanese Olympic Committee meeting on Feb. 3, Mori commented that women talk too much, causing discussions to drag on. He first apologised, but initially declined to resign and said he ""didn't listen to women that much lately."" 
'DON'T REALLY GET IT'
Mori's tenure as prime minister in 2000-2001 ended after a series of gaffes slashed his ratings to single digits. Still, the onetime head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) biggest faction retained considerable clout.
Despite the outrage over his remarks, Olympic and ruling party officials initially told Reuters that few were willing to oust Mori, whose network of politicians and Olympic officials was thought key to pulling off a successful Games.
Suga has dubbed Mori’s comments unacceptable and said they were not desirable for Japan’s national interests, but did not call for his resignation.
""I don't think they (ruling politicians) really get the issue about gender, its significance. Gender equality is very important but they take the issue lightly and just focus on internal politics,"" said Machiko Osawa, a professor at Tokyo Women's University.
Overseas media kept up prominent coverage of the controversy and foreign diplomats posted support for gender equality on social media.
Twitter was alight with domestic and foreign criticism - tennis star Naomi Osaka called his remarks ""ignorant"" - and an online petition calling for action against Mori garnered more than 140,000 signatures.
On Wednesday, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said she would not join a meeting of organisers with Mori because it would not send a “positive message”, and a day earlier the International Olympic Committee issued a statement condemning Mori's remarks.
Mori's handpicked successor, Kawabuchi – already derided as ""another grandpa"" by some on social media - decided to decline the post, the Asahi newspaper reported on Friday.
His selection had threatened to keep alive the controversy as Japan's deeply entrenched gender bias clashes with changing attitudes. Japan ranked 121st out of 153 countries in the World Economic Forum's 2020 gender gap report.

""They share the same values, I think that's why he was chosen,"" Osawa said of Kawabuchi and Mori. ""It's not just what he says, it's the decision process. Women's opinions should be more highly regarded.""

Earlier this week, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) said it was planning to offer support for some cryptocurrencies on its network this year. Asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and payments company  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) have also recently backed cryptocurrencies.
Rainey said PayPal wanted to invest its money in services the company is currently providing, such as buy now, pay later.
Buy now, pay later services have blossomed across retail websites during the COVID-19 pandemic, as more people turned to online shopping.
PayPal's comments come amid a bitcoin frenzy after Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc revealed it had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars, sending the price of the digital currency higher.
Following Tesla's announcement, several companies came out with their views.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company discussed and ""quickly dismissed"" the idea of investing in bitcoin. However, he added that Uber could potentially accept the cryptocurrency as payment.

 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it was still undecided in holding bitcoin, while General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it will evaluate whether bitcoin can be accepted as payment for its vehicles.

(Reuters) - A U.S. House committee on Thursday approved a proposal to give airlines another $14 billion in payroll assistance as part of a broader COVID-19 relief package that is working its way through Congress. 
It would be the third round of support for the pandemic-hit industry. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines have warned of some 27,000 furloughs without an extension of the current package that expires on April 1. 
The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on a 29-24 vote approved the $14 billion for airlines and $1 billion for contractors to cover payroll through September.
The funds will be included in the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill proposed by President Joe Biden, whose initial plan did not include new money for airlines. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that she expects lawmakers to complete legislation based on the bill by the end of February.
American Airlines said in a statement after the committee vote that the payroll support program, which covers employee wages and bans job cuts, ""has been a lifeline for our team members.""
U.S. airlines are burning through millions of dollars every day as the pandemic crushes travel demand.
The Air Line Pilots Association, the largest pilot union in the world, said the funds ""would help prevent the additional financial devastation that would result from the aviation industry being forced to furlough tens of thousands of workers.""
Budget carriers  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), Allegiant Travel and Frontier Airlines, however, have said in recent weeks that they intend to resume pilot hiring later this year.

Reuters first reported many of the details of the plans to provide new assistance to U.S. airlines, transit systems, airports and passenger railroad Amtrak.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 09:55PM ET</span>",EU says it is ready to work with Biden administration to settle trade disputes,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union on Thursday acknowledged a move by the new U.S. government to refrain from imposing additional tariffs on EU goods in a long-running dispute over aircraft tariffs, and said it was ready to work to resolve trade disputes.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office on Thursday said it had agreed with U.S. industry that it was unnecessary to revise existing tariffs on European goods at this time, refraining from changes that would have been possible during a periodic review.
The move came a day after USTR said it looked forward to working with European allies to resolve a 16-year-long battle over subsidies provided to Europe's Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
Asked about Thursday's decision, an EU spokesman said, ""The EU is ready to engage with the new U.S. administration on the basis of the EU-US agenda for global change we adopted on December 2. Our aim is to find solutions to our ongoing trade disputes, including on Airbus/Boeing.""
The American Italian Food Coalition, which represents more than 450 Italian companies, manufacturers and trade groups, said the move would give both sides time to work out a solution.
""The Biden Administration appropriately hit the pause button on another carousel round of tariffs,"" it said.
Officials from the EU and Britain are keen to work out a deal with the administration of President Joe Biden, but talks are on ice until Biden's pick as top trade negotiator, Katherine Tai, is confirmed in her job by the U.S. Senate. That could take several more weeks, with a confirmation hearing not yet scheduled.
Envoys from Britain and the European Union on Monday stressed their willingness to resolve the aircraft subsidies dispute.

EU Ambassador Stavros Lambrinidis said Brussels had proposed a six-month suspension of tariffs on both sides to allow for negotiations. Britain, which is no longer part of the EU but is part of the Airbus consortium, has said it is also willing to lift tariffs, possibly unilaterally, as a goodwill gesture.

BETHESDA, Md. (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said the coronavirus vaccination program he inherited from Donald Trump was in ""much worse shape"" than he had expected, while urging patience and also announcing the government has bought 200 million more doses.
""We're not going to have everything fixed for a while, but we're going to fix it,"" Biden said in remarks at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. 
With demand for the vaccine far outstripping supply, Americans are struggling to get appointments for their inoculations, leaving Biden with an acute problem less than a month after taking over from Trump.
Biden said Trump, who spent his last two months in office in a futile effort to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election that he lost, did not order enough vaccine and did not do enough to get people lined up to get vaccinated.
He said the vaccine program he inherited was in ""much worse shape"" than he had anticipated and that his transition team had been misled about the vaccine supply.
""While scientists did their job in discovering vaccines in record time, my predecessor - I’ll be very blunt about it - did not do his job in getting ready for the massive challenge of vaccinating hundreds of millions,"" Biden said.
Brian Morgenstern, a former White House official involved with the coronavirus effort, said the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed program had prepared plans well in advance, aided by many career officials still serving in government.
""That is why the new Administration’s goals were being surpassed before they even came into office. Enough with the lies, excuses & political pot shots. Time to lead,"" he said.
Trump had expressed pride in the speed of the vaccine development on his watch.
Biden said the U.S. coronavirus death toll is likely to reach 500,000 next month. He urged Americans to wear masks to prevent the spread.
""We've now purchased enough vaccine to vaccinate all Americans,"" Biden said.
He said the U.S. government has signed contracts for 100 million doses of the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine and 100 million more from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) to help reach the target.
""We appreciate the confidence that the U.S. government has demonstrated in our COVID-19 Vaccine,"" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a press release. 
Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo confirmed that it and BioNTech had reached a deal with the U.S. government.
""We will deliver 100 million doses by the end of March, a total of 200 million doses by the end of May, and the full 300 million doses by the end of July,"" she said.
The new vaccine orders, in addition to 400 million doses previously contracted, would allow the United States to vaccinate a total of 300 million people by July 31 using doses from the two vaccines authorized. 
That would be enough to vaccinate most people in the 330 million population who want it, given that the two vaccines are not authorized for children and that many people have said they don't want shots. 

In addition, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccine candidate is likely to be authorized later this month, and the company expects to supply 100 million doses of its single-shot vaccine to the United States by the middle of the year.

Biden's first call late Wednesday with China's President Xi Jinping ""resurfaced all of the difficulties that we're going to face this year in addition to the pandemic,"" he said.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 06:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: How GameStop missed out on capitalizing on the Reddit rally,"By Jessica DiNapoli, Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - U.S. video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) decided it could not seize on the Reddit-fueled rally in its shares to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock because of regulatory restrictions, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The Grapevine, Texas-based company found itself at the epicenter of an unprecedented trading frenzy last month, as amateur investors organized on social media sites such as Reddit to bet against Wall Street hedge funds that had shorted its shares.
While many heavily shorted stocks, from movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc to headphone maker Koss Corp, also scored big rallies, ""Gamestonk,"" as it was nicknamed by many online, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, became synonymous with the wave of trading speculation. 
GameStop's market value soared from $1.4 billion on Jan. 11 to a peak of $33.7 billion on Jan. 28. At that point, GameStop could have raised hundreds of millions of dollars through a stock sale to pay down its debt pile, which totaled $216 million net of cash as of the end of October, and fund its transformation into a digital gaming service, as sales at its mall-based stores dwindle.
Yet GameStop never sold shares, the sources said, despite being egged on by many Wall Street pundits to do so. While it could still sell shares in the coming weeks, the opportunity to raise hundreds of millions of dollars has now slipped as the rally in its shares reversed. It now has a market value of $3.6 billion. 
GameStop examined the possibility of selling stock during the rally, the sources said. The company had already registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell $100 million worth of stock in December, an option it did not exercise, the sources added. 
GameStop decided it was restricted under U.S. financial regulations from selling shares because it had not yet updated investors on its earnings, the sources said. The SEC requires companies to have released such information when conducting stock sales. While GameStop had started preparing results for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in January, it was not due to report them for several more weeks, the sources said.
By the time its shares took off in the second half of January, executives had already compiled data and had a clear picture of what the quarter would look like, the sources said.
GameStop could have gone ahead with a stock sale by releasing preliminary earnings. But such a move, carried out for the purposes of a stock sale, came with significant logistical hurdles and regulatory risk that the company was not willing to accept, one of the sources said. The SEC had said it would scrutinize how companies took advantage of the trading volatility to sell stock and had asked that they provide more information to investors about the potential risks.
Representatives of GameStop and the SEC declined to comment.
""They were 2-1/2 months into their quarter when all this stuff took place,"" said David Erickson, a finance lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who was previously co-head of global equity capital markets at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc ""It's so deep in the quarter that from a legal and corporate governance perspective they would likely be obligated to pre-announce some high-level financial information for the quarter. And that can't be prepared in just a week.""
AMC, AMERICAN AIRLINES
Other companies in the middle of the Reddit frenzy, whose financial quarters finished at the end of December and had already updated investors on their latest financial performance, were able to sell stock when their shares rallied at the end of January. 
AMC, whose movie theater business has been hurt by the pandemic, raised roughly $1.2 billion through debt and equity deals after its shares rallied more than 700%.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, which has also suffered as demand for flights plummeted, pulled the trigger on a plan to sell more than $1 billion of stock last month after its shares rallied as much as 48%.
GameStop has lost market share to larger competitors, including  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), as consumers buy video games online or through big-box retailers.
Robert W. Baird & Co analysts wrote last month that the best outcome for GameStop shareholders would be for the company to close the majority of its physical stores and diversify into online businesses, including hosting tournaments and events.

One of GameStop's largest shareholders, online pet store Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc co-founder Ryan Cohen, and two of his partners joined the company's board in January. Last year, hedge funds Hestia Capital Partners and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund also won seats on the board.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Indaba Capital is pushing benefit management software company Benefitfocus (NASDAQ:BNFT) Inc to put itself up for sale after years of poor returns and high turnover in the executive suite, according to a letter the hedge fund sent to the company's board on Thursday.
Benefitfocus stock price jumped than 10% to trade at $17.31 after Indaba, which owns a stake of 9.6% dialed up the pressure after weeks of private negotiations that ended last month.
The company did name a new director and said an independent chairman will be appointed at the annual meeting. The hedge fund objected to these specific moves, although it had asked for new, diverse, independent board members and for the company to unwind financial transactions with an entity controlled by a current director.
""They suggest only a wink to cleaning up the mess, with no real commitment to value-enhancing change,"" said the letter, seen by Reuters.
Now the hedge fund, which oversees $1.5 billion in assets, is urging a ""good faith sales process,"" adding ""the current leadership has lost the privilege of running Benefitfocus.""
Benefitfocus said it is committed to generating substantial value for shareholders, is open to constructive suggestions, and routinely reviews strategic priorities and opportunities.
""We have also taken steps to enhance our corporate governance, improve our financial flexibility, bolster our balance sheet and strengthen our leadership team,"" the company said in a statement.
Indaba blames the board for Benefitfocus' sluggish stock returns, heavy executive turnover and poor capital allocation.
Since 2015, Benefitfocus has had three chief executives and six chief financial officers.
Benefitfocus shares have jumped 18.6% in the last five days. But in the 52 weeks to Feb. 5, they dropped 23.7% while peers gained an average 55.7% and the Russell 2000 index gained 32.8%. 
Over five years, Benefitfocus' stock has dropped 43% compared with a 527.5% gain for peers and a 126.6% gain in the Russell 2000 index.
While the hedge fund and company were holding talks, Indaba suggested three candidates for the board, including two African Americans.
The company in January said Doug Dennerline, who has been on the board since 2014, will become independent chairman while Mason Holland, the company's co-founder, will become chairman emeritus. 
Indaba was founded in 2010 by former Farallon Capital Management partner Derek Schrier and has traditionally kept a lower profile making both stock and credit bets. 
In addition to being one of Benefitfocus' largest stock owners, it holds approximately 22.9% of Benefitfocus' outstanding issue of the 1.25% convertible senior notes.
Lawyers and industry analysts have said mergers and acquisitions are likely to heat up as vaccine rollouts ease the pandemic and boost the economy and investors push companies to perform better.

Investing.com – The Dow closed just below the flatline Thursday, but remained close to record highs as investors weighed weakness in energy against strength in technology and growing optimism for another injection of stimulus to support to recovery.    
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.02% or 7 points after hitting an intraday all-time high of 31,543.82. The S&P 500 was up 0.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.38% to close at a record high.  
Energy led the broader market decline as oil prices slipped on renewed demand concerns after OPEC lowered its forecast on global oil demand.
OPEC forecast oil demand to increase about 5.8 million barrels per day to just below 96.1 million bpd, down 0.1 million bpd from a previous forecast, citing downward revisions in the OECD region and the impact of extended lockdowns.
Halliburton  (NYSE:HAL), Apache (NASDAQ:APA),  Marathon Oil  Corporation (NYSE:MRO) were among the biggest decliners in the energy sector, each ended the day down by more than 3%.
Yet, Wall Street remains bullish on the global demand outlook. Goldman Sachs said earlier this week it expects global oil demand will recover by the end of 2022 and maintained its forecast for WTI to rise above $60 per barrel later this year. 
Financials also took a breather after racking up gains recently even as U.S. Treasury yields held steady.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) ended below the flatline.
The day of weakness for most cyclicals stocks followed a smaller-than-expected decline in weekly jobless claims.
Economists, however, were quick to downplay the weaker headline number, noting that claims remained well below their January peak at a time when another potential round of stimulus will boost the labor market recovery.
""A declining pace of job destruction, furthermore, suggests that the U.S. labor market is on the mend after a second-round resurgence of the virus complicated the recovery near year-end with a further round of restrictions resulting in business closures and layoffs,"" Stifel said in a note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Businesses that run afoul of U.S. securities laws will not be able to seek a waiver to keep doing certain types of business as part of their settlement negotiations with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulator announced on Thursday.
The SEC move to separate the practice of granting waivers from settlement talks around enforcement probes suggests it will take a harsher stance on the activity going forward. Companies that are found guilty of criminal conduct or fraud can be barred from certain activities, such as private capital deals, without such an SEC waiver.
The shift, announced by SEC acting Chair Allison Lee, reverses a policy established by her predecessor, Jay Clayton, who said in 2019 that allowing settlement offers to be contingent upon granting such waivers could streamline the process and speed relief to harmed parties.
But Lee said such waivers should not be a ""bargaining chip"" in negotiations to settle enforcement actions or be treated as a given.
""A waiver is not the default position under the law, and should not be considered one under our processes,"" she said in a statement.
The regularity with which such waivers had been granted had been a sore spot for some Democrats, who argued they undermined any punishment for wrongdoing by allowing companies to continue doing business unimpeded.

Under the new policy, companies must agree to settle charges with the SEC's enforcement team, and separately seek relevant waivers from its divisions of corporate finance and investment management, which will evaluate the requests on their own terms.

Total direct-to-consumer subscribers of 146.1 million topped consensus estimates of 143.1 million even as the average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for Disney+ decreased from $5.56 to $4.03.
""Direct-to-Consumer revenues for the quarter increased 73% to $3.5 billion and operating loss decreased from $1.1 billion to $466 million. The decrease in operating loss was due to improved results at Hulu, and to a lesser extent, at Disney+ and ESPN+,"" the company said.
The ongoing strength in its streaming business comes after the company doubled down on content following its announcement late last-year to streamline the organization.
Its theme parks business, however, continued to suffer a hit from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Parks, experiences and products revenue for the quarter decreased 53% to $3.59 billion, and its media and entertainment distribution business saw revenue fall 5% to $12.66 billion.  
""The most significant impact was at the Disney Parks, Experiences and Products segment where since late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, our parks and resorts have been closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity and our cruise ship sailings have been suspended,"" the company said.
Looking ahead, Investing.com's analyst Haris Anwar believes investors should wait for a pullback as the upside from its streaming business has been prices into the stock. 
""Disney, with its core revenue generating units still under pressure, is a bet on the reopening of the economy and a success of its streaming product. That business is firing on all cylinders with explosive growth in new subscribers. If that trend continues, it will clearly show that Disney is winning in streaming wars. These two catalysts are very much reflected in the share price, making it tougher for the stock to continue to perform strongly from here. Investors should wait on the sidelines for a better entry point in our view,"" Anwar said."

852,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 03:36PM ET</span>","Bitcoin Pop, Pot Stock Drop, Bumble Debut: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks were mixed on Thursday, and energy led declines on renewed demand concerns.
The cartel of oil producers known as OPEC said demand will increase about 5.8 million barrels a day, which is actually less than previous forecasts. That weighed on big energy stocks like Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)and  Marathon Oil  Corporation (NYSE:MRO)
The number of new jobless claims filed last week was higher than expected, but economists were quick to downplay the weaker headline number, noting that claims remained well below their January peak.
Sentiment on stocks were also supported by an ongoing decline in U.S. virus cases and a pick up the pace of the vaccine rollouts that will likely lead to a stronger-than-expected reopening.
There isn’t much data scheduled for release, and earnings season is winding down. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Crypto craze
Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) jumped nearly 6% to $47,753, after BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) said it started a new business to help clients hold, transfer and issue digital assets.
Investors have been piling into bitcoin and other digital currencies, rather than put their money in the traditional safe haven of gold. It might help that widely followed people like Elon Musk have taken to twitter to sing the praises of crypto (in Musk’s case, dogecoin). But Tesla’s investment in $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin is also pushing the price higher.
2. Pot trade up in smoke
A bid up in the cannabis sector this week petered out on Thursday. Widely reported to be a Reddit effort to boost shares of  Tilray Inc  (NASDAQ:TLRY),  Aphria Inc  (TSX:APHA), and Canopy Growth Corp (TSX:WEED), the trade lost its momentum and the stocks tumbled.
The ETFMG Alternative Harvest (NYSE:MJ)fund lost 24% on Thursday, though it is still up nearly 76% so far this year.
3.  Bumble  pop
As we predicted on Wednesday, Bumble Inc (NASDAQ:BMBL), the dating app company, soared on its debut, trading well above its IPO price of $43, following the pattern of other recent new listings. Bumble is getting a boost from users who are stuck at home but still eager to make new social connections, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd said on CNBC on Thursday.
After jumping more than 80% when it began trading around midday, Bumble gave up some of that gain. It was up 70% from its IPO price just after 3:00 PM ET.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday declined to further delay the extradition to Japan of two men charged with helping former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee the country.
The order by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston clears the way for U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, to be handed over to Japan, after the U.S. State Department approved their extradition.
Their lawyers had said that absent a stay of a prior ruling that they were seeking to appeal that allowed for their extradition, the U.S. government could turn over the Taylors to Japan as early as Friday.
Paul Kelly, a lawyer for the Taylors, said their defense team is ""currently exploring the Taylors' legal options."" The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment.
The Taylors were arrested in May at Japan's request after being charged with helping Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.
Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, received $1.3 million for their services.
The Taylors' lawyers argued they could not be prosecuted in Japan for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that, if extradited, they faced the prospect relentless interrogations and torture.
But a federal judge last month held that while prison conditions in Japan ""may be deplorable,"" that was not enough to bar extradition and that they were charged with an ""extraditable offense.""

The Taylors' high-powered defense team during their months-long legal fight also lobbied the White House under then-President Donald Trump to step in.

Investing.com – The Dow eased from record highs Thursday, paced by slump in energy and financials on concerns over the demand outlook, though overall investor sentiment remains positive on stocks amid expectations for another round of stimulus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.30%, or 94 points after hitting an intraday high of 31,543.82. The S&P 500 was down 0.30%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.25%. 
Energy led the broader market decline as oil prices slipped on renewed demand concerns after OPEC lowered its forecast on global oil demand.
OPEC forecast oil demand to increase about 5.8 million barrels per day to just below 96.1 million bpd, down 0.1 million bpd from a previous forecast, citing downward revisions in the OECD region and the impact of extended lockdowns.
Halliburton  (NYSE:HAL), Apache (NASDAQ:APA),  Marathon Oil  Corporation (NYSE:MRO) were among the biggest decliners in the energy sector, each down by more than 4%.
Yet, Wall Street remains bullish on the global demand outlook. Goldman Sachs said earlier this week it expects global oil demand will recover by the end of 2022 and maintained its forecast for WTI to rise above $60 per barrel later this year. 
Financials also took a breather after racking up gains recently even as U.S. Treasury yields held steady.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) fell more 1%.
The day of weakness in cyclicals followed a smaller-than-expected decline in weekly jobless claims.
Economists, however, were quick to downplay the weaker headline number, noting that claims remained well below their January peak at a time when another potential round of stimulus will boost the labor market recovery.
""A declining pace of job destruction, furthermore, suggests that the U.S. labor market is on the mend after a second-round resurgence of the virus complicated the recovery near year-end with a further round of restrictions resulting in business closures and layoffs,"" Stifel said in a note.
Sentiment on stocks were also supported by ongoing decline in U.S. virus cases and a pick up the pace of the vaccine rollouts that will likely lead to a stronger-than-expected reopening.
The Reddit-led bid up in cannabis stocks a day earlier ran out of steam, with Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), Aphria (TSX:APHA) and Canopy Growth (TSX:WEED) down sharply.

(Reuters) - A political shift in the United States has unlocked an estimated $1.38 billion jackpot for struggling pot producers who have cashed in on a surge in their shares since President Joe Biden's election in November.
Cannabis producers have issued stock worth this amount in the first five weeks of 2021, investment firm Viridian Capital Advisors estimates, as prices have risen on a promise of federal decriminalization of marijuana and a host of other reforms by the incoming Biden administration.
Canadian pot companies have been the largest beneficiaries of the rally in shares, owing to the fact that they have been allowed to list on U.S. exchanges, while U.S. companies that harvest or sell marijuana within the country are forbidden from doing so.
Retail investors have also piled into the pot sector this week, with Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) and Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) emerging as the new favorites of Reddit's popular WallStreetBets forum that was behind recent rallies in some shorted stocks.
(Graphic: Cannabis stocks rally to new highs: https://graphics.reuters.com/CANNABIS-STOCKS/xlbvgymnxvq/chart.png)
In a vote of confidence in the sector, a single unnamed institutional investor this week bought $100 million worth of stock in U.S.-based pot producer Green Thumbs Industries Inc's initial public offering, according to a company filing.
Calgary, Alberta-based Sundial, a medical cannabis producer, has issued over a billion new shares since September.
Considered by many analysts to be a bankruptcy risk earlier, the company has improved its cash position from $22 million to over $600 million in just four months and fully repaid its current debt obligations.
(Graphic: Pot producers raising record money: https://graphics.reuters.com/CANNABIS-STOCKS/FUNDRAISING/xklvyozegvg/chart.png)
Market experts, however, have said the cannabis rally is already overdone and valuations are once again becoming unrealistic, especially for the Canadian companies that may not even get much upside from U.S. decriminalization.
Viridian said the turnaround in Sundial's fortunes is good for them, but the advisory firm is ""a bit skeptical about any fundamental changes at the company justifying this Cinderella story"".
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) were among a handful of companies to have raised funds from the market when their shares soared last month.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) could not seize on the Reddit-fueled rally to sell shares because of regulatory restrictions, according to three people familiar with the matter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co said on Thursday that it plans to sell its nuts business - including most Planters and Corn Nuts products - to  Hormel Foods Corp  (NYSE:HRL) for $3.35 billion, sending shares up 6%.
The Chicago-based company has been trying to streamline its portfolio and focus on more accretive brands, having faced criticism for years about losing out to private label products because it is in too many categories to focus on key brands. In September, Kraft Heinz said it would sell its natural cheese business to French dairy company Groupe Lactalis for $3.2 billion.
""Planters is one of the brands most affected by private label in our portfolio. It's also, of course, affected as a commodity,"" Chief Executive Miguel Patricio said in a statement.
""We must focus on areas where we see the greatest competitive advantage.""
Patricio said in an interview with Reuters the Planters deal gives Kraft Heinz the flexibility to invest internally, make acquisitions or pay down debt. He declined to comment on what brands Kraft Heinz is interested in buying but said the company is ""not in any negotiation at the moment.""
Kraft Heinz's nuts business contributed about $1.1 billion to net sales in 2020.
The deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2021, includes global intellectual property rights to the brands, subject to existing third-party licenses.
Kraft Heinz also beat analysts' estimates on Thursday for fourth-quarter revenue as people under pandemic lockdown during the holidays bought more packaged food products like Mac and Cheese, Heinz ketchup and Oscar Meyer meat slices.
""No large-cap food company has benefited more from the COVID era than Kraft Heinz, with strong non-promoted sales growth and much needed balance sheet relief,"" Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer wrote in a recent note.
Sales grew 6.2% to $6.94 billion in the three months ended Dec. 26, beating the average estimate of $6.82 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Adjusted net earnings rose to 80 cents per share from 72 cents per share a year earlier, beating estimates of 74 cents per share.

(Reuters) - Shares in North American cannabis firms were heading for new highs on Thursday, with Reddit-inspired retail investors betting they could beat the short-sellers and benefit from new legislation that is expected under U.S. President Joe Biden.
U.S.-listed Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) and Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL), which have already doubled in value so far this week, were up 6% and 50% respectively in U.S. premarket trading, as European retail investors piled in to the rally. 
Participants on the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit, which inspired a price spike in GameStop (NYSE:GME) earlier this year that squeezed out Wall Street short-sellers who had bet on a price fall, have turned attention to U.S. and Canadian cannabis firms.
""The involvement of Reddit means a frenzy is the right word,"" said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group in London.
""I’m splitting the outlook in two. Reddit targeting a short-squeeze in Tilray means a quick pump and dump,"" he said, while others looked longer-term at benefits from potential legislative changes under Biden and his Democrat allies in Congress.
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said in the presidential campaign marijuana would be decriminalised at a federal level in the United States under a Biden administration.
Swaggystocks, which aggregates sentiment on shares discussed on WallStreetBets which has about 8 million participants, showed Sundial and Tilray were the most or highly touted stocks.
Analysts said the retail bet carried risks. Chris Bailey, a strategist at Raymond James in London, said it was ""still a highly speculative area where hopes may rise sharply but then disappear equally as quickly.""
'REDDIT ARMY AND FRIENDS'
Short interest in Tilray, measuring the number of shares borrowed by short sellers betting on a price fall, was about 37% on Wednesday compared to 27% at the end of January, financial analytics firm Ortex said.
Short-sellers borrow stocks and sell them on, aiming to buy them back later more cheaply and pocket the difference. If the shares move up instead, they face a 'short squeeze' as they race to buy the stock to close out their positions to stem losses.
Tilray was one of the most traded stock on German trading platform Lang & Schwarz, vying with major German stocks such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Other pot stocks, Sundial Growers and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), were also among the most active on the platform, reflecting high retail interest, traders said.
""It's the Reddit army and friends,"" said Stefan de Schutter, portfolio manager and Alpha Trading in Frankfurt.
Tilray jumped more than 50% on Wednesday, while U.S.-listed Sundial and Toronto-listed Aurora surged 78% and 21% respectively. 
Customers on eToro, a retail trading platform seen as an alternative in Europe to popular U.S. platforms such as Robinhood, opened more positions in Tilray on Wednesday than in the first 10 months of 2020 combined.
One eToro user in Germany, @ChrisBro14, wrote in a thread about Tilray as it traded around $70: ""Guess (NYSE:GES) will go to $100. Where do you have TP limit. What do you think it will (do)?""
Interest in the sector lifted cannabis-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) to new highs, with some more than doubling in value over the past month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday rejected media reports it is considering any new domestic air travel restrictions.
""To be clear, there have been no decisions made around additional public health measures for domestic travel safety. The administration is continuing to discuss recommendations across the travel space, but no specific decisions are under consideration,"" a White House spokesman told Reuters.
Reports that the administration was considering imposing restrictions on travel to Florida brought denunciations from many Republican lawmakers.
The chief executives of major U.S. airlines are scheduled to meet virtually on Friday with the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator to discuss travel-related issues, Reuters reported Wednesday.
The meeting with coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients and other administration officials involved in COVID-19 issues comes as airlines, aviation unions and other industry groups have strongly objected to the possibility of requiring COVID-19 testing before boarding domestic flights.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co Chief Executive Gary Kelly and the leaders of the airline's unions urged President Joe Biden in a letter not to mandate COVID-19 testing, saying it would put ""jobs at risk.""
""Such a mandate would be counterproductive, costly, and have serious unintended consequences,"" said the letter, which was dated Tuesday and released on Wednesday.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month said the Biden administration was ""actively looking"" at expanding mandatory COVID-19 testing to U.S. domestic flights. The CDC on Jan. 26 began requiring negative COVID-19 tests or evidence of recovery from the disease from nearly all U.S.-bound international passengers age 2 and older.
One idea that has been under review within the Biden administration is for the CDC to issue recommendations advising against travel to areas of the United States with high COVID-19 caseloads, but no decisions have been made and recommendations would not be binding, officials said. 

CDC officials have repeatedly urged Americans not to travel unless necessary.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday suspended trading in inactive Minnesota corporation SpectraScience Inc., among the latest securities to see a surge in interest from retail investors on social media. 
The suspension comes after weeks of volatile trading of the so-called ""meme stocks"" - assets which draw sudden interest from retail investors amid discussion on social media websites.
The trend was notably led in late January by the 400% surge in one week in share prices of struggling video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) on a wave of bullish commentary shared on sites including Reddit and Twitter. 
Short sellers were forced to pay up to cover their bearish positions and investors who bought at the heights were left suffering steep losses when crashed back down.
Since late January, some social media accounts ""may be engaged in a coordinated attempt to artificially influence"" SpectraScience's share price even though the company had not filed any periodic reports since November 2017 or any publicly available news, according to SEC's statement and order.
""The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the securities"" of SpectraScience, the SEC said.
The SEC has said it was looking into the market volatility and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened U.S. financial markets regulators to discuss the matter. The tumult has also drawn scrutiny from Capitol Hill and state securities regulators.

(Reuters) - PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc has joined rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) in predicting revenue growth in 2021, saying on Thursday it expects pre-pandemic lifestyles to resume as economies reopen and COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out.
The company has navigated the health crisis better than Coca-Cola as it relies more on grocery and retail channels from where consumers stockpiled snacks and beverages.
Pepsi said its fourth-quarter revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, topping Wall Street expectations, as people munched Tostitos and Cheetos and gulped down Gatorade while stuck at home during a second wave of coronavirus lockdowns.
The increase in demand had last year led the company to launch a direct-to-consumer website that offered special flavors and specialized bundles of its top selling products.
""We have figured how to do well in this environment,"" Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters, adding that most of the growth came from no-sugar, low-calorie and healthy options. 
Still, revenue from the foodservice channel, which includes restaurants and vending machines, fell at a double-digit rate. 
Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta said he expects consumers to return to certain pre-pandemic behaviors by the second half of 2021, but some changes such as increased online shopping and more remote work arrangements will likely be sustained.
The company expects a mid-single digit rise in annual organic revenue and a high-single digit increase in adjusted earnings. 
""PepsiCo's success has largely been driven by its portfolio strategy and focus on at-home consumption, which is helping the company outperform others in the category, especially in beverage,"" Kristen Groh, a managing partner at Publicis Sapient said.
Organic revenue for Frito-Lay North America rose 5%, while those at the North American beverage unit rose 5.5%.
Excluding items, it earned $1.47 per share, a cent above expectations, according Refinitiv IBES data.

PepsiCo's shares, which had gained nearly 9% last year to outperform Coca-Cola's 1% rise, were marginally down in early trading.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets edged to new record highs on Thursday on continued momentum generated by macroeconomic policy, as the spike in pot stocks appeared to go the same way as the one in GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other struggling icons of the 1990s.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 35 points, or 0.1%, at 31,472 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%. The moves come after a report showed another small improvement in labor market trends, with initial jobless claims falling below 800,000 last week.
Analysts said the report was consistent with expectations of a broad economic recovery in the coming weeks as the pandemic recedes.
"" With Covid cases and hospitalizations plummeting, the economy is now starting to re-open, albeit very slowly and patchily, but the direction of travel is clear,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""The seasonal patterns suggest that claims likely dip only slightly over the next few weeks, but the dominant force as the spring arrives will be the fading of Covid and the reopening.""
However, the cannabis stocks that had risen like shooting stars as they grabbed the attention of retail investors on social media chatboards were all giving up those gains.

Anticipation of a sharp revival of the company's core ride-hailing operations as the economy reopens have pushed the stock up 25% since late January.
 Zillow  (NASDAQ:Z) stock jumped 15% after the online realtor delivered a solid quarterly update. It also announced plans to acquire Chicago-based ShowingTime for $500 million.

871,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 08:31AM ET</span>",Amsterdam displaces London as Europe's top stocks centre after Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Amsterdam has displaced London as Europe's biggest share trading centre after Britain left the European Union's single market, and picked up a chunk of UK derivatives business along the way, according to data published on Thursday.
Stock exchanges in the Dutch capital traded 9.2 billion euros ($11.15 billion) a day in January, compared to London's 8.6 billion, according to the Cboe exchange, which operates in both cities.
This compares with an average of 17.5 billion euros traded daily in London during 2020, when Frankfurt was second with 5.9 billion and Amsterdam sixth at 2.6 billion, Cboe said.
The City of London had long warned of the consequences of leaving the EU single market without adequate provisions for trade in services, and notably finance, which accounted for more than 10% of UK tax receipts before Brexit.
Exchange officials say the shift from London to Amsterdam is likely to be permanent since the EU has shown no sign of reversing its position that euro-denominated shares must be traded in the EU - whose internal market Britain left on Jan. 1.
The gap may narrow, however, as trading in Swiss shares resumed in Britain this month. It is averaging 250 million euros and is expected to build up towards over a billion euros a day - the level reached before trading of Swiss shares in London stopped in June 2019.
Separate data published on Thursday showed how chunks of trading in euro-denominated interest rate swaps have shifted from London, the world's biggest swaps trading centre, to platforms in the EU and New York since January.
Platforms in Amsterdam, and to a much lesser extent Paris, accounted for a quarter of the euro rate swaps market in January, up from just 10% last July, IHS Markit said.
Over the same period, London's share fell from just under 40% to just over 10%, with U.S. platforms doubling volumes to 20% of the total euro swaps market.
IHS Graphics - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkndmzpm/IHSMarkit%20Graphic.png
PAPERWORK DONE
As with shares, the swaps market has been fragmented by Brussels ""obliging"" EU-based firms to trade interest rate swaps and credit default swaps either on a platform inside the bloc, or in a non-EU country whose platforms have been approved for use, such as the United States.
London has not yet secured that ""equivalence"" because Brussels says it needs information about Britain's intentions to diverge from EU rules.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said London had already supplied the necessary paperwork and was ""one of the world's most pre-eminent financial centres, with a strong regulatory system"", adding that fragmenting markets was in no one's interests.
In any case, the three-way split between Britain, the EU and United States due to the EU ""derivatives trading obligation"" or DTO will not be reversed, a senior official from the EU's executive European Commission has said.
""For the foreseeable future, all three jurisdictions will have trading venues that offer all currencies in such volumes that keep the DTO in all currencies,"" Tilman Lueder, head of securities markets at the EU executive, told a Bloomberg event.
""The three-way liquidity split is going to stabilise.""
The Bank for International Settlements says the gross market value of euro rate swaps in the first half of last year was the equivalent of $5.2 trillion.
Brussels had been clear that it wanted euro-denominated financial activity shifted from London to build up its own capital market and have direct supervision.
Over 6 billion euros in daily trading left London on Jan. 4 for EU-based platforms.
The rise of Amsterdam, home to the world's oldest stock exchange, had been well flagged as pan-European share platforms - Cboe and London Stock Exchange's Turquoise in London - began preparing to open in the Amsterdam after Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU.
The ICE (NYSE:ICE) exchange announced this week that trading in EU carbon emissions will move from London to the Dutch city during the second quarter.

872,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 08:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Vietnam intervened in currency markets weeks after U.S. censure: sources,"By Phuong Nguyen and Tom Westbrook
HANOI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - After being branded a ""currency manipulator"" by the United States in December for trying to keep the dong from rising in value, Vietnam is again intervening in foreign exchange markets and using what traders say is an unusual method to do so, according to six people familiar with the matter and a review of an interbank trading message. 
Early in January, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) told some local banks it would cease its regular purchase of U.S. dollars in the spot market, where the trade settles within days, according to two senior currency traders and an analyst, who all work at local banks and have direct involvement in the trades.
The central bank offered the local banks an attractive deal instead: It would agree to buy dollars at a favourable rate for delivery in July, and it would allow the local banks to cancel this agreement before mid-June if they wished, according to the three sources and a review of trading instructions sent by the SBV for one such transaction. 
The new method of intervention, which has not been previously reported, put downward pressure on the dong but without money changing hands right away, which the sources said could help avoid drawing U.S. attention to the trades and any further consequences for bilateral relations. For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3aT8V0K
The SBV did not respond to requests for comment. 
There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Vietnam. Many central banks intervene regularly in currency markets. Vietnam has consistently said its currency policies aimed to maintain stability and control inflation, not seek trade advantage.
""We do not have anything public to share at this time,"" a Treasury official said in an emailed response to Reuters' queries about Vietnam's foreign exchange practices.
Vietnam, which has seen a surge in export-led growth as manufacturing of electronics and other goods, has increasingly shifted to the Southeast Asian nation, especially from China after its trade war with Washington.
A higher value of the dong because of its trade surplus could hurt this growth in the middle of a pandemic.
Nguyen Xuan Binh, who is head of research at KB Securities in Hanoi and familiar with the trades but not directly involved with them, said the delayed delivery of dollars meant Vietnam's central bank could avoid triggering one of the conditions behind the U.S. label: buying dollars in six of 12 consecutive months.
The Treasury's semi-annual report to Congress, which examines exchange rate policies of major trading partners, said in December that Vietnam's currency management was aimed at creating ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade."" 
It said Vietnam met all the conditions that trigger the currency manipulator designation, including ""persistent, one-sided intervention"" in the currency market.
The stakes are high for Vietnam since further interventions after the currency manipulator label could trigger a U.S. response, such as new tariffs on its goods. The next U.S. review is slated for April.
MARKET IMPACT
Under its January deals, the SBV offered the local banks an above-market rate of 23,125 dong per dollar, according to the three sources and written trading messages sent by the central bank. That rate is a premium of about 0.5% on current spot prices.
If the dong were to rise further between January and June, it would increase the premium over spot prices for the banks. And if the dong were to weaken below 23,125, they could then cancel the deal and sell dollars in the spot market instead. 
Reuters could not determine the size of the SBV's intervention, but the three traders said it was large enough to create demand for dollars in the market, which put downward pressure on the dong.
The currency's value in the black market, where the dong is often traded in the real economy, has fallen 1.1% as the traders said dollar supply may have dried up. 
UNUSUAL FORWARDS 
SBV's new transactions resemble financial derivatives known as forwards, which bind parties to exchange currencies at a future date at an agreed upon rate, the three sources said.
Forwards contracts offer several advantages to central banks. They do not require cash up-front and can help smooth out sudden shifts in reserves. Indeed, they are popular with other Asian central banks, such as those in India, Taiwan and South Korea.
But four of the people familiar with the transactions said SBV's agreements were not typical forward contracts, as they gave banks the option to cancel the deal without significant costs.
Two of them said the SBV had offered similar options previously, around 2015, although then it had been selling dollar forwards in order to try and support a sliding value of the dong.
As the SBV previously preferred to use three-month forward contracts, all six sources familiar with the transactions said the shift to a longer time frame suggested a desire to buy time before the intervention drew U.S. attention or pressure.

The SBV did not respond to questions about its approach.

Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) Inc. led the pack, surging 49% premarket to add to its 161% gain over the first three trading days of the week. FSD Pharma Inc. rose 21%, Organigram Holdings Inc. added 25%, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) Inc. gained 13% and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Inc. climbed 14%. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, known by its ticker MJ, rose 7.1%.
The moves are reminiscent of late 2018 when Canada was about to become the first large economy to legalize recreational marijuana use, sending cannabis stocks surging. Tilray’s three-day gain to start the week was its biggest ever, although it’s still well below the intraday high of $300 it hit in September 2018.
“As witnessed with GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC, retail investors from the WallStreetBet Reddit crowd obviously have a lot of influence and power,” said Matt  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN), managing partner at Entourage Effect Capital, a cannabis-only private equity firm. Hawkins said he doesn’t see as much risk to U.S.-focused cannabis companies from such activity, though some of the Canadian growers are more vulnerable.

Exactly what’s behind the sudden frenzy remains unclear. Some of the recent demand may be driven by wagers on the Cboe Volatility Index to rise.

Borsa Istanbul will reduce brokerages’ monthly membership fees by 10,000 liras ($1,420) for each report on stocks outside the benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index, according to a note sent by the exchange to brokers and seen by Bloomberg News. The aid will be capped at 70,000 liras for each firm and continue for the rest of the year.
The bourse said earlier this week it would offer financial support to brokerages to increase analyst reports on listed companies, without providing details. The exchange declined to make any further comment.
Borsa Istanbul’s move to boost small-cap research comes as Turkish retail traders are becoming an increasingly powerful presence in the local stock market, echoing a global trend that has seen day traders fueling sharp gains in the shares of a number of U.S. companies such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) Inc. Social media accounts specialized on local stocks have been popular among Turkish day traders. Some of the forums, including paid WhatsApp and Telegram groups, offer price targets and analysis from mostly amateur pundits.
“As the number of retail investors increases, it’s important to publish research reports that cover more companies to encourage the right investment decisions and healthy pricing,” Borsa Istanbul Chief Executive Officer Hakan Atilla said Monday in an emailed statement.
The market regulator and the exchange have previously warned inexperienced retail investors to be careful when picking stocks.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament on Thursday approved measures to suspend competitive access to airport slots throughout the summer as the coronavirus travel slump drags on.
Under normal rules, airlines must use 80% of their take-off and landing rights at busy airports or cede slots to competitors. The so-called ""use it or lose it"" rule was waived last March when the COVID-19 crisis grounded most flights.
The new measures approved on Thursday allow airlines to relinquish temporarily up to 50% of their slots in the summer season beginning on March 28 and use as little as half of those they retain without any permanent loss of access.
The suspension of slot rules has become a divisive subject, with low-cost carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air protesting that it thwarts their growth plans.
However, incumbent airlines warn that failure to suspend the rules would force them to fly planes empty to maintain slots, in a return to the ""ghost flights"" carried out by some airlines before the first waiver was approved.
Welcoming the parliament's vote, industry group Airlines for Europe said it would ""help to mitigate the economic impact of the crisis on European airlines, preserve future connectivity for EU citizens and avoid the unnecessary operation of empty flights and associated emissions"".

The measures adopted on Thursday also delegate authority to the European Commission to issue further extensions to the temporary rules and adjust the minimum useage threshold between 30% and 70%.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher Thursday, continuing the recent strong rally after Fed chief Jerome Powell reaffirmed that the central bank’s monetary policy will remain supportive for some time yet.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 70 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures traded 10 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 57 points, or 0.4%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at an all-time high Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also hit record highs intraday before closing lower. All three indices are on track to register their second positive week in a row.
Investors purchased $43.1 billion in equity funds in the week to Feb. 10, the most since at least mid-March 2019, Refinitiv Lipper data showed.
Stock markets have benefited from large amounts of financial largesse, both fiscal and monetary, as central banks and governments sought to try and support their Covid-hit economies.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated Wednesday that the central bank’s accommodative policies still need to stay in place for a considerable time, saying the employment picture is a “long way” from where it needs to be.
Additionally, talks are still underway in Washington over President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, although Congress currently seems to be fully focusing on former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial.
The S&P 500 index can still rise 10% from its current levels, despite high valuations, with improving economic growth and easy monetary policy helping to extend its rally, said Geneva-based Pictet Group.
This earnings season continues Thursday, with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Kellogg (NYSE:K) among the names due to provide numbers before the market opens. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) are scheduled to report after the bell.
Other companies in focus include Uber (NYSE:UBER), after the ride-hailing company released its latest results after the close Wednesday, and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), after the Canadian cannabis company became the focus of the same Reddit group that pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) higher.
On the economic data slate, the weekly initial jobless claims data are due for release, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), with a drop to 757,000 expected, from 779,000 the previous week.
Oil prices weakened Thursday, as traders banked profits after a strong rally, despite a larger than expected drop in U.S. crude supplies raised hopes of a recovery in demand in the world’s largest consumer.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration recorded late Wednesday a draw of 6.64 million barrels for the week to Feb. 5, with crude stocks falling for a third straight week to their lowest level since March. A small addition had been expected.
The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.7% to $61.02, after having risen for the previous nine sessions, its longest sustained period of gains since January 2019. U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $58.30 a barrel, with Wednesday having seen its eighth daily rise.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,843.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2130.

881,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>","Not perfect, but saves lives, AstraZeneca says of COVID-19 vaccine","By Pushkala Aripaka and Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine is not perfect, but will have a big impact on the pandemic, its chief executive predicted on Thursday, as the drugmaker pledged to double supplies to more than 200 million doses per month by April.
The two-dose shot, developed with Oxford University, has been hailed as a ""vaccine for the world"" because it is cheaper and easier to distribute than some rivals. 
But its rapid approval in Europe and elsewhere has been clouded by doubts over its most effective dosage and interval between doses. 
Data at the weekend also showed it was less effective against a fast-spreading South African variant of the virus, and the company has been embroiled in a row with the European Union over supply delays.
""Is it perfect? No it's not perfect, but it's great. Who else is making 100 million doses in February?"" CEO Pascal Soriot said on a conference call about the vaccine.
""We're going to save thousands of lives and that's why we come to work everyday.""
AstraZeneca said it expected much-anticipated data from the U.S. trial of the vaccine before the end of March, and that it was confident the shot offered relatively good protection against severe disease and death for the South African variant. Its disappointing results were against milder cases. 
However, after rising to become Britain's most valuable company last summer, the company has now slipped to sixth, in a move some analysts attribute to doubts over the vaccine. 
""In a year or two we will look back and everybody will realise we made a big impact,"" Soriot said. 
POSTER CHILD
AstraZeneca's shares were up more than 2% in morning trade, after the company forecast a pick up in earnings growth this year on strong demand for its cancer and other new therapies. 
It has pledged not to make any money from its COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic. 
The company said it expected 2021 revenues to rise by a low teens percentage and core earnings of $4.75 to $5.00 per share, as it beat expectations for fourth-quarter sales.
The earnings guidance equates to 18-24% growth, after 15% in 2020, but was a little lower than the $5.10 per share analysts were expecting, as the company flagged more spending this year. 
The COVID-19 vaccine is not included in the guidance and the company said its sales would be reported separately from the first quarter of 2021.
While public interest is focused on the vaccine, AstraZeneca's core business of diabetes, heart, kidney, and cancer medicines has been steadily growing, helping the company to turn around years of decline. 
Rounding off its third consecutive year of product sales growth, sales for the three months to December surpassed a company-compiled consensus, while core profit of $1.07 per share was in line with expectations. 
Cancer drugs sales, AstraZeneca's biggest field, jumped 28% in the quarter, led by its top-selling lung cancer drug Tagrisso.
""The company is arguably the poster child for big pharma turnarounds,"" said Third Bridge senior analyst Sebastian Skeet.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>","Commerzbank reports $3.3 billion Q4 loss as it counts cost of restructuring, pandemic","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) reported a $3.3 billion fourth-quarter loss on Thursday, sinking further into the red as it continued a major restructuring and dealt with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Its shares fell nearly 6% in mid-morning trade.
Germany's No. 2 bank also said it would swiftly implement plans to cut 10,000 jobs and close hundreds of branches, and would strive for an operating profit in 2021.
Commerzbank hopes the revamp will revive its fortunes, as it struggles to boost profits amid management reshuffles and strategy flip-flops. It has never fully recovered after a state bailout during the last financial crisis more than a decade ago.
The net loss of 2.70 billion euros ($3.27 billion) in the quarter compares with a loss of 97 million euros a year earlier. The bank had already disclosed that it lost nearly 2.9 billion euros for the full year.
The results come a week after Commerzbank Chief Executive Manfred Knof finalised plans for a radical overhaul and a month after he took the reins at the bank.
""We want to be sustainably profitable and shape our own destiny as an independent force in the German banking market,"" Knof said. 
The bank's shares were down 5.6% at 5.126 euros by 0902 GMT. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said that the bank's plans to complete 80% of redundancies by 2023 was slower than its analysts had hoped.
Commerzbank's share price had recovered after hitting a record low of 2.804 euros on March 16, 2020.
Knof is due to make his first public appearance as CEO at a news conference on Thursday.
While the bank plans to cut one out of three jobs in Germany, it will add 2,500 jobs outside the country, primarily in eastern Europe, in an effort to cut costs for external service providers. It will also expand headcount at its Polish unit mBank. 

Commerzbank said that depending on the course of the pandemic, it expects provisions of between 800 million euros and 1.2 billion euros in 2021. That compares with 1.75 billion euros in 2020.

883,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Eurozone Banks - Between Uncertainty and Awfulness,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s banks are using this earnings season as another illustration of why you can probably find better places to invest your money.
The long-hoped for bounce-back looks like it is going to have to wait a few more months, as a slow vaccination process delays the re-opening of the Eurozone economy and, consequently, the all-clear from fearful regulators on paying money out to shareholders.
Even in those cases where the banks are in a position to make such payouts, they still seem capable of finding ways to disappoint. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) CEO Jean Pierre Mustier bowed out on a low note after stuffing an 878 million euro ($1.06 billion) goodwill impairment into its fourth-quarter accounts late on Wednesday, ensuring that the bank’s net loss for the quarter – at 1.18 billion euros – was almost doubled the market forecast.
Unicredit stock fell 2.5% by late morning in Milan, although they are still up over 11% so far this year thanks to the broader rally in Italian stocks due to the nomination of former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi as Prime Minister. Draghi has made solid progress in convincing most of Italy’s big parties to back him.
The impairment rather overshadowed achievements that the market had already taken for granted, with underlying net profit coming in at 1.3 billion for the year, a modest but still positive result.
For 2021, Unicredit expects underlying profit to more than double to 3 billion euros, while return on tangible equity should improve even faster from last year’s 2.5%, helped by 800 million in stock buybacks. European regulators are likely to purse their lips and frown, but if a bank with a common equity tier 1 ratio of over 15% can’t make distributions, it’s hard to see why any private investor would want to get involved.
Even Unicredit, well-capitalized and more profitable than many Eurozone banks, faces some key risks. If the biggest of them revolves around Italy’s economy emerging from the pandemic, then the next biggest is surely the fate of perennial basket case Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (MI:BMPS), which the previous government wanted Unicredit to absorb.
Mustier stepped down ostensibly in protest at such pressure, and the task of negotiating terms will now fall to UBS veteran Andrea Orcel, who will join the bank in April. Orcel will doubtless appreciate the irony of having to negotiate any deal with Draghi, who as governor of the Bank of Italy in 2007 approved BMPS's ruinous takeover of Banca Antonveneta, an event largely responsible for today's mess.
But if things look uninspiring in Italy, they look downright dismal in Germany, where the agonizing death of Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) drags on.  Commerzbank stock fell another 6.5% after the bank confirmed a loss of 2.7 billion euros due to its third major restructuring in five years.
The latest plan foresees the cutting of 10,000 jobs and the closure of nearly half its branches in Germany. But the country’s strict labor laws mean the process will drag on to 2023, a timeline that left the market, yet again, deflated.  "

885,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 05:41AM ET</span>","With oil past peak, Shell vows to eliminate carbon by 2050","By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) - Energy giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) vowed to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050, raising its ambition from previous targets, as oil output was set to decline from its 2019 peak.
The Anglo-Dutch company is in the midst of its largest overhaul yet as it prepares to expand its renewables and low-carbon business in the face of growing investor pressure on the oil and gas sector to battle climate change.
Shell last year laid out a plan to reach net zero by 2050, in line with the Paris climate agreement and European Union ambitions, but it said the goal depended on its customers.
In a strategy update on Thursday, Shell outlined plans focused on rapid growth of its low-carbon businesses, including biofuels and hydrogen, although spending will stay tilted towards oil and gas in the near future. 
""We will use our established strengths to build on our competitive portfolio as we make the transition,"" CEO Ben van Beurden said in a statement.
Investors welcomed the upgraded targets.
""Shell's net zero target is industry-leading and comprehensive as it covers all their carbon emissions,"" Adam Matthews, Director of Ethics & Engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, who led investor engagement with Shell, said in a statement. 
Shareholders will be able to vote on Shell's transition plan at this year's general meeting, an industry first, Matthews added.
Shell shares were down 1.1% at 0840 GMT.
Its strategy is to continue to rely on its retail business, the world's largest, aiming to increase the number of sites to 55,000 by 2025 from today's 46,000 and increase the number of electric vehicle charging points to 500,000 from 60,000 now.
Shell did not outline any plans to grow its solar and wind power generation capacity, marking a difference from rivals, such as BP (NYSE:BP) and Total, which both aim to boost their ownership of physical wind and solar farms.
In the near term, Shell will invest at least $5 billion a year in what it calls its growth pillar, dividing the investment roughly equally between its trading and retail business and renewables units. It previously aimed to spend up to $3 billion on renewables and marketing combined.
Its upstream business, or oil and gas production, will attract a larger share of its budget at $8 billion. It will also spend $4 billion on its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business and up to $5 billion on chemicals and refining.
Total spending is expected to remain within a range of $19 to $22 billion per year.
NET-ZERO EMISSIONS
Shell, which said its greenhouse gas emissions peaked in 2018, accelerated its plans to reduce carbon emissions.
It aims to reduce its net intensity by between 6% and 8% from 2016 levels by 2023. The target rises to 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035 and 100% by the middle of the century.
The company previously said it would reduce its net carbon footprint emission intensity metric by at least 3% by 2022, 30% by 2035 and 65% by 2050 from a 2016 baseline. 
Intensity levels represent emissions per unit of energy produced, technically allowing higher production. 
Most European energy majors have set some kind of net-zero carbon target by 2050.
Graphics: Big Oil's 2019 greenhouse gas emissions Big Oil's 2019 greenhouse gas emissions - https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-CARBON/oakpeygqrpr/chart.png
Shell's ambition differs from BP's in that it covers the emissions from the end-use of products other companies have produced but which Shell sells to customers.
Shell's total carbon emissions, which include its own production as well as sales of products to customers, peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes. Shell is the world's largest oil and gas trader.
Oil production is expected to gradually be reduced by 1% to 2% each year from a 2019 peak of around 1.8 million barrels per day, including divestments of oilfields and the natural decline of fields. 
But it will rely on revenue from its oil and gas division to pay for shareholder returns and the transition.

BP aims to reduce its oil output by 40% by 2030.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 05:41AM ET</span>",Analysis: Merkel's vote of confidence in Deutsche Bank belies lender's problems,"By Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Angela Merkel will give a welcome speech at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s annual New Year reception on Thursday, marking a rare appearance by the German chancellor at an event by a bank that for years has been battling losses and scandals. 
Merkel will be speaking just a week after the lender reported its first annual profit since 2014, an important milestone in CEO Christian Sewing's efforts to revive Deutsche's fortunes.
But investors and analysts said that despite Merkel's symbolic vote of confidence, the bank's prospects remain uncertain. 
They applaud Sewing for cutting costs but question the bank's ability to generate income after revenue in all its core businesses fell last year apart from the investment bank.
Thanks to a pandemic-sparked trading boom, Deutsche managed to make lemonade out of lemons last year, said Alexandra Annecke, portfolio manager at Union Investment, a shareholder in the bank. ""The bank is still on thin ice.""
Deutsche, which is in the midst of a major overhaul, is forecast to make 1.6 billion euros less in revenue in 2022 than in 2020, a drop of 6%, based on a consensus forecast of analysts. 
All divisions are expected to generate roughly the same or less over that period, with the exception of asset management.
The bank declined to comment for this story.
""We have to ask Christian Sewing where he wants to earn his money in the next three to five years,"" Klaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW said. ""The bank needs more fields where they can earn the money they need.""
Deutsche has some ideas in the pipeline. The private bank division that focuses on retail customers, with its 22 million clients, hopes to broaden the number of customers that are charged fees for deposits, bankers at the unit have said.
The asset management division is seeking to grow in Asia, while the corporate bank wants to expand in the area of merchant payments.
""It's actually crucial ... to revitalise the corporate banking franchise in those areas where they so far lack presence,"" said Michael Rohr, analyst with Moody's (NYSE:MCO), one of the ratings agencies that has become more confident in the bank's outlook.
Increasing profitability in the other areas is important to diversify the bank's revenue streams, Ioana Sima, a director at Fitch, said.
""If the investment bank has a bad year, which it may have, then these other businesses are able to carry it,"" Sima said.
Sewing has said the investment bank should contribute only 30% of core revenues. In 2020, it accounted for close to 40%.
Low interest rates and fierce competition have depressed profits for banks across Europe, which is why Sewing, who took the helm in 2018 to turn the bank around, has largely focused on costs. He is cutting 18,000 jobs and has closed some businesses.
DISTANCE
Merkel has largely kept her distance from the country's banking industry since the 2008 financial crisis triggered unpopular taxpayer-financed bailouts. 
This year, Merkel's office said she was delighted to accept Sewing's invitation to Thursday's reception, which will be virtual.
""In view of the 150-year history of Germany's largest bank, and the importance of the German banking industry in the current challenging situation, an appreciative tribute is only natural,"" her office said.
Privately, bankers have grumbled that Germany's politicians are loath to support the industry as they would other sectors, like cars.
As well as financial troubles, Deutsche has had to cope with a series of scandals and costly regulatory failings, including over money laundering. 
In his efforts to turn the page on this era, Sewing has bolstered the bank's compliance operations. He has urged employees to reclaim their ""hunter mentality"" and has preached ruthless cost control.
But it is too early to judge whether he has succeeded in turning the bank around. 

""The jury is still out,"" said Giles Edwards, analyst with S&P.

887,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>",Analysis: Investors lukewarm on Tesla's $1.5 billion bitcoin splurge,"By April Joyner and Kate Duguid
(Reuters) - Investors in high-flying electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc are questioning whether Elon Musk's $1.5 billion outlay into bitcoin will be as good for the company as it has been for the cryptocurrency.
Tesla's disclosure on Monday that it had moved nearly 8% of its reserves into bitcoin sent the price of the cryptocurrency to all-time highs, up more than 16% this week, while Tesla's shares are down nearly 6%. Others may follow Tesla's lead, with  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s chief financial officer telling CNBC that the company has considered adding bitcoin to its balance sheet.
Shareholders voiced concern that the investment by Tesla, which recently joined the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, could fuel more gyrations in the company's shares.
""It will add volatility to the stock due to exposure to bitcoin,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, whose firm has owned Tesla shares since 2015. ""This is better for bitcoin than it is for Tesla."" 
Gary Black, former chief executive of Aegon (NYSE:AEG) Asset Management and now a private investor who has been bullish on Tesla since 2019, on Monday announced https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1358795340862873602 on Twitter that he had sold his Tesla shares. He cited the absence of a 2021 delivery target and the company's riskier capital allocation strategy, among other reasons. 
Black also tweeted https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1358833329118851073 on Monday: ""$TSLA has always been higher risk, but investing $1.5B in #Bitcoin makes it more risky."" He did not respond to a request for comment. 
The difficulty of valuing the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency over the long term was also a cause for concern to investors. 
""Elon Musk has exposed Tesla to immense mark-to-market risk,"" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a research note, referring to an accounting method designed to measure the fair value of accounts -- assets and liabilities -- in order to provide a measure of current financial performance.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Garnry also wrote that investors with concentrated positions in Tesla, such as ARK Invest, are at risk. Tesla is the top holding of the flagship ARK Innovation Fund https://ark-funds.com/arkk#holdings, representing 8.75% of the portfolio.
Brett Winton, ARK's director of research, said Tesla's bitcoin investment was an ""appropriate use of cash"" and it did not change the firm's outlook on the carmaker.
""We are comfortable with the way in which we are forecasting the positions we are putting our clients in front of,"" he said.
On the fixed-income side, investors had mixed views on the impact of the bitcoin investment.
Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory, who holds Tesla's asset-backed securities tied to the company's auto leasing business but does not own its corporate bonds, said while bitcoin can be easily converted into cash, ""you don't know what kind of value you would get or how quickly you could realize that value.""
""If I were an unsecured bond holder, I would be very unhappy about this,"" said Graff. 
Another fixed-income investor, who requested anonymity because of a position in Tesla's bonds, said the volatility would matter more for equity holders as Tesla has sufficient money to pay out its bondholders. Tesla last year raised cash, partly to ease future debt pressures.
Musk, Tesla's chief executive, holds the greatest portion of outstanding Tesla shares, according to Refinitiv data, followed by Capital World Investors, The Vanguard Group Inc, Baillie Gifford & Co and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Institutional Trust Inc. Vanguard declined to comment, while Capital World Investors and BlackRock did not respond to inquiries. 
Baillie Gifford partner James Anderson told The Times https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/investors-may-put-brakes-on-elon-musks-bitcoin-sprees-at-tesla-6wvqfkh9q that he was content with the purchase, but his firm would discuss setting limits on how much could be put into the asset. Baillie Gifford declined comment. 
Still, investors in Tesla have been rewarded for sticking with one of Wall Street's most controversial stocks. Over the past 12 months shares have risen 422%.
Indeed, the popularity of Musk's outsized public persona may mean that many longtime investors are ultimately inclined to view the move positively. 

""I've been following this company a long time and … they make the big decisions right,"" said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Tanaka, president and chief investment officer of Tanaka Capital Management, which holds Tesla shares.

888,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",Tencent says exec being probed over links to 'personal' corruption allegations,"By Pei Li and Scott Murdoch
(Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd said a company executive is being investigated by authorities over allegations of ""personal corruption"", after a media report said the move was linked to sharing of personal data from its popular WeChat app.
The move comes amid Beijing's unprecedented crackdown on its home-grown internet platforms, which has ensnared some of its best technology innovators and private-sector champions over violations of anti-trust and data privacy rules.
Any violation of customer data protection rules would pile more pressure on the local technology companies, already dealing with heightened regulatory scrutiny after years of a laissez-faire approach. 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that a Tencent executive has been held by Chinese authorities as part of an inquiry into a high-profile corruption case involving one of the country's former top law-enforcement officials.
""We can confirm that case relates to allegations of personal corruption and has no relation to Weixin or WeChat,"" Tencent said in a statement to Reuters.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal reported that the executive, Zhang Feng, has been under investigation by China's anti-graft inspector since last year over alleged unauthorized sharing of personal data collected by Tencent's social-media app WeChat.
Tencent said in statement to Reuters that Zhang's case was not related to its international WeChat app or domestic Weixin platform. It declined to elaborate further. 
""This is just one more instance of Beijing entrenching control over the large and powerful tech giants under its purview,"" LightSTream Research analyst Mio Kato, who publishes on Smartkarma, told Reuters.
""This seems like an extension of the previous anti-corruption campaign that was focused on the political structure.""
The Journal report said Zhang was suspected of turning over WeChat data to former vice public security minister Sun Lijun, who is being investigated by Beijing for undisclosed violations of Communist Party rules. (https://on.wsj.com/2NdMuv9)
Investigators were looking at what type of data Zhang might have shared with Sun and what Sun might have done with it, the report said.
ANTI-GRAFT DRIVE
The report comes as Chinese regulators and state media are becoming increasingly vocal about infringement of consumer rights by tech companies, which use personal data to drive businesses - from selling products to acquiring customers. 
Chinese technology companies have also come under pressure to double down on corruption investigations in recent years, as a result of President Xi Jinping's year-long anti-graft drive.
Tencent said earlier this month it had fired more than 100 staff over embezzlement and bribery incidents.
Shares in Tencent, which is the most valuable company in Hong Kong with more than $900 billion in market capitalization, fell as much as 1.6% after the Journal report but pulled back later to end down 0.5% in a positive broader market.
Zhang was referred to as a Tencent vice president in a 2018 statement released by the municipal government of Zhangjiakou, a city near Beijing. Tencent, however, told Reuters he was not a vice president or a senior executive, without elaborating.
The Journal said Zhang could not be reached for comment, and Sun didn't respond to a comment request sent through anti-graft inspectors, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the State Council Information Office (SCIO). 
The CCDI and SCIO did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

889,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>","Global stocks nudge higher, sustained by bottomless stimulus","By Tom Arnold and Wayne Cole
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global shares rose for a ninth day running on Thursday, just off record highs, as investors digested recent gains, while bulls were sustained by the promise of more free money after a benign U.S. inflation report and a dovish Federal Reserve outlook.
European stocks opened higher, with the STOXX 600 and London's FTSE 100 up 0.3%. That followed a subdued Asian session as markets in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were closed for holidays.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.1%, having already climbed for four sessions to gain more than 10% so far this year.
Investors were also reflecting on the first phone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, where Biden said a free and open Indo-Pacific was a priority and Xi warning confrontation would be a ""disaster"" for both nations.
With Chinese markets closed, there was little reaction to news the Biden administration will look at adding ""new targeted restrictions"" on certain sensitive technology exports to China and would maintain tariffs for now.
Futures for the S&P 500 were 0.2% higher, having hit historic highs on Wednesday. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was 0.1% higher. That was not far from peaks reached the day before and just sustaining a nine-day streak of gains, a first since October 2017. 
""The story really is still U.S. equities first and foremost,"" said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""Earnings season has been especially strong in the U.S., the fiscal stimulus coming from the Biden administration is getting bigger in the market's mind and most of the big winners from the pandemic are U.S. listed.
""Only the Fed can rock the boat and with yesterday’s disappointing inflation print that prospect has just slipped even further into the future.""
The outlook for more global stimulus got a major boost overnight from a surprisingly soft reading on core U.S. inflation, which eased to 1.4% in January.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he wanted to see inflation reach 2% or more before even thinking of tapering the bank's super-easy policies.
Notably, Powell emphasised that once pandemic effects were stripped out, unemployment was nearer 10% than the reported 6.3% and thus a long way from full employment.
As a result, Powell called for a ""society-wide commitment"" to reducing unemployment, which analysts saw as strong support for President Joe Biden $1.9 trillion stimulus package.
Westpac economist Elliot Clarke estimated over $5 trillion in cumulative stimulus, worth 23% of GDP, would be required to repair the damage done by the pandemic.
""Financial conditions are expected to remain highly supportive of the U.S. economy and global financial markets in 2021, and likely through 2022,"" he said.
The mix of bottomless Fed funds and a tame inflation report encouraged bond markets, leaving 10-year yields at 1.14%, down from a 1.20% high early in the week.
Italian bond yields remained near recent lows before a long-term bond auction and as Mario Draghi was expected to present his new government coalition in the next few days. Italy's 10-year BTP, or government bond, yield was down one basis point down at 0.490%, near its lowest since early January.
After the U.S. inflation report and the Fed's Powell reiterating that rates could stay lower for longer, the U.S. dollar slipped before steadying during European trading. The dollar index was flat at 90.438, away from a 10-week top of 91.600 touched late last week.
Gold was up 0.1% at $1,845.26 per ounce, as investors drove platinum to a six-year peak on bets of more demand from car makers. [GOL/]
Oil prices dipped, having enjoyed the longest winning streak in two years amid producer supply cuts and hopes vaccine rollouts will drive a recovery in demand. [O/R]

Brent crude futures eased back 39 cents to $61.07. U.S. crude dipped 36 cents to $58.31 a barrel.

(Reuters) - Geneva-based Pictet Group's asset management arm expects the S&P 500 to rise 10% from its current levels, with improving economic growth and easy monetary policy helping to extend its rally. 
The S&P 500 has risen around 21% from its October lows, and closed on Wednesday at 3909.88 points.
""There is a risk of a melt up in a way, in the U.S. especially, and you don't want to stand against it,"" Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Wednesday.
But valuations were high at current levels, said Paolini, whose company manages more than $200 billion in assets.
U.S. bond yields may rise in the next three-to-six months due to an uptick in inflation expectations and possibly some pre-emptive Fed guidance on tapering its massive stimulus programme, Paolini said.He expected the 10-year treasury yield to end 2021 around 1.25%, last seen in March 2020. It is currently at 1.14%.
Paolini said global inflation levels are likely to remain low this year, but accelerate in 2022 when the global economy is expected to return to near-full potential.
But there was still a risk of rising inflation, which should be hedged with gold, some commodities and U.S. TIPS, or treasury inflation protected securities, he added.
Paolini called high-yielding corporate bonds an ""incredibly risky"" investment in the context of U.S. junk bonds falling below 4% for the first time ever.
To make a good return at this level (in junk bonds), he said, ""you need to have ... no rise in bond yields, no Fed taper, decline in default rates, a strong economy, and I think it is quite unlikely that you're going to get all of that.""

Paolini said there was not a strong case for bitcoin prices to rise in the long term, calling the meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies a side effect of a long period of monetary expansion.
""That's a very speculative asset class, which I think is ... incredibly dangerous.""
Bitcoin powered to a record high earlier this week, nearing$50,000, following Elon Musk-led Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s investment in the cryptocurrency that had investors believing it may become a mainstream asset class.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday, helped by solid earnings releases, including gains for  Credit Agricole  (OTC:CRARY), during a busy day for corporate news.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index climbed 0.5% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%.
Stock markets have posted strong gains over the last few months on expectations that additional U.S. fiscal stimulus coupled with global vaccination programs would usher in a period of economic growth as the influence of the coronavirus pandemic waned.
However, the ongoing earnings season has been the dominant driving force Thursday, with the banking sector in particular focus.
Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) stock soared 5.1% after the Paris-based bank indicated that the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic may have passed, reporting lower provisions and a larger-than-expected return to dividends.
On the flip side, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock fell 5.1% after the German lender said that its revenue will probably shrink “slightly” this year after reporting a quarterly loss of 2.7 billion euros ($3.3 billion) after writing down asset values and booking costs for future job cuts.
UniCredit (MI:CRDI) stock fell 2.3% after the Italian bank posted a larger than expected quarterly loss late Wednesday after writing down the value of its investment banking business while CEO Jean Pierre Mustier stepped down.
Elsewhere, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock rose 1.8% after the U.K.-based drugmaker beat quarterly sales estimates and forecast 2021 growth even without its Covid-19 vaccine;  Danone  PA:DANO) stock climbed 3% after investment company Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM) demanded strategic changes at the French foods company; and ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) stock fell 0.5% after the steel giant reinstated its dividend and named Aditya Mittal as its new chief executive officer.
Additionally, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock climbed 1% after the German car maker announced it was teaming up with U.S. tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to speed up the development of automated driving.
Fresh economic data was thin on the ground in Europe Thursday, but investors will watch the release of the weekly jobless claims numbers in the U.S. carefully later in the session. 
Oil prices weakened Thursday, as traders banked profits after a strong rally, despite a larger than expected drop in U.S. crude supplies raising hopes of a recovery in demand in the world’s largest consumer.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration recorded late Wednesday a draw of 6.64 million barrels for the week to Feb. 5, with crude stocks falling for a third straight week to their lowest level since March. A small addition had been expected.
The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $61.09, after having risen for the previous nine sessions, its longest sustained period of gains since January 2019. U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $58.35 a barrel, with Wednesday having seen its eighth daily rise.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,843.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2123.

892,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 03:45AM ET</span>",ArcelorMittal Resumes Payouts as Aditya Mittal Named CEO,"(Bloomberg) -- ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) reinstated its dividend and named Aditya Mittal as its new chief executive officer after a rebounding steel market helped the company shrug off the impact of the pandemic.
The new CEO is the son of the founder of the steelmaking giant, Lakshmi Mittal, 70, who becomes executive chairman. The 45-year-old, formerly chief financial officer and head of the company’s European business, has spent an apprenticeship of more than two decades preparing for the role. In 2006, at the age of just 30, Aditya Mittal also spearheaded the steel industry’s biggest ever deal.
“We have worked closely together since he joined the company in 1997, indeed in recent years we have effectively been managing the company together,” the elder Mittal said in a statement. “We will continue to work very closely together and I remain as fascinated, engaged and committed to the company’s long-term success as ever.”
Mittal is stepping back from day-to-day operations as ArcelorMittal rewards investors with a revived dividend and series of share buybacks after years of focusing on debt reduction. The company expects steel demand -- a key barometer for global economic growth -- to rebound this year, after contracting in 2020.
The succession is “a transition plan long in the works and understood by the market,” said Alan Spence, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
ArcelorMittal shares rose as much as 4.1%, before trading down 0.5% as of 9:32 a.m. in Amsterdam.
Reinstating the dividend will be a boost for Lakshmi Mittal, the billionaire steel magnate who owns 36% of the company. Mittal, who was once the U.K.’s richest man, built the company from a rolling mill in Indonesia in 1976, before transforming the industry with the $34 billion takeover of his largest rival Arcelor 30 years later.
Aditya Mittal, who previously worked in  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s investment bank, played a key role in driving that acquisition. His plan catapulted Mittal from being the owner of older plants, mainly in emerging markets, to the world’s biggest and most advanced steelmaker. It also lumbered the company with debt that it’s spent the past 15 years trying to escape from.
Now he faces the twin challenges of fighting off low-cost output from Turkey to China, while curbing the business’s carbon emissions.
“I’m very much looking forward to this next chapter,” the new CEO said on a conference call. “I’m focused on ensuring we continue to perform well and the biggest challenge of the day is how we decarbonize the steel industry.”
ArcelorMittal achieved its debt target as the company generated cash flow with the recovery in the global economy from the initial effects of Covid-19. Steelmakers from India to Japan have flagged a recovery after the pandemic crushed consumption last year.
“Although we must continue to navigate the Covid-19 challenge, I expect 2021 to be another year of progress for the company, and look forward to working closely with Aditya our new CEO,” the executive chairman said.
ArcelorMittal will pay a dividend of 30 cents a share, the company said. The company also announced a new $570 million share buyback program.
The steelmaker has focused on consolidation, selling its North American operations to Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) Inc. and shuttering an unprofitable furnace in Poland. It also sold most of its stake in the beleaguered Ilva mill to the Italian government.
Global steel demand will increase by 4.5% to 5.5% this year, the company said Thursday in its full-year earnings statement.
ArcelorMittal reported fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $1.73 billion.

Stock markets have posted strong gains over the last few months on expectations that additional U.S. fiscal stimulus coupled with global vaccination programs would usher in a period of economic growth as the influence of the coronavirus pandemic waned.

With this in mind, the ongoing earnings season is likely to be the dominant driving force Thursday, with the banking sector in particular focus.
Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) reported net income of 124 million euros ($150 million) in the fourth quarter, despite a goodwill charge at its Italian unit. The Paris-based bank indicated that the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic may have passed, reporting lower provisions and a larger-than-expected return to dividends.

Shares climbed as much as 50% to 27 baht before trading at 24.10 baht as of 10:04 a.m. in Bangkok. The company sold 2.61 billion shares to the public at 18 baht, the top end of the marketed price range. The company also has a so-called greenshoe option of 390 million shares.
PTT Oil becomes the third mega Thai IPO in the past year after Central Retail Corp.’s record $2.5 billion offering in February last year and SCG Packaging (NYSE:PKG) Pcl’s $1.3 billion share sale in October. PTT Oil’s IPO drew more than 500,000 subscriptions from retail investors, the highest ever booking by number of investors, according to the company’s statement.
Equity offerings have been proving exceedingly popular of late, with many companies popping on their debuts. Ultra-low interest rates and expectations of more stimulus have stoked a stock rally and boosted demand for share sales, while leading some to warn of frothy markets.
The Thai stock exchange’s daily trading turnover averaged about 94 billion baht ($3.14 billion) so far this year, a 50% jump from the same period a year earlier, boosted by new retail investors, according to the bourse’s data.
Last week Chinese short-video app Kuaishou Technology surged 161% on its debut in Hong Kong, the second-best ever for an IPO of over $1 billion. About one of every five people in the financial hub submitted orders for shares, a record number.
Plentiful cash and coronavirus-induced lockdowns have led to an increase in retail trading globally, which has contributed to some volatile stock moves as seen with  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME)., as well as hugely oversubscribed share sales.

In Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.03% by 8:42 PM ET (1:42 AM GMT).
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.81%. Trading was light as many offices will close early ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays. The city could ease some COVID-19 restrictions, such as limiting public gatherings to two people and limiting both the number of people in and operation hours at restaurants, provided there are no spikes in cases over the holidays. Government services are also set to return to their normal hours of business.
Moves in other parts of Asia were also muted, with Korea and China already celebrating the Lunar New Year holidays. Markets in Japan are also closed for a holiday.
U.S. shares remained flat near the record high that opened the session. U.S. inflation data released shortly thereafter showed that the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew 1.4% year-on-year in January, below the 1.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and December’s 1.6% growth. The core CPI was flat month-on-month, against the predicted 0.2% growth and the 0.1% growth recorded in December.
The CPI grew 0.3% month-on-month in January, against December’s 0.2% growth, and grew 1.4% year-on-year, below the forecast 1.5% growth but above December’s 1.3% growth.
All the data pointed to scant inflation and became part of the ongoing debate over inflation’s course. Despite the data, some investors continued to argue that price pressures will intensify in the coming months. U.S. President Joe Biden continues to push his proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package through Congress and easing COVID-19 restrictions, thanks to vaccine rollouts and falling numbers of cases, is likely to spur consumer spending.
“While inflation is not showing up in the data right now, inflation is on its way thanks to fiscal and monetary stimulus and pent-up consumer demand that should intensify as the economy reopens,” Quadratic Capital Management founder Nancy Davis said in a note.
Other investors agreed.
“Some of the steam has run out of the engine over the last couple of trading sessions … we’ve had a good run, but the data hasn’t kept up,"" Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr told Reuters. He added that bond yields and stocks could still end the year higher after a pause in the reflation trade.

Nearly complete recoveries in markets including Brazil and Australia point to leisure travel to restaurants and cultural events bouncing back quickly once the pandemic ends, with business travel returning more slowly, as many employees continue to work from home. 
Shares fell 3% in after-hours trading after gaining around 6% during the day. Shares had risen after smaller ride-hail rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) said on Tuesday it might become profitable during the third quarter, three months ahead of a previous goal, thanks to a rebound and cost cuts.
Uber reported a loss on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $454 million, significantly less than analysts' average expectations for a $514 million loss, according to Refinitiv data.
Uber cut costs throughout 2020, including reducing staff by nearly 30% from the beginning of the year. A focus on its core rides and food delivery business and divestments of ancillary units will allow Uber to emerge from the pandemic a slimmer company.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the cost of the company's extensive stock-based compensation and other potentially significant items, is the profitability metric Uber uses.
Uber reported $3.17 billion in total revenue in the months from October through December.
Fourth-quarter mobility revenue, largely comprised of rides, declined by 52% from last year, but at $1.47 billion was up 8% on a quarterly basis despite new lockdown measures in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.
The company said it could not predict the quarter in which ride-hail volumes might return to pre-pandemic levels. Airport travel, which made up 15% of gross bookings before the pandemic, will take longer to return than leisure and business trips, Uber said.
It expected first-quarter adjusted EBITDA to be flat or down compared with the fourth quarter.
Orders at Uber's food delivery platform, Uber Eats, further grew during the fourth quarter, as many countries and U.S. states issued new lockdown orders, closing restaurants and prompting many people to order in. 
Delivery revenue more than tripled from last year and at around $1.36 billion, grew 19% compared with the third quarter. 
Uber has expanded its footprint in the competitive space and acquired smaller food-delivery rival Postmates for $2.65 billion and alcoholic beverage delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion.
Both deals were largely stock-based, with the Drizly deal expected to close later this year. 
Uber also said it had further lowered costs in the fourth quarter, with total costs and expenses dropping 14% in that period. 
Following a directive by Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi to focus on the company's core businesses, Uber has sold two cash-burning units.
The company in December sold its self-driving Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) in a $4 billion equity deal at a steep drop in valuation. Khosrowshahi at the time said the deal would accelerate Uber's profitability goal.

The same month, Uber also handed over the keys to its air taxi business Elevate, without disclosing the terms of the deal.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Two senior  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co executives responsible for defending corporate clients against activist investors who push for companies to perform better have left the bank, three sources said.
Benjamin Wilson, head of shareholder activism defense for North America resigned this month to take another job in the banking industry while Kirshlen Moodley, who was head of the practice in Europe, Middle East and Africa, left late in 2020, the sources said.
Wilson who has worked at JP Morgan since 2008 and rose through the ranks in the bank's Mergers & Acquisitions department is moving to position at Guggenheim Partners, two sources said.
Moodley, who worked at the bank for nine years, now works at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) CIB in London, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
JP Morgan declined to comment.
The moves come only a few months after the bank revamped its shareholder defense practice in August when it promoted David Freedman to oversee the business globally after David Hunker left the bank. 
Activism defense has become a major franchise for investment banks, as hedge funds such as Elliott Management, Starboard Value and Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) push for changes at companies.

There has been movement among banks in the last months. In January, UBS hired Aneliya Crawford from law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP to co-head its activism defense group.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday asked two federal appeals courts to put on hold government appeals of lower court rulings blocking restrictions the Trump administration imposed on Chinese-owned app TikTok.
Under former President Donald Trump, the Commerce Department sought to ban Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google app stores from offering TikTok for download to new users and to ban other technical transactions TikTok said would effectively barred the app's use in the United States.
Three federal judges in separate rulings blocked Commerce orders on TikTok and for Chinese-owned WeChat.
The Justice Department told appeals courts for the District of Columbia and the Third Circuit that the Commerce Department ""plans to conduct an evaluation of the underlying record justifying those prohibitions"" to determine if they are warranted by the national security threat Trump described.
Late Wednesday, the Third Circuit agreed to cancel oral arguments that had been set for Thursday and directed the government to file a status report in 60 days.
Earlier, the White House said it has an ongoing review of risks TikTok may present to U.S. data but stressed it has taken no new ""proactive step"" related to a pending plan for U.S. investors to acquire the Chinese-owned company's American operations.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said ""it is not accurate to suggest that there is a new proactive step by the Biden White House"" related to TikTok.
She said the administration was still conducting a comprehensive review of the ""risks to U.S. data ... including from TikTok, and will address them in a decisive and effective fashion.""
Reuters on Wednesday, citing two people briefed on the matter, reported that the plan unveiled in September for U.S. investors, including  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, to buy a majority stake in TikTok's American operations could face months of additional reviews, as the new Biden administration conducts a wide-ranging review of China policy.
The Trump administration had contended that TikTok poses national security concerns as the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China’s government. TikTok, which has over 100 million users in the United States, has denied the allegation.
Many key Biden administration officials are not yet in place to review TikTok's status. TikTok declined to comment.
Walmart declined to comment. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.
Under pressure from the Trump administration, ByteDance, which owns TikTok, was in talks for months to finalize the deal with Walmart and Oracle to shift TikTok’s American assets into a new entity to address U.S. security concerns. Those talks have continued since Biden took office last month, sources said.

In early December, the Trump administration chose not to grant ByteDance a new extension of an August order that required the company to divest TikTok’s U.S. assets. The Justice Department had the power to enforce the divestiture order once the deadline expired, but it has taken no enforcement action.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Audrey Strauss, will remain in her job for the present, federal officials said on Wednesday.
Strauss, based in Manhattan, occupies one of the nation's most prominent federal prosecutor's posts. 
Her office is currently handling several high-profile criminal cases, including prosecutions of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two former associates of ex-President Donald Trump lawyer and former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and of Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
Strauss began serving as acting U.S. Attorney last June after Trump and then-Attorney General William Barr moved to oust U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. When Berman resisted efforts to persuade him to leave voluntarily, Trump fired him, leaving Strauss as his acting successor.
In December, the office of the Southern District's chief judge issued a statement saying that while Strauss' term of office as acting U.S. Attorney expired on Jan. 15, 2021, the court unanimously decided to retain her as the Manhattan-based federal prosecutor ""until a United States Attorney, nominated by the president and appointed with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, takes office.""
A Justice Department official told Reuters Strauss would continue as the Manhattan-based prosecutor, but did not respond when asked whether the Biden administration at some point would move to replace her.
On Tuesday, the Justice Department asked most federal prosecutors appointed during Trump's presidency to resign. Strauss is one of the few federal prosecutors who will remain on the job. 

Others remaining include a Delaware-based prosecutor whose office is conducting a tax probe of President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden and John Durham, appointed by Barr as ""special counsel"" to investigate the origins of federal investigations of links between Trump, his entourage and Russia.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged slightly lower from record levels on Wednesday as energy and financials rose but some big tech stocks limited gains amid an ongoing rotation of portfolio holdings.
Remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who reassured investors interest rates will remain low for some time to spur the economy and jobs growth, provided no new insights on the U.S. central bank's stance on monetary policy.
Powell is reiterating the Fed’s stance on staying with interest rates where they are until you see sustained inflation, said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for Private Wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia. ""I don’t think anything coming out there is surprising.""
A wave of selling in high-riding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's and lesser declines in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) pulled the Nasdaq down and weighed the most on the S&P 500.
The consumer discretionary index was the biggest drag on the S&P, with information technology another drag. On the upside, energy and financials rose.
A broadening of market leadership is underway with the focus on big tech easing off and sectors such as energy and financials gaining traction, said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, California. 
""Is the whole market still reliant on big tech as it clearly was last summer? I think the answer is increasingly becoming 'no,' you’re seeing a broadening of market leadership,"" Bahnsen said. ""You have over 75% of the S&P 500 trading above its 200-day moving average. That’s remarkable breadth.""
The Russell 1000 value index, which is heavily weighted towards cyclical sectors, rose while its growth index, comprising large tech companies, fell.
Shares of cannabis companies soared as the Reddit forum that pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) to record levels late last month extended a months-long rally on bets of decriminalization under the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden.
Wall Street's fear gauge spiked to a one-week high of 23.85 points before paring some gains.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) rallied after it forecast a strong start to 2021 as ad spending rebounds from a rock bottom.
The social media platform has thought about whether to hold bitcoin on its balance sheet, but it has not made any changes yet, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal told CNBC.
""The big question is sensitivity to valuation,"" said Bahnsen, adding that at 23 to 25 times forward earnings there's no question certain stocks are highly valued.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62.57 points, or 0.2%, to 31,438.4, the S&P 500 lost 1.31 points, or 0.03%, to 3,909.92 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 35.16 points, or 0.25%, to 13,972.53.
Data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices rose moderately in January but underlying inflation remained benign amid a pandemic that has fractured the labor market and services industry.
Fourth-quarter earnings have so far also exceeded expectations, supporting sentiment.

 Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) jumped after the ride-hailing firm said it is chopping costs and now expects to be profitable in the third quarter.

Investing.com – The Dow eked out a record close Wednesday, as investors digested the latest wave of quarterly results from corporates and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the need for accommodative monetary policy at a time when data shows runaway inflation worries are somewhat misplaced.      
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, or 61 points to a record high of 31,437.41. The S&P 500 was down 0.03%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.25%
Powell signaled it was important to keep the monetary stimulus spigot open as he continued to bat away growing concerns over an expected pick up in inflation, insisting rising prices in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic were unlikely to be sustained. 
""Also important is a patiently accommodative monetary policy stance that embraces the lessons of the past—about the labor market in particular and the economy more generally,"" Powell said Wednesday to the Economic Club of New York on the ""State of the U.S. Labor Market."" ""This means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market,"" Powell said, recognizing the economy's ability to sustain a robust job market without causing an unwanted increase in inflation. 
The remarks come as data showed core inflation in January was 0%, falling short of expectations for a 0.2% increase.  
""Bottom line, inflation pressures remain very tame despite inventory shortages, shipping bottlenecks and surging commodity prices. Despite these cost pressures, retailers and/or producers are unable or unwilling to pass them through to consumers,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Energy stocks also pushed the broader market higher as oil prices rose on data showing an expectedly weekly drop in U.S. crude supplies that supports investor expectations the supply-demand tightening in oil will continue ahead of an anticipated jump in fuel demand as the economies reopen.
Crude inventories fell 6.64 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a build of 985,000 barrels.
Consumer discretionary stocks, however, helped keep a lid on gains in the broader market with General Motors among the biggest decliners. GM's better-than-expected fourth-quarter results were offset by worries over rising costs amid an ongoing chip shortage.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) said the chip shortage that has plagued electric vehicle automakers across the industry would cost the company $1.5 billion to $2 billion this year, sending its shares 2% lower.
LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) reported fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street's estimates and said it remained on track to become EBITDA profitable by the fourth quarter. It shares closed up more than 4%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, helped pare losses in the wider tech sector after the social media giant rallied 13% on better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
The beat on the bottom line for Twitter was driven by a ""global rebound in advertising, primarily from brand advertisers, which make up most of the company’s revenue and expressed greater demand for displaying digital ads to Twitter’s larger audience as events and product launches returned,"" Wedbush said.
In other news, cannabis stocks including Canopy Growth (TSX:WEED), Aphria (TSX:APHA) and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) on a Reddit-led wave of buying as retail traders bet on the Biden administration legalizing marijuana.
Yet analysts on Wall Street called for caution, particularly on Canopy Growth, which has more than doubled since the start of the year.
""We do not view the risk/reward as attractive on a fundamental basis for CGC shares at these levels to allocate new money. However, retail investor enthusiasm could remain a positive driver for shares near term,"" Oppenheimer said in a note."

Investing.com --  The Dow eked out a record close on Wednesday as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell tried to deflect inflation worries.
In a speech, the central bank chief said rising prices after the pandemic are not likely to be sustained, and that it was important to maintain the status quo on policy. 
Earnings continued to roll in mostly positive but some companies spoke about near-term challenges. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), for example, had a better-than-expected fourth quarter but said a chip shortage affecting the whole industry could cost it $1.5 billion to $2 billion this year. Its shares fell in reaction.
The Senate’s second trial of former President Donald Trump, the only to be impeached twice while in office, continued as House managers outlined their case for conviction. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1.  Disney  earnings
The happiest place on Earth wasn’t too happy last year, as Covid-19 forced it to close its theme parks. The movie business wasn’t so hot, either, with theaters also shut to new runs. Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) solve that problem with its Disney+ streaming service, which got a big leg up with people stuck at home.
Some analysts have sounded more bullish on Disney, saying the vaccines and economic recovery will result in a boost to revenue and profit. For the fourth quarter, analysts tracked by Investing.com forecast Disney to report EPS of 33 cents on revenue of $15.9 billion.
2. Pot stocks
Cannabis is the hot topic this week in the markets, with stocks of Tilray,  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) Corp (TSX:WEED),  Aphria Inc  (TSX:APHA) all higher.  Reports say  Tilray Inc  (NASDAQ:TLRY) is now a subject of talk among the same Reddit group that boosted shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME).
The Canadian pot company struck a deal this week to distribute medical marijuana in the U.K. and is also poised for growth abroad. Cannabis stocks also are getting a boost from the expectation that Democrats will push for legalization in the U.S. 
3. A dating app debut
Just in time for Valentine’s day, the dating app Bumble is geared up for its initial public offering after raising its range to $37 to $39 from $28 to $30 in a deal that could reach $1.7 billion. What else is new? Practically every recent IPO has seen a big bump on the first day of trading.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said on Wednesday it will unveil two new electric vehicles that will go on sale next year in the United States amid a growing push by the Biden administration to cut vehicle emissions, sending the Japanese automaker's shares soaring.
The company also said it expects that 40% of its U.S. sales by 2025 will be hybrid vehicles or electric vehicles, rising to 70% by 2030. One of the new EVs next year will be a sport-utility vehicle and Toyota will also unveil a new plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Toyota said in 2017 it would market more than 10 electric vehicles globally in the early 2020s.
The new vehicles for the U.S. market are ""the first of many,"" Bob Carter, executive vice president of sales for Toyota Motor North America.
""Electrification is the future of this industry. There is no doubt about that,"" Carter said. ""The only debate we have is that rate of change.""
Toyota forecasts by 2025 that industry sales will be 7% electric vehicles rising to around 15% to 18% in 2030.
In 2020, Toyota sold 337,000 hybrid vehicles in the United States, accounting for 16% of U.S. sales, and hybrids will grow to more than 20% this year as it adds more hybrid versions.
Toyota shares rose more than 5% on the news in New York trading.
There is growing interest in EVs in the industry.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) said last month it was setting an aspirational goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift.

In an interview with CNBC, Segal said Twitter had considered how it might pay vendors or employees using bitcoin, should they ask to transact using the virtual currency.
""We might consider whether we would be transferring dollars to bitcoin at the time of the transaction or if we wanted bitcoin on our balance sheet ready to complete that transaction,"" Segal said.
Segal's comments come a couple of days after billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc revealed the automaker had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars, sending the cryptocurrency shooting higher.
On General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s earnings call on Wednesday, Chief Executive Mary Barra, responding to a question about accepting bitcoin as payment for vehicles, said, ""This is something we'll monitor and we'll evaluate. If there's strong customer demand for it in the future, there's nothing that precludes us from doing that.""
But unlike Musk, Barra said ""We don't have any plans to invest in bitcoin. Full stop there."" 
Shares of Twitter were up 11% on Tuesday after the company beat Wall Street targets for quarterly sales and profit and followed its social media peers to forecast a strong start to 2021 as ad spending rebounds from rock bottom.

Investing.com – The Dow edged higher Wednesday in a choppy session, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the need for policy to remain accommodative, while investors continued to digest the latest wave of quarterly results from corporates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.28%, or 88 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.14%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.06%
Markets turned positive intraday on remarks from Powell, who continued to bat away growing concerns over expectations about a pick in inflation, insisting rising prices in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic were unlikely to be sustained. 
""Also important is a patiently accommodative monetary policy stance that embraces the lessons of the past—about the labor market in particular and the economy more generally,"" Powell said Wednesday to the Economic Club of New York on the ""State of the U.S. Labor Market.""
""This means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market,"" Powell said, recognizing the economy's ability to sustain a robust job market without causing an unwanted increase in inflation. 
Consumer discretionary stocks, however, help keep a lid on gains in the broader market with General Motors among the biggest decliners. GM's better-than-expected fourth-quarter results were offset by worries over rising costs amid an ongoing chip shortage.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) said the chip shortage that has plagued electric vehicle automakers across the industry would cost the company $1.5 billion to $2 billion this year, sending its shares 1% lower.
LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) reported fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street's estimates and said it remained on track to become EBITDA profitable by the fourth quarter. It shares were up more than 5%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, helped pare losses in the wider tech sector after the social media giant rallied 12% on better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
The beat on the bottom line for Twitter was driven by a ""global rebound in advertising, primarily from brand advertisers, which make up most of the company’s revenue and expressed greater demand for displaying digital ads to Twitter’s larger audience as events and product launches returned,"" Wedbush said.
Energy stocks were pushed higher by rising oil prices as data showing an expectedly weekly drop in U.S. crude supplies continued to support investor expectations that the supply-demand tightening in oil will continue ahead of an anticipated jump in fuel demand as the economies reopen.
Crude inventories fell 6.64 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a build of 985,000 barrels.
The topsy-turvy session on Wall Street comes ahead of an update from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on the labor market in a webinar at 2:00 PM ET (1900 GMT).
Powell has previously indicated that would allow the labor market to run hot and inflation to move above its 2% target for some time, underpinning market expectations the central bank is in no rush to tighten monetary policy.  
In other news, cannabis stocks including Canopy Growth (TSX:WEED), Aphria (TSX:APHA) and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) on a Reddit-led wave of buying as retail traders bet on the Biden administration legalizing marijuana.
Yet analysts on Wall Street called for caution, particularly on Canopy Growth, which has more than doubled since the start of the year.
""We do not view the risk/reward as attractive on a fundamental basis for CGC shares at these levels to allocate new money. However, retail investor enthusiasm could remain a positive driver for shares near term,"" Oppenheimer said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 was down slightly in volatile trading while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was barely higher on Wednesday, pausing after recent gains, while the dollar dropped to two-week lows.
Major U.S. stock indexes hit record highs at the opening before losing gains.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) shares were up 7.8%, a day after the company beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly sales and profit and followed its social media peers to forecast a strong start to 2021 as ad spending rebounds from a rock bottom.
Bets on more fiscal aid have powered Wall Street's main indexes to a series of all-time peaks recently, with investors moving into sectors such as energy, banks and industrials that are poised to benefit from a recovering economy.
President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he agreed with a proposal by Democratic lawmakers that would send $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans earning up to $75,000 and households making up to $150,000.
Earnings contributed to earlier optimism in equities markets, with French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) among those beating fourth-quarter profit expectations.
""Although visibility isn't great into the future, the analysts are extrapolating that into higher earnings throughout this year than may be what folks had feared six months ago,"" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager and head of research at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.
Executives from Robinhood, Melvin Capital and Citadel Securities are expected to testify before a U.S. House of Representatives panel at a Feb. 18 hearing exploring trading turmoil in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other stocks, according to a Reuters report citing two sources familiar with the matter.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.25% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.13%.
Bitcoin, meanwhile, consolidated recent gains on Wednesday, trading 3.7% lower at $44,799. It hit a new high of $48,216 on Tuesday following Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s disclosure of a $1.5 billion investment in the virtual currency.
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar index fell 0.13%, with the euro up 0.12% to $1.2131.
The dollar was weighed down by U.S. data showing tepid inflation.
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields also tumbled, as the U.S. data showed that inflation stayed benign in January, disappointing investors betting that price pressures would increase more. 
The Labor Department said its consumer price index increased 0.3% last month after climbing a revised 0.2% in December.
Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 1.1431%, from 1.157% late on Tuesday.
Oil rose, extending its rally for a ninth day, its longest winning streak in two years, supported by producer supply cuts and hopes vaccine rollouts will drive a recovery in demand.

Brent crude was up 30 cents, or 0.5%, at $61.39 after touching a 13-month high of $61.61 earlier in the session. U.S. crude was up 22 cents, or 0.3%, to $58.57, having touched $58.76, also a 13-month high.

(Reuters) - Electric aircraft startup Archer will go public through a merger with a blank-check company backed in a deal valued at around $3.8 billion and backed by an order and investment from United Airlines, among the first major airlines to commit to the purchase of air taxis.
The deal with Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Crest Investment Corp, announced on Wednesday, is expected to provide $1.1 billion to the company which makes electric aircraft with vertical take-off and landing.
Archer and Atlas Crest said the proceeds include a $600 million private investment from United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc, Stellantis, investment banker Ken Moelis (NYSE:MC) and Mubadala Capital, the investment arm of Abu Dhabi's state investor Mubadala Investment Co.
The deal is the latest in an increasingly crowded market dominated mostly by aerospace companies and tech start-ups trying to cash in on industry efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
Archer said it had an order from United Airlines worth $1 billion and an option for an additional $500 million of aircraft.
United said separately that it was teaming up with regional carrier Mesa Airlines to buy 200 Archer eVTOL aircraft that would take people from cities to airports within the next five years.
""Given that the entire electric aircraft market is in its infancy, needless to say it will take time to refine the product and get the regulatory approvals,"" Raymond James analysts said.
Palo Alto-based Archer was launched in May last year and is backed by Marc Lore, former chief executive officer of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) eCommerce U.S. The company said it is developing an electric aircraft that can travel up to 60 miles at 150 miles per hour.
A blank-check company, or a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), is a shell company that uses capital raised through an initial public offering to buy a private firm, thereby taking it public. They have gained popularity as an alternative to public markets for companies seeking to avoid a traditional IPO.

Moelis-led Atlas Crest raised $500 million in its IPO in October. The veteran banker founded investment firm  Moelis & Co  in 2007, since when it has advised on more than $3.5 trillion worth of transactions. Moelis also served as the president of UBS Investment Bank.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 12:25PM ET</span>",Cannabis stocks light up Reddit as sector surges to new highs,"By Shariq Khan and David Randall
(Reuters) - Interest from retail investors appeared to lift cannabis stocks broadly higher on Wednesday, signaling that the recent trading frenzy behind Reddit favorites such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) is shifting to other companies. 
Shares of Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) jumped 40% in morning trading, while shares of  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) Corp and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) Inc both rallied more than 12%. The ETFMG cannabis stocks exchange-traded fund, which has more than doubled in value since November's U.S. presidential elections, gained nearly 10%, while the broad S&P 500 index edged just 0.2% higher before turning lower. 
The moves came as posts touting cannabis stocks as the next GameStop spread throughout the popular WallStreetBets forum on Reddit, linking it with the short squeeze that pushed shares of the video game retailer up more than 1,650% in January.
""I missed the Gamestop boat, but I don't think we're gunna miss this one,"" one user wrote https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgrc39/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_10_2021. 
The forum has become a must-watch for traders at financial institutions since concerted action by some of its 8 million participants proved enough to force deep losses in a handful of short-selling hedge funds in January. 
Shares of GameStop have fallen more than 85% since their closing peak of $347.51 on Jan. 27, capping a wild ride that illustrated the power of retail investors trading on commission-free platforms such as Robinhood to influence financial markets.
Swaggystocks, which aggregates sentiment on shares talked about in the WallStreetBets forum, showed Tilray was the most upvoted, or highly touted, stock in the group.
""I don't think the retail punter story goes away overnight,"" said Mirabaud sales trader Mark Taylor. ""I am really only watching the price action and trying to make sense of it all.""
Changes promised by some Democrats in Congress could help give U.S. cannabis companies access to more traditional methods of banking and open the sector to new, institutional investors.
However, some analysts argue that the valuations of the companies are becoming unjustifiable, especially for Canadian companies like Tilray, Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) and Canopy Growth, which may gain very little from U.S. changes.
Canopy reported a reduction in adjusted losses in third-quarter results on Tuesday, but Stifel analysts said those fell short of justifying its current valuation.
Another brokerage, Canaccord Genuity, said the U.S. election-related enthusiasm had caused a ""disproportionate amount of capital flow"" into Canadian producers.
Shares of Tilray, which is being taken over by Aphria in a complicated reverse merger, are up more than 400% since the deal was announced in December following new agreements to supply its medical cannabis to European markets.
Aphria has gained 243% over the same period, as companies across the sector surged on a wave of legalization in major U.S. states and the Democratic party's promise to decriminalize the plant at the federal level.

Despite those gains, about 37% of Aphria's free float was out on loan for short-sellers, compared with 27.3% at the end of January, according to analytics firm Ortex. Short interest in GameStop, by comparison, soared to more than 100% of its free float during the short squeeze that pushed its shares higher.

LONDON (Reuters) - The shift in euro share trading from London to the European Union since Brexit is damaging to all of Europe because it fragments markets, a top British Finance Ministry official said on Wednesday.
Britain left the EU on Dec. 31 and over 6 billion euros a day in euro share trading moved on Jan. 4 from London to platforms in Amsterdam and Paris.
Some trading in derivatives has also moved from London to the EU and New York, with trading in EU carbon emissions set to follow as the City adjusts to having little access to the bloc.
""This isn't where we wanted to end up, frankly on derivatives trading or share trading,"" Katharine Braddick, the finance ministry's director general for financial services, told an Afore Consulting webinar.
""Broadly it's a negative impact for Europe as a geography because fragmentation is negative to the operation of efficient financial services, and ultimately its real economy businesses that pay,"" Braddick said.
The UK will focus remaining an open financial centre and secure a concentration of trading liquidity ""as far as we sensibly can"", she added.
Britain and the EU are in talks on putting in place a memorandum of understanding or ""administrative tool"" for a ""new normal"" in financial services relations battered by Brexit, she said.
Braddick downplayed expectations that an MoU would open the door to Brussels granting ""equivalence"" or direct market access for financial firms from the UK. The EU has said City must adjust to Brexit and that Brussels will not be rushed into granting access.
""The longer we go on without substantial equivalence decisions in place, the more industry moves on, industry adjust, restructure, and they become less material,"" Braddick said.
The Treasury is leading a review of how Britain's 135 billion pound financial sector is regulated now that it no longer has to comply with EU rules, raising expectations of a push to make the City more competitive globally.
But there was a need to understand the difference between what is possible after Brexit and what is materially beneficial without piling on more compliance costs, Braddick said.

""Our rulebook is still extensively the European rulebook. We don't reject it, we don't think it's terrible. The vast majority of it is beneficial to the UK because it reflects international standards,"" Braddick said.

(Reuters) - Executives from Robinhood, Melvin Capital and Citadel Securities are expected to testify before a House panel at a Feb. 18 hearing exploring trading turmoil in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and related stocks, said two sources familiar with the matter.
The House Financial Services Committee is examining how an apparent flood of retail trading drove certain stocks to extreme highs, squeezing hedge funds like Melvin that had bet against those shares. 
A committee spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, and a full witness list for the hearing has yet to be made public. Spokespeople for the companies declined to comment.
The hearing is the first of what could be several Washington-driven probes into what happened in the stock market to kick off 2021. 
The three companies have been at the center of the GameStop saga. Robinhood emerged as both a popular and accessible retail trading platform, but drew criticism during the frenzy after it temporarily handcuffed trading in GameStop and other viral stocks as the firm tapped credit lines.
Robinhood's commission-free trading model also put a spotlight on Citadel Securities, which accounts for over 20% of all U.S. equities volume and roughly 39% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, according to its website. Citadel Securities' heft has raised questions over the company’s market power, including business arrangements where the company and competitors pay brokers like Robinhood for order flow.

The GameStop surge resulted in massive losses for Melvin Capital, after the hedge fund bet the retailer’s stock price would tumble. The fund, founded by Gabe Plotkin in 2014, began the year with $12.5 billion in assets but lost 53% in January as retail traders ganged up on hedge funds.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has lost its final bid to block the auditor chosen by Swiss financial supervisor FINMA to scrutinise the bank's activities in a spying scandal, according to a Supreme Court ruling published on Wednesday.
In January 2020, FINMA appointed an independent auditor to review the bank's corporate governance and its use of electronic communications in connection with spying into former and current executives that became public in 2019 and led to the ouster of then-CEO Tidjane Thiam. 
Switzerland's second-biggest bank had sought to scuttle FINMA's appointment of Thomas Werlen, of international law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, on the grounds that the firm and Werlen lacked sufficient independence, but a lower court in April rejected the bank's challenge.
Switzerland's Supreme Court, in a decision dated Dec. 28, upheld the lower court ruling, saying that most law firms available to take on such assignments in Switzerland had often gained the requisite know-how by representing counterparties in disputes with major banks.
""The fact that the market available to take on FINMA's auditing assignment into big banks contains few potential providers suggests that the criterion of independence should not be applied too strictly,"" the judges said in the ruling, which became public on Wednesday.
Credit Suisse said it noted the court's decision and was fully cooperating with FINMA. The regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
FINMA in September stepped up its investigation into Credit Suisse, opening an enforcement case in a rare challenge to one of the country's major lenders.

In particular, it is examining how the banks' surveillance activities were documented and controlled.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>","LVMH, Rihanna to pause Fenty fashion venture, focus on lingerie, cosmetics","PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Louis Vuitton owner LVMH and music star Rihanna have agreed to suspend her fashion line Fenty less than two years after its launch, the French luxury goods giant said on Wednesday.
LVMH said in a statement that Fenty's ready to wear activity, based in Paris, would be ""put on hold"" pending better conditions - a rare setback for the luxury group, which has weathered the coronavirus crisis better than most rivals.
The R&B singer and LVMH launched the Fenty fashion brand in May 2019, only the second time the French group had set a label up from scratch as it looked to tap soaring demand for luxury celebrity collaborations.
LVMH did not elaborate on the reasons for hitting the pause button but after a big launch and debut collection, the brand kept a low profile and never followed up with major marketing events, even before the COVID-19 crisis. 
Trade publication WWD, which first reported news that the label was being suspended, said on Wednesday that a skeleton staff remained at the Paris headquarters to wind down remaining operations. 
Asked about the fashion venture during the group's third-quarter earnings call last October, LVMH's finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony called it ""a work in progress"": ""We are still in a launching phase, and we have to figure out exactly what is the right offer. It's not something that is easy.""
LVMH also said on Wednesday that private equity fund L Catterton, which is connected to the group, had taken a stake in Savage X Fenty, Rihanna's lingerie line.
""LVMH and Rihanna reaffirm their ambition to concentrate on the growth and the long-term development of Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skincare and lingerie,"" it added.
Fenty - after the ""Umbrella"" hitmaker's full name, Robyn Rihanna Fenty - was meant to build on the singer's joint cosmetics venture with LVMH, with a full range of clothing, shoes and accessories.

It was the first label the acquisitive group - also home to storied couture houses such as Christian Dior and Givenchy - had fully created since Christian Lacroix’s eponymous brand launched in 1987. It eventually sold that on in 2005 after it struggled to ever turn a profit.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday, with the risk environment looking increasingly benign after published details of the Democrats’ new spending plans indicated no dilution of the administration’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.
The ongoing feverish speculation by retail traders meanwhile has definitively moved from last week’s heavily shorted names and is now focusing on cannabis stocks, in anticipation of legalization measures in the U.S. and Mexico.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 99 points, or 0.3%, at 31,475 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%.
The hottest movers were all pot names, with Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock and Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) stock both gaining 33%, while Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) stock was up 17.5% and  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) stock gained 13.5%.
Earlier, inflation data for January had passed off without any noticeable sign of nascent price pressures, allaying any nascent fears about the Federal Reserve moving to tighten monetary policy sooner than thought. The consumer price index rose 0.3% and the annual rate of inflation edged up to 1.4%, but core CPI, which strips out more volatile elements, was flat and the annual rate fell to 1.4% from 1.6%.
Analysts still expect inflation to accelerate to 3% or more over the rest of the year, not least due to the heavy basis effect that last year's collapse in fuel and energy prices will create. However, Fed officials have promised to 'look through' any volatility in the short-term headline rate until unemployment has fallen decisively from today's elevated levels. 
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock also stood out with an 11.4% gain after saying the year had started strongly for advertising revenue. That followed a banner quarter in which traffic was sustained by the presidential election and all that followed. Twitter's chief financial officer confirmed the network doesn't intend ever to readmit ex-President Donald Trump.
LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) also gained 8.0% to its highest in 18 months after saying it expects to turn a profit as early as the third quarter of this year. The expected rebound in the ride-hailing business also lifted Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock 4.7% to a new all-time high ahead of its earnings report, which is due after the closing bell.
Elsewhere, General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock fell 5.1% after it warned of potential production bottlenecks arising from a shortage of semiconductors for an industry that has been wrong-footed by the relatively quick rebound in demand since the pandemic peaked.  That contrasted with  Toyota  (NYSE:TM) ADRs, which rose 2.2% to a fresh all-time high after it revised its profit guidance for the year through March higher."

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday reported a higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on strong demand for trucks and SUVs during the COVID-19 pandemic but forecast weaker-than-expected 2021 results citing a shortage of chips used in car production.
GM shares were down 0.3% to $55.89 in premarket trading.
The automaker expects a chip shortage to trim $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion from its 2021 operating profit. It forecast a range of $10.0 billion to $11.0 billion, or $4.50 to $5.25 a share. Analysts had expected $5.89, according to Refinitiv data.
The global chip shortage also will have a short-term impact on production and cash flow, the company said.
Chief Executive Mary Barra, in a Tuesday morning media briefing, said GM ""won't lose any production"" of its high-profit full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, although the supply of computer chips ""is still a bit fluid.""
However, she added, ""we're going to be able to meet the production schedules"" for the year.
GM said it expects to accelerate spending on electric and autonomous vehicles in 2021. Projected capital expenditures this year are $9.0 billion to $10.0 billion, including more than $7.0 billion for EVs and AVs.
The company trimmed its outlook for adjusted free cash flow to $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion.
GM said it earned $2.8 billion, or $1.93 a share, compared with a loss of $194 million, or 16 cents a share, in the prior year. 
For the full year, GM earned $6.4 billion, down from $6.7 billion in 2019.
GM said its 2020 operating margin was 7.9 percent, including 9.4 percent in North America.

The company ended the year with $22.3 billion in cash and $40.5 billion in total liquidity, including untapped credit lines.

The health crisis has accelerated the soda maker's efforts to trim hundreds of its underperforming brands and shift toward popular products such as sparkling waters and zero-sugar sodas, while also influencing a major restructuring that included thousands of job cuts.
""The progress we made in 2020, including the actions taken to accelerate the transformation of our company, gives us confidence in returning to growth in the year ahead,"" Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said in a statement.
For 2021, the company expects adjusted earnings to grow in the high-single digits to low-double digits and organic revenue to rise in the high-single digits.
Organic revenue declined 9% last year, as pandemic-related curbs closed the doors of non-retail channels such as restaurants, cinemas and sporting events that account for over a third of the company's sales. 
Meanwhile, the company warned it expects a liability of about $12 billion related to a dispute with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on how much it charged foreign affiliates for the rights to make and sell Coke products abroad.
The U.S. Tax Court sided with the IRS in November, but Coca-Cola said it ""intends to vigorously defend its position"" even as the company recorded a tax reserve of $438 million for the year ended Dec. 31. 
Net revenue fell 5% to $8.60 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, just short of expectations of $8.63 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

On a per share basis, the Atlanta-based company earned 47 cents per share, 5 cents more than estimates.

Valuations and investor presence in emerging European stocks remain “extremely low” and it’s time investors pay more attention to this equity class, Chris Colunga, co-manager of BlackRock’s 617 million euro ($748 million) Emerging Europe fund said in emailed comments.
The provision of vaccines and continuing stimulus are likely to fuel earnings growth in the region, he said. European Union spending on sustainable infrastructure is set to feed liquidity into eastern Europe, he added.
“As we enter 2021, the combination of strong liquidity, easy financial conditions and high levels of disposable income are a very powerful mix for earnings growth at a time the vaccine is offering hope of some demand normalization,” said Colunga.
The BlackRock fund manager said he favors exposure to Greek stocks on bets tourism will recover and financial conditions as well as investments will improve. The stock fund has also turned “more constructive” on Turkey after the market’s underperformance and as the new economic leadership team pledges more traditional policies, Colunga said. As of the end of December, the fund had a 9.6% exposure to Greece, its third-biggest, and a 5.5% exposure to Turkey, its fifth-highest.
Colunga said he has reduced the fund’s exposure to its biggest geographic holding, Russia -- which stood at 57% at the end of December -- as the BlackRock team expects political tensions with the West to keep a cap on the nation’s equities.
U.S. and European leaders have condemned Russia for the jailing of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny, who was sentenced last week after returning from Germany where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning he blamed on President Vladimir Putin’s security services.
The fund manager declined to comment on the extent or timing of the scaling back on Russian holdings.
Among sectors, he favors utilities, which may benefit from green-project financing, and financials, as yield curves steepen. The fund is most underweight on defensives.
Not all money managers share Colunga’s optimism over the outlook for emerging markets in 2021.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said last week that MSCI Inc.’s gauge of developing country stocks may have already peaked for the year, following “euphoric” fund inflows.
The BlackRock Global Funds Emerging Europe Fund, which Colunga runs with Sam Vecht, is down 4.5% over the past year, compared with the MSCI Emerging Markets Europe Index’s 9.2% slump.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading higher Wednesday, resuming the recent rally as solid earnings after the previous close from social media giant Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) boosted sentiment.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 85 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 45 points, or 0.3%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 9 points lower Tuesday and the S&P 500 ended down 0.1%, both indices snapping a six-day winning streak, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1%. 
This earnings season has been a generally positive one, with data released at the end of last week showing that over 80% of the S&P 500 companies that had reported earnings for the fourth quarter of last year beat expectations (albeit that's an achievement that owes as much to traditionally gloomy expectation management as anything else: the average performance of stocks that have 'beaten expectations' has, however, been weaker than at any time in recent years.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) did better than most late Tuesday, impressing with its quarterly sales and profit while also forecasting a strong start to 2021 as ad spending rebounds. This saw the company’s stock rise over 4% after hours even while warning that it expects user growth to slow to low double digits this year.
The earnings season may be coming to a close, but there are still reports from a number of iconic brands due Wednesday, including Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Elsewhere, investors continue to monitor the passage of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill through Congress, while Democrats will begin formally making their case that former President Donald Trump should be convicted for inciting the U.S. Capitol siege after the Senate concluded his impeachment trial could proceed.

Fed chairman Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak about the state of the U.S. economy in an address to the Economic Club of New York later Wednesday. 
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by a further drop in U.S. crude stocks after the American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday an unexpected fall in inventories last week.

940,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 06:51AM ET</span>",Africa's miners and winemakers toast China's row with Australia,"By Joe Bavier, Tanisha Heiberg and Emma Rumney
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - For South African winemaker Vergenoegd Löw, the pandemic could have been a disaster but a bitter trade war between China and Australia has thrown the 325-year-old estate a lifeline.
Bottles of its reds, whites and roses piled up when South Africa banned alcohol sales under a strict lockdown and visitors who once flocked to the vineyard near Cape Town to sip wine and snap photos of its famed Indian Runner ducks vanished.
That changed when Beijing slapped tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine in November after Canberra led calls for an inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.
It wasn't just wine. Beijing hit a range of Australian goods with punitive duties, created new layers of red tape and banned some Australian imports outright, giving African suppliers of anything from coal to beef to copper a boost.
""We can now get much greater volumes of sales,"" said Shaun McVey, marketing manager at Vergenoegd Löw, which has signed a new Chinese deal. ""Instead of sending maybe three or four containers in a year, we've upped that to 15 to 20 containers.""
Chinese drinkers bought nearly 40% of Australia's wine exports before the long-simmering tensions between Beijing and Canberra boiled over and brought the trade to an abrupt halt. 
Over the past three months, exports of South African wine to China jumped 50%, according to the Wines of South Africa trade body, and hopes are high for even more sales once Australian stocks are polished off during China's Lunar New Year holiday.
Martyn Davies, Deloitte's managing director for emerging markets and Africa, said a protracted trade war would create a wide window of opportunity for miners and other sectors such as agribusiness, though seizing the potential would take work.
The Chinese market presents a range of obstacles, from language barriers and inscrutable bureaucracy to tailoring marketing to its unique social media ecosystem, analysts said.
""Many African companies are significantly behind the curve,"" said Deloitte's Davies. ""Australian companies have been engaging China for 35 years.""
BAUXITE BOOST
The lack of trade deals between China and countries in sub-Saharan Africa also means exporters may face an uphill battle.
Despite its increasingly important role as an investor on the continent, China only signed its first free trade agreement with an African country, the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius, in January.
So while some African products may leapfrog Australian goods in the pecking order, they remain at a disadvantage when competing against exports from countries with preferential Chinese trading terms such as Chile, Peru or New Zealand.
In the mining sector though, China has spent the past decade ramping up projects in Africa to safeguard the flow of raw materials to the manufacturing juggernaut.
Those investments are now paying off and African producer countries are pocketing the royalties as exports to the world's second biggest economy get a boost at Australia's expense.
Last year, state-owned Aluminum Corp of China Ltd, known as Chalco, shipped the first bauxite cargo from its Guinea project, and a prolonged trade war between China and Australia is only likely to help the West African country's economy.
Australian shipments to China of the rock used to make aluminium dropped 22% in the final quarter of 2020 while imports from Guinea leapt 70%, according to Chinese customs data. 
That's after Guinea tripled its bauxite output between 2015 and 2019 as mining projects came online, with most of it going to China. Over the same period, Guinea's gross domestic product jumped 40%.
Graphic - China switches to Guinea bauxite as it shuns Australia: https://graphics.reuters.com/AFRICA-CHINA/TRADE/rlgpdemxrvo/chart.png
Chinese copper concentrate imports from Australia, meanwhile plummeted to zero in December 2020. At the same time, exports rose 17% from Democratic Republic of Congo, another country where Chinese companies such as China Molybdenum have invested heavily to secure key mineral supplies.
South Africa's coal industry has also got a much-needed boost. Australian sales to China of thermal coal, which is mainly used in power plants, and metallurgical coal for steelmaking, slumped to zero in December.
The first shipment of South African thermal coal to China in five years landed last month and exporters are hopeful sales will increase further in 2021.
Graphic - China's copper imports from DRC surge: https://graphics.reuters.com/AFRICA-CHINA/TRADE/gjnvwzgjzpw/chart.png
'INNOVATIVE AND BEAUTIFUL' 
To overcome the lack of trade deals with China, South Africa's Standard Bank, which is partly owned by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has sought to level the playing field.
Africa's largest bank measured by assets is using online platforms and events to match its customers with Chinese buyers in a bid to boost exports.
Those efforts, however, now face challenges unique to the coronavirus pandemic, such as a shipping squeeze due to global trade distortions that have sparked a bidding war for container space and pushed prices to record highs.
""You get a lot of interest. And then when people see the cost of logistics at this point in time, they end up not concluding on the transaction,"" said Philip Myburgh, Standard Bank's head of Africa-China banking.
Still, wine is one African export Standard Bank considers a good bet. So does Edouard Duval, chief executive of East Meets West Fine Wines, one of China's biggest wine importers.
If South Africa can capture just 1% of the 38% market share Australian imports are rapidly vacating, it would double its exports to China, he said. ""The potential is there ... it's a very dynamic and fast-moving market.""
South Africa typically exports less than half of its wine and earned 9.1 billion rand ($616 million) from overseas sales last year, with Britain buying by far the most. Sales to China came to just $19 million.
Even though Chinese tariffs wiped out Australian wine sales in November and December, its exports to China alone still came to A$1.01 billion ($779 million) last year.
At his ""Cheers"" wine store in Beijing, Lin Lulu is not too concerned about the impact of the trade war with Australia.
""South African wine now has great advantages over Australian wine because of the new tariff situation,"" he said as he stocked his shelves with South African reds. ""South African wines are more innovative and beautiful.""

(Reuters) - Shares of companies that have invested in bitcoin have vastly outperformed on Wall Street in 2021 and are extending their gains thanks to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s $1.5 billion bet on the soaring digital currency. 
The price of bitcoin hit a record high over $48,000 on Tuesday in a two-day surge after Tesla said on Monday that it had bought the digital currency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars.
A handful of bitcoin-related companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges were also buoyed by the disclosure that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a fan of cryptocurrencies, added bitcoin to the electric car maker's balance sheet. 
Graphic - Soaring shares of companies that own bitcoin: https://graphics.reuters.com/CRYPTO-CURRENCIES/COMPANIES/nmopaznbxva/chart.png
Tesla's bitcoin purchase amounts to a minor bet for the fast-growing electric car company with an $800 billion stock market value. However, it bolstered the digital currency's emerging credentials as a mainstream financial asset.
Driven in part by interest from institutional investors, the price of bitcoin has quadrupled in the past four months, surging far beyond record highs set in 2017. Some investors view it a hedge against inflation. 
Tesla gained after disclosing the investment on Monday, but dipped 1.6% on Tuesday, leaving its gain in 2021 at 20%, compared to the S&P 500's 4% rise.
Companies with much more significant exposures to bitcoin in proportion to their overall stock market value than Tesla have also rallied following Tesla's disclosure, increasing already strong stock gains driven by the cryptocurrency's recent rally.
MicroStrategy, whose CEO Michael Saylor is an avid bitcoin bull, surged 22% on Tuesday, bringing its gain this week to over 50%, and it has surged over 200% so far in 2021. The business intelligence software company has bought about 71,079 bitcoins, now worth over $3 billion and equivalent to over a quarter of its $11.8 billion stock market value. 
Canadian financial technology firm Mogo, which in December said it would invest up to 1.5 million Canadian dollars in bitcoin, jumped 45% on Tuesday, bringing its gain since Tesla's announcement to 85% and giving it a stock market value of $318 million. 
Payments company Square dipped almost 1%, leaving its 2021 gain at 19%. In October, Square said it bought 4,709 bitcoins for about $50 million, amounting to about 1% of its total assets at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Those bitcoins are now worth over $200 million.
Marathon Patent Group, a bitcoin mining company that in January announced it bought nearly 4,900 bitcoins for $150 million, has jumped over 60% this week and is up 260% year to date. 

PayPal Holdings joined the cryptocurrency market in October, allowing customers to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other virtual coins using the U.S. digital payments company’s online wallets. Its stock has surged 21% in 2021.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>","With Disney shares near record high, investors eye streaming update","By Lisa Richwine
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, which wowed investors in December with ambitious streaming TV plans, will update Wall Street on Thursday about its digital subscriber membership and the future of its pandemic-hobbled theme parks.
The company's shares closed at an all-time high of $190 on Monday after December's unveiling of a programming blitz to boost Disney+, the streaming service the company launched in November 2019. Shares ended trading at $188.21 on Tuesday.
When Disney releases its quarterly earnings report after stock markets close on Thursday, investors likely will zero in on how many subscribers have joined the Disney+ rolls since early December, when customers stood at 86.8 million. The company released Pixar movie ""Soul"" on the platform on Christmas and debuted Marvel series ""WandaVision"" in January.
Disney's rapid streaming growth, which drew praise from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) Chief Executive Reed Hastings, has helped propel its stock while the theme park and movie studio continue to feel the effects of the global coronavirus pandemic.
Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield in January upgraded his rating on Disney to ""neutral"" from ""sell."" He said investors were looking past COVID and focusing on how Disney will fare after the pandemic. Shareholders have rewarded the company for ""leaning much more heavily into streaming at the expense of near-term earnings,"" Greenfield said.
Overall, analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expect Disney's earnings per share to show a loss of 42 cents for October through December compared, with a gain of $1.53 a year earlier.
For the first time, Disney will be reporting results under a new structure announced in October by Chief Executive Bob Chapek to focus the company around streaming. 
""We believe the underlying business trends to be roughly stable on a sequential basis, as Disney World remains open (at limited capacity) and some live sports have returned to media networks,"" Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said in a research note.
Still, investors will look for information on when the company might be able to reopen its Disneyland theme park in California, which has been closed since March, and any forecasts on operations at its flagship Walt Disney World in Florida. The Florida resort has restricted attendance to allow for social distancing.

Disney watchers also will look for news about future movie release plans. The company has delayed several big-budget films, as many movie theaters remain closed, and moved some to Disney+.

943,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 06:02AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Maersk Calls the Top,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The world’s largest shipping company called a top to the restocking trend that has been one of the standout features of the latest stage of the pandemic.
Danish shipping giant Moeller-Maersk  (OTC:AMKBY), which accounts for over one in four of the containers shipped across the world, said its windfall gains from buoyant global trade are likely to peak in the first quarter and “normalize” thereafter.
Maersk (CSE:MAERSKa) stock responded with its worst intraday fall in weeks, its A-shares losing 5.7% by 6 AM ET (1100 GMT), having bounced weakly off a three-month low.
The news is important because Maersk’s performance has embodied the shift in global consumer spending patterns over the last year, in which people locked down at home have diverted their disposable away from services which are temporarily unavailable to goods, much of which has gone either into home improvement or adaptation.
The global shipping industry has been maxed out by that trend, with the asymmetry of China’s external trade in particular just making things worse, forcing many ships to spend half of their time empty on return legs to China.
That has allowed shippers such as Maersk the chance to push prices up sharply: the company estimates it contributed $1.5 billion to earnings before interest and taxes in 2020.
The “normalization” that Maersk expects isn’t likely to be abrupt either. Profits aren’t going to fall off a cliff. The first quarter of this year is still expected to be better than 4Q 2020. Underlying EBITDA is set to rise to between $8.5 billion and $10.5 billion this year, from 8.3 billion last year. Its key Ocean division is still set to grow in line with global demand of between 3% and 5% although, here too, growth will slow in the second half.
The midpoint of the EBITDA range is almost exactly where Maersk’s net debt stood at the end of the year, so there will be minimal pressure on its ability to keep buying back stock.
However, the market has already decided the cyclical high for Maersk is already past. After Wednesday’s losses, the stock is down 20% from its peak three weeks ago, after posting its biggest gains since 2005 last year. 
Vaccines and the lifting of lockdowns across the northern hemisphere are likely to ensure that this trend continues: barring fresh disasters, 2021 will be the year that spending on travel, dining out and commuting revive at the expense of fitness bikes, sofas and PC upgrades. Although the unwind is likely to be softened for Maersk by fiscal stimulus that will float all boats, underperformance is likely to be a constant from now."
944,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 05:45AM ET</span>","New CEO to cut 8,000 jobs as Heineken feels pandemic effect","By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Heineken (OTC:HEINY) NV plans to cut about 8,000 jobs, the Dutch beer group said on Wednesday, seeking to restore operating margins to pre-pandemic levels after a sharp decline in profit because of coronavirus restrictions.
The world's second-largest brewer, which makes Europe's top selling lager Heineken as well as Tiger and Sol, said it would save 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) over the three years to 2023 under CEO Dolf van den Brink's ""EverGreen"" plan.
Savings will be achieved by redesigning its organisation, reducing the complexity and number of its products and identifying its least effective spending, Heineken said.
The review of its operations will result in about 8,000 job losses - equating to 9% of its workforce at the end of 2019 - and a related 420 million euro charge. Personnel expenses will be cut by about 350 million euros, it added.
The brewer said ongoing restrictions on social gatherings and hospitality venues meant 2021 revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin would be below levels in 2019.
It expects market conditions to improve gradually in 2021 and more into 2022, with a slow recovery in European bars and restaurants, less than 30% of which were open at the end of January.
The operating profit margin before one-offs should rise to 17% by 2023, the company said, versus 12.3% last year and 16.8% in 2019.
Heineken shares were down 2.2% at 0955 GMT, making them 4.6% weaker in the year to date. Analysts said the cautious 2021 outlook and the fact that large restructuring only brought margins back to 2019 levels weighed on the stock.
""Underwhelming"" was the verdict of Bernstein Securities beverage analyst Trevor Stirling of the margin goal. 
MORE GLOBAL, MORE CAUTION
The brewer said it wanted more top-line growth than competitors and would push premium brands, such as Heineken, and zero-alcohol lager even more. It also aims to become the best digitally connected brewer to serve consumers who are increasingly looking to buy beer online. 
Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), the world's third-largest brewer, last week said it was banking on most COVID-19 restrictions being lifted in the coming months, serving to buoy earnings in the peak summer season.
Heineken's Van den Brink, who took charge in June, was more cautious, but said vaccination programmes in Europe, North America and some more developed countries in Asia would allow a return to normality this year.
""But we are a global company ... Only when the whole world is vaccinated to a certain degree can we say we really come out of it. Directionally, we partly agree, but we have a bit of caution given the global footprint of our company,"" he told Reuters.
Brazil and Mexico, two of Heineken's biggest markets, are still struggling to deal with the pandemic.
Operating profit fell 35.6% in 2020, in line with expectations.

Tokyo 2020 Olympics President Yoshiro Mori has incited anger at home and abroad with remarks last week that women talk too much, causing meetings to drag on. He has apologised but refused to resign.
""We are disappointed by the recent comments from the President of TOCOG (Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games), which are contrary to the values that  Toyota  respects and supports,"" Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp President Akio Toyoda said.
Toyota became a top level Olympic partner because it shared the values with ""the spirit of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, which through sports aim to create a peaceful and an inclusive society without discrimination in which anyone can participate,"" 
he said in remarks read out by an executive at the company's earnings briefing.
The executive, Operating Officer Jun Nagata, said the company issued Toyoda's message because it had concluded that it should not keep silent.
Toyota, the maker of the RAV4 SUV crossover and Prius hybrid, is a worldwide Olympic sponsor. 
It had planned to use the postponed Tokyo Games to showcase its fuel cell technology by rolling out 100 hydrogen fuel cell buses to shuttle visitors between venues. The Games organiser also planned to power the Olympic flame with hydrogen.
The Tokyo Olympics, delayed from last year by the coronavirus, are due to begin in July. For officials, the Mori controversy adds to a long list of hurdles facing the event.
Other Olympic sponsors have also expressed their views, including Asahi Holdings, the holding company of beer maker Asahi Breweries, which said it believed Mori's comments were ""disappointing and inappropriate considering the spirit of gender equality espoused"" by the Games. 

An executive of Eneos, Japan's oil and metals company, said on Wednesday the company ""deplored the sexist remarks from a viewpoint of respect for human rights"".

Boeing has been developing the widebody jet, a new version of its 777 series, with the goal of releasing it in late 2023, already three years later than planned. 
""The 777x was due to come in June of last year, Now it's unlikely to be, I think, before the first quarter of 2024,"" Clark told a virtual summit by aviation consultancy CAPA.
A Boeing spokeswoman told Reuters the planemaker still anticipated 777x deliveries to start in late 2023.
The 777X will be the first major jet to be certified since software flaws in two Boeing 737 MAX planes caused fatal crashes and prompted accusations of cozy relations between the company and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The certification process of the new jet is expected to be longer and costlier after scrutiny of the 737 MAX, which was grounded for almost two years following the fatal crashes. 
Emirates originally ordered 150 of the 777X series, which seats up to 406 people, and now has 126 on order. Analysts say the COVID-19 crisis has clouded the demand outlook for such big jets.

The plane was originally due to enter service with Emirates in June 2020.

At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index climbed 0.1% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%.
Helping the tone of European stock markets of late has been a solid earnings season, and Wednesday saw a number of companies releasing results.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) stock rose 2.9% after the French banking giant saw a “significant improvement” in its business during the second half of 2020, after heavy losses on equity derivatives earlier in the year.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) stock rose 4.6% after the German conglomerate raised its full-year outlook for sales, cash flow and profits, citing improved demand for automotive components and materials.
 Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) stock soared 9.8%, to an all-time high, after the Dutch company known for handling payment processing for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other large online firms, beat expectations, helped by growth in the Americas.
On the flip side, Heineken (OTC:HEINY) stock fell 2.1% after the Dutch brewer said it was cutting around 8,000 jobs following a review of its operations launched in October.
Maersk (CSE:MAERSKb) stock dropped 7.6% after the world’s largest container shipping line offered a disappointing outlook, saying it sees signs freight rates are close to peaking.
Earlier Wednesday, China's factory gate prices rose in annual terms in January for the first time in a year, according to data released earlier Wednesday, pointing to strong manufacturing growth in the world's second-largest economy.
However, this positive news was tempered by Chinese consumer prices falling back into deflation as virus restrictions curbed travel and spending.
Back in Europe, German consumer prices were confirmed climbing 0.8% in January, a gain of 1.0% on the year, having slipped into negative territory late in 2020 due to the government's temporary VAT cut, which has now expired.
Stock markets have climbed strongly in the last few months on expectations of a global economic recovery on the back of vast fiscal and monetary spending coupled with vaccination programs to the end of the coronavirus pandemic.
Italian stocks remained near 12-month highs on Tuesday after Silvio Berlusconi said his Forza Italia party will back the new government of Mario Draghi, bringing him closer to commanding a solid majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, helped by a further drop in  U.S. crude stocks. The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday an unexpected fall in inventories last week. Supply data from the Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, will now be studied carefully.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $58.61 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $61.42.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A surge in demand for goods like furniture and exercise equipment from locked-down consumers has sparked a jump in shipping rates, boosting profits for Danish freight giant Maersk, the company said on Wednesday.
Yet shares in the world's largest container shipping line fell as much as 8% as it missed analysts' lofty forecasts for the end of last year and gave more cautious guidance for 2021 than anticipated. 
Maersk's ocean shipping business, its largest division, ""performed at record level in the quarter as a consequence of the strong rebound of demand,"" CEO Soren Skou said in a statement.
Helped by record high freight rates and low fuel prices, fourth-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) leapt 85% to $2.71 billion from a year earlier. However, that was below the $3.06 billion forecast by analysts in a poll gathered by the company. 
""Our continued progress makes us confident that we will continue to grow the earnings of the company as the economic situation normalises in 2021 and beyond,"" Skou said.
The global shipping industry quickly recovered last year from the pandemic-related halt in trade around the world, boosted in particular by higher retail sales in the United States.
Maersk expects global container trade to rise 3-5% in 2021 after declining 2% last year.
The majority of consumer goods are ferried by container ship operators like Maersk. Container ships have been sailing at full load since August – something that has not happened in a decade.
Maersk expects EBITDA of $8.5 billion-$10.5 billion this year, compared with the $10.3 billion expected by analysts and $8.3 billion achieved last year.

Unlike other automakers, including Japanese peers Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd and Honda Motor Co Ltd, that have had to cut production because of semiconductor shortages, Toyota raised output for the fiscal year ending March.
Shares in Toyota, the world's biggest automaker by vehicle sales, closed up 1.7% after hitting their highest level since July 2015.
""For the near term, we do not see any decrease in production volume due to the chip shortage, but we do see risks of a chip shortage,"" Chief Financial Officer Kenta Kon said during a briefing.
Kon said Toyota had heard chip shortages globally might continue until the summer, though the situation might resolve itself earlier.
Asked about why the automaker is seeing limited impact compared with competitors, Kon said Toyota has been constantly providing its short-term and long-term production volume plans to suppliers.
The automobile industry has been grappling with a chip shortage since the end of last year, which has in some cases been exacerbated by the former U.S. administration's sanctions on Chinese chip factories.
But the maker of the RAV4 SUV crossover and Prius hybrid said it expects to sell 9.73 million vehicles this year, up 3.3% from a previous forecast of 9.42 million yet still down from last year's 10.46 million.
""The fact that Toyota isn't largely affected by the chip shortage now is an encouraging catalyst,"" said Hideyuki Suzuki, a general manager of investment research at SBI Securities.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, Toyota now expects record operating profit of 2 trillion yen ($19.13 billion), far higher than an earlier projection of 1.3 trillion yen, and well above an average 1.542 trillion yen profit forecast based on estimates from 23 analysts, Refinitiv data showed.
The automaker now expects the yen to trade at 105 yen against the U.S. dollar, versus a previous forecast of 106 yen. 
Toyota said operating profit rose to 987.9 billion yen in the three months ended Dec. 31 versus an average 565.51 billion yen profit from nine analysts surveyed by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Wednesday, boosted by continued optimism for a global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic as well as solid earnings from French banking giant  Societe Generale  (OTC:SCGLY).
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3%, and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
China's factory gate prices rose in annual terms in January for the first time in a year, according to data released earlier Wednesday, pointing to strong manufacturing growth in the world's second-largest economy.
However, this positive news has to be tempered by Chinese consumer prices falling back into deflation as virus restrictions curbed travel and spending.
In Europe, German January consumer prices were confirmed climbing 0.8% on the month, a gain of 1.0% on the year, having slipped into negative territory late in 2020 due to the government's temporary VAT cut, which has now expired.
Stock markets have climbed strongly in the last few months on expectations of a global economic recovery on the back of vast fiscal and monetary spending coupled with vaccination programs to the end of the coronavirus pandemic. Italian stocks remained near 12-month highs on Tuesday after Silvio Berlusconi said his Forza Italia party will back the new government of Mario Draghi, bringing him closer to commanding a solid majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
Also helping the tone of late has been a solid European earnings season, and this is set to continue Wednesday.
Societe Generale (PA:SOGN) beat expectations, with the French banking giant reporting a net profit of 470 million euros ($569 million) for the fourth quarter, ending 2020 with a net loss of 258 million euros. The bank saw a “significant improvement” in the business during the second half of 2020, after heavy losses on equity derivatives earlier in the year.
German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) raised its full-year outlook for sales, cash flow and profits, citing improved demand for automotive components and materials.
On a busy day for corporate results, earnings are also expected from the likes of   Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP), Metro (DE:B4B), Siemens Energy (DE:ENR1n), Heineken (OTC:HEINY) and Equinor (OL:EQNR).
Oil prices edged lower Wednesday, as traders began taking profits after a week-long rally, validated on Tuesday by a further drop in  U.S. crude stocks. The American Petroleum Institute reported an unexpected fall in inventories last week. Supply data from the Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, will now be studied carefully.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $58.18 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $60.94. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,844.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2125.

LONDON (Reuters) - Macquarie, the world's largest infrastructure investor, has raised 1.6 billion euros ($1.93 billion) for its second global renewables fund, driven by strong demand from institutional investors in Britain and Germany.
Countries and companies are seeking to increase their usage of renewable energy to lower carbon emissions and fight climate change. At the same time, record low interest rates have crimped fixed income returns and boosted the allure of alternative assets.
Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA), manager of the fund, said it had drawn investment from 32 institutions, including pension schemes, insurers and sovereign wealth funds, helping it exceed a minimum target of 1 billion euros.
While Europe-based investors contributed most of the capital - German and British investors accounting for 30% each - the fund, Macquarie Green Investment Group Renewable Energy Fund 2, also attracted interest from Asia Pacific and North America.
It will target wind and solar projects in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand.
""In the geographies this particular fund is focused on, there's over 300 gigawatts of additional capacity required in the next five years,"" Leigh Harrison, Head of MIRA EMEA, told Reuters.
While the push by countries to meet the terms of the Paris climate accord was a big driver of demand, many were also looking to renewables projects to help Build Back Better from the economic ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
British pension scheme Border to Coast, which invests 45 billion pounds ($62.08 billion) on behalf of local government workers, pledged 101 million euros to the new Macquarie fund, which has a projected life-span of 25 years.
""Climate Change is one of the largest risks facing investors – and so investing in assets that recognise this risk and help play a part in the solution is a natural fit for us,"" Daniel Booth, the scheme's chief investment officer, told Reuters.
The decision to launch a second renewables infrastructure fund comes three years after Macquarie took over the running of its predecessor through the 2.3 billion pound acquisition of the Green Investment Bank from the British government.
While that fund, Macquarie Green Investment Group Renewable Energy Fund 1, was dedicated to offshore wind in Britain, the new fund's broader remit has already resulted in two investments: a 10% stake in the 576 MW Gwynt y Môr Offshore Wind Farm in Britain and a 50% stake in a 268 MW U.S.-focused portfolio of residential rooftop solar projects

The group now expects to almost break even on an adjusted operating profit level, having previously expected a mid triple-digit million euro loss in the year to September.
The group's steel division, which could be sold, spun off or kept, swung to an adjusted operating profit of 20 million euros ($24 million) in the first quarter, compared with a loss of 127 million in the same period last year.

Global stocks look set to reach another record high as COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out, the prospect of further U.S. stimulus measures rises, and the number of global COVID-19 cases starts to decline.
However, investors are starting to reconsider how much government stimulus spending, easy money from central banks and inoculations against COVID-19 will boost stocks, oil and inflation. This led them to hit pause on a global markets rally on Tuesday.
Some investors dismissed these worries.
“Substantial inflation worries are potentially overblown,” Axi chief global markets strategist Stephen said in a note.
However, other investors struck a more cautious note.
“A pullback here could give tactical opportunities to those who were looking to get involved … it seems like right now the story is just getting started, and the momentum is building behind it, and that story includes the reopening, vaccines, the downward trend now in some of the virus cases we’ve been seeing, supported by the stimulus talks and the Federal Reserve still on the side lines,” Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors investment strategist Mona Mahajan told Bloomberg.

961,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 06:10PM ET</span>",Buy a car with bitcoin? Some car dealers were years ahead of Musk,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Georgia car dealer Christopher Basha was way ahead of Elon Musk in embracing bitcoin as a currency for selling vehicles.
Basha said he learned about cryptocurrency from a roommate who mined bitcoin. “Someone bought a pizza with bitcoin,"" he said. ""Buying a car with bitcoin didn't seem that crazy.”
He began accepting bitcoin payments in 2015, but no customers were interested. ""I almost forgot about it,"" he said.
In 2017, bitcoin prices surged, and one customer used the cryptocurrency to buy four Kias for a total of more than $150,000, Basha said. Bitcoin payments have been picking up since late last year, with prices rallying. 
Basha is one of a small group of auto dealers who have been accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from customers well ahead of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's revelation that it had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars. 
Dealers said accepting cryptocurrency is a good marketing and branding tool. But it is still a niche business. Price volatility and the absence of trusted banks and other financial intermediaries make bitcoin payments a risk for dealers who are not tech savvy. 
Basha, the Kia dealer, said he converts bitcoin into cash immediately upon receipt because he believes it risky for a company the size of his to hold such a volatile asset. But it does take several minutes to turn bitcoin into U.S. dollars on a payment platform, which occasionally leads to losses averaging $300 to $400 on each transaction due to price movements. 
Once, he forgot his password to send bitcoin from one account to another to make the dollar conversion after receiving payments from a customer. ""I was freaked out… There is no middleman who’s going to come save you."" 
Pietro Frigerio, a Lamborghini dealer in Irvine, California, said when bitcoin prices surged in 2017, his store sold 20 cars in a month. But during the latest rally, he has not seen much increase in bitcoin payments. 
“People are waiting for exchange rates to go up further,"" said Frigerio, who also sells other premium luxury sports cars like Bugatti and McLaren.
He said customers who bought cars with bitcoin have something in common: they are young people who have a strong belief in virtual currency. 
""More and more, Bitcoin is becoming a common payment form,"" Lamborghini said in a statement to Reuters, adding that its dealers are free to decide payment methods.
Peter Saddington, founder of cryptocurrency startup Emrit, bought a Lamborghini Huracan in 2017 using bitcoin that he bought in 2011 for $115 in a bid to bring attention to his company and cryptocurrency. 

""(Tesla's move) is certainty a PR stunt,"" he told Reuters. ""But Elon is very progressive in his thinking, so it makes sense to me that he would offer a future currency for his company.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Tuesday it was extending production cuts at three North American plants until at least mid-March due to the global semiconductor chip shortage, while vehicles at two other factories would only be partially built.
GM's U.S. rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co also said Tuesday that it was in limited cases parking partly assembled vehicles due to the chip shortage.
GM, whose shares dipped 1.1% after the announcement, did not disclose the impact on volumes or say which supplier and vehicle parts were affected by the chip shortage.

""Semiconductor supply remains an issue that is facing the entire industry,"" GM spokesman David Barnas said. ""GM's plan is to leverage every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products.""
GM said it was extending downtime at its U.S. plant in Fairfax, Kansas; its Canadian factory in Ingersoll, Ontario; and its Mexican facility in San Luis Potosi until mid-March when it would reassess the situation, he said.
In addition, GM said it would build but leave incomplete for final assembly vehicles at Wentzville, Missouri, and its Mexican plant at Ramos Arizpe.
GM vehicles affected by the idled plants include the Chevrolet Malibu sedan, Cadillac XT4 SUV, Chevy Equinox, and GMC Terrain SUVs. Vehicles to be left incomplete for now included the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon pickups and Chevy Blazer SUV.
This week, GM had said it was idling the three factories where it has now extended downtime and said it would halve production at a plant in South Korea.
Ford's chief product platform officer, Hau Thai-Tang, at a conference on Tuesday raised the possibility that Ford might have to park vehicles that would need parts added later because of the chip shortage. Kelli Felker, a Ford spokeswoman, later said the company was doing that ""in limited cases,"" but did not say what vehicles were affected.
The shortage stems from a confluence of factors as auto manufacturers, which shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies. 
Consumers have stocked up on laptops, gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic, leading to tight chip supplies. They have also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring, further straining supplies. 
The chip shortage has affected many automakers, including Toyota, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Stellantis,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Subaru (OTC:FUJHY), Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Honda and Mazda. 
VW said Tuesday it expects chip supply to remain tight in the first half of the year.
AutoForecast Solutions on Tuesday updated its estimate for lost production this year, saying the global industry could lose almost 1.3 million vehicles as a result of the shortage. GM could lose an estimated 111,450 vehicles, the forecasting firm said.
Honda and Nissan said on Tuesday they would sell 250,000 fewer cars in total this financial year due to the chip shortage. 
Ford said last week the shortage was hitting production of its highly profitable F-150 pickup trucks, saying it could lose 10% to 20% of planned first-quarter vehicle production and earnings could fall by $1 billion to $2.5 billion.
Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), is at the center of efforts to resolve the shortage. U.S. officials discussed the issue with their Taiwanese counterparts last week.
Chinese officials said on Tuesday they had met with auto and chip companies, asking them to help ease the shortage. French state officials meet with auto and electronics industry leaders on Wednesday to discuss the issue.
The Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA) said this week that chip shortages had hurt national auto production in January, and it would likely dampen output during the first half of 2021.

The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents technology and auto companies, wrote U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urging action to address the shortage, including providing ""substantial funding"" to ensure there will be enough chips.

NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said she and 25 other representatives of New York's securities industry sent a letter last Wednesday to state legislative leaders warning against the unintended consequences of imposing such a tax, which would ultimately be borne by investors. 
""The New York Stock Exchange belongs in New York. If Albany lawmakers get their way, however, the center of the global financial industry may need to find a new home,"" she said.
An NYSE representative declined to comment further. 
New York State is facing steep budgetary shortfalls due to the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting some state lawmakers to introduce a bill https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/s3980 that would tax certain financial transactions.
The idea of a new transaction tax seems to have little support with the governor's office. 
When the topic came up at a January press conference, Budget Director Robert Mujica said a lot of ideas around such taxes ""haven't been fleshed out,"" according to a copy of the remarks provided to Reuters by an official in the New York State Division of the Budget.
Mujica pointed to a financial tax that had been proposed last year in New Jersey, where many exchanges host their servers, and noted that the exchanges quickly mobilized to temporarily move their employees and activity outside of the state.

The pandemic has shown people can do business anywhere, he said. ""So if we increase the tax like that, you mobilize people, potentially just move your transactions and your servers to another part of the country where those taxes don't exist.""

The Conference Board's quarterly U.S. Consumer Dynamics Report showed 20% of consumers surveyed in the fourth quarter of 2020 invested in shares of stocks or mutual funds, up from 15% in the second quarter. No data was available for the third quarter. 
""Trends like low interest rates and declining debt concerns, alongside below-normal spending on vacations and out-of-home entertainment due to pandemic restrictions, have left a portion of Americans with more disposable income and fewer ways to spend it,"" said Denise Dahlhoff, a senior researcher at The Conference Board. ""Stocks, which continue to yield strong returns, have become an increasingly attractive option for these consumers.""
The share of consumers spending more on home improvements increased to 24% from 21% in the second quarter. With the pandemic now in its second year, fewer Americans are going on vacations, buying new clothes and technology products. 
The share of consumers spending money on holidays or vacations fell to 24% from 28% in the second quarter. Fewer are also spending on out-of-home entertainment and healthcare.
The share of consumers putting money into savings fell to 43% last quarter from 49% in second quarter, likely because of near zero interest rates. 
But the pandemic has widened income inequality, which has been worsened by the so-called K-shaped recovery, with better-paid workers doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out.
The survey showed 26% of consumers were not paying off their debt, including credit cards and loans. Though that was down from 29% in the second quarter, it remained quite high. Just under a fifth of consumers were not putting money into a retirement fund and 10% said they had no cash to spare.

The move gives power to senior officers in the SEC's enforcement division to authorize staff to subpoena documents and take sworn testimony, acting chair Allison Herren Lee said in the statement.
The delegation of the authority comes a month after the inauguration of U.S. President Joe Biden. Under the previous administration, the enforcement division's two co-directors had to approve orders to kick off any formal probes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's pick as budget director on Tuesday struck a critical tone against China, voicing concern about potential security threats posed by Chinese technology and accusing Beijing of failing to meet bilateral commitments.
Neera Tanden, nominated to head the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, told senators she would work with Congress to shore up the security of U.S. supply chains and work with allies to put more pressure on Beijing to adhere to global trade rules.
""The bilateral relationship between China and the United States, in the last several years is one where China did not uphold ... its end of the bargain,"" Tanden said at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
""It is vital that we ensure that China change course,"" she said. ""It is important that we marshal allies to put pressure on China to ensure that they have a fair trading system where American companies can truly compete against China.""
If confirmed as OMB director, as expected, Tanden would oversee the agency that acts as a gatekeeper for the $4 trillion federal budget and all fiscal and regulatory initiatives.
The White House is reviewing all policies of former President Donald Trump's administration towards China, including a two-year interim trade deal signed by Trump in January 2020.
Given that Democrats control the Senate, Tanden can become the OMB's director even if she wins no Republican support.
Tanden said bilateral trade ties had not been effective in changing China's ""mercantilist"" approach and addressing its failure to abide by global trading rules, which she said were unfair to American companies and American workers.
Biden has pledged support for reforming the World Trade Organization, and has repeatedly said he plans to work with allies to address challenges posed by China.
She told the committee she shared concerns about threats to U.S. supply lines posed by Chinese products such as those of telecoms equipment maker Huawei, and would look carefully at federal procurement.
Asked if she viewed Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok as a security threat, Tanden said, ""I think we should be concerned about any entity that takes information and shares its private technological information. To the extent TikTok is doing that, I would share that concern.""

Tanden also underscored the Biden administration's focus on human rights, and said she was hopeful a new generation of leaders in Hong Kong were fighting for ""basic human rights and basic human protections.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Stock brokers in Canada cannot use marketmakers to execute trades for a fee, under a government rule that has restricted the growth of zero-commission trading platforms like Robinhood, whose booming business in United States was linked to wild swings in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other ""Reddit rally"" stocks.
U.S. zero-commission platforms sell orders to wholesale marketmakers and generate revenue. Canadian brokers are required to fulfill trades on exchanges because it makes the stock market more transparent than splitting trades among market makers.
""Canadian regulators require brokers to go with best execution... for all orders to meet at the market,"" rather than through a wholesale marketmaker, said Marius Zoican, assistant professor of finance at the University of Toronto. 
""As long as payment for order flow is not allowed in Canada, it would be difficult to have full-fledged zero-commission trading,"" he added.
In the United States, 10 million new retail brokerage accounts opened in 2020, according to JMP Securities, driven by the growth of zero-commission trading, versus 2.4 million in Canada, based on Investor Economics' retail brokerage research.
In Canada, most online trading platforms still charge commissions, even as they add new revenue sources to overcome pressure from declining trading fees. That has left Canadian retail investors with limited choices for commission-free trading.
""They're like gyms that rely on only 5% of members showing up; when 40% show up on the same day, they've got problems,"" said Glenn LaCoste, chief executive at Surviscor, which analyses online services including Canadian discount brokerages.
""Everybody wants to talk zero commission, but there's no free lunch.""
Questrade, one of Canada's biggest non-bank online brokerages with C$20 billion ($15.7 billion) of client assets, has had about 200,000 account openings annually in its 21 years of operation. Robinhood has amassed over 13 million accounts in seven years.
WHAT NEXT AFTER FREE?
While Robinhood's zero-commission trades have pushed bigger rivals including  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) and Fidelity to follow suit, most major Canadian trading platforms, including the biggest banks, Questrade and Aviso Wealth's Qtrade, still charge for trades, and show no inclination to change. 
Regulators Canadian Securities Administrators and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada have not announced any changes to regulations, and did not respond to requests for comment about plans for payments for order flows. 
""We have a very strong regulatory system in Canada... and we're not even close to the model of the firms"" that experienced capital shortfalls in the U.S., said Stephen Graham (NYSE:GHM), chief operating officer at Questrade.
""Where does your pricing strategy go after free?"" 
Qtrade's new account openings spiked 60% in the last week of January from previous weeks, and trade volumes doubled in the month from a year earlier, more than half of these coming from Blackberry (TSX:BB), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings and GameStop, according to Aviso data.
""Charging for the trades helps to cover our costs,"" said Christine Zalzal, head of online brokerage and digital wealth at Aviso. ""Others who have zero commission may not have the robust information, education and support that we provide.""
The only major zero-commission trading platform in Canada is Wealthsimple, owned by Power Corp of Canada,. It charges 1.5% in exchange fees on U.S. trades and funds Canadian trades with local deposits, Chief Executive Michael Katchen told Reuters. About 20% of its trades are in U.S. dollars.
Wealthsimple, which has about 700,000 trading clients and C$3 billion of assets, plans to grow revenues by adding premium features for more sophisticated clients, he added. 
The firm, which has seen 70% growth in new clients since the beginning of 2021, is more open than some rivals to introducing payment for order flows.

""There are great ways to introduce payment for order flows, in particular if the broker decides to share revenue with clients, enabling better price execution,"" Katchen said. ""In the U.S., because of a lack of transparency, and a misunderstanding of the business model, there was a huge backlash against this.""

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) delivered 26 aircraft in January, boosted by the clearing of the 737 MAX jet to fly again after a 20-month ban as it also won four new orders for its 747-8 freighters.
MAX deliveries are seen as central to Boeing's financial recovery in 2021 after a sharp slump in demand for its bigger, more profitable wide-body jets due to the coronavirus crisis added to the company's woes last year.
Boeing, which books revenue after actual deliveries, said it handed over 21 737 MAX jets last month, along with one P8 military plane and four wide-body aircraft other than the 787 Dreamliner that had no deliveries for the third straight month.
The overall figure compared to 39 aircraft in December and was double the 13 planes delivered in January of last year, as Boeing struggled with the MAX's grounding. In January two years ago, the company delivered 46 planes. 
Following January's deliveries, Boeing is now estimated to have a total of about 400 737 MAX jets in storage, down from about 450 at the end of November, when the U.S. regulator gave a green light to start the jet's shipments.
The four gross orders for the 747-8 freighters from Atlas Air (NASDAQ:AAWW) had already been announced. 
January orders net of cancellations and conversions, however, stood at negative two, as customers scrapped two orders for 737 MAX jets and four wide-body 747-8 aircraft.
A business jet customer and Czech airline Smartwings canceled one order each for the 737 MAX, while three orders for 747-8 freighters were scratched by Russian carrier Volga-Dnepr and one by Jordan's Royal Jordanian, the company said.
Boeing removed from its backlog another 11 737 MAX jets seen as unlikely to be filled when stricter accounting standards are applied. When adjusted for the accounting standard, that made January net orders negative 13.

European rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) reported deliveries of 21 aircraft in January with no orders or cancellations.

The Indianapolis-based drugmaker said it immediately hired external counsel to conduct an independent probe after it was made aware of the allegations. The investigation revealed consensual though inappropriate personal communications between Smiley and certain Lilly employees.
Lilly said the behavior exhibited poor judgment by Smiley. The company would not give further details on the communications or the number of employees involved. 
Reuters could not immediately reach Smiley for comment. A LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) search showed Smiley's account, which he managed himself, was no longer available.
The company took ""swift and significant action"" as soon as it learned about the allegations, a Lilly spokeswoman told Reuters.
Eli Lilly shares were down about 2%. The stock had risen 40% through Monday's close in the past 12 months.
Smiley has been with the company since 1995 and became CFO in 2018. He will be replaced by Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company in 2001 and was most recently senior vice president, controller and chief financial officer of Lilly Research Laboratories, Lilly said.
Smiley's conduct was not related to financial controls, financial statements or any other business matters or judgments, the company said, and he will be available to assist in the transition of his role through July at reduced cash compensation of $9,000 every two weeks.
Smiley has agreed to forgo all of his $1 million 2020 cash bonus, about $3 million he was awarded between 2018 and 2020, and all of his other current and future stock awards, totaling about $20 million based on Lilly's share price, according to a public filing. Earlier this month, Smiley sold shares worth more than $3 million, filings show. 
Executive behavior and the treatment of employees has been under scrutiny over the past few years following the #MeToo social media movement.
In 2019, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) dismissed Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook over a consensual relationship with an employee, which the board determined violated company policy.

 Intel Corp  (O:INTC) Chief Executive Brian Krzanich resigned in June 2018, after an investigation found he had a consensual relationship with an employee that breached company policy.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 11:05AM ET</span>",Reddit-fuelled retail trading frenzy spreads to Europe,"By Lawrence White and Anna Irrera
LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. retail stock trading phenomenon driven by the WallStreetBets Reddit forum is fuelling a copycat trading boom in Europe, bank and brokerages said.
Younger investors in Britain and other countries are fast joining online trading platforms and spending more on shares at traditional brokerages, hoping to copy Americans who bet on stocks such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) during the frenzy this year.
British-based online trading platform Freetrade signed up over 160,000 customers in January, pushing it past 500,000 in total, thanks to the hype around the so-called Reddit rally stocks, Freetrade told Reuters. 
""When investors become so excited about the potential for a particular stock or asset class, the story can sometimes move from the world of financial news to the mainstream,"" said Adam Dodds, chief executive of Freetrade.
The Reddit stock mania has galvanised a retail trading boom that was already underway in Europe in 2020, as bored housebound punters saving extra money tried to cash in on market volatility, and new user-friendly apps gave them the means.
The surging interest in stock investing is also due to macroeconomic factors in continental Europe, including rock-bottom interest rates, high house prices and inadequate pension systems, said Nick Bortot, co-CEO of Amsterdam-based digital broker BUX.
The U.S. Reddit-fuelled stock craze has lit the touchpaper, he said.
""During the last couple of weeks since GameStop and others hit the headlines, we have onboarded a few thousand customers a day, two or three times our average,"" he said.
Traditional brokers have also benefited.
Spending on credit and debit cards by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) customers at brokerages grew by over 300% year-on-year in January, the British bank said, continuing a growth boom that started last year mainly among the 18-29 age group. 
LATE TO THE PARTY
Regulators and some of the brokers themselves have cautioned that with the new craze comes risks, especially for latecomers chasing easy gains.
Some investors in the U.S. made a lot of money in the early days of the social media-fuelled frenzy, which pitted amateur traders against Wall Street hedge funds that had built up big bets against the fortunes of unloved stocks like GameStop. 
Many of those late to the party have lost heavily as GameStop's stock crashed to as low as $51 last week after hitting $483 the week before, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said regulators must keep a close watch. 
European Union regulators have also said they may intervene after a surge in online share trading by retail investors since restrictions to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic were introduced.
Many investors in Europe caught up in the hype are more focused on U.S. stocks rather than companies closer to home, bank and brokerage sources said.
""We are seeing an increase of retail investors outside the U.S. opening stock accounts. Most of these are household names and with a virtual halt on other forms of betting due to the pandemic, some retail punters are increasingly betting on US stocks,"" said the head of trading at a U.S. bank in London.
Younger overseas investors are ignoring domestic shares in favour of the U.S. because it offers both the Reddit rally stocks and many of the world's household name tech companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Freetrade says its UK retail customer orders are split around 55% for US-listed securities and 45% for UK-listed ones.
Lewis Harding, a 22-year-old Freetrade user from Leeds, said he holds a mix of US and UK shares in his portfolio, including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Plc and Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc . 
He made his first investment in 2017, buying shares of Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc one of the world's largest cannabis companies. 
The trade was successful and he managed to buy his first car with the gains. Since then, he's been focused on bigger, more stable companies and says he educates himself by reading investment books, watching YouTube videos and listening to podcasts. He expressed enthusiasm about what has happened in markets over the past few weeks.

""It's been quite amazing what's been happening,"" Harding said. ""I haven't bought GameStop myself but I watched from the sidelines and it was crazy.""

988,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>","Pot ETF Trio Soars 90% to Open 2021 on Legalization Hopes, M&A","(Bloomberg) -- The top performing exchange-traded funds so far in 2021 have at least one thing in common: They all track the pot industry.
The Global X Cannabis ETF (POTX), the Cannabis ETF (THCX) and Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (CNBS) -- have returned more than 90% year-to-date, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those three non-leveraged products have largely outpaced the 4% gain in the S&P 500 Index.
That outperformance of those funds in the $5.8 trillion ETF industry highlights how hopes for legalization on both the state and federal levels are boosting the cannabis market and unleashing a wave of mergers and acquisitions. Most recently, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed to legalize marijuana in his state, while a Democratic majority in Congress is fueling optimism of more widespread approval measures.
Such legislation “could legitimatize it and spur demand for marijuana, which would make companies that were suppliers more profitable,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for CFRA Research.
Besides a more accommodative political climate toward the group, cannabis stocks are surging on expectations for profit growth as well as a pickup in mergers and acquisitions, according to Kenneth Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
 Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) Corp. -- a producer of medical marijuana -- jumped 5% at 10:28 a.m. in New York after reporting revenue that beat the average analyst estimate. Other pot stocks and ETFs also surged on Tuesday.
The POTX fund climbed 11%, extending this year’s surge to almost 130%. Its largest holdings Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Inc. and Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc. -- which agreed to a merger of $3.8 billion in December -- have skyrocketed in 2021, thanks in part to crowds on Reddit and internet forums piling in.
Those companies are also the two biggest stakes in the $1.95 billion ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ), currently in fourth place among non-leveraged ETFs. It’s surged more than 90% this year and has taken in about $200 million, already more than half of its entire 2020 inflows.
Still, the performance of cannabis ETFs is notoriously volatile. While the funds rallied in 2018 after Canada and California deregulated production, a combination of disappointing earnings reports, stalling legalization efforts and difficulties in developing the right mix of products hurt returns.
“It seems like the cannabis space is a whirlwind: You can have some great return periods and others that are more challenging,” said David Perlman, an ETF strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. “It’s one where you have to expect volatility, and you really have to look at the ETF to make sure you’re getting the names that you want.”

992,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 09:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ubben seeks $8 billion for new hedge fund amid talks with Exxon - sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Jeffrey Ubben, a hedge fund veteran in talks to join  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s board, is seeking to raise as much as $8 billion for his new socially and environmentally conscious fund, according to people familiar with the matter.
This would be the first fund Ubben has amassed since he launched his new firm, Inclusive Capital Partners, last summer. He left ValueAct Capital, the activist hedge fund he co-founded in 2000, while retaining stewardship of the ValueAct Spring Fund, a $1.2 billion capital pool focused on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing.
The fundraising comes as Ubben is negotiating what would be a major boon for his new firm and himself - a board seat at Exxon, the most valuable U.S. oil major. 
The Irving, Texas-based company is under pressure from investors, including hedge funds Engine No. 1 and D.E. Shaw, to cut costs and tackle its impact on climate change more forcefully. Engine No. 1, which is also focused on ESG investing, has put forward four of its own nominees for election to Exxon's board. Ubben is allied with D.E. Shaw.
An agreement to add Ubben to Exxon's board, which could help the energy giant burnish its environmental credentials, may come as early as this week, one of the sources said. It's not clear how much of the new fund Ubben would use to invest in the company, which has a market capitalization of $220 billion.
Exxon declined to comment.
Eva Zlotnicka, one of Inclusive Capital's co-founders and a managing partner, told investors and lawyers on a private Zoom call organized by the New York University School of Law's Institute for Corporate Governance and Finance two weeks ago that the firm was seeking to raise as much as $8 billion for the new fund, three people familiar with the matter said.
Named Spring Fund II, the new capital pool would be used to invest in companies with environmental and social problems and help address them, Zlotnicka said on the call. Ubben and his partners at Inclusive Capital fashion themselves as ""management consultants with an ownership stake to collaborate with courageous CEOs,"" Zlotnicka said, according to the sources.
Inclusive Capital plans to amass stakes in roughly 15 companies, while expecting to get board seats on roughly half of them, the sources said. 
While Zlotnicka did not discuss the fund's fees on the call, one of the sources said they would be significantly lower than those of the first Spring Fund. That fund charged a 1.5% management fee and 20% performance fee, which is customary among hedge funds. Investors in Spring Fund II would be expected to lock up their money for five years, the source added.
All the sources requested anonymity because the fundraising process is confidential.
Ubben did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Over the span of two decades, Ubben and his team at ValueAct pushed for changes at some of the world's most prominent companies, from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON:RR). Ubben avoided proxy contests to replace board directors, preferring to work behind the scenes to win the backing of corporate boards.
Yet he gradually grew disillusioned with what he saw as hedge funds' short-term investment agendas. He launched the first Spring fund in 2018 to focus on ESG, an area of investing that has become increasingly popular on Wall Street. 
The fund invested in BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, another oil major, as well as electric truck maker Nikola Corp and power utilities Hawaiian Electric Industries (NYSE:HE) Inc and AES (NYSE:AES) Corp.

Some of the Spring Fund's early bets soured. After Nikola's shares soared following its merger with a blank-check acquisition company, they stumbled amid production challenges, criticism from short sellers and a decision by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in November to downsize a co-operation agreement.

""Beyond autonomous driving the concept of vertical mobility could be a next step to take our mobility approach into the future, especially in the technically affine Chinese market,"" the German group said in a statement.
""Therefore we are investigating potential concepts and partners in a feasibility study to identify the possibility to industrialize this approach.""
In an interview https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/ with Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess on Linkedin, the carmaker's China head Stephan Woellenstein said the company wanted to develop a drone that could be licensed, giving it a way to participate in this future market.
China is the world's biggest autos market, and also accounts for the largest part of Volkswagen's sales.
The news comes as companies from start-ups to other global carmakers are racing to develop commercial ""robo-taxis"", hoping to cash in on a market  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says could be worth $1.5 trillion by 2040.
In addition to big players such as Volkswagen and Airbus, groups including U.S.-based Joby, Germany's Lilium, and Volocopter, whose financial backers include Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), are pursuing such plans.

Munich-based Lilium said in November it would set up its first U.S. hub near Orlando, putting more than 20 million Floridians within range of its winged electric aircraft that can take off vertically and cover 300 km (185 miles).

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone 12 mini U.S. sales were just 5% of overall sales of its new phones during the first half of January, industry data provider Counterpoint said on Tuesday, adding to signs of muted demand for the new smaller version of its flagship device.
Smartphone users have switched to larger devices in recent years as they devour more video content on-the-go and binge on visually rich social media platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram, Tiktok and Snapchat. 
Graphics: Global share of small-screen smartphones steadily declines - https://graphics.reuters.com/APPLE-IPHONE/rlgpdewkbvo/chart.png
J.P. Morgan analyst William Yang said in a note last week that weak demand for the smaller iPhone 12 and 12 mini might lead Apple to stop production of the mini in the second quarter.
""The product mix adjustment is well expected by investors and should not be a negative surprise,"" Yang added.
Apple was not immediately available for comment. 
The company launched a smaller variant of the iPhone 12 model last year, but demand for the smaller smartphones seems to be weaker, compared to the high-end iPhone 12 Pros and the older iPhone 11s.
""This is in line with what we're seeing in the broader global market, where screens under 6.0"" now account for around 10% share of all smartphones sold,"" Kang added.
Apple shipped its iPhone 12 lineup several weeks later than usual last year, but an expanded number of models and new look tapped pent-up demand for upgrades, especially in China.
Last month, the Cupertino, California-based company reported $65.60 billion in quarterly revenue from its iPhones business, beating a record it had set three years ago.

The Federal Customs Service opened the case in December against H&M’s Russian unit for not including some of the license fees it pays to its Swedish parent in declarations when importing goods from 2016 to 2019, according to documents seen by Bloomberg News.
H&M paid 3.1 billion rubles in 2019 to cover the discrepancy after an audit, a person with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. The payment did not forestall the criminal case, which could result in fines of as much as twice the calculated discrepancy or even jail sentences for senior executives, the person said.
H&M’s press office in Stockholm confirmed there is an investigation, but couldn’t provide details because they had not received information from local authorities. The Federal Customs Service didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
H&M sales in Russia were 6.23 billion kronor ($745 million) in the financial year ending Nov. 30, according to a company report. The retailer had 155 stores in the country, which is its seventh biggest market.
In 2014, Swedish beauty-products producer Oriflame was fined 1 billion rubles by Russian authorities for tax violations in a case that “seriously concerned the European business community,” the Association of European Businesses in Moscow said at the time.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 07:21AM ET</span>",Analysis: Mexican power bill seeks legal compromise for bruised investors,"By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is gambling he can use a contentious new bill to cement public sector control of the electricity sector without inundating his government with more lawsuits from investors already smarting from his policies.
Corporate lobbies have objected to the bill, which will give priority in electricity dispatch to national power utility the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), and eliminate Mexico's obligation to buy power through auctions.
Mexico's Business Coordinating Council (CCE) called the shake-up an ""indirect expropriation"", while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it violated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal.
The proposal to put the CFE, a heavy consumer of fossil fuels, ahead of private wind and solar plants, also caused consternation among advocates of renewable energy in Mexico.
Legal experts say the administration will lower the risk of lawsuits if the fast-tracked bill respects contracts signed under a 2013-14 constitutional reform enacted by the last government to open the sector to private capital, even as it curbs future incentives for companies to invest.
The overhaul will not be retroactive, which will safeguard existing projects, said Manuel Rodriguez, a member of Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) who heads the lower house of energy committee that now has the bill.
""Investments already made in accordance with the rules of the energy reform are guaranteed, and will continue, there won't be a change of rules for those investments,"" he told Reuters.
That point could be stipulated in the transitory articles attached to the legislation, he said.
Going forward, amended rules would apply to new investors, such as companies having to cover the cost of back-up energy rather than piggybacking on the CFE, he noted.
REPUTATION
Lopez Obrador has said his predecessor's energy opening distorted the market in favor of private firms at the expense of the CFE and state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
His government has tried to walk back the reform by holding up projects and issuing regulations that tied up companies in litigation, angering the private sector and causing friction with major trade partners.
Shortly after Lopez Obrador's proposal was unveiled last week, consultations began between foreign embassies in Mexico and the private sector, according to diplomatic sources.
Investors believe it could violate Mexico's constitution and USMCA commitments.
Last week, the Supreme Court threw out provisional regulations the energy ministry has pushed through to help the CFE. An actual change in the law would be harder for the court to overturn, legal experts said.
In his defense, Lopez Obrador has pointed to a chapter in USMCA recognizing that Mexico has a ""sovereign right to reform its constitution and its domestic legislation."" However, it suggests that any such change should be ""without prejudice"" to the ""rights and remedies"" of the United States and Canada.
If Mexico does not guarantee existing investments, it can expect a flood of litigation, said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister for North America.
Even assuming all prior investments are guaranteed, Mexico might still face further legal wrangling. 
For instance, under USMCA, if Mexico reduces market access to its energy sector, the United States and Canada should get more access to another sector to compensate, said a former trade official who has advised the private sector and the government.
If not, Mexico could face retaliatory measures equivalent in value to the loss of market access, said the former official.
Rozental acknowledged USMCA does not oblige Mexico to continue opening its energy sector, but said the bill gives investors another reason to feel unwelcome.

""A reputation gets damaged overnight,"" Rozental said. ""A reputation's rehabilitation takes a lot of time.""

999,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 07:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: Lost in the 'Gamestonks' mania - What is GameStop actually worth?,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) have been on a wild ride. Analysts who cover the company, however, remain unmoved from their conviction that the stock still has much further to fall before it meets reality. 
The company's shares soared more than 1,600% in January as retail investors, urged on by popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets, bought the stock as a way to punish hedge funds that had taken an outsized short bet against it. 
While few on the forums have posted their breakdown of what they think is the fair value of a share of GameStock, a popular YouTube streamer named Keith Patrick Gill, who posted under the name the Roaring Kitty, suggested in videos prior to the short squeeze that it was worth at least $50 per share.
The company's stock fell 5.9% to $60 in Monday trading. 
Analysts who cover GameStock see it worth on average $13.44 per share, a 78% drop from its current trading price, highlighting the wide gulf between how Wall Street and amateur investors view a stock that has become a symbol of the growing power of retail investors. 
""I've worked on Wall Street for over 20 years and what is happening with GameStop is the most nonsensical, insane thing I've ever seen in my entire career,"" said Anthony Chukumba, a managing director at Loop Capital who covered the company for more than 10 years but recently dropped his coverage due to a lack of interest by institutional investors. 
""GameStop at most is worth $10 a share,"" Chukumba said, given its declining market share. ""We've seen short squeezes happen all the time but we've never seen a stock become so disconnected from the fundamentals.""
FOCUS TO DIGITAL 
At heart is whether the company will be able to transition to a focus on digital sales without losing its profitable used games business, which at gross margins of approxamitely 50% is by far its most lucrative business segment. 
GameStop did not respond to a request for comment.
In an unlikely ""bright blue sky"" scenario, GameStop shares would be worth $125 each, assuming a 20 times multiple of earnings per share of $6.29 in 2024, said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. That would only be possible if GameStop boosts margins by saving $500 million annually by closing its 2,500 physical locations while retaining its market share against competitors such as  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), he said. 
That scenario has at most a 5% probability of happening, Sebastian noted. Far more likely is that GameStop will benefit from faster e-commerce growth while closing stores at a delayed pace with a slower rollout of new services, leaving its shares worth $13 each, he said. 
A ""storm cloud"" scenario, meanwhile, in which customers abandon the store and push the company's share price to zero, is three times more likely to happen than a successful transition to a digital marketplace, Sebastian said. 
The company's current average target price among analysts is nearly double that of November, shortly before Ryan Cohen, one of the company's largest shareholders, urged it in a Nov. 16 letter https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf to focus on digital sales.
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, currently has a $16 per share price target for the company but said that ""you could convince me that it's worth $24"" per share depending on its ability to transition to a digital-first business.
Yet the stock's price has become disconnected from its intrinsic value, leaving it inevitable that it will collapse, he said. 

""They are a real company with real profits and the management team is good,"" Pachter said. ""I was telling the shorts when it was at $8 that it's not going to zero.""

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",Honda and Nissan to sell a quarter of a million fewer cars because of chip shortage,"By Eimi Yamamitsu and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's second and third largest automakers, Honda Motor and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor, will sell a combined 250,000 fewer cars in the current financial year as a global shortage in semiconductor chips hits production.
The automakers made the announcement as they unveiled brighter outlooks for the financial year ending March 2021 as automobile markets, led by China, rebounded from a coronavirus-induced slump. Honda and Nissan also reported better-than-expected results for the October-December quarter.
But Honda cut its sales target by 100,000 vehicles, or 2.2%, on Tuesday to 4.5 million cars, while Nissan lowered its target by 150,000 vehicles, or 3.6%, to 4.015 million units as a chips shortage forced both companies to curb output.
""Popular models that sell well were hit hard by semiconductor shortage,"" Seiji Kuraishi, Honda's Chief Operating Officer said during an online press briefing. ""We needed to swap around and adjust production plans. But that wasn’t enough,"" he added.
The global automobile industry has been grappling with a chip shortage since the end of last year, which has in some cases been exacerbated by the former U.S. administration's sanctions on Chinese chip factories.
Asian chipmakers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co are expanding production to make up for shortages, but have warned that it may take some time to crank up output.
Some companies such as Japan's Renesas Electronics are also seeking price hikes for semiconductors that control engines, sensors and other automotive systems.
Honda's Kuraishi predicted that the shortage would ease in the first half of 2021.
His company last month cut output by about 4,000 units, mainly its Fit and Jazz models, and is also reducing output of five models at five facilities in the United States and Canada.
China's GAC said its joint venture with the automaker had received warnings on supply of certain models.
Nissan said it is reducing production of its best-selling Note compact car, featuring new hybrid technology, at its Oppama plant in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan.
It is also making short-term output adjustments at its North American operations, including three non-production days on the truck line at its Canton, Mississippi, facility..
""We are mitigating the impact if the semiconductor shortage and doing our best to minimize the negative impact,"" Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said during a livestreamed media briefing.
IMPROVED OUTLOOKS
Nissan, which is pulling back from the global expansion pursued by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn, on Tuesday cut its operating loss forecast by more than a third helped by China sales and cost cuts. 
It now expects an operating loss of 205 billion yen ($1.96 billion) in the year ending March 31 compared with an earlier 340 billion yen loss prediction.
Nissan's revised operating loss is smaller than a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of a 230.1 billion yen loss drawn from analysts.
China's auto market grew by 6.4% in December as it continued to lead the industry's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp, a junior partner in the three-way alliance that includes Nissan and Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY), also cut its operating loss forecast on Feb. 2.
The Nissan-Renault pair were among the weakest global automakers going into the coronavirus crisis, lacking a clear plan for using their alliance to emerge from the slump and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles and other technology. 
The latest full-year operating profit forecast from Honda, which is also benefiting from the demand rebound in China and elsewhere, is for 520 billion yen, up from the 420 billion yen profit it predicted three months ago.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading slightly lower Tuesday, consolidating from record levels, with investors keeping a wary eye on the ongoing earnings season and ahead of Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 14 points, or 0.1%. 
All three major indices on Wall Street closed at all time highs on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 have now advanced for six straight sessions, their longest win streaks since August, while the Nasdaq Composite has finished higher on five of those six days. 
These gains have been based, at least in part, on the expectation of additional stimulus from the new Biden administration. This package took a step forward Monday as House Democrats released the first draft text for key pieces of legislation that will comprise the Covid-19 relief bill.
Also helping the tone has been a largely positive earnings season so far, coupled with improving numbers on the pandemic. The United States reported a 25% drop in new cases of Covid-19 to about 825,000 last week, the biggest fall since the pandemic started, while deaths fell 2.5%.
This earnings season continues Tuesday, with the likes of chemicals leader Dupont (NYSE:DD) and tire manufacturer Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) reporting their earnings before the opening bell, and tech giants Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) after the close.
Elsewhere, the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump begins later Tuesday. The House has charged Trump with inciting the riot at Capitol Hill last month, which resulted in five deaths, while his lawyers will argue that he did not call on people to commit violence and that the case should be dismissed. 
On the economic data slate, the Federal Reserve’s favorite gauge of employment is due for release later Tuesday in the form of the Labor Department’s job openings and labor turnover release. 
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, consolidating after reaching their highest levels in 13 months on growing confidence in the recovery of fuel demand, coupled with supply curbs by the top crude producers, primarily Saudi Arabia.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $57.91 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $60.63. Both contracts hit their highest levels since January 2020 earlier Tuesday, and have posted gains for the seventh consecutive session on Tuesday, the longest win streak since January 2019.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,843.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.2101.

1003,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Tesla's Foray Into Bitcoin Raises Red Flags, Both Old and New","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Tesla’s move to buy $1.5 billion of Bitcoin ought to raise more red flags in financial markets than a Communist Party rally in Beijing. Instead, it’s fuelling a speculative mania in an asset that is trading more feverishly than ever before on the Greater Fool principle.
If Elon Musk wishes to speculate on Bitcoin, of course he’s perfectly entitled to. Lots of other people are doing the same, so there are plenty of reasons to believe that he can sell his Bitcoin on at a profit in future. 
But there is no need to do it with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders’ money. If they want to bet on Bitcoin, there is nothing to stop them doing so. However, Tesla investors have bought - albeit at an excruciatingly high price - rights on the future cash flows of a carmaker.
You can argue that there is no inherent conflict there, and it’s true that there may be a substantial overlap between those who believe in Bitcoin and those who believe in Tesla. Certainly, there appears to be a big overlap in mindset, in as much as both are convinced that both will revolutionize and then dominate their respective spheres in future.  
Many Tesla investors will trust any bet that Musk makes, owing to his force of personality. That’s their right, too.  Still, now seems as good a moment as any to remind people that Musk is due to face trial in March on charges of breaching his fiduciary duty when he bailed out his cousins’ failing SolarCity business with $5.6 billion of Tesla’s money back in 2016. Tesla's other directors have already paid $60 million plus legal costs to settle those claims.
What Tesla announced on Monday has nothing to do with making or selling electric cars.  It is simply a bet on a speculative asset whose only intrinsic utility is to make untraceable transactions in illegal goods and services. The claim that the move is a diversification of its corporate treasury assets is a stretch: the aim of diversification is to spread risk, not magnify it (albeit the risk is small relative to Tesla’s balance sheet: the $1.5 billion spent is less than 10% of the cash held by the company at year-end).
But if the claim of diversification is a stretch, the claim that Tesla will accept Bitcoin as payment for its cars is simply eyewash, as neither the customer nor any company would want to set its prices in a currency that can rise or fall by 10% in a day. Tesla's unit of account will remain the dollar for any meaningful timeframe. The fact that Tesla has resorted to such specious arguments should make one instantly suspicious of its real motivation.
It’s hard to shake the suspicion that the main aim of this move is to generate paper profits out of thin air the way that the company has so far done with emissions credits, which are on a long-term downward trend. Both have the effect of masking the reality that the underlying car business can never be profitable enough to justify the business's current valuation (over 1,700 times trailing earnings and 26 times 2020 sales, in case anyone cares).
The leverage that Musk has over financial markets via his fan base makes it risky to bet against Monday’s move, but it is not a healthy sign for markets in general, and for Tesla in particular."

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",JP Morgan's board rejects switch to stakeholder-focused entity,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has led calls for companies to consider the needs of workers, communities and customers as well as those of shareholders.
But now it is clear: investors come first.
That is how activist investor John Harrington interprets a recent decision by JPMorgan's board - chaired by Dimon - not to convert itself to a ""public benefit corporation,"" a Delaware legal structure gaining attention among would-be financial reformers.
JPMorgan's board cited a legal review it commissioned stating, among other things, that when the interests of stockholders and other constituencies conflict at a corporation like JPMorgan, ""the board's fiduciary duties require it to act in a manner that furthers the interests of the stockholders.""
That would not be the case for a public benefit corporation, however. Directors at such companies must balance stockholder interests with the interests of other constituencies, according to the review sent to shareholder Harrington, who had requested it.
Harrington said the document's details and the board's decision show the limits of the sentiments espoused by Dimon and other top CEOs when they issued their ""Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation"" in 2019 calling on companies to look out for all stakeholders.
""What they said was meaningless,"" Harrington said in a telephone interview.
A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.
A representative for the law firm that wrote the report, Richards, Layton & Finger of Wilmington, Delaware, also declined to comment. 
DO THE RIGHT THING
Harrington's effort is one of several campaigns aiming to move corporate practices into line with some CEOs' increasingly liberal rhetoric on hot-button issues like climate change and income inequality. A Reuters analysis found shareholders have often kept their leverage.
Other reformers have urged corporate boards to give their own statements of purpose. A rare example came when tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) in its proxy last year gave its commitment to ""delivering a smoke-free future"" with products scientifically shown to be less harmful than traditional cigarettes. The statement reiterated what the company had called its ""strategic priority"" in 2017. 
Separately, some activists have urged companies to add workers to their boards of directors. But of ten shareholder resolutions filed in 2020 on the topic, none won more than 8% support of votes cast, according to a review by Proxy Insight.
One company that has converted to a public benefit corporation, software maker Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) Inc, won backing for the change from 99% of votes cast last month.
Veeva's certificate of incorporation, sent by a spokesman, now states that the company will be managed to balance stockholder interests with those of its customers, employees and others. ""We believe this corporate structure reflects our guiding principle, 'do the right thing,'"" the document states.
Harrington, the investor, has filed other shareholder resolutions for this spring calling on additional banks to convert themselves to public benefit corporations.
One recipient, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), told Harrington in a Feb. 5 letter that it plans to hold a vote on his proposal at its annual meeting.
But it also stated its board will recommend investors vote against the idea for reasons including that it already operates in a way that balances shareholder and stakeholder interests, and because ""The public benefit corporation model is new, largely untested, and is therefore inappropriate for a company of our size and complexity.""
A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment further.
A spokeswoman for another recipient,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, noted it previously studied and rejected the idea.

In January 2020, Wells Fargo's board said it could already consider stakeholder interests ""without the significant uncertainties, costs, and distractions"" that conversion would require.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",South Korean boy investor with 43% gains is new retail trading icon,"By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - Watching the business news first thing is a new routine for 12-year-old South Korean Kwon Joon, as he dreams of becoming the next Warren Buffett after earning stellar returns of 43% from a hobby picked up just last year: buying stocks. 
Kwon pestered his mother to open a retail trading account last April with savings of 25 million won ($22,400) as seed money, just as the benchmark KOSPI index began recovering from its biggest dip in a decade.
""I really talked my parents into it, because I believed an expert who was saying (on TV) that this is a once-in-a-decade opportunity,"" said Kwon, who rode the steepest jump by year-end among MSCI's country indexes..
""My role model is Warren Buffett,"" he added, in a reference to the U.S. billionaire investor.
""Rather than short-term focused day trading, I want to keep my investment for 10 to 20 years with a long-term perspective, hopefully to maximize my returns.""
South Korea's rookie investors like Kwon, who pursues ""value investing"" in blue chip shares with funds garnered from gifts, trading mini-car toys and running vending machines, have led the blistering rise of retail trade amid the coronavirus pandemic.
More retail investors are teenagers or even younger, making up more than two-thirds of the total value traded in the nation's shares, versus less than 50% in 2019.
The trend has grown as equity markets lure parents disillusioned with the education system and millennials working from home.
""I wonder, in this day and age, whether a college degree would be all that important,"" said Kwon's mother, Lee Eun-joo, who fuelled his passion by looking to expose him to business rather than tuition, seen as key to getting ahead in academics.
""Because we live in a different world now, it could be better to become an 'only-one' kind of person,"" added Lee, who feared even a good schooling might not arm her son against dwindling job opportunities.
About 70% of the 214,800 stock brokerage accounts for minors at Kiwoom Securities, South Korea's most retail-friendly brokerage, with a market share of more than a fifth, were set up in January 2020 or after, its data shows. 
Kwon, with time on his hands during last year's school closures for the pandemic, drew up a wish list of purchases, which he made during market corrections.
These ranged from South Korea's largest messenger app operator Kakao Corp., to the world's biggest memory chip maker Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co., and Hyundai Motor. 
Kwon's success also reflects the employment challenges for young South Koreans, with one in four out of work by January, the worst level on record, despite being among the most highly educated cohort in the OECD club of advanced nations.
Three-quarters go on to college after high school, versus the grouping's 44.5% average, but finding rewarding, creative work is tough. ""There aren't enough jobs for college graduates, so many are opting out to diversify their career path early,"" said vocational researcher Min Sook-weon.
That is something Kwon understands. 
""Rather than going to good schools like the Seoul National University, I'd rather become a big investor,"" he said. ""I also hope to do a lot of charity work.""

Nearly $10 billion worth of shorts were unwound last week on the S&P 500, the largest rate since April, and $21 billion shorts still remain and are in loss, analysts at Citi said.
""There is potential for further short squeezes supporting market gains for another week or two given the size of the remaining short base,"" they wrote in a report late on Monday, based on data on the exchange traded futures.
They also said that at 4,000 points holders of long positions on the index could be tempted to take profit, potentially holding back the market in the short term.
The S&P 500 is up more than 5% so far in February and on Monday it closed at a new all time peak of 3,915 points. 

The surge comes after a social media-driven retail trading frenzy targeted heavily shorted stocks, forcing big hedge funds to close their bearish bets globally.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks rose for the seventh straight day to reach a record high on Tuesday, while bitcoin also reached a peak after an endorsement from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in the prior session had sent the cryptocurrency up 20%.
Robust corporate earnings, monetary and fiscal support from policymakers and prospects that pandemic vaccines could hasten a return to normal in the United States and other countries have all bolstered risk sentiment in recent days.
A record high close for Wall Street overnight gave Asian stocks the confidence to push on further, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 0.3%, led by Chinese blue chips, up 2.2%. 
That helped The MSCI All-Country World Index edge up 0.1% to its own record high, although early moves in Europe's top indexes suggested further gains may be tougher to find, with Britain's FTSE 100 flat on the day.
Futures for the S&P 500 were equally undecided, suggesting a quiet start to the U.S. trading day.
""Reflation on the back of U.S. fiscal stimulus and positive vaccine news remains the major theme for markets,"" strategists at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) wrote.
In keeping with the risk-on sentiment, oil also hit 13-month highs, helped by rising optimism about a return in fuel demand, with Brent crude up 0.8%.
""There is a sense that the glut of oil supply is disappearing more rapidly than anybody thought possible,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""There seems to be a paradigm shift in the market.""
Despite that, concern remains over the pace of vaccination, the efficacy of the vaccines against new strains of the COVID-19 virus and the damage being done to economies, including the impact on the dollar of a planned $1.9 trillion stimulus package.
That suite of negativity helped weigh further on the dollar . Against a basket of other currencies, it was down 0.2% in early deals - bolstering gold, a traditional safe haven against rising inflation, which rose 0.5%.
In more volatile cryptocurrency markets, bitcoin pushed on from the prior day's 20% rally to hit a high of $48,216.09, before edging off its highs to trade around $47,000. 
Still underpinning the gains was a surprise announcement from Tesla Inc on Monday that it had invested around $1.5 billion in the virtual currency and expects to accept it as payment for its cars in the future.

(Reuters) - European shares dipped on Tuesday as a recent rally powered by hopes of a swifter global economic recovery and vaccine roll-outs showed signs of cooling, while shares in French oil major Total rose after its earnings recovered in the fourth quarter.
Total SE rose 1.9% after the company said its earnings recovered in the fourth quarter as oil prices stabilised, although a hit from writedowns on assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic plunged it to a $7.2 billion net loss for 2020 as a whole.
The STOXX 600 index fell 0.1%, after gaining nearly 4% so far this month against the backdrop of steady vaccine roll-outs globally and expectations that a massive stimulus package will soon be passed by U.S. lawmakers.
Early trading showed European defensive sectors including food & beverage, personal & household and healthcare among top gainers.
However, analysts say international investors are looking towards European equities as an attractive investment with corporate earnings showing signs of improvement and on multi-billion dollar deal-making activity recently.
""There is this view that Europe is getting a bump in business investment which I think is right, because when that consumer spending is unleashed, it will lift corporate profits, which have so far been the field indicators of business investments,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.2% even as data showed German exports rose in December as robust trade with China and the United States helped.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Tuesday, consolidating after recent gains, although the energy sector outperformed helped by positive news from oil giant  Total  .
At 4:25 AM ET (0925 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index dropped 0.1% and the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1%.
Total (PA:TOTF) stock rose 2% after the French oil major surprised the market by reporting better than expected fourth quarter earnings, bucking the trend of weakness in the final quarter of 2020 on the back of renewed lockdowns to combat the surge in coronavirus cases.
The company said its earnings recovered in the fourth quarter as oil prices stabilized, although a hit from writedowns on assets due to the pandemic plunged it to a $7.2 billion net loss for 2020 as a whole.
Global stock markets have climbed strongly in the last few months, helped by optimism of future economic growth as governments and central banks continue massive spending and easy money policies while vaccination programs point to the end of the coronavirus pandemic.
The major European indices have generally seen less impressive gains, although the German DAX did reach an all-time high on Monday, with the continent hit hard by the second surge of the virus and European Union’s vaccination drive falling far behind its U.S. and U.K. equivalents.
In other corporate news, Demant (CSE:DEMANT) stock soared 13% after the Danish hearing aid producer easily beat expectations for the second half of 2020. 
Ocado (LON:OCDO) stock dropped 1.9% despite the company reporting its online sales jumped 35% in 2020. That said, the company as a whole, including its tech business, reported a small loss over the year.
On the economic data front, but German exports rose in December as solid trade with China and the United States helped Europe's largest economy.
Oil prices continued to push higher Tuesday, reaching their highest levels in 13 months on growing optimism of the recovery of fuel demand coupled with supply curbs by the top crude producers, primarily Saudi Arabia.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $58.14 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.2% to $60.80.

Market researcher Nielsen said British consumers spent 1.4 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) on groceries online in the four weeks to Jan. 30 - year-on-year growth of 121%.
It said one in three of all British households shopped online, with 770 million pounds of the spend coming from new online shoppers.
The 16% share was the highest level since the 14% recorded in June 2020.

""Retailers were able to flex their capacity in home delivery and increasingly in click and collect to meet the unprecedented number of new online shoppers.”
Nielsen said total UK grocery sales rose 10.6% in January year-on-year, also the highest since June 2020.

The sales rebound led by China, the world's biggest auto market, comes as driver demand for new models including electric vehicles and autonomous drive cars grows. A global shortage of semiconductors, however, is forcing Honda and its global peers to trim vehicle production. 
Honda's latest profit forecast is up from the 420 billion yen profit it predicted three months ago and higher than an average 463.6 billion yen forecast from 21 analysts, Refinitiv data shows.
""Automobile sales results exceeded the same period last year since October due mainly to the launch of new N-ONE,” Seiji Kuraishi, Honda's COO said at a press briefing, referring to the company's micro city car. 
The Japanese carmaker cut production last month by about 4,000 units, mainly affecting its Fit and Jazz models, due to the semiconductor chip shortage. It also reduced output of five models at five facilities in the United States and Canada. China's GAC said its joint venture with the automaker had received warnings on supply of certain models. 
Sources told Reuters the automaker will also reduce its domestic output this month.
Honda said expects to sell 4.5 million cars globally in its business year to March 31 compared with a previous forecast of 4.6 million vehicles
China, one of Honda's biggest markets, grew by 6.4% in December as it continued to lead the industry's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic..
Honda is accelerating its shift to electric cars and other zero-emission vehicles, aiming for two-thirds of its output to be new-energy vehicles by 2030. Last year it launched its first mass-produced all-battery car and also plans to begin selling new autonomous drive vehicles.

""All Gerber products produced in China comply with China's food safety standards on complementary foods for infants and babies,"" the Swiss multinational food and drink conglomerate said in a statement sent to Reuters.
Chinese social media users on the weekend shared screenshots of a Feb. 6 notice issued by an association called the Maternal and Child Industry Committee of China Commercial Economy Society, which said that Gerber products contain toxic metals ""to a dangerous degree"".
The group cited a recent report by U.S. congressional investigators who said they had found ""dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals"" in certain baby foods that could cause neurological damage, including Gerber.
A spokesman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it was reviewing the report by the U.S. investigators and noted that toxic elements are present in the environment and enter the food supply through soil, water or air.
A representative for Gerber said in response to the U.S. report that the elements in question occurred naturally in the soil and water in which crops are grown and it took multiple steps ""to minimize their presence"".
Nestle said warnings over food safety in China were only allowed to be published by the State Council and that the association had confused the public and damaged the company's reputation.
A member of staff at the Beijing office of the Maternal and Child Industry Committee of China Commercial Economy Society told Reuters that the Feb. 6 notice that had been widely circulated was misunderstood and meant to be an internal one. 
The notice had been deleted from the group's social media page, the member of staff said.

In a defamation suit filed last week, Smartmatic had alleged that Fox and other defendants invented a story that the election was stolen from Donald Trump and made Smartmatic ""the villain in their story"".
Fox said it moved to dismiss the Smartmatic lawsuit because it was ""meritless"" and it defended its reporting of the U.S. presidential election.
""If the First Amendment means anything, it means that Fox cannot be held liable for fairly reporting and commenting on competing allegations in a hotly contested and actively litigated election,"" it said in a statement.
Florida-based Smartmatic did not respond to a request for comment on the Fox motion.
In its suit, Smartmatic sought more than $2.7 billion in compensatory and punitive damages. It also asks for defendants to retract false statements.
Fox said that it cannot be held liable for covering all sides of a ""vigorous debate of profound national importance"".
""When a sitting president and his surrogates claim that an election was rigged, the public has a right to know what they are claiming, full stop,"" it said.
Smartmatic's suit named as defendants Trump's lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, his former lawyer Sidney Powell, Fox Corp and Fox hosts Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro.
After the election, Trump and some of his supporters spread false claims of election fraud, including that Smartmatic manipulated the results.
Smartmatic in December demanded Fox News retract allegations leveled by its employees and guests, but Fox did not comply and instead aired an interview on the three hosts' programs with an outside expert who said there was no evidence to support claims made against Smartmatic. 

(This story corrects to clarify that claims were against Smartmatic in last paragraph.)

LONDON (Reuters) - Remote working is now one of the top daily challenges facing traders and a development that will likely boost the use of technology and electronic trading in the months ahead, a survey by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) released on Tuesday showed.
According to the survey of 260 fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) traders conducted in December, almost a third cited the availability of liquidity -- how quickly and easy it is to buy and sell an asset in markets -- as their chief trading challenge.
That was followed by workflow efficiency and remote working, a new addition that highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on trading floors following widespread lockdowns that began almost a year ago.
According to the survey, 77% of respondents said they worked from home between March and June for an average of four days a week, with 21% reporting a change in the their execution style. Many cited increased electronic trading.
For 2021, 55% of respondents said they expected to work from home for an average of four days a week, with 18% saying their execution style could continue to change going forward -- again mostly through increased electronic trading.
""This is really interesting because it is something we anecdotally know,"" said Scott Wacker, head of FICC e-commerce sales at JPMorgan.
""So, if you think about that, if they are going to be working from home, then remote working capabilities, access to data, electronic trading are going to be more important and that's what we saw in the survey.""
Mobile trading applications were expected to have the most influence in shaping trading in the next 12 months, with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning taking over in the next three years.
Rate traders anticipated the biggest increase in electronic trading volumes over the next two years, followed by credit and commodities traders, the survey showed.
Asked about what percent of trading volume is/will be done electronically, rates traders put the number at 67% in 2022, 53% in 2021 and at around 50% currently.
The COVID-19 pandemic boosted electronic trading in bond markets last year, according to traders and investors.
Asked which theme will have the biggest impact on markets in 2021, 42% of those surveyed cited the global pandemic, followed by market and economy dislocation.
Banks were ranked first as the top liquidity source for traders for a second straight year, cited by 88% of those surveyed, with 32% listing non-banks and just under a third ranking listed exchanges.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp shares climbed above 10,000 yen apiece on Tuesday, hitting two-decade highs, a day after the group's Vision Fund unit reported record profits as portfolio company listings accelerate.
SoftBank's shares were up 3.3% at Y9,800 at 03:56 GMT having earlier shot past Y10,000, the biggest intraday jump in two months. On Monday SoftBank reported a bounce back in the value of its portfolio after startups like home-selling platform Opendoor went public.
With equity raising running at record levels, major assets from the first $100 billion Vision Fund portfolio expected to go public include ride-hailing firms Didi and Grab. [L1N2JT0HC]
The Japanese conglomerate is ""effectively owner of the most lucrative portfolio amidst an ongoing retail IPO frenzy,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note, referring to initial public offerings.
Most of the value of the first fund is locked up in a small number of large assets, which also include e-commerce firm Coupang and TikTok-owner Bytedance, in contrast to smaller bets by Vision Fund 2. 
Frothy markets have seen the value of many of SoftBank's assets, or ""golden eggs"" as Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son termed them on Monday, climb with the value of its assets standing at $221 billion at the end of December. 
That is $37 billion lower than three months earlier after the share price of Son's largest ""egg"",  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), tumbled following the regulatory halt of the IPO of its fintech affiliate Ant in November. 
""The explosion in market liquidity over the last 9-10 months has played a huge role and we believe SoftBank success correlates closely with how U.S. tech trades going forward,"" Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry wrote in a note.
Japan's benchmark share index was trading at a 30-year high on Tuesday after Wall Street closed at an all-time high overnight.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singaporean banks are likely to see strong revenue from wealth business bolstering their profits this year, with improving economic prospects also expected to cushion the impact on their interest margins hovering near record lows, analysts say.
Wealth management has emerged as a rare bright spot for the global banking sector, hit by the COVID-19-induced economic downturn and sharply lower lending rates, helping them book higher client advisory fees as well as robust trading income. 
Singapore has benefited in recent years from its status as a stable base to set up family offices and investment structures for the world's wealthy, providing a lucrative business for local banks including DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) and OCBC.
""Relative strength in wealth management should offset weakness in cards and loan-related fees for the past quarter,"" said Krishna Guha, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), referring to the Singaporean lenders. 
""We await guidance on wealth management assets under management growth for 2021 but positive market sentiment should augur well for transactional fee stream,"" he said.
DBS, Southeast Asia's biggest bank, and peers OCBC and UOB are expected to post lower net profits in the fourth quarter ending December versus a year ago. All three are also expected to see full-year profit declines in 2020 for the first time in three years, mainly due to higher bad loans provisioning. 
The banks' net interest margins (NIM) are expected to remain near record lows or dip slightly to between 1.5% to 1.54% in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data, as demand for loans from corporates remained sluggish due to the pandemic.
Double-digit growth in wealth management business over the past five years has enabled this segment to account for the biggest chunk of net fee and commission income for Singapore banks as of end-2019.
CIMB analysts Andrea Choong and Lim Siew Khee said in a report that while margin compression had slowed as banks reap the benefits of lower funding costs, clear guidance in methods to expand NIMs by targeting client segments with higher risk-returns could differentiate banks performances.
""As it stands, banks have been relying on wealth and treasury segments to offset net interest income reduction,"" CIMB said.
DBS is set to report net profit of S$1.02 billion ($764.7 million) on Wednesday for the fourth quarter, down 32% from a year ago, according to the average estimate of four analysts, Refinitiv data shows. 
Analysts will look for details on its strategy to turnaround distressed Indian lender Lakshmi Vilas Bank, which it took over in November.
OCBC's net profit is set to weaken 24% from a year ago while UOB's net profit is set to fall 29%, Refinitiv data shows.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's financial markets watchdog, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), is not currently investigating Hyundai Motor executives' sales of shares in the automaker, a regulatory official said on Tuesday.
The official made the statement after some retail investors expressed concerns in online stock forums over the possibility of insider trading by Hyundai executives who sold shares in recent weeks.
Reports of possible cooperation between Hyundai and tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on a self-driving electric vehicle that emerged early in January sent Hyundai stock sharply higher, adding billions of dollars to its market value.
The official said the regulator would need more facts to support speculation on retail investor forums before considering an investigation. The official declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media. 
Hyundai did not have comment on the matter when reached by Reuters.
The company said on Monday it is not now in talks with Apple on autonomous vehicles, just a month after it confirmed early-stage talks with the tech giant. Shares in Hyundai jumped 21% between the initial confirmation and Monday's announcement that the project was now off.
Since the initial report of Hyundai-Apple cooperation on Jan. 8, a total of 12 mid-ranking Hyundai Motor executives sold about 3,400 shares worth about 833 million won ($747,152), according to Reuters calculations based on the company's regulatory filings.
Analysts described the executives' share sales as standard practice.
""It's a routine procedure that company executives sell or buy their company stocks,"" said Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities. ""The amount Hyundai Motor executives have sold after the media report is not a lot of money, and executives often sell or buy company stocks to turn them into profit.""
Hyundai Motor shares rose 1.7% in morning trade, compared to a 0.7% gain in the broader market.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning after their U.S. counterparts wrapped up another record-setting day overnight.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.24% by 9:54 PM ET (2:54 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.53%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.54% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.29%.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.77% and the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.10%.
Early Asian trading followed another day of reflation trades globally, where markets bid up stocks, cryptocurrencies, oil and gold and U.S. Treasury yields saw almost 11-month highs.
Expectations that inflation will increase are growing as governments and central banks continue massive spending programs and implement ultra-easy monetary policies until economies recover from COVID-19.
“Reflation on the back of U.S. fiscal stimulus and positive vaccine news remains the major theme for markets,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) analysts said in a note.
Alongside U.S. shares, cryptocurrencies also saw surges. Bitcoin rose to a record high of $45,000, buoyed by a $1.5 billion investment from Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The electric vehicle company also expects to accept the cryptocurrency as a payment method for its cars “in the near future,” it said in its 2020 annual report.
Rival cryptocurrency ethereum also reached its own record level of $1,784.85 on Monday.
The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally, and data suggesting that the number of COVID-19 cases has peaked in countries such as the U.S., are boosting investors risk appetite. A  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). gauge of global risk aversion dropped to its lowest level since COVID-19 first impacted the market a year ago. Friday’s disappointing U.S. jobs report highlighted the economic risks as the pandemic continues, while also stressing the need for further stimulus measures.
“The vaccine roll-out programs certainly suggest that the reflation trade has legs, but central banks seem to want to ensure that expectations are kept in check,” Rabobank head of foreign exchange strategy Jane Foley told Bloomberg.
“This suggests a choppy ride,” she added.
Meanwhile, a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden in January continues its path towards Congressional approval. However, some investors, including former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers, have questioned the package’s price tag and raised risks such as faster inflation.
Investors also await comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who will speak at a webinar on Wednesday."
1028,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 09:41PM ET</span>",Tencent bolsters defenses for core businesses as ByteDance muscles into its turf,"By Pei Li and Brenda Goh
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd may be the world's largest gaming company and a Chinese internet powerhouse worth more than $900 billion, but it's also spooked. 
Rapidly growing ByteDance, the owner of TikTok and the similar Chinese short video platform Douyin, has made sizeable inroads into business areas Tencent holds dear - including ads, gaming, livestreaming, social media and office software.
That has forced Tencent over the past year to become less of absent parent and much more hands-on with some of the 800-plus companies it has invested in, sources at Tencent and its portfolio firms told Reuters.
It is now helping key firms revamp their business models to head off ByteDance while coaxing them to stop competing with each other, the sources said.
To buttress its core gaming division, the Shenzhen-based company has also stepped up acquisitions and the development of casual games.
""ByteDance is pressing hard so as a defensive strategy, Tencent has to go on the offensive and at the same time exert more influence on portfolio companies to form a line of defence,"" said a Tencent executive.
The executive, like other sources for this article, declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media on the matter.
NO LOVE LOST
In 2018, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming traded barbs with Tencent founder Pony Ma, accusing Tencent of blocking and copying Douyin, and the feud has since escalated into a volley of lawsuits.
That includes a suit from Douyin last week accusing Tencent of monopolistic behaviour. Tencent said the claims were false, accused Douyin of illegally gaining user information and vowed to file more suits against ByteDance.
Asked to comment on changes to its strategies and the feud, Tencent said in a statement to Reuters that ByteDance and related companies have hurt the interests of its partners and rights of its users.
""We are committed and will take legal action to protect our healthy ecosystem,"" it said.
ByteDance argues WeChat users should have control of their data and the data isn't owned by Tencent. It said in a statement it was seeking to protect its rights and those of its users and that ""competition is better for consumers and promotes innovation"".
Established only in 2012, Beijing-based ByteDance has become a prolific 'app factory' valued at some $180 billion. It is now 22-year-old Tencent's biggest threat, eclipsing long-time rivals  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent sources said.
In 2019, ByteDance became China's second largest digital ad player behind Alibaba, leapfrogging Tencent and Baidu in the process. Its share of Chinese app users' screen time has also grown, to 15% as of end-September from 12% a year earlier, while Tencent's share fell to 41% from 45%, according to analytics firm QuestMobile.
The potential for ByteDance to use Douyin and other apps to direct traffic to new business lines, similar to how Tencent leveraged its WeChat and QQ social media products, has pushed Tencent to formulate new strategies, the sources added.
MAKING IT HARD FOR BYTEDANCE
Best known for more sophisticated money-making titles like ""Honor of Kings"", Tencent is also now churning out simple casual games typically played on mobile phones - a segment it was once dismissive of as not very profitable, sources said.
The reason? ByteDance's growing library of such games, currently over 150, that include notable hits like ""My Kungfu is Special"" and ""Rooster Defense"".
Tencent has boosted its line-up with an investment last year in France's Voodoo, which already had a presence in China. Tencent then acquired Chinese firm Leyou, known for the action game ""Warframe"", but which also has many simple casual games.
""Obviously these games don't bring Tencent much revenue. The sole purpose is to just make it hard for ByteDance to succeed,"" said a ByteDance gaming executive.
Tencent invested in 30 gaming firms last year compared to its usual practice of about 10 per year - a strategy aimed at preventing ByteDance, which has been working on more sophisticated games, from gaining a greater foothold in the industry, sources said.
Tencent is also responsible for game-streaming firm Huya (NYSE:HUYA) Inc's plans to acquire  DouYu International Holdings  (NASDAQ:DOYU) - putting an end to a destructive rivalry that saw regular poaching of each other's celebrities, sources familiar with the matter said.
It took action after Douyin and another rival Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) began gaining traction in games livestreaming services, they added.
In other business areas, ByteDance's development of a search engine was a factor behind Tencent's plans to buy out the rest of search engine Sogou (NYSE:SOGO) for $3.5 billion and take it private, one of the sources said.
For majority-owned China Literature, Tencent sent one of its senior executives to lead the online reading platform and made most of its content free - moves analysts have said were made in response to the success of a rival offering launched by ByteDance.
Attempts by Tencent to ward off ByteDance's encroachment of its territory could, however, become complicated by a recent antitrust review by Chinese regulators of internet firms.
The gaming market remains fragmented and Tencent is less vulnerable to regulatory action there, but the overwhelming dominance of WeChat as a social media forum in China - the basis for ByteDance's latest suit - is hard to deny, lawyers say.
Regulatory approval of the Huya-DouYu deal might come with the condition that other platforms be allowed to livestream Tencent-owned games, said You Yunting, a lawyer with Shanghai-based The Bund Law Office.

Sources with direct knowledge of the matter have also said Tencent's Sogou deal will face a thorough review and there is a good chance it may not close as planned.

(Reuters) - Bitcoin took another large stride toward mainstream acceptance on Monday after billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc revealed it had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars, sending the cryptocurrency shooting higher. 
The announcements, buried deep in Tesla's 2020 annual report, drove a roughly 20% surge in the world's most widely held cryptocurrency to over $47,000. At current prices, 0.8 bitcoins would be enough to buy an entry-level Tesla Model 3. 
Investors anticipated other companies will soon join a list of firms that invest in or hold bitcoin including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, and payments companies Square and PayPal. 
Musk has upended Wall Street over the last year and briefly became the world's richest person as shares of Tesla surged nearly 500% to become the fifth most-valuable U.S. company, leaving other companies and investors eager to follow in his wake. 
""If any lesser mortals had made the decision to put part of their balance sheet in Bitcoin, I don't think it would have been taken seriously,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York. ""But when the richest man in the world does it, everyone has to take a second look."" 
The news sparked heavy trading in cryptocurrencies and caused exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, Binance to experience technical issues, according to Coindesk https://www.coindesk.com/top-crypto-exchanges-technical-difficulties-tesla-bitcoin-trading-frenzy.
It also generated discussion on Reddit. While discussions of cryptocurrencies are banned on the WallStreetBets community that fueled the  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) trading frenzy, users in other subreddits posted ""to the moon,"" expecting more companies to follow suit after Tesla. 
A well-known supporter of cryptocurrencies, Musk has weighed in regularly on the past month's frenzy in retail investment, also driving up prices of the meme-based digital currency dogecoin and shares of U.S. video game chain GameStop.
Experts said they would not be surprised by a closer look from regulators given Musk's bumpy past with watchdogs.
The Securities and Exchange Commission sparred with Musk and Tesla several times over his use of Twitter to discuss the company, ultimately resulting in his exit as company chairman and a pair of $20 million fines for Musk and Tesla.
""We're talking about a billionaire with one of the most valuable companies in the history of the world who has seemingly gotten away with poking the SEC before,"" said Tyler Gellasch, head of the Washington-based Healthy Markets Association and former SEC official. Still, Gellasch said that ""examination doesn't mean this is likely to be an enforcement case.""
Tesla said in a filing the decision to move nearly 8% of its reserves into bitcoin was part of its broad investment policy as a company aimed at diversifying and maximizing its returns on cash, including holding gold. The report said it ended 2020 with $19.38 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
""We expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt,"" the company said. 
Tesla said it had invested an aggregate $1.5 billion in bitcoin under the changed policy and could ""acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term"". (https:// Shares of the company rose 1.3% Monday. 
Gold jumped more than 1% Monday while ethereum, another cryptocurrency, surged to a record high. 
LONG-TERM STORE OF VALUE?
Central banks remain skeptical of digital currencies, but analysts say the more real world uses appear for bitcoin, the more attractive it will prove as a long-term store of value.
Bitcoin has rallied as far as $47,565 after Tesla's disclosure. The cryptocurrency is up 1135% since March 2020, thanks in part to interest from institutional investors.
""The argument for bitcoin is evolving. It used to be negative (reasons to buy), but suddenly there are positive reasons, and that's why you see bitcoin at (new highs),"" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor of Allianz (DE:ALVG), told CNBC. 
Tesla is the latest company to add bitcoin to its corporate treasury, following similar moves by Square, the payments company led by  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) chief Jack Dorsey and U.S. software firm MicroStrategy Inc.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be the next big company to enter the cryptocurrency market, both by allowing bitcoin to be exchanged on its Apple Wallet service and investing some of its own reserves in units of the cryptocurrency, said Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
""If this becomes a trend in corporate treasuries the downside of staying on the sidelines will only become costlier over time,"" said Maya Zehavi, a blockchain consultant.
(GRAPHIC-Bitcoin hits record high on Tesla investment: https://graphics.reuters.com/CRYPTO-CURRENCY/TESLA%20CRYPTO-CENRRENCY/bdwpkngldvm/Bitcoin.png)
Tesla's move to put some of its corporate reserves in bitcoin may be a signal that it expects the cryptocurrency will emerge as another store of long-term value alongside the dollar and gold, said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Tanaka, president and chief investment officer of Tanaka Capital Management in New York. 

""Companies are very careful when it comes down to their reserves,"" he said. ""This doesn't appear to be a flash in the pan. It appears to be something that may be a fundamental change.""

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Veteran investor Foley plans to raise $1.5 billion through two SPACs - source,"By David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Veteran investor Bill Foley plans to raise two new blank-check acquisition vehicles which will be named after a Napoleonic battle and seek around $1.5 billion in total from their initial public offerings (IPOs), a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Public filings related to Austerlitz Acquisition Corp I and Austerlitz Acquisition Corp II - both so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) - could be published as soon as this week, the source said. 
The first Austerlitz vehicle will aim to raise around $500 million from investors, with the second entity targeting around $1 billion, the source added.
The source spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is private. A representative for Foley declined to comment.
Foley has been one of the most prominent dealmakers in the recent Wall Street frenzy around SPACs. His most recent two, Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp and Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II, in recent months have agreed mergers with U.S. benefits services provider Alight Solutions and payments processor Paysafe Group Holdings Ltd, respectively.
SPACs raise funds in an IPO to acquire a private company, which then becomes public as a result of the merger. 
They have become increasingly popular, with prominent investors, former sports stars and politicians among those who have launched such vehicles.
As well as investments in a number of financial companies, including insurer  Fidelity National Financial  (NYSE:FNF) and mortgage data firm Black Knight (NYSE:BKI) Inc, Foley is the owner of the Las Vegas Golden Knights ice hockey team.
The Battle of Austerlitz, also known as the Battle of the Three Emperors, was regarded as one of Napoleon's greatest military triumphs, where French forces defeated larger armies belonging to Russia and Austria in December 1805.

The reference to historical battles follows on from Foley's last two SPACs, which were named after a conflict at Lake Trasimene involving the Carthaginians and the Romans in the second-century BC.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",Boeing says requiring COVID-19 tests before U.S. domestic flights could pose economic risks,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior Boeing (NYSE:BA) executives have warned the White House that requiring COVID-19 tests before traveling on U.S. domestic passenger airline flights could pose significant economic harm.
""Imposing such a burden on the already financially beleaguered airline industry has the potential for severe unintended consequences that will ripple across the entire economy,"" Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Stan Deal and Chief Aerospace Safety Officer Michael Delaney wrote in a letter. The letter, seen by Reuters, was sent Friday and had not previously been reported.
Boeing and the White House declined to comment on the letter.
The federal government has been mulling additional measures to fight the spread of the coronavirus but has made no decisions on adding new requirements on domestic air travel.
A senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official (CDC) said on Jan. 26 that officials were ""actively looking"" at mandatory testing - days after new mandatory testing requirements for most international passengers took effect.
CDC officials have repeatedly urged Americans not to travel unless necessary.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Monday that additional screening at places where people gather like airports could help detect more asymptomatic cases. ""If we are traveling this would be yet another mitigation measure to try and decrease the spread,"" she said.
Officials told Reuters there is no specific proposal currently being vetted by the administration and a new meeting with airlines could take place late this week.
The Boeing letter questioned the air travel emphasis if the CDC's focus is the ""corridor"" around travel rather than aircraft. 
""If this broader travel journey is, in fact, the main concern of the CDC, then science would dictate all aspects of travel should receive similar scrutiny including hotels, car rental agencies, mass transit, and restaurants,"" the letter said.
Amtrak Chief Executive Bill Flynn told reporters Friday he was unsure how requiring testing before train trips ""would actually work and how it could actually be enforced."" 
The Boeing letter raised concerns about testing costs and availability, noting costs could easy top average base airfare.
""If a testing mandate is prescribed by the administration, funding should also be provided to comply,"" Boeing said.
On Thursday, a top aviation union leader warned mandatory domestic COVID-19 testing requirements could devastate the airline industry and potentially lead to bankruptcies.
Representative Peter DeFazio, the chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, raised concerns about domestic testing requirements in a meeting with President Joe Biden Friday, a spokeswoman for DeFazio confirmed.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told Reuters last week decisions about domestic testing will be ""guided by facts and by science.""

He added: ""Safety is our bottom line because we think that’s not only the right answer for passengers and workers but ultimately it’s the right economic answer too — so that there’s full confidence among the traveling public.""

Sales of some brick-and-mortar retailers have risen from the pandemic troughs plumbed last year thanks to the launch of online shopping options and government stimulus checks to support household income.
That has helped retailers meet their rental obligations, with Simon saying it had collected 90% of combined the second, third and fourth-quarter net billed rents as of Feb. 5. It had garnered only 85% of third-quarter net billed rents as of Nov. 6. 
Simon forecast 2021 earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.85, compared with $3.59 per share in 2020.
However, the company wrote-off, abated or deferred about $850 million, or nearly 18%, of its contractual rents due from the second through fourth quarters of 2020 as some tenants held back on payments. 
""We still, even to this day, have a handful of large tenants unfortunately, that have yet to resolve their receivables,"" Chief Executive Officer David Simon said on a call with analysts.
""Are we completely out of the woods? Not yet, but we're well on our way."" 
Lease income slumped nearly 24% to $1.03 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, missing analysts' estimates of $1.08 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

(Reuters) - KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc said on Monday its after-tax distributable earnings rose 15% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in management and transaction fees from its capital markets business.
KKR's after-tax distributable earnings (DE) – the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders – rose to $431 million from $375.1 million a year earlier. This translated to DE per share of 49 cents, surpassing the average analyst estimate of 41 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com -- Stocks roared ahead to another record high, with broad buying in value sectors such as energy and financials as investors cheered the prospects of stimulus and a recovery.
All three major indexes hit highs, led by energy on a bet the vaccine rollout will fuel a resurgence in business activity, and thus, a pick up in energy demand.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) made a big splash on Monday by disclosing a $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin.
Democrats in Congress appear ready to move on President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan, even without bi-partisan agreement. A deal could get done in the next few weeks, and checks could go out to qualified households soon after that.
The Senate will also be busy with the second trial of former President Donald Trump, which starts on Tuesday.
This is another week of earnings as the season winds its way to an end, including reports from Twitter and Cisco. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Big tech earnings
We get reports from Twitter and Cisco after the closing bell.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) is expected to report earnings per share of 29 cents on revenue $1.18 billion. Analysts might also be listening for any comments on how removing Trump from the platform affected user numbers.
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) is expected to report EPS of 75 cents on revenue of $11.9 billion.
2. Bitcoin soars to record
Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) is at $43,215 after Tesla revealed a $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency and added it would allow people to buy its cars using bitcoin at some point in the near future.
Whether bitcoin can continue its big gains of the last few months may depend on the progress of the recovery. Some of the trade in the alternative space has been in place of other traditional stores of value like Gold Futures, which has languished around $1,800 after hitting a high above $2000 last August.
3. Impeachment trial -- distraction from Covid relief?
The Senate begins the second trial of the twice-impeached now former President Trump on Tuesday. His lawyers are arguing that he did not call on people to commit violence and that the case should be dismissed. 
The House has charged Trump with inciting the riot at Capitol Hill last month, which resulted in five deaths. The trial comes as lawmakers are trying to get through a Covid-19 relief package, and could prove a distraction to that effort depending on how long it plays out.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street reached all-time closing highs on Monday as investor optimism was stoked by prospects of a speedier economic recovery from the global health crisis, driven by increased stimulus and an accelerated vaccine rollout. 
All three major U.S. stock indexes gained ground, with the S&P 500 and the Dow posting their sixth consecutive gains, their longest winning streak since August. Small-caps, set to benefit most from the economic rebound, outperformed their larger peers.
""Investors are starting to play the economy opening up and the vaccine starting to work,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""And maybe they can go to a baseball game this summer.""
Still, the extended rally provides some cause for concern.
""Stocks have been over-valued for much of the past year,"" Nolte added. ""And the things we're seeing now, with GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Bitcoin, those are signs of speculation, not investing.""
Oil prices rose to their highest in over a year due to supply cuts and hopes for a stimulus-driven demand rebound, helping energy stocks jump 4.2%. [O/R]
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said if Congress approves the president's $1.9 trillion fiscal aid package, the United States could return to full employment next year.
That package came closer to passage on Friday when lawmakers approved a budget outline that would enable Democrats to muscle it through Congress without Republican support.
Vaccine deployment, meanwhile, pushes ahead in United States, with at least 32,780,860 doses administered so far, and new infections trending lower, on average.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 237.52 points, or 0.76%, to 31,385.76, the S&P 500 gained 28.76 points, or 0.74%, to 3,915.59 and the Nasdaq Composite added 131.35 points, or 0.95%, to 13,987.64.
Ten of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in positive territory, with energy stocks enjoying the largest percentage gain. Utilities were the sole losers.
The fourth-quarter reporting season has passed the halfway mark, with 294 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 83% have beaten consensus estimates, according to Refinitiv.
Analysts see aggregate fourth-quarter S&P earnings posting a year-on-year gain of 2.4%, a stark reversal from the 10.3% annual decline seen at the beginning of the year, per Refinitiv.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) were up between 1.8% and 4.9% ahead of their earnings reports this week.
Bitcoin touched a record high after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc announced it had invested around $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency and would begin accepting payment in Bitcoin for its cars and other products.
""This is really, I view it, as almost a seminal moment ... in terms of Bitcoin from a transaction perspective,"" said Daniel Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities in Westfield, New Jersey. ""I think this is really an eyebrow-raising move.""
Tesla shares gained 1.3%, while cryptocurrency miners Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Marathon Patent Group surged 40.2% and 42.4%, respectively.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.56-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 461 new highs and 6 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 15.32 billion shares, compared with the 15.51 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1037,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 04:16PM ET</span>",What recovery? Clothes retailers cut orders while factories fight to survive,"By Victoria Waldersee and Ruma Paul
LISBON/DHAKA (Reuters) - Clothes retailers in Europe and America sit on excess inventory and cut back on spring orders. Sourcing agents face late payments. Garment factories in Bangladesh are on the rack. 
The global apparel industry, reeling from a punishing 2020, is seeing its hopes of recovery punctured by a new wave of COVID-19 lockdowns and patchy national vaccine rollouts. 
Some major retailers are still nursing last year's clothes, which would have been sold off in clearance sales in normal times. British chain Primark, for example, told Reuters it was housing around 150 million pounds ($205 million) worth of 2020 spring/summer stock and 200 million pounds from autumn/winter.
In an indication of the scale of the backlog, consultancy McKinsey says the value of unsold clothing worldwide, in stores and warehouses, ranges from 140-160 billion euros ($168-192 billion) - more than double normal levels.
Britain's Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) and Germany's Hugo Boss  said they had placed smaller orders than usual for this year's spring collection.
Retailers are keeping volumes small and lead times tight, according to Ron Frasch, former president at Saks Fifth Avenue who is now operating partner at private equity firm Castanea Partners, which works with a number of apparel brands. 
""Most of the brands now are pretty tight on shipping and the factors are very tight. I think everyone was very conservative with their purchasing,"" he said. ""I know many have been slow paying. That is for sure.""
Indeed, Hong Kong-based sourcing agent Li & Fung, which manages more than 10,000 factories in 50 countries for retailers including global players, told Reuters that some retailers had requested later payment terms, but declined to provide specifics.  
FACTORIES FEEL THE PAIN
The pain is consequently flowing to  major garment manufacturing centres like Bangladesh, whose economies rely on textile exports. Factories are struggling to stay open.
Fifty factories surveyed by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters  Association said they had received 30% fewer orders than usual this season, as pre-Christmas lockdowns in much of Europe followed by another clampdown in January hit their businesses hard.
""Orders usually arrive three months in advance. But there are no orders for March,"" said Dhaka-based factory owner Shahidullah Azim, whose clients include North American and European retailers. 
""We are operating at 25% of capacity. I have some orders to run the factory till February. After that, I don't know what future holds for us. It's difficult to say how we will survive.""  
Miran Ali, who represents the Star Network, an alliance of manufacturers in six Asian countries, and himself owns four factories in Bangladesh, faces similar problems.
""At this point in time, I should have been entirely full until March at least, and looking at a healthy quantity for autumn/winter coming in already. Across the board, that is coming slow,"" he told Reuters from the capital Dhaka.
""Brands are buying less from fewer people."" 
Asif Ashraf, another factory owner in Dhaka who makes clothes for global retailers, said it was tough to adjust. ""We've produced the fabric and we're ready to stitch the garments, but then they say the order is on hold.""
'PUBLIC WEARING PJs AGAIN'
With store closures threatening to carry into summer, some retailers are attempting to sell off as much of their excess stock as possible before placing new orders, textile recycling firm Parker Lane Group told Reuters. 
CEO Raffy Kassardjian said his business went from processing an average of 1.5 million items of excess apparel per month to over 4 million in January, its busiest month ever. 
Last year was dire for the clothing industry, which saw sales slide by about 17% versus 2019, according to Euromonitor. And the future is uncertain.
Estimates for 2021 range from pessimistic forecasts of a 15% sales drop from McKinsey, to an 11% recovery from Euromonitor.
So are there bright spots? Well, a lockdown pyjama boom is offering some minor relief. 
""If you want to know what the Great British public is doing - it's wearing pyjamas again,"" Marks & Spencer CEO Steve Rowe said last month, while Hugo Boss alluded to the same phenomenon, saying it had ""streamlined our range of classic business clothing and expanded the range of casual wear"".
But that's cold comfort for some factory owners.
""Demand for pyjamas is at a life-time high,"" Ali in Dhaka acknowledged. ""But not everyone can make pyjamas!""

Investing.com – The S&P ended above an unprecedented milestone to hit another all-time high Monday as both cyclicals and growth played a role in record-setting day for three major averages amid an improving Covid-19 backdrop and growing expectations for another round of fiscal stimulus. 
The S&P 500 was up 0.74% to 3,915.60, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.76%, or 237 points, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.95%. All three major averages closed at all time highs. 
Energy led the gains in the broader market, underpinned by a more than one-year high on bets a pick up in the pace of vaccinations will lead to a strong reopening and boost energy demand.
 Marathon Oil  Corporation (NYSE:MRO), Apache Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) were up sharply, with the latter up about nearly 9%.
The energy sector was also supported by a rise in oil major  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) on an upgrade from BNP Paris to neutral from underperforming, citing the company's planned reduction on fossil fuel spending.
 Disney  (NYSE:DIS), up 5%, was one the biggest contributors to the move higher in the Dow Jones as investors bet that a faster pace of vaccinations will lead to quicker reopening of the company's theme parks. The rally in Disney comes just days ahead of its quarterly earnings report later this week.     
Financials were also among the biggest sector gainers.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) added more than 1%, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) was up 2%. 
The move higher in cyclicals was also supported by falling Covid-19 cases and growing optimism that fiscal stimulus will be rolled out sooner rather than later.
The labor market is in a ""deep hole,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, citing the 779,000 unemployment claims filed last week. ""We need a big package and we need to get this done quickly,"" she added in an interview with CNN.
In the U.S., the number of cases has slowed from 235,000 to 87,000 with now more than 42 million vaccine doses administered. Despite progress, however, President Biden warned the U.S. probably won't reach herd immunity before the fall,” Stifel said in a note.

Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) fell 4% despite reporting fourth-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.
Hershey (NYSE:HSY) climbed 2% as a pandemic-led bump in sales helped the company deliver an earnings beat in the fourth quarter.
In tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) cut losses to end just above the flatline shrugging off media reports on Friday suggesting the tech company had paused its talks with Hyundai and Kia over plans to develop an electric vehicle.
Still, analysts on Wall Street say that it is matter of when not if the tech giant will make a foray into the electric vehicle industry.

Development and deployment of synthetic and biofuel alternatives to kerosene are seen as key to longer-term efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions from aviation.
The KLM aircraft used regular fuel mixed with 500 litres (132 gallons) of synthetic kerosene produced by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) with carbon dioxide, water and renewable energy sources, along with regular fuel to power the aircraft, a statement said.
""Making the aviation industry more sustainable is a challenge facing us all,"" Dutch Infrastructure Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen said. ""Today, with this world first, we are stepping into a new chapter of our aviation.""
Sustainable fuel will potentially make the biggest contribution to emissions reductions in new airline fleets, Pieter Elbers, who heads KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY), said.

""The transition away from fossil fuel to durable alternatives is one of the biggest challenges facing the industry,"" Elbers said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, but the generic supportive factors of stimulus packages and falling Covid-19 cases were put in the shade by the news that Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) had converted $1.5 billion of its cash reserves into Bitcoin.
 The move exposes the electric car maker to the fluctuations of an asset whose price is highly volatile and whose utility is still to be proven. However, it also gives the army of enthusiastic retail traders who have supported Tesla's stock thus far another argument to push it even higher in the short term. Bitcoin prices surged some 13.5% to over $43,400 on the news, a new record high, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock opened 2.2% higher.  Shares in MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), a company that has turned itself effectively into a holding company for Bitcoin, rose 17.8%. 
The news of Tesla's move on Bitcoin came on the same day that the electric carmaker was summoned to a meeting with Chinese regulators, who reportedly raised issues of battery fires and unexpected acceleration with the company.  Tesla was hit with one of its biggest ever safety recalls last week in the U.S. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 178 points, or 0.6%, at 31,326 points, a new all-time high. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.6%
The broader market was supported by comments at the weekend from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said in an interview that it may be possible to get the U.S. back to full employment by the end of 2022. Those comments came after a disappointing official labor market report, which showed that nonfarm employment rose by only 49,000 last month. 
Elsewhere, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock rose 12.4% after it announced a new partnership with  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) on open artificial intelligence applications for business customers.
GameStop and AMC Entertainment. two stocks whose volatility last week attracted the interest of federal regulators among many others, both fell heavily as the momentum behind two extraordinary short squeezes appeared to fade. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock fell 7.9%, while AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock fell 13.9%.
On a day when AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) was forced to admit the low efficacy of its vaccine against the new South African strain of Covid-19,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose 4.4% and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose 6.3%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese government officials have met representatives from U.S. electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc over reports from consumers about battery fires, unexpected acceleration and failures in over-the-air software updates, a regulator said on Monday.
China's State Administration for Market Regulation said in a social media post its officials, along with those from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Emergency Management, Cyberspace Administration and Ministry of Transportation, had met Tesla ""recently"", without giving a date.
The officials urged Tesla to operate according to China's laws and protect customer rights, the regulator said.
In response, Tesla said it would thoroughly investigate the problems reported by consumers and step up inspections.
""We will strictly abide by Chinese laws and regulations and always respect consumer rights,"" a company representative said in a text message, adding that Tesla accepted the guidance of the Chinese government departments.
Tesla is building Model 3 electric sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles at its Shanghai factory. It sold 15,484 China-made vehicles in January.
The industry ministry in May urged Tesla to ensure consistency in its China-made vehicles after some Chinese customers complained about less advanced computer chips in their cars.
China, the world's biggest auto market, is pushing the industry to make more electric vehicles as it tries to reduce air pollution. 

Sales of electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles in China are forecast to rise to 20% of all new car sales by 2025 from just 5% now, the State Council said last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Months before the irrational trading in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), there was Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ) Inc.
Operating under bankruptcy protection last spring once the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out its business, the car-rental giant confronted an extraordinary situation: Its stock price was skyrocketing for no apparent reason.
Conversations at the time among Hertz management and directors on its board, reported here for the first time, turned from shock to a vigorous debate about whether the company should capitalize on its unexpected good fortune and sell shares to fund itself during bankruptcy proceedings, according to three people familiar with the deliberations.
Raising money through a share sale would be less expensive for Hertz, which was bleeding cash as travel and car rentals plunged, than tapping a costly bankruptcy loan that most companies in its situation use to navigate court restructurings.
Directors keen on selling shares fended off concerns from some in Hertz’s C-suite and boardroom that such a move risked misleading investors who failed to appreciate that creditors are always paid first in bankruptcy, two of the sources said.
Shareholders, on the other hand, usually lose their shirts.
But Hertz abandoned its plan to sell up to $500 million in new shares after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started scrutinizing it. Hertz declined to comment.
Over the past few weeks, soaring stock prices of GameStop - along with movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc, home goods retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc and other companies - on the back of Reddit memes and YouTube videos have put company leaders in a similar situation.
The internal Hertz deliberations offer a window into the contours of the ethical and regulatory dilemmas they face. Namely, can they sell stock to raise capital in such a volatile market? 
Regulators are watching. The acting head of the SEC has said in recent days that the agency is looking closely at how companies are behaving, including whether they are trying to raise money and adequately disclosing risks associated with it to investors.
""Taking advantage of what could potentially be a manipulated market would trigger both reputational and legal concerns,” said Donald Langevoort, a Georgetown University Law Center professor and former SEC attorney.
The SEC declined to comment.
DIFFERENT APPROACHES
As a social-media-fueled retail trading frenzy has whipsawed a series of ""stonks"" - a Reddit meme for stocks - over the past few weeks, the companies in the eye of the storm have largely kept quiet. But three sources familiar with some of these companies said discussions about surging shares are taking place in their C-suites and boardrooms as well.
Unlike Hertz, these companies are not under bankruptcy protection. So far, they are taking different approaches.
GameStop, whose shares slumped as much as 84% in the first week of February after surging more than 25-fold the previous month, has paperwork lined up to sell $100 million worth of new equity but has not yet disclosed whether it has done so. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc pulled the trigger on a plan to sell more than $1 billion of stock after its shares recently rallied as much as 48%. 
GameStop and American declined to comment.
AMC, which previously warned it could file for bankruptcy after the pandemic temporarily closed its cinemas, has raised roughly $1.2 billion through debt and equity deals. It is now racing to file papers with regulators to sell shares possibly worth hundreds of millions of dollars more, two people familiar with the matter said.
""A company would be silly not to” consider selling additional shares, one source close to AMC said. ""Any company that is thinking seriously would want to talk it through and decide what strategies are available.”
AMC did not respond to a request for comment. In late January, Chief Executive Adam Aron said recent fundraising meant “any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table.”
BEFUDDLED BOARD 
That was the dilemma Hertz faced last spring. The company filed for bankruptcy last May, crumbling under roughly $19 billion of debt as the pandemic decimated its business. 
Roughly two weeks later, Hertz shares vaulted nearly 16 times to a high of $6.25, almost unheard of at the time for any company, let alone one under bankruptcy protection. Directors, executives and company advisers were befuddled, three sources familiar with the matter said. Calling around, there were no signs that a hedge fund or other large institutional investor was buying shares, one of the sources said. 
An adviser talked with an investor who suggested the trading app Robinhood was behind the unexpected rise, the source said. Indeed, Hertz was among the platform’s most popular stocks. “Hertz bankruptcy is CANCELLED by Robinhood ‘investors,’” a Reddit commenter called “itsnotshade” wrote at the time. “Good job guys.”
Some Hertz directors saw an opportunity to bolster its cash coffers with a stock sale. But some in the management, along with other directors, pushed back over concerns the shares were virtually worthless and any offering would take advantage of small-time investors unfamiliar with bankruptcy law, the sources familiar with the discussions at the time said. 
Directors favoring a share sale countered that, while rare, shareholders sometimes receive payouts in bankruptcy cases, one of the sources said. Shares of other companies under bankruptcy protection, such as J.C. Penney Co Inc and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) Corp, were also spiking at the time.
Eventually, the board decided to proceed with selling shares. On June 12, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath approved Hertz’s plan to sell new shares. In court filings, Hertz touted that it would not have to repay the money and that the move was better for its creditors. 
Hertz alerted the SEC and warned prospective buyers they would likely lose all their money. 
But the deal was done before it started. In a television interview, then-SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said the agency had informed Hertz it had “comments” on the stock offering, and that most companies do not go forward after hearing from the regulator until the issues are resolved. Reuters could not determine the content of the SEC's feedback on the offering. 

The next day, Hertz, not wanting to antagonize regulators, pulled the offering, two of the sources said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading higher Monday, building on last week’s record levels, as growing expectations of fiscal stimulus combined with accelerating vaccinations offer hope for future economic growth.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 120 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 47 points, or 0.4%. 
The three major indices on Wall Street recorded their best weeks since November last week, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite closing Friday at record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is less than 0.5% below its own closing record.
They have been helped by signs of progress in the country’s vaccination program, hope for a substantial stimulus plan as well as optimism over the country’s economic recovery, even after the January nonfarm payrolls report disappointed on Friday.
“Business surveys are offering encouragement and low hospitalization rates are allowing a partial re-opening in many states. With progress being made on vaccinations, much stronger jobs figures are likely from 2Q onwards,” said ING analyst James Knightley, in a research note.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen implied something similar on Sunday over the weekend when she predicted full U.S. employment next year if the proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package is passed.  Reaching full employment would leave the Fed free to concentrate on meeting its inflation target.
The prospects for a quick passage improved last week when both the House and Senate passed legislation that would allow the Democratic-controlled Congress to pass the Covid relief bill without Republican support.
Progress on the vaccine rollout has also helped the tone, after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had administered over 35 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of late last week. 
Another 78 companies in the S&P 500 are set to report quarterly results this week, during what has generally been a better than expected quarter. Upcoming U.S. reports in the week ahead include Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS).

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",Renesas boosts power and connectivity prowess with $6 billion Dialog deal,"By Tim Kelly and Douglas Busvine
TOKYO/BERLIN (Reuters) - Renesas Electronics Corp has agreed to buy Dialog Semiconductor for 4.9 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in cash, boosting its position in low-power technology and connectivity across smart devices, cars and industry.
One of the world's biggest auto chipmakers, Renesas aims to capitalise on technology shifts that are putting more electric vehicles on the streets with assisted driving technology while the rollout of 5G networks is connecting billions of devices to the so-called Internet of Things.
""The transaction we announced today represents our next important step in catapulting Renesas’s growth plan,” the Japanese company's president and CEO, Hidetoshi Shibata, said on Monday of the latest in a string of acquisitions.
Renesas offered 67.50 euros a share for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Dialog, representing a 20% premium to Friday's closing price and a 52% mark-up to a weighted three-month average.
The Frankfurt-listed shares in Anglo-German chip designer Dialog were up 16% at 65.28 euros in morning trade, just shy of the agreed sale price.
""Power management is the DNA of Dialog’s intellectual property,"" Mirabaud Securities analyst Neil Campling said after the deal was announced.
""As we move forward in a world increasingly focused on battery technology, EV vehicles and leveraging the ‘power sucking’ capabilities of 5G in the smart industrial future - power, power efficiency and power management are crucial.""
British-based Dialog had confirmed on Sunday that it had received an offer from Renesas after media reports of interest from the Japanese company and Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics.
Dialog CEO Jalal Bagherli said its board had recommended the Renesas offer after extensive discussions, adding that it is subject to the UK takeover code and would consider any counter-bid.
STMicroelectronics declined to comment.
WHEELS AND DEALS
Renesas and Dialog had agreed in August to cooperate in automotive computing platforms, shoprtly before a global shortage of semiconductors forced some carmakers to curb production.
The Japanese group, which has a 30% market share for microcontrollers used in cars, bought U.S. chip designer Integrated Device Technology Inc for $6.7 billion in 2018, the year after its $3.2 billion purchase of U.S. chipmaker Intersil. 
Renesas has filed to issue up to 270 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in new shares to fund its latest deal, which Shibata said would boost earnings immediately on closing. He forecast an immediate gross margin uplift of 0.6 percentage points and a rise of 0.4 percentage points in core earnings. 
Dialog specialises in power-management chips and low-energy Bluetooth products used in fitness trackers and cordless earphones.
It agreed in 2018 to transfer people and patents involved in designing the main power-management chip used in iPhones to Apple in a $600 million deal that left it a smaller and more broad-based business.
“We have successfully executed on a diversification strategy that positions Dialog for high growth,” said Dialog's Bagherli, praising its fit with Renesas's embedded computing, analogue and power portfolio. 
Shares in Renesas fell as much as 6.9% before closing 3.6% down, lagging a 2.1% gain in the broader market, on concerns that it would borrow too much to pay for the deal. CEO Shibata reassured analysts that its leverage ratio would peak at 3.5 times core earnings after the deal but return to a multiple of 1 over the next two years. 
Renesas was advised by Nomura and law firms Covington & Burling and Nagashima Ohno & Tsunematsu, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Qatalyst Partners and Linklaters worked with Dialog.

The stock was up 11% at 5:40 a.m. in New York premarket trading, after falling 80% last week, a drop that followed three weeks of dizzying gains.
GameStop has stabilized since Robinhood Markets Inc.’s move late last week to end buying limits it imposed in the wake of the stock’s January surge. Inflated levels of short interest that triggered a squeeze on the shares have declined after a number of hedge funds closed positions and incurred huge losses.
“Extremely elevated short interest is a pre-condition for a major short squeeze to occur,” Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in a note dated Feb. 5, saying that GameStop -- on which short interest had exceeded 100% of the float of the company -- has been a “highly unusual” situation.
Volumes in GameStop options remained high, with open interest in puts and calls rising further last week as the stock price tumbled. While calls open interest has climbed, volumes on the bearish put contracts have jumped to almost five times the amount.

1060,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 06:09AM ET</span>",StockBeat: German DAX Hits All-Time High as Brighter Outlook Lifts Cyclicals,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It’s been a bright start to the week in Europe, with Germany’s DAX index hitting a new all-time high amid signs of fresh buying of cyclical names as confidence in the arrival of an economic recovery grows.
The development is something of a paradox, as the authorities in Europe’s largest economy continue to act as if the pandemic is about to take a major turn for the worse: federal and state authorities are widely expected to extend the bulk of the country’s lockdown measures for at least another two weeks at a meeting on Thursday. 
The government’s conservative approach, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel with her customary risk-aversion, rests on two main pillars: the slow rollout of vaccinations and the awareness that at least two of the new strains of the Covid-19 virus appear be to more highly transmissible than the original  one. That has reinforced the government’s desire to ensure that infection rates are low enough for the country’s contact tracing system to withstand any relaxation of the guidelines.
But because of its high concentration of exporters, the DAX story is more about the expected global recovery than the German one, or even the European one (markets appear to have priced in the reality that the EU’s poorly executed vaccine procurement will delay the recovery by around three months).
Capital goods providers, in particular, have started to perform as the market anticipates an upturn in corporate investment thanks to expansive fiscal and monetary policy in Europe and the U.S. That’s as true for midcap names as for blue chips: the MDAX midcap index also hit a new record high on Monday morning, rising 0.4% to 32,472 points, with its medical and biotech names prominent among the gainers.
Much can be explained by valuations: analysts at JPMorgan point out that the DAX is trading at an implied 15.7 times expected 2021 earnings, a clear discount to the 23 multiple of the S&P 500.   
But it also helps that corporate-specific newsflow is also starting to turn positive. Of the two best performers in the DAX over the last week, Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) took another big step toward drawing a line under its disaster with Roundup, the weedkiller developed by its  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit, while Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) signalled it will split its passenger cars and truck divisions to help unlock value and sharpen the focus of each. 
Daimler stock has risen 14% in the last week, although it paused for breath on Monday on a touch of disappointment after Chief Executive Ola Kallenius said it would need until the end of the decade for its electric vehicles to be as profitable as its internal combustion models."
1061,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>","Shares reach record high, oil tops $60 a barrel","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares hit a record high on Monday and oil surpassed $60 a barrel for the first time in a year, on hopes that a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid package will be passed by U.S. lawmakers as soon as this month. 
Even news that South Africa had halted the rollout of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine after a study showed it gave only limited protection against the country's more contagious variant of the virus wasn't going to put equity markets off.
MSCI's 50-country index of world stocks hit its ninth record high of 2021 overnight as Tokyo's Nikkei jumped on talk of Japan relaxing emergency restrictions and as China's markets got busy before the start of the lunar new year. 
Europe then made a strong start as higher oil prices and inflation expectations lifted basic resource and banking shares, and France's Veolia launched a hostile 11.3 billion-euro takeover bid for waste and water rival Suez. 
""A generalised risk-on tone is pushing stocks higher,"" UniCredit's analysts said in a note. 
Bond markets were focused on how far inflation might rise if the current mix of stimulus, rising oil and food prices and expectations for a reopening economies continue to hold.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields, which are one of the main drivers of global borrowing costs, climbed to 1.2%, their highest since the peak of coronavirus uncertainty last March. Break-even rates, which are designed to account for inflation, traded as high as 2.21%, their highest since 2014.
In Europe, Germany's 10-year yields were up 3 basis points at -0.415%, near five-month highs. 
""It will be hard not to see inflation in something when we get what is likely to be a short-term stimulus boost,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Jim Reid said, referring to planned U.S. stimulus. 
""Whether that will be in goods, wages or asset prices or all three remains to be seen, but it seems inevitable there will be an impact.""
Brent crude touched an intraday high of $60.06 a barrel, the highest since January last year. 
Saudi Arabia's pledge of extra supply cuts in February and March on the back of reductions by other OPEC members its allies, including Russia, is helping to balance global markets and support prices. 
In a sign that supplies are tightening, the six-month Brent spread hit its highest in more than year, $2.45. OCBC's economist Howie Lee said the Saudis had sent another ""very bullish signal"" last week by keeping its Asian prices unchanged. 
""I don't think anybody dares to short the market when Saudi is like this,"" he said.
STIMULUS
Asia's overnight rally had seen Japan's Nikkei close up 2%, Chinese blue-chip shares advance 1.3% and Australian shares finish 0.6% higher. 
Wall Street futures were also pointing higher after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both climbed to record highs on Friday as weak monthly U.S. jobs data supported expectations of stimulus and after some strong corporate earning. 
U.S. President Joe Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress forged ahead with their stimulus plan on Friday as lawmakers approved a budget outline that will allow them to muscle through in the coming weeks without Republican support. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yallen predicted the United States would reach full employment next year if Congress can pass its support package.
""That's a big call, given full employment is 4.1%, but one that will sit well with the market at a time when the vaccination program is being rolled out efficiently in a number of countries,"" said Chris Weston, Melbourne-based chief strategist at Pepperstone. 
Expectations of a U.S. economic recovery have not boosted the dollar, though, ""because this shift in prospects is seen by the market as part of a global recovery,"" Westpac economists wrote in a note.
""Investors therefore favour risk taking, and so value the safety of the U.S. dollar less.""
Indeed, the dollar came off a four-month high against the Japanese yen to be last at 105.50. 
The euro was weaker at $1.2027 after rising 0.7% on Friday to a one-week high.

The risk-sensitive Australian dollar eased from a one-week high to $0.7675 while South Africa's rand fell nearly 0.5% after its vaccine troubles.

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday, led by economically sensitive cyclical sectors, as sentiment was lifted by hopes of a quicker recovery and multi-billion dollar deals in the region. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.4%, adding to gains of 3.5% in the previous session, with technology shares rising 0.9%.
Cyclical sectors including basic resources, banks and chemicals rose between 1% and 1.7%, and were among top gainers on the main index. 
Dialog Semiconductor surged 16.2% to the top of the STOXX 600 after Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics Corp agreed to buy the Frankfurt-listed chip designer for 4.9 billion euros ($5.89 billion) in cash.
""There are many other European shares which had fallen out of favour for international investors and this (the deal) indicates that global investors particularly American, Japanese or Chinese investors are looking to invest in such names,"" said Chris Bailey, European Strategist at Raymond James. 
France's Veolia Environnement (OTC:VEOEY) SA said it is launching an offer for all of waste and water management company Suez SA (OTC:SZSAY), valuing it 11.3 billion euros ($13.59 billion) after dropping efforts to win the backing of the Suez board.
The French firms fell about 1% each.
The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and increased M&A activity have helped reduce recent pessimism around European equities. 
""Growth investment opportunities are improving in Europe and so far the fourth quarter earnings season has shown that too,"" Bailey said. 
Frankfurt shares rose 0.3%, after hitting a record high moments after the open. Data showed German industrial output stagnated in December as lockdowns to contain the COVID-19 pandemic held back the export-oriented manufacturing sector in Europe's largest economy.

This comes after data last week showed that orders for German-made goods fell more than expected in December, ending a seven-month streak of positive data.

In a letter, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of legislators from countries including Britain, Australia, Japan and the United States, criticised the bank for its freezing of accounts belonging to activists associated with Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.
""HSBC has failed to give evidence of any court order or police warrant to carry out this action and have refused to publicly respond to concerns raised by Hui and his family,"" according to the letter.
The letter added it was ""highly concerning"" that Hui's family members' accounts have also been frozen, despite not having been subject to any charges.
An HSBC spokeswoman said the bank was ""unable to comment on individual cases, but the Hong Kong Police explained publicly in early December the reasons for instructing banks to freeze accounts related to Mr Hui and his family.""
The bank also said it had no choice but to comply with specific legal instruction by police authorities in Hong Kong to freeze the accounts of somebody under formal investigation.
Hui, a former Hong Kong lawmaker, said in December his local bank accounts appeared to have been frozen after he said he would seek exile in Britain to continue his pro-democratic activities.

British lawmaker Chris Bryant told the bank's Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn last month that HSBC was ""aiding and abetting one of the biggest crackdowns on democracy in the world"", during a hearing.

1066,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 04:09AM ET</span>",Treasury Long-Bond Yield Tops 2% Mark for First Time in a Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Yields on the longest-dated U.S. benchmark bond have topped 2% for the first time in close to a year, fueled by advancing talks on U.S. fiscal stimulus and rising expectations for inflation.
The selloff in Treasuries pushed the yield on the 30-year bond up by as much as three basis points to 2.00%, the highest since Feb. 2020. The level is psychologically important, in part because 2% is the pace of inflation that the Federal Reserve looks to maintain for consumer prices.
The move on Monday follows a series of comments from policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic at the weekend. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pushed for rapid stimulus, saying the U.S. can return to full employment in 2022 if it enacts a robust enough coronavirus investment package. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said policy makers must ensure monetary and fiscal support will be withdrawn gradually once the economy has recovered sufficiently from the virus.
“Comments from Yellen and Lagarde, along with the Senate adopting budget measures to fast-track the stimulus plan have set the tone for the market open, with risky assets and bond yields higher,” said Mohit Kumar, managing director at Jefferies International, who sees the U.S. 10-year yield heading past 1.20% soon.
The 30-year yield has been in a rising trend since touching a low of around 1.16% in August. Drivers include rising expectations for consumer-price gains, reflected in higher breakeven rates for inflation-linked debt, and an influx of long-end Treasury supply.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, as optimism grows about an economic recovery as vaccination campaigns continue to make progress.  
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4%, and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.3%.
Europe has been hit hard by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the region’s GDP falling by 0.7% in the final quarter of 2020 due to lockdowns and other measures. However, most of Europe, and most of the developed world, is now reporting a falling infection rate while they ramp up their vaccination programs, prompting hopes that a degree of normalcy may be just around the corner.
Additionally, hopes of more U.S. stimulus have risen after both the Senate and House passed a budget resolution on Friday, starting the process that would allow President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue package to be approved.
It’s not all good news though as drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said over the weekend that its vaccine appeared to offer only limited protection against mild disease caused by the South African variant of the virus. South Africa has suspended the rollout of Astra's vaccine, while the company and Oxford University have said they will work on developing a booster shot by the autumn.
Back in the European corporate sector, Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) stock soared 16%, to an all-time high, dragging the technology sector higher, after saying it had accepted a takeover bid from Renesas Electronics, valuing it at some 4.9 billion euros ($5.9 billion).
In France, Veolia (PA:VIE) stock fell 1.2% after a court suspended the conglomerate's hostile bid for water services rival Suez (PA:SEVI), also down 0.9%, while the government insisted that takeover talks must proceed on a friendly basis. 
Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) stock fell 2.1% after the engineering giant said it was considering a plan to shut some of its plants for two weeks in the summer in a bid to stem losses.
Experian (OTC:EXPGF) stock fell 1.9% after the credit reporting agency said it was investigating whether the personal data of millions of people in Brazil that was found to be illegally offered for sale online could be connected with its Brazilian business Serasa.
Oil prices firmed Friday on growing hopes increased stimulus will hasten an economic revival coupled with supply curbs by primarily Saudi Arabia, but also other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $57.54 a barrel, after hitting $57.67, the highest since January last year.
The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $60.12, after hitting a high of $60.26, also the highest level since January 2020.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 02:35AM ET</span>","Hyundai, Kia say Apple car deal now off, see $8.5 billion wiped off market value","By Heekyong Yang and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co said on Monday it is not now in talks with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on autonomous electric cars, just a month after it confirmed early-stage talks with the tech giant, sending the automaker's shares skidding.
Wiping $3 billion off its market value, Hyundai's stock slid 6.2%. Shares in its affiliate Kia Corp, which had been tipped in local media reports as the likely operational partner for Apple, tumbled 15% - a $5.5 billion hit.
The announcement brings the curtain down on weeks of internal divisions at Hyundai Motor Co Group - parent to both automakers - about the potential tieup, with some executives raising concerns about becoming a contract manufacturer for the U.S. tech giant in a tieup reminiscent of electronics firm Foxconn's role in making device for Apple like the iPhone.
""We are receiving requests for cooperation in joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies, but they are at early stage and nothing has been decided,"" the automakers said on Monday, in compliance with stock market rules requiring regular updates to investors regarding market rumours.
""We are not having talks with Apple on developing autonomous vehicles.""
Kia shares had jumped 61% since Hyundai initially confirmed a local media report early in January that Apple and Hyundai were in discussions to develop self-driving electric vehicles by 2027 and develop batteries at U.S. factories operated by either Hyundai or Kia.
""Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is at early stage, nothing has been decided,"" Hyundai said, before releasing subsequent statements that removed all mentions of Apple but said Hyundai was receiving electric car cooperation requests from parties it didn't identify.
As recently as last week, media outlets including CNBC reported that a deal was close to being finalised. One South Korean report said the two companies were set to sign the deal on Feb. 17.
'AGONISING'
Hyundai is traditionally known for its reluctance to work with outsiders, making engines, transmissions and even its own steel in-house in a vertically integrated supply chain as South Korea's second-largest conglomerate.
Although shares in Kia and Hyundai had surged on news of the talks, internal opposition to becoming an Apple contract manufacturer was considerable, according to people familiar with the matter.
""We are agonising over how to do it, whether it is good to do it or not,"" a Hyundai executive aware of internal discussions on the tie-up told Reuters in January. ""We are not a company which manufactures cars for others,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Apple and Hyundai first started talks over a car partnership in 2018, another person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. But progress was hampered by the South Korean automaker's reticence on working with outsiders, the person said.
Reuters reported in December that Apple was moving forward with autonomous car technology and aimed to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology as early as 2024.
Apple, known to keep product plans under tight wraps, has never acknowledged talks with the automaker about building vehicles, and wasn't immediately available for comment outside business hours in the United States.
Analysts said talks might have collapsed over leaks of the partnership plan to media, or over possible insistence by Apple that Hyundai's role in any tieup would be that of an equipment manufacturer, rather than a strategic partner. 
""With numerous news reports over discussions between the two companies, which should have been held to non-disclosure agreements, it would have been uncomfortable"" said Kwon Soon-woo, an analyst at SK Securities.

Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities, said, ""It seems clear that Hyundai Motor Group has not been too happy with dealing with Apple ... They made it clear that they do not want to be treated just as Apple's supplier or manufacturer.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen posting gains at the open Monday, as optimism grows about an economic recovery as vaccination campaigns continue to make progress.  
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6%, and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.5%. 
Europe has been hit hard by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the region’s GDP falling by 0.7% in the final quarter of 2020 due to lockdowns and other measures. However, most of Europe, and most of the developed world, is now reporting a falling infection rate while they ramp up their vaccination programs, prompting hopes that a degree of normalcy may be just around the corner.
""For the third week in a row, the number of new cases of Covid-19 reported globally fell last week,"" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference last week. ""There are still many countries with increasing numbers of cases, but at the global level, this is encouraging news.""
It’s not all good news though as drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said over the weekend that its vaccine appeared to offer only limited protection against mild disease caused by the South African variant of the virus. South Africa has suspended the rollout of Astra's vaccine, while the company and Oxford University have said they will work on developing a booster shot by the autumn.
Additionally, hopes of more U.S. stimulus have risen after both the Senate and House passed a budget resolution on Friday, starting the process that would allow President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue package to be approved.
Back in Europe, there are few major corporate earnings due Monday. On the data front, the latest German industrial production figures showed no growth in December, a hefty drop from growth of 0.9% the previous month. 
In France, a court suspended Veolia's hostile bid for water services rival Suez, while the government insisted that takeover talks must proceed on a friendly basis. U.K. ecommerce names such as ASOS (LON:ASOS) and  Boohoo  (LON:BOOH) may come under early pressure after weekend reports suggesting the government may overhaul the system of business rates to remove the tax advantage of online-only names.
U.K.-based Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS), meanwhile, said it had accepted a takeover bid from Renesas at 67.50 euros a share, valuing it at some 4.9 billion euros.
Oil prices firmed Friday on growing hopes increased stimulus will hasten an economic revival coupled with supply curbs by primarily Saudi Arabia, but also other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $57.39 a barrel, after hitting $57.56, the highest since January last year.
The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $59.86, after hitting a high of $60.05. The last time front-month Brent traded at $60 was Feb. 20, 2020.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,816.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2033.

Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a Wanda unit, converted its Class B common stock in AMC to Class A shares on Feb. 1 ""in order to permit sales of its common stock,"" AMC said in the filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb 5.
The filing did not give details on the amount of stock converted to Class A shares or say whether Wanda had sold any shares in AMC. Wanda did not immediately return a request for comment.
AMC shares touched $17.25 on Feb. 1, almost quadrupling from a week earlier, as social media platforms such as Reddit fuelled frenetic retail buying into heavily-shorted stocks such as AMC and GameStop (NYSE:GME). 
AMC shares plunged 41% the next day and the stock is now down about 60% from its Feb. 1 peak. 
The social media-fuelled trading frenzy has cooled over the past few days as U.S. financial regulators scrutinize GameStop's Reddit-driven stock surge.
Wanda, whose businesses range from real estate to entertainment, bought a majority stake in AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion, in what was then the largest overseas acquisition by a privately held Chinese company.
In 2018, the once-acquisitive Chinese conglomerate trimmed its exposure to the U.S. cinema operator amid tighter regulatory scrutiny by Beijing over Chinese companies' overseas expansion. 

Wanda still owns a controlling stake in AMC, according to the group's website. Wanda also owns Hollywood producer Legendary Entertainment and Australian cinema chain Hoyts Cinema, the website said.

France is one of Airbnb's top destinations but the online letting marketplace has faced criticism in Paris and other cities, including Amsterdam and New York, over concerns that its short-term rentals make housing shortages worse. 
Airbnb said it would take extra measures against people who let out properties in France for short-term stays without registering with authorities. 
Listings without a registration number in Paris, Lyon and Bordeaux would be blocked from taking reservations as of this year, Airbnb said, adding the plan would be rolled out to other cities too. 
Under existing rules in Paris, people are not allowed to rent out their entire homes on Airbnb for more than 120 days and are obliged to declare the rentals. 
The new measures follow an appeal from France's housing ministry for platforms such as Airbnb to work more closely with local authorities, including by sharing data and information. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the tourism and travel industries hard. Airbnb, which listed last December on the New York stock exchange, has suffered a blow to revenues as reservations dwindle. 

The group said it would take part in new campaigns in France to promote travel, including in ski resorts in the French Alps and the Haute Savoie region. The French government has extended ski lift closures because of the pandemic, dealing a blow to local business owners who depend heavily on the winter season.

Investing.com – South Korean's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and Kia Motors Corp. (KS:000270) saw their shares plunge, after saying that they are not in talks with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), in the latest round of a did-they-or-didn't-they game between the three companies.
Shares in Hyundai fell 5.01% to KRW237,000 ($211.91) by 11:59 PM ET (4:59 AM GMT) and Kia shares slumped 13.40% to KRW87,900 after both companies said earlier in the day in separate regulatory filings that “we are not having talks with Apple on developing autonomous vehicles.”
Both Korean companies saw their shares surge in early January, after Hyundai released a statement that said, “Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is at early stage, nothing has been decided."" A local media report first broke the news of the collaboration, with the report also saying that the companies were ere in discussions to develop self-driving electric vehicles by 2027 and develop batteries at U.S. factories operated by either Hyundai or Kia.
However, Hyundai released a statement later in the day that backtracked on the earlier one, which erased all mentions of Apple but added that the company was “getting requests for cooperation on joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies.” These “various companies” were not identified.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Monday morning, starting the week with on an optimistic note after U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen pushed for a U.S. stimulus package to be passed and COVID-19 trends showed improvements.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.15% by 10:06 PM ET (3:06 AM GMT), with the Topix index set for its highest close since 1991 over hopes that the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden in January will be passed by Congress.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.13%. In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.85% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.71%.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1% while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.84%.
Yellen said on Sunday that the U.S. could return to full employment in 2022 if the country enacts a robust enough relief package.
However, some investors expressed skepticism about Yellen’s statement.
“That’s a big call given full employment is 4.1%, but one that will sit well with the market at a time when the COVID-19 vaccination program is being rolled out efficiently in a number of countries,” Pepperstone chief strategist Chris Weston told Reuters.
Disappointing U.S. jobs data from Friday also continues to dent investor sentiment. The U.S. jobs report for January showed that fewer jobs were created in the economy than expected. Non-farm payrolls were at 49,000 and the unemployment rate was at 6.3%.
Further U.S. data, including the federal budget and the consumer price index, will be released later in the week.
Although the data highlighted the economic recovery’s fragility and the need for further stimulus measures, other investors warned that the introduction of these measures could boost inflation and overheat asset prices.
“It does seem to be the case that global markets have now become addicted to stimulus and that the greatest risk to the outlook, and potential trigger for a correction in risk-asset valuations, would be central banks dialing down the music,” First Abu Dhabi Bank Pjsc chief economist Simon Ballard told Bloomberg.
However, investor sentiment was boosted by a continuous global rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations.  Sinovac Biotech  Ltd (NASDAQ:SVA) received conditional approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration for its Coronovac offering over the weekend.
Also boosting sentiment was data suggesting that COVID-19 daily cases are declining in countries such as the U.S., France and Germany. There were also no new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases for the first time in nearly two months in China, according to data released on Monday.
On the central bank front, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver remarks during a webinar on Wednesday."

Anand Balakrishna Madduri is launching ApaH Capital Management with roughly $200 million in assets, including the capital from Blackstone, one of the people said.
Hong Kong-based ApaH will concentrate on public and private market investments across Asia, including in Australia, China, India and Japan.

Blackstone declined to comment. 
Madduri was a senior managing director at Lone Star Funds for five years and spent seven years at Och-Ziff Capital Management, where he rose to managing director.
Blackstone, which invests $79 billion in hedge funds, is making the investment with cash from its $1.5 billion Strategic Alliance Fund III which backs new entrants into the hedge fund industry.
Blackstone has seeded Palm Lane Capital, Tresidor Investment Management and Jones Road Capital Management among others from Fund III. 
Blackstone's seeders take a 15% to 25% cut of the hedge fund's business, people familiar with the terms said.

Securing seed investments from Blackstone often helps new managers establish credentials and get up and running, while it allows Blackstone to get in on the ground floor with promising newcomers.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2021 01:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon orders hundreds of trucks that run on natural gas,"By Laura Sanicola
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has ordered hundreds of trucks that run on compressed natural gas as it tests ways to shift its U.S. fleet away from heavier polluting trucks, the company told Reuters on Friday.
The coronavirus pandemic caused delivery activity to surge in 2020, with truck volumes exceeding 2019 levels on average while passenger car traffic fell. But that increase in road activity means more pollution, as heavier-duty trucks emit higher levels of greenhouse gases than passenger vehicles.
Transportation companies are building their stable of electric vehicles to reduce carbon emissions. Much of the nation's freight is delivered via medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which account for more than 20% of the industry's greenhouse gas emissions even though they make up less than 5% of the road fleet, according to U.S. federal data. 
""Amazon is excited about introducing new sustainable solutions for freight transportation and is working on testing a number of new vehicle types including electric, CNG and others,"" the company said in a statement. 
Amazon has ordered more than 700 compressed natural gas class 6 and class 8 trucks so far, according to the company.
The online retailer's sales rose 38% in 2020; it plans to run a carbon neutral business by 2040.
The engines, supplied by a joint venture between  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI) and Vancouver-based Westport Fuel Systems (NASDAQ:WPRT) Inc, are to be used for Amazon's heavy duty trucks that run from warehouses to distribution centers. More than 1,000 engines that can operate on both renewable and non-renewable natural gas have been ordered by the supplier, according to a source familiar with the situation.
Natural gas emits approximately 27% less carbon dioxide when burned compared with diesel fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Electric-powered motors are considered less viable for heavy-duty trucks than for the average passenger vehicle. 
In 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric vans from startup Rivian Automotive LLC. The first of those vans, to be used for last-mile delivery to customers, are to be delivered this year. The company also ordered 1,800 electric vans from Mercedes-Benz for its European delivery fleet. 
Other transportation companies are also experimenting with ways to reduce emissions. 
In 2019,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) announced plans to buy more than 6,000 natural gas-powered trucks over three years and step up purchases of renewable natural gas (RNG) as part of a $450 million investment to reduce the environmental impact of its 123,000-vehicle fleet.
RNG and natural gas from fossil fuel are both methane gases and can be used interchangeably. RNG is derived from decomposing organic matter such as cow manure on dairy farms, discarded food in landfills and human waste in water treatment plants. It also prevents naturally occurring methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - from being released into the environment.

Amazon shares were down 0.1% in post-close trading. Shares of Cummins rose 4%, while the U.S.-listed shares of Canada-based Westport surged, gaining 47% in the aftermarket session.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: GameStop frenzy reveals potential for broader market stress,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the trading frenzy in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares and other social media favorites recedes, investors are eyeing signs of potential market stress that could weigh on broader stock performance in coming weeks.
For now, U.S. equities appear to be looking past last week's surge in volatility that led the S&P 500 to its biggest weekly decline since October. Solid earnings, fiscal stimulus expectations and progress in country-wide vaccination efforts are leading stocks back to all-time highs.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted records for a second straight session on Friday.
Some investors, however, worry that the wild swings in GameStop and other ""meme stocks"" may have exacerbated concerns over market volatility and elevated valuations that could make market participants more risk-averse. The S&P 500 stands near its highest forward price-to-earnings ratio in about two decades after rallying 74% from its March lows.
""The recent retail activity was concerning for the broader market,"" said Benjamin Bowler, head of global equity derivatives research at BofA Global Research.
Liquidity in futures on the S&P 500 dried up as market makers and other investors sought to reduce risk during the GameStop surge, according to BofA analysts. Earlier this week ""market fragility,"" as measured by the bank, stood at its highest level since March 2020, making U.S. equities exceptionally vulnerable to sudden market shocks, the firm said. 
Moves in the Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" also indicate that investors may be more sensitive to market turbulence than usual. On Jan. 27 the index surged 14 points, its biggest one-day gain since March, as the S&P 500 lost 2.6%.
The fear gauge's climb was eight to 10 points greater than the expected move following such a drop in the S&P 500, according to Stuart Kaiser, strategist at UBS. The outsized reaction, he said, points to heightened jitters among investors that could suggest bigger market sell-offs in response to negative developments.
The VIX has since reverted to its lowest level since early December as U.S. equities have rallied this week. Even so, ""I wouldn't say we're completely past it yet,"" Kaiser said.
Next week, investors will focus on quarterly corporate results from Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co as well as data on U.S. consumer prices.
Options markets have not flashed the green light to go full speed ahead with resuming risk.
Investor demand for calls on the S&P 500, used to position for gains in the index, has jumped after plummeting to a multi-decade low earlier in the week, according to Charlie McElligott, managing director, cross-asset macro strategy at Nomura. The swing in demand points to risk of a pullback and choppy trade in the next few weeks, he said. Longer-term, several market analysts say the GameStop effect may be no more than a blip on the radar screen for markets as a whole. Drops in the VIX of 20% or more to below 25 tend to bode well for stocks, with the S&P 500 rising 2.6% a month later, according to Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.

Still, the exuberance that magnified the market's fault lines has not completely faded. According to data from Trade Alert, options activity shows heavy demand for upside calls in the SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF, which includes GameStop, and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), which was also rocked by retail trading. As a result, some investors say they plan to tread cautiously for the time being, especially if they are exposed to passive funds that hold a large number of small-cap stocks that could be sensitive to a sudden retail frenzy. ""Time will tell whether this has a more lasting effect on the market,"" said Matt Forester, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK)'s Lockwood Advisors. ""We need to police our holdings to make sure we're not overly exposed to these trends.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Fox Corp's Fox Business Network has canceled ""Lou Dobbs Tonight,"" a weekday program hosted by the business journalist and vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, the company said on Friday.
News of the cancellation came one day after Dobbs, 75, was named as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed by voting machine maker Smartmatic, which argued that three Fox hosts, including Dobbs, falsely accused the company of helping to rig the election against Trump.
Fox said the move to end Dobbs' show had been in the works before the lawsuit as part of a revamp following the November U.S. presidential election in which Republican Trump was defeated by Democrat Joe Biden.
""As we said in October, Fox News Media regularly considers programming changes and plans have been in place to launch new formats as appropriate post-election, including on Fox Business,"" a Fox News Media spokesperson said. ""This is part of those planned changes.""
On the Smartmatic lawsuit, Fox said on Thursday the network was ""proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend this meritless lawsuit in court.""
Dobbs, reached by text message on Friday, said he had no comment.
The cancellation of Dobbs' show was first reported by the Los Angeles Times, which said the anchor was unlikely to appear on Fox channels again even though he remains under contract. 
Trump issued a statement praising Dobbs on Friday evening. 
""Lou Dobbs is and was great,"" Trump said in an emailed statement. ""Nobody loves America more than Lou. He had a large and loyal following that will be watching closely for his next move, and that following includes me."" 
Dobbs' show ran at 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Eastern time on Fox Business Network, and he appeared at times as a commentator on Fox News Channel. 
Starting Monday, the 5 p.m. show will be called ""Fox Business Tonight,"" and be repeated at 7 p.m. 
In January, Fox announced that Larry Kudlow, a former top economic adviser to Trump, would be hosting a new weekday show on the Fox Business Network. 

It also launched a new opinion show at 7 p.m. on Fox News.

Key wealth management unit employees of UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, will see variable compensation flat or slightly up from the prior year, with significant variations depending on the region, Bloomberg said in the report, attributing those people.
Wealth managers in the Asia Pacific regions are expected to receive some of the higher rewards, with bonuses increasing by 10%, Bloomberg said. Some private bank employees in Europe will see their bonuses lessened between 10% and 15%. 
UBS declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.
Banks across the world have wrestled with the uneven impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as soaring stock markets boosted trading while national lockdowns had crippling economic consequences, leaving lenders braced for coming defaults.
UBS' business model paid off in 2020, as its low-risk lending book - comprised primarily of mortgages and loans to the wealthy, as well as some corporate and retail credits in prosperous Switzerland - meant fewer losses than many high street rivals.

Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hamers recently said a strong connection to clients helped the bank to bring in more than $100 billion in net new money across its wealth management and asset management business during the troubled past year.

Verizon said in September it would buy Tracfone, a unit of Mexican telecom company  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), in a cash and stock deal.
The state attorneys general said the FCC ""should examine whether the acquisition of TracFone by Verizon could significantly reduce millions of Americans’ access to affordable communications services.""
Th letter added, ""it is imperative that the FCC thoroughly vet the proposed transaction and impose specific conditions that protect and ensure the public interest before considering approval.""
The state AGs are led by Virginia's Mark Herring and also include those of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.
Tracfone is one of the largest providers of telecommunications services under the government subsidy program known as Lifeline with 1.7 million low-income subscribers in 43 states and the District of Columbia, the state AGs' letter said, while Verizon offers Lifeline in parts of four states.
A Verizon spokesman said on Friday the company ""will continue to offer Lifeline service through TracFone and further develop its core brands, products and distribution channels. Strengthening and growing TracFone will benefit value-conscious consumers.""
Tracfone, which serves about 21 million subscribers through more than 90,000 retail locations across the United States, said last year more than 13 million of its subscribers rely on Verizon’s network under an existing agreement. Verizon is the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers.

""We urge the FCC to put the interest of the American consumer before that of big business and request additional information before allowing this acquisition to happen,"" said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday dismissed nearly all of a lawsuit accusing upscale grocery chain Whole Foods Market of illegally punishing workers who wore Black Lives Matter face masks on the job.
Twenty-seven plaintiffs had accused Whole Foods in a proposed nationwide class action filed in Boston of selectively enforcing its dress code banning ""visible slogans, messages, logos or advertising"" unrelated to the company.
The plaintiffs said Whole Foods would send workers home without pay or impose disciplinary actions for wearing the masks and related apparel, even as it let employees wear masks bearing political messages and sports team logos.
U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, however, said Whole Foods and its parent, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), did not engage in racial discrimination or violate Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.
""At worst, they were selectively enforcing a dress code to suppress certain speech in the workplace,"" she wrote. ""However unappealing that might be, it is not conduct made unlawful by Title VII.""
Burroughs said one plaintiff can pursue a retaliation claim.
The plaintiffs' lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan expects her clients to appeal, saying in an email the decision ""goes against the tide of case law recognizing the critical importance of eradicating race discrimination from worksites across our country.""
Whole Foods has said its dress code was ""facially neutral"" and that it has ""zero tolerance"" for retaliation. It has also along with Amazon expressed support for Black Lives Matter.
""We remain dedicated to ensuring our team members feel safe and free from discrimination and retaliation,"" a spokesman said following Burroughs' decision.
The judge said employees who are not happy with the policy could try to persuade Whole Foods to change it, express themselves outside the workplace and perhaps encourage consumers to shop elsewhere, or find somewhere else to work.
A video showing the death last May 25 of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police sparked nationwide protests about racial injustice, including the treatment of Blacks in police custody.

The case is Frith et al v Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM), U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 20-11358.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks extended their recent rally on Friday and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes scored their biggest weekly percentage gains since the U.S. elections in early November, boosted by optimism over earnings, stimulus talks and progress on vaccine rollouts.
Both the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose for a fifth straight session in their longest streak of gains since August, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted record closing highs for a second day in a row.
A smaller-than-expected rebound in the U.S. labor market last month highlighted the need for more government aid to shore up the economy. The Labor Department on Friday reported a 49,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls last month, but job losses in manufacturing and construction.
U.S. President Joe Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress moved ahead with their $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package as lawmakers approved a budget plan that will allow them to muscle Biden's plan through in the coming weeks without Republican support.
""The upcoming package of stimulus is going to be big,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm based in Toledo.
""You have a situation where there's a lot of cash on sidelines and bonds have really underperformed, so that's helped some sectors that have really done poorly.""
Upbeat earnings this week have also supported investor optimism. So far, stronger-than-expected corporate results in the fourth quarter have driven up analysts' expectations, and S&P 500 companies are on track to post earnings growth for the period instead of a decline as initially expected.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 92.38 points, or 0.3%, to 31,148.24, the S&P 500 gained 15.09 points, or 0.39%, at 3,886.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 78.55 points, or 0.57%, at 13,856.30.
For the week, the S&P 500 gained 4.65%, the Nasdaq added 6.01% and the Dow increased 3.89%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index rose 7.7% for the week, its biggest weekly percentage gain since the week ended June 5.
The Cboe Volatility index fell and had its biggest weekly point drop since the week ended Nov. 6.
The S&P 500 technology index ended down 0.2% after hitting a record high earlier in the session.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) rose 1.5% after the drugmaker said it had asked U.S. health regulators to authorize its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use.
Shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), caught in the recent social media-hyped trading frenzy, rose 19.2% on Friday, after online broker Robinhood lifted all the buying curbs imposed at the height of the battle between amateur investors and Wall Street hedge funds.
Clover Health Investments Corp shares ended up 5.7%. It said it would cooperate with a request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. U.S. regulators are following up on a report about Clover by short-selling specialist Hindenburg Research.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.33-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.94-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 286 new highs and four new lows.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched a second straight day of all-time highs Friday as President Joe Biden signaled that he was prepared to pass the stimulus bill without Republican support, stoking investor optimism that in the absence of compromises needed to win over GOP support the final package could be closer to $1.9 trillion. 
The S&P 500 closed up 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.57%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.30%, or 92 points,
""Going forward, this minimal improvement in January hiring underscores concerns that the labor market recovery may take some time, potentially remaining well below full employment for years, and also provides additional ammunition for those in Washington focused on a further increase in government spending to help supplement growth,"" Stifel said in a note.
Biden on Friday said he would move forward with his $1.9 trillion stimulus relief package even if it means passing it without the 10 Republican votes needed in the Senate.  The president also stressed that he would not trim the size of the proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans.
""The biggest risk is not going too big [on the size of the stimulus package] but too small,"" Biden said during televised remarks on Friday. He added: ""It's very clear our economy is still in trouble,""
The Senate approved a budget bill early Friday, paving the way for passage of Biden's ""American Rescue Plan.""
The urgency on further stimulus comes as the economy produced fewer jobs than expected last month.
The U.S. created more 49,000 jobs in January, from a downwardly revised 227,000 decline in jobs seen in December, and lower than economists' estimates for a 50,000 gain. The unemployment rate fell to 6.3% from 6.7%, but the better-than-expected decline was due to ""people leaving the labor force as employment rose 201,000 and unemployment fell 606,000,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Mostly bullish quarterly earnings, meanwhile, continued to surprise to the upside, further boosting investor sentiment.
Ford (NYSE:F) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, but revenue missed expectations. Its stock still climbed 1% as the company upped its spending plans on electrical vehicles to $29 billion, underscoring its intention to make a big splash in the EV market.
Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) surged nearly 10% after projecting strong 2021 forecast and delivering a fourth-quarter beat on the both the top and bottom lines, led by strong performance from its ""Call of Duty"" franchise.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) was up 9%, shrugging off a softer-than-expected first-quarter guidance as earnings topped analysts' estimates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co confirmed on Friday the U.S. Justice Department and California Air Resources Board have closed a lengthy investigation into the No. 2 U.S. automaker's emissions certification process without taking any action.
Ford said in a securities filing that reviews by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Environment and Climate Change Canada remain open.
Ford first disclosed the criminal probe in April 2019 and earlier hired outside law firm Sidley Austin and experts to investigate its vehicle fuel economy and testing procedures after employees raised concerns about analytical modeling that is part of its fuel economy and emissions compliance process.
Ford said Friday the investigations' closure was ""consistent with the company’s own investigation and conclusion that we appropriately completed our certification processes.""
Ford declined to releasing findings from its own investigation and said it has not changed any fuel economy ratings as a result.
Ford faces a class-action lawsuit from owners who claim Ford ""cheated on its fuel economy testing on some of its best-selling and most popular trucks"" and said the issue affected over a million Ford truck owners.
The lawsuit claims that ""independent testing conducted on Ford F-150 and Ford Ranger vehicles has vindicated the concerns of both consumers and Ford’s own employees: Ford did not follow appropriate coastdown testing procedures, and instead disclosed inaccurate resistance figures to increase the MPG Rating of its F-150 and Ranger vehicles."" Coastdown testing measures the effects of wind and road resistance on a coasting vehicle.
The lawsuit said ""extra fuel costs for all 2018 and 2019 F-150s"" would total approximately $2.32 billion for city driving, $2.09 billion highway, and $1.9 billion combined.""

Ford declined to comment on the lawsuit Friday but argues in court papers it should be dismissed, saying owners are ""implausibly claiming that Ford had a duty to disclose the 'true fuel economy' for the subject vehicles, as if such a figure actually exists.""

The S&P 500 was up 0.31%, having hit an intraday record high of 3,894.50 earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.31%, or 97 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.51%.
The U.S. created more 49,000 jobs in January, from a downwardly revised 227,000 decline in jobs seen in December, and lower than economists' estimates for a 50,000 gain. The unemployment rate fell to 6.3% from 6.7%, but the better-than-expected decline was due to ""people leaving the labor force as employment rose 201,000 and unemployment fell 606,000,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
The weaker than expected bounce in jobs is expected to galvanize lawmakers on Capitol Hill to speed up efforts on another round of stimulus.  
""Going forward, this minimal improvement in January hiring underscores concerns that the labor market recovery may take some time, potentially remaining well below full employment for years, and also provides additional ammunition for those in Washington focused on a further increase in government spending to help supplement growth,"" Stifel said in a note.
President Joe Biden on Friday said he would move forward with his $1.9 trillion stimulus relief package even if it means passing it without the 10 Republican votes needed in the Senate.  The president also stressed that he would not trim the size of the proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans.
""The biggest risk is not going too big [on the size of the stimulus package] but too small,"" Biden said during televised remarks on Friday. He added: ""It's very clear our economy is still in trouble,""
The Senate approved a budget bill early Friday, paving the way for passage of Biden's ""American Rescue Plan.""
The background of growing optimism of further stimulus comes as the quarterly earnings continued to surprise to the upside, further boosting investor sentiment.
Ford (NYSE:F) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, but revenue missed expectations. Its stock still climbed 2% as the company upped its spending plans on electrical vehicles to $29 billion, underscoring its intention to make a big splash in the EV market.
Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) surged 9% after projecting strong 2021 forecast and delivering a fourth-quarter beat on the both the top and bottom lines, led by strong performance from its ""Call of Duty"" franchise.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) was up 6% shrugging off a softer-than-expected first-quarter guidance as earnings topped analysts' estimates.
 Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) fell 6%, however, after flagging supply chain issues as the cycling company struggled to keep up with demand. The company's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue topped Wall Street forecasts."
1101,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 02:05PM ET</span>","Prudential CEO mulls shrinking life insurance, ""low growth"" businesses","By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU), which has already halted sales of some variable annuities, said on Friday that it will also consider scaling back its individual life insurance and other ""market sensitive, low growth"" businesses.
""Life will be one of the businesses we look at in addition to annuities but not the only one,"" said Chief Executive Officer Charles Lowrey in a call with analysts to discuss the New Jersey insurer's fourth-quarter results.
More insurers are selling off individual life insurance businesses. Large life insurance investment portfolios are highly sensitive to already low interest rates, which have dropped further during the pandemic, and dragged on industry earnings along with higher COVID death rates.
Private equity firms see opportunity. Last month, Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) said it had agreed to sell most of its life insurance business to entities managed by buyout firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc for $2.8 billion. Last year, American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) said it will separate its life insurance business from the company.
In November, Prudential (NYSE:PUK) said that it would stop selling variable annuities with so-called ""guaranteed living benefits,"" which for a fee offer features such as set minimum income for life or the ability to withdraw funds.
That move was also aimed at curbing the company's interest rate risk.
Lowrey on Friday said that Prudential would look at ""blocks of businesses in terms of runoff, reinsurance or sales.""
Prudential is also looking into mergers and acquisitions opportunities for PGIM, its asset management arm, said Prudential's head of U.S.-based businesses Andy Sullivan.
""Specifically leaning into new product and investment strategy capabilities, we feel very confident that when we do that, we can gain leverage from our distribution might and strength,"" Sullivan said.

Investing.com --  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) recovered all the ground it lost after-hours on Thursday, and then some, after Wall Street analysts had time to digest mixed results.
Shares of the social media company jumped 5% on Friday after falling 10% late Thursday, when it reported a slightly wider than expected loss but a 62% gain in revenue. Snap said a change in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iOS operating system could be a risk to advertising. 
Huber Research upgraded the stock to overweight from underweight, and several other analysts raised their price targets. Oppenheimer, Cowen, Rosenblatt, and Stifel analysts all raised their targets to $70, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) raised to $65. Snap currently trades around $61. "

Investing.com - President Joe Biden pledged Friday to ""act fast"" on getting his $1.9 trillion stimulus through Congress, saying it was ""very clear"" the economy was in trouble following a weaker-than-expected rebound in the labor market last month.  
""It's very clear our economy is still in trouble,"" Biden said during televised remarks on Friday. ""We added just 6,000 private sector jobs in the economy last month ... at time when 10 million people are out of work,"" he said, following Friday's jobs report showing just 49,000 jobs were created in January.
This ""once in a century virus has decimated the economy ... we're still in the teeth of this pandemic as January was the single deadliest month of the whole pandemic."" Biden added: ""I'm going to act. I'm going to act fast."" 
The president pledged to go it alone if efforts to win over the support of the 10 Republican votes needed in the Senate to pass the bill end up delaying passage of the fiscal package.   
The Senate approved a budget bill early Friday, paving the way for passage of Biden's ""American Rescue Plan.""
If its a choice ""between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting so badly and getting bogged down in a negotiation, or compromising in a bill ... I'm going to help the American people who are hurting now,"" Biden said. ""That's why I'm so grateful to the House and Senate for moving so fast on the American rescue plan.""

1104,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>",Mystery Trade Adds Almost $9 Billion to Vanguard S&P 500 Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- Near the start of December, a mystery over-the-counter trade pulled about $7 billion from Vanguard Group’s S&P 500 exchange-traded fund. It just got it all back and more.
The $194 billion Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (ticker VOO) added $8.7 billion on a single day this week, about two months after that record withdrawal. Similar to the 2020 mega outflow, VOO’s cash infusion came amid lower-than-average trading volumes and there were no noticeable large block trades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It all points to another monster over-the-counter trade.
“A large institution arrives with, say, 200 equities that are in the S&P. They work with a broker to get that morphed into a VOO position,” said Dave Nadig, chief investment officer at data provider ETF Trends. “The most likely reason for a trade like this is liquidity. All ETFs are much easier to manage, from a liquidity perspective, than any basket of individual securities.”
When cash flows into an ETF, a market maker known as an authorized participant, or AP, gives the issuer more of the fund’s underlying assets in exchange for new shares to meet demand.
An investor ordinarily buys or sells their ETF shares on an exchange. But instead of buying on the open market with cash, they could theoretically take some of the underlying assets to an AP, and arrange for them to be swapped into ETF shares. In this way, assets would flow into the ETF, but volumes associated with the transaction would not show up on the exchange.
The latest data show a similar trade also cycled through the $251 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) this week. Roughly $7.6 billion poured into that fund, amid muted exchange trading volume and without any discernible large transactions. That inflow comes after $8.3 billion was yanked from IVV in a single day in mid-December.
Vanguard spokesman Freddy Martino declined to comment on the VOO flow. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on IVV’s jump in assets.
In the eyes of Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas, it’s likely that the same institution was behind the outflows and inflows for both funds. He noted that a similar pattern took place last year.
“Basically this is an investor who wants to be exposed to S&P 500 but has some purpose for selling out and buying back in around end of year, probably tax-related,” he said.

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>",Clover Health shares dip as SEC looks into short-seller allegations,"By Anirban Sen and Stephen Culp
(Reuters) - U.S. regulators are following up on a critical report about Clover Health Investments Corp by short-selling specialist Hindenburg Research and have told the insurance company to preserve any relevant documents. 
Clover, backed by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, said on Friday it would cooperate with the request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
The company's share price was last down 1.8%.
Clover said the SEC had requested ""document and data preservation for the period from January 1, 2020, to the present, relating to certain matters that are referenced in the (Hindenburg) article."" 
The company also disclosed a separate earlier inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), but added it had not received any civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the department. 
Palihapitiya and the company were fully aware of the DOJ inquiry, which it did not consider as ""material information"" for its earlier disclosures, Clover said. 
On Thursday, Hindenburg published a scathing report, the title of which called Clover a ""broken business,"" and accused the company of not disclosing a DOJ investigation into its business model and its software offering, Clover Assistant. 
The insurance firm's shares fell more than 12%, their biggest daily percentage drop in four months, following the report.
Clover said on Friday some of the claims were ""completely untrue"" and executives Vivek Garipalli and Andrew Toy said in a separate blog post that the report was ""rife with ad-hominem attacks, sweeping inaccuracies and gross mischaracterizations"".
Hindenburg was the first major short-selling research house to publish a new report since the eruption two weeks ago of the battle between short-sellers and investors over  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and a number of other stocks.

Clover, which sells Medicare-backed insurance plans, went public through a $3.7 billion deal with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by Palihapitiya. Its other investors include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Silicon Valley-based venture capital giant Sequoia Capital.

The bonus, which will be paid at the end of this month, amounts to an average of 1,371 euros ($1,648), or about 6% of annual reference average salary, national metal mechanic unions said in a statement.
That exceeds a 1,350 euro average bonus paid last year and a 1,250 euro payment made two years ago by Stellantis predecessor Fiat Chrysler (FCA).
Stellantis, the world's fourth automaker, was created last month as FCA and French rival PSA completed their merger process.
Gianluca Ficco, of UILM union, said some 54,000 workers of former FCA in Italy will receive the bonus.
He said the increased bonus showed that the automaker and the unions had signed a good national agreement.
""It also shows the workers' effort to keep efficiency high at Italian plants, despite all the problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said.
Italian employees of former PSA, a few hundred people mostly with sales jobs and hired with a different contract, are not entitled to the bonus. 
FCA froze its production in Italy for almost two months last spring, as the country was hit by one of the world's toughest lockdowns following the coronavirus outbreak. 
Stellantis has pledged not to close any plants or cut jobs following the FCA-PSA merger and Chief executive Carlos Tavares has said that all brands and all plants would be given a chance.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 11:21AM ET</span>",Analysis: The other winners of the Reddit-fueled rallies: convertible debt,"By Kate Duguid and Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Among the winners from the recent retail-driven frenzy in U.S. stocks are investors in the niche market of convertible debt, capping a year of gains for the securities and potentially drawing new interest. 
While buyout firm Silver Lake capitalized on a surge in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), one of the stocks at the epicenter of the retail frenzy linked to a convertible bond, others have also seen their bonds gain.
Those holding convertible notes - which allow investors to convert the debt to equity when a company's shares hit a set price - in Ligand Pharmaceuticals have seen prices rise 10% since Jan. 25. Over the same period, the American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) convertible note rose to a record high, as did that of  First Majestic Silver  (NYSE:AG), last up 9% and 14% respectively. All three stocks were pushed higher in the retail buying rush.
""This is why you buy convertibles,"" said Geoff Dancey, portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management, who bought into the Ligand convertible bond just before the Reddit rally. 
""We are benefiting from the rise, the same way as equity investors,"" said Arnaud Brillois, who manages the global convertible portfolio at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management. He noted that not all stocks that rose last week are linked to convertible bonds, which allow investors to gain from dramatic jumps in share prices but also pay a coupon like a traditional bond.
""When you have a stock going up, the convertible bond is going to capture a large part of the equity's rise,"" said Brillois. ""The convertible bond will perform approximately 950% or 970% when the equity is doing 1000%.""
Two hedge fund investors who requested anonymity because they could not speak publicly about their positions said the market volatility also provided hedge funds with an opportunity to profit. They buy the convertible bonds of companies whose stock has soared and hedge their position by shorting the shares.
""This (retail) development has spurred a whole group of funds to adopt that strategy,"" said a source who runs a U.S. hedge fund. 
That arbitrage strategy - which takes advantage of differences in price between the debt and equity - has been utilized by funds like CQS, AQR Capital Management, Man Group and Whitebox Advisors, among others. 
Last week's market mania ""benefited the private equity firms or whoever owned the bonds greatly; it benefited the company because they don't have to pay back the debt, and it probably did not benefit whoever it was that was buying up that stock that hit crazy levels,"" said Todd Pulvino, co-founder of CNH Partners, an affiliate of AQR that trades convertible arbitrage.
Gil Song, portfolio manager at Man GLG, said large, unexpected moves in stocks that benefit convertible arbitrage investors may become more common. 
""Given recent estimates of retail participation in the market having doubled in the past two years alone, one might infer increased volatility is here to stay for at least some time,"" said Song. 
Whitebox Advisors declined to comment and CQS did not respond to a request for comment. 
Funds that buy and sell both equity and debt have beenscouring the market for opportunities created by the retailbuying frenzy, said one fund source and a prime brokerage banker, who declined to be identified. 
Companies that have convertible debt outstanding and whose equity valuations have become over-inflated fit the criteria for investing. ""You look for inefficiency in the pricing of the debtstructure,"" said one New York-based investor. ""When the equitygoes crazy, that creates an automatic opportunity to buy thedebt."" Convertible bonds do come with risks, as they are often in speculative-grade companies. However, Joe Wysocki, a convertible portfolio manager at Calamos Investments, said ""regardless of what drives that stock - whether it's the technicals or the fundamentals - by owning a convertible you retain some of that upside participation."" 

While the Reddit rally has shown signs of weakening, two of the largest exchange-traded funds that track the convertible market, the iShares Convertible Bond ETF and the SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Convertible Securities ETF, hit all-time highs on Friday morning.

(Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's lawsuit seeking to preemptively block the U.S. government from blaming the world's largest retailer for its alleged role in fueling the nation's opioid crisis.
U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan said the government had not waived its sovereign immunity from Walmart's ""sweeping"" challenge to the Department of Justice's and Drug Enforcement Administration's enforcement of laws governing opioid prescriptions by pharmacies and pharmacists.
Walmart said on Friday it will appeal the decision, which the Plano, Texas-based judge issued on Thursday night.
Jordan ruled six weeks after the government filed its own lawsuit against Walmart, claiming its network of more than 5,000 pharmacies was unable to adequately detect and report suspicious opioid prescriptions. It also said Walmart did the opposite, filling thousands of invalid prescriptions.
In its Oct. 22 lawsuit, Walmart had said the government's lax and confusing oversight left pharmacists with an ""untenable"" choice between filling prescriptions and risking criminal or civil liability, or refusing prescriptions and facing the wrath of patients, doctors and state medical boards.
""Our pharmacists and patients deserve better than the current patchwork of inconsistent, conflicting and contradictory demands from federal and state regulators,"" the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said in announcing the planned appeal.
The Justice Department's lawsuit against Walmart was a significant escalation of its efforts to hold major pharmacies responsible for their roles in an U.S. opioid epidemic in which about 450,000 people died from overdoses from 1999 to 2018.

It is seeking civil damages for Walmart's alleged violations of the Controlled Substances Act on a ""nationwide scale,"" both as a pharmacy and as a distributor.

1113,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",Cathie Wood Amasses $50 Billion and a New Nickname: ‘Money Tree’,"(Bloomberg) -- In South Korea, retail investors have given Cathie Wood a nickname: “Money Tree.” Looking at the pile of cash now managed by Ark Investment Management, it’s easy to see why.
Ark’s exchange-traded fund assets under management crossed $50 billion this week, up from only $3.6 billion at this time last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In 2021 alone, investors have funneled almost $11 billion in Wood’s family of funds.
The new record underscores the flood of money pouring into thematic products, tracking topics like genomics and fintech, as retail traders put money to work in funds with relatable narratives. Wood’s eye-popping returns catch the pros’ attention, while her approachable persona attracts investors just starting out.
“This is a key milestone, and a sign that the ETF business is not just dominated by firms tracking indexes,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for CFRA Research. “Given investor focus on long-term thematic investing, there’s room for additional growth for Ark and other active managers.”
In South Korea, retail investors are swarming to buy thematic products and Cathie Wood has become something of a celebrity. In social media posts they refer to her as “돈나무”, which roughly translates as “Money Tree.” The facts back that up -- her ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has gained 19% already this year, on top of a 149% rise in 2020.
In fact, due to popular demand, Ark recently launched a line of merchandise. Offerings include T-shirts that say “Truth Wins Out” and baseball caps with “Stay Innovative.” There’s even a baby onesie with “Invest in the Future” on the front.
The allure faded a bit last week as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). stole the headlines and the main ARKK fund went four days without an inflow. Also shorts are building in the $25.4 billion fund. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on ARKK is nearly 1.5%, down slightly from an all-time high of 1.9% earlier this month, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd.
Critics warn Ark could face headwinds, since her funds are so heavily exposed to technology companies that saw tremendous gains during the pandemic lockdowns. As the economy reopens and a broad market rotation takes hold, tech stocks could suffer.
Still, Wood’s name recognition is only growing, and her stamp of approval is enough to move stock prices. Her inclusion of DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc. in the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) boosted the sports-betting company’s shares 8.6% earlier this week.
“Performance leads to inflows,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs for WallachBeth Capital. “All their funds have done very well, which had led to such huge amounts of money going into them. Investors still believe in the fund manager.”

1116,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 09:44AM ET</span>","Wall Street Grinds Higher at Opening, Shaking Off Jobs Report; Dow up 150 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, building on Thursday's record-high close and on course for their best weekly performance since November - despite a labor market report for January that had little to cheer about. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 150 points, or 0.5%, at 31,206 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.
Earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had said that the U.S. economy had added a modest 49,000 nonfarm jobs in January. While that was in line with early estimates, it was well short of expectations that had risen since Wednesday, when private payroll processor ADP had estimated a net addition of 174,000 jobs in in the month.
The numbers were a reminder of the deep hole in which the labor market finds itself as a result of the restrictions on businesses and social gatherings due to lockdown measures across the nation. However, for some in the market, they were more important for again underlining the importance of a comprehensive relief package from Congress. As such, they promised to weaken resistance to some of the spending measures contained in the $1.9 trillion package making its way through Congress now. 
The Senate completed voting on amendments to the bill just before dawn on Friday after an all-night session. Biden is set to meet with representatives of the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives later Friday to speed its passage through the lower chamber.
Among early movers. Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock stood out with a 6.1% drop after the maker of connected exercise bikes warned that it couldn't keep up with demand due to production bottlenecks. The window of peak demand for Peloton bikes may begin to close later this year as the rollout of vaccines allows gyms to reopen.   
Standing out in the other direction was GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock, which gained 46% on a fresh wave of enthusiasm from retail traders  The videogame and accessory store had lost over 40% on Thursday, closing below the level that some of its long-term backers see as fair value. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock, which also spiked over the last week due to an acute short squeeze driven by retail traders, rose 9.0%. The moves came as Robinhood, a fee-free online brokerage popular with retail traders, lifted its remaining restrictions on buying the two stocks.
News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) was another big gainer, rising 9.7% to the highest since Rupert Murdoch spun off his 'old media' assets from Fox Corp. in 2013. The publisher of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones had its most profitable quarter in that timeframe at the end of 2020.
Elsewhere in the videogames sector, Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock rose 11% after a welter of broker upgrades in the wake of its quarterly report this week. Wedbush, Evercore ISI and Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) all raised their target prices while Raymond James initiated coverage with a target price of $120, some 18% above its current level.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 09:41AM ET</span>",Countdown to 'catastrophe:' Inside Europe's fight for COVID shots,"By Francesco Guarascio and John Chalmers
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - In a meeting last week in the Europa building in Brussels, home of the European Union's political leadership, diplomats for the 27 member states were desperate.
The EU had paid billions of euros toward shots to curb a pandemic that was killing thousands of Europeans every day. Now vaccine-makers had cut back deliveries, and the EU was trapped in a public fight.
""This is a catastrophe,"" French ambassador Philippe Leglise-Costa told the Jan. 27 meeting, according to a diplomatic note seen by Reuters.
It was a crucial moment in nearly two weeks of confusion and anger over the EU's vaccine supply, which were to plunge the bloc into its deepest crisis since Ursula von der Leyen took over the executive European Commission just over a year ago. 
A week earlier, the EU had set a target to vaccinate 70% of adults against COVID-19 by the end of summer, a potential ticket out of lockdowns that have cost countries billions. As the impact of the vaccine shortfall became clear, the bloc embarked on a campaign to shame drugmakers hit by production delays into releasing more supply.
But the tactic wasn't working and details of confidential deals were leaking out, casting doubt on the EU's ability to enforce contracts it had agreed on behalf of its members.
Reuters has obtained exclusive details of internal EU talks over the past month in diplomatic notes, and interviewed four people present at key meetings to verify them. The notes reveal how the EU's top executives lurched from satisfaction about the vaccination programme to panic.
Some EU officials were already aware in December of delays in vaccine production, the notes show, but the Commission announced ambitious targets nonetheless. The EU initially kept no track of companies' vaccine doses leaving the bloc, only realising after its own supplies were delayed it could not trace the millions of doses that had already been exported. And as its attempts to win ground by legal means failed, the Commission faced sharp attacks from EU governments on its public communication strategy.
In a pandemic that has killed over 700,000 people in Europe alone, the delays announced by the companies producing coronavirus vaccines - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC and  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) - risked leaving millions in Europe unprotected deep in the winter, just as new, more transmissible, variants were circulating and hospitals were being overwhelmed. Vaccination centres from Madrid to Paris had closed for lack of supply.
The EU Commission declined comment for this story. So did AstraZeneca, which has said it is focused on boosting supplies to the bloc after the manufacturing glitches. The Commission has often said it expects an exponential increase in the availability of vaccines from April. Pfizer's Chief Executive Albert Bourla told Reuters production is back on track in Europe after the company made changes at its Belgian manufacturing site to increase supply.
The vaccine squeeze was not just a public health nightmare. It was also a political crisis.
Britain, freshly divorced from the EU's single market after five years of bitter negotiations, was inoculating people at a much faster pace than any EU country, public data show.
Diplomats feared the Commission was losing the battle against a ""narrative of ... big failure,"" a senior EU diplomat who was present at the Jan. 27 meeting told Reuters. They urged the Commission to cool a row with British company AstraZeneca for the sake of getting drugs as soon as possible, the notes show and people present said.
The Commission's dilemma underscores the power of big drugmakers as governments scramble to vaccinate their citizens, and the geopolitical tensions that can result. 
Eventually, the notes show EU diplomats recognised the bloc may not benefit from arguing about contracts with AstraZeneca. Instead, the Commission turned up the heat on the United Kingdom - which AstraZeneca said was preventing British-made vaccines from reaching Europe - only to swiftly step back after realising it risked disrupting a border agreement in the Brexit accord which London and Dublin said could have serious consequences for security in Northern Ireland.
The damage to the EU's image was visible on the front pages of Britain's eurosceptic popular press, with headlines declaring ""EU vaccines war explodes"" and ""EU chiefs behaving like the mafia.""
A spokesman for the French ambassador said he had urged the EU ""to communicate in an orderly and strategic manner."" 
A British government spokesperson said, ""We are in constant contact with the vaccine manufacturers and remain confident that the supply of vaccine to the UK will not be disrupted."" The UK government declined to comment on AstraZeneca's claim it was preventing vaccines from reaching Europe, but said it does not prohibit any export of COVID-19 vaccines.
""GLITCH-FREE""
The month started calmly for member states, who had agreed at the start of the pandemic to form a steering group with the EU executive to negotiate with drugmakers, to support smaller states and prevent internal squabbling. 
EU Commission officials and diplomats involved met in the Europa Building's S7 Room, a windowless chamber where delegates assembled at a round table beneath a ceiling decorated with dozens of squares in pastel colours. The Commission was represented by the EU's top vaccine negotiator, Sandra Gallina, an Italian national who started working for the EU Commission more than three decades ago as an interpreter. She declined to comment for this story.
The EU was about three weeks behind Britain in launching a vaccine - largely because it opted against issuing emergency regulatory approval as Britain had done. But the EU had announced deals with six vaccine-makers to secure nearly 2.3 billion doses for its population of 450 million.
Pfizer, working with German partner BioNTech, was one of only two firms whose shots had approval. It was the only one supplying the EU, which had announced deals for up to 600 million Pfizer doses. The roll-out began immediately after Christmas.
""Deliveries are so far mostly glitch-free,"" Gallina told diplomats in a Jan. 8 briefing, according to a note from the meeting.
Gallina told the briefing the EU was receiving 3.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine a week. She underscored that the UK, by contrast, had reserved only 4 million doses of the Pfizer shot until February. Pfizer declined to comment, saying delivery schedules are confidential. 
Gallina told diplomats some countries were passing on their share of Pfizer doses in anticipation of securing drugs from AstraZeneca, which was due to launch deliveries to the EU once its vaccine won regulatory approval there in late January. Both companies' vaccines are made and exported from plants a short drive from Brussels. AstraZeneca also makes vaccines for the EU at factories in Germany and Britain, according to the EU Commission.
Gallina told the meeting member states saw AstraZeneca as a ""star"" for its low prices and big numbers. 
The companies have declined to comment on prices; AstraZeneca's vaccine costs about 2.5 euros ($3) per dose, against 15.5 euros for Pfizer's, two EU negotiators directly involved in talks with vaccine makers told Reuters. AstraZeneca committed to deliver at least 80 million doses through March, or up to 120 million, an official involved in the talks told Reuters.
EU negotiators were aware AstraZeneca was scaling back its planned supply because of production problems. The company had told the EU's steering group on Dec. 4 that it would reduce its targets for the first quarter to two-thirds of the 120 million maximum, according to a diplomatic note.
At a public hearing on Jan. 12 in the European Parliament, Gallina told EU lawmakers that she had heard only three instances of ""relatively minor"" complaints about deliveries. 
REALITY CHECK
Three days later, on Jan. 15, Pfizer too said it had trimmed production and would temporarily cut supplies to the EU from its Belgian plant. There was an immediate public outcry across Europe. Italy's special commissioner for COVID-19, Domenico Arcuri, said Italy was considering legal action against Pfizer. 
Despite these delays, the EU Commission went ahead and announced an ambitious vaccination goal.
On Jan. 19, when just over 5 million vaccines had been administered in the EU, the Commission published targets to inoculate at least 80% of health workers and the elderly above the age of 80 by March, and 70% of the EU's adult population by the end of the summer. It also proposed a way to donate excess doses to poorer countries. 
The next day in the S7 Room briefing, EU diplomats told Commission officials those goals were too bold. 
""We have only about 2% vaccinated. How did you come up with the 70% target?"" a representative from Lithuania asked. ""We prefer to under-promise and over-deliver,"" the Dutch delegate said. A spokesman for the Dutch ambassador confirmed the Netherlands had raised concerns about the ambition in the Commission proposal. A spokeswoman for the Lithuanian ambassador declined to comment. 
Three days later, the notes showed Gallina telling diplomats that Pfizer's sudden cut had ""savaged"" member states' vaccination plans. But she reassured them shipments would resume the following week. 
""SHOCKED""
Worse was to come. On Friday Jan. 22, AstraZeneca, due to start EU deliveries on Feb. 15, said it would cut supplies further over the first three months. A senior official involved in the talks told Reuters this would mean a roughly 60% fall - to 31 million doses instead of 80 million. 
The European Commission went on the offensive. A few hours after the announcement, Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides tweeted about her ""deep dissatisfaction."" The following Monday the Commission summoned AstraZeneca's executives to meetings to pressure the company to lift deliveries. 
The Commission won concessions - AstraZeneca sweetened its offer to add 8 million doses from an earlier date of Feb. 7.
It was not enough. Aware of production problems at AstraZeneca's Belgian site, the EU Commission asked for drugs from Germany and Britain. But AstraZeneca offered no clarity on whether doses could be diverted from Britain, an EU official who attended the meeting said. 
The next day, the company's Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told European newspapers AstraZeneca was not legally required to deliver doses to the EU on a precise timeline, because its contract only stated it would make its ""best efforts"" to deliver. 
He also said Britain had signed up for its vaccine earlier than the EU and had asked to be served first from UK-based plants. The UK government declined to comment. 
Soriot's remarks infuriated the EU Commission. On Jan. 27, according to the notes, Gallina told diplomats she was ""shocked"" by ""the level of incorrect statements"" that she said Soriot had made about AstraZeneca's commitments. AstraZeneca declined to comment. 
The Commission, saying it was confident of the strength of its legal arguments, publicly demanded AstraZeneca publish the contract they had agreed. A heavily redacted version was eventually made public on Jan. 29.
""BACK AGAINST THE WALL""
At the Jan. 27 meeting, Gallina told delegates around the S7 Room table that some of the problems with AstraZeneca had already been known, but the new cut was ""a big blow.""
She also said the EU had no breakdown of who was exporting vaccines where. ""We have some information but we need more,"" she said.
Rough customs data showed millions of COVID-19 vaccines had been exported in past weeks from the EU to Britain, Canada, Israel and China, she said. The EU Commission did not respond to a request for export data. Britain, Israel and Canada have said they received Pfizer's vaccines from the EU; Britain has also said it received AstraZeneca's vaccine from the EU. Fosun, the China-based company which has exclusive rights to sell Pfizer's vaccine in China and Hong Kong, had no comment.
Gallina added the EU would set up a new mechanism to track and licence exports. The EU's lawyers could use several legal arguments to pressure AstraZeneca into releasing more doses, she added. 
The briefing did not go well. At least five diplomats told the meeting the Commission had pushed too far in its public fight and urged it to calm the dispute, at least privately. Legal action would not produce more vaccines quickly, they said.
""The Commission has its back against the wall,"" French ambassador Leglise-Costa told the meeting, according to the notes. He urged an immediate change in the communication strategy. 
Later that day, on another call with the Commission, Soriot told the EU not to expect doses from AstraZeneca's factories in Britain because London was using a clause in its contract that gave it priority over doses made in the United Kingdom, two EU officials told Reuters.
""ACT OF HOSTILITY""
Seeing that diplomats wanted to tone down the fight with AstraZeneca, the Commission set its sights on Britain's government.
The next day, EU officials publicly threatened to block vaccine exports - a move likely to hit Britain's imports of vaccines from Pfizer's Belgian plant. And the Commission said it wanted to set up a mechanism that would require companies to seek authorisation before exporting vaccine doses. 
On Friday Jan. 30, it took a further step, threatening to trigger a clause that would block vaccines from reaching Northern Ireland - a British-run province that remained part of the EU internal market after the Brexit divorce. 
Imposing restrictions on that border was potentially explosive: The Brexit talks had agreed to keep it open, to preserve the central plank of a 1998 peace deal ending 30 years of armed conflict in the province. 
Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster called the EU proposal ""an incredible act of hostility,"" and EU officials soon admitted it was excessive. 
By Sunday, the Commission had retreated on both fronts.
Commission President Von der Leyen announced in a tweet the bloc had achieved a ""step forward on vaccines."" AstraZeneca had offered to increase deliveries, she said. 

After a week of fighting and diplomatic confusion, the EU had secured just 1 million doses more than the firm's initial sweetened offer, her tweet revealed.

LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was wrong to try and compel U.S. engineering, procurement and construction company KBR (NYSE:KBR) Inc to hand over documents held overseas during an investigation, the UK Supreme Court ruled on Friday.
In a judgment that deals a blow to the investigator and prosecutor's abilities to gather overseas evidence, senior judges unanimously reversed a 2018 lower court ruling that so-called Section 2 notices could have extra-territorial reach.
""The presumption against extra-territorial effect clearly applies in this case because  KBR Inc  is not a UK company, and has never had a registered office or carried on business in the UK,"" they said.
The SFO said Section 2 powers were fundamental to its ability to investigate multinationals with complex corporate structures, but that it welcomed the court's clarification.
KBR said it was ""pleased"".
The SFO opened a bribery and corruption investigation into KBR's British business in 2017. But after a degree of initial cooperation, KBR Inc challenged a Section 2 notice handed to a U.S.-based senior executive in July 2017 during a London meeting to discuss the investigation.
KBR Inc said the notice was ""ultra vires"", or beyond the SFO's legal authority, because it sought material held outside the UK, that the agency should have relied on Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) from U.S. authorities and that the notice could not be handed to an officer temporarily in the jurisdiction.
MLA -- when enforcement authorities exchange information in different nations -- is a more cumbersome route to securing evidence than Section 2 notices. Failure to comply with such an order can lead to imprisonment or a fine. 
But its powers are enshrined in a 1987 law that largely pre-dates complex, multinational corporate structures and the easy digital transfer of documents.
Lawyers said the old law might be ill-suited to the modern age but that it was not the role of the courts to rewrite statutes to further a public interest in investigating crime.
""The judgment is a welcome reminder of the presumption against extraterritoriality in English criminal law,"" said Andrew Smith, a partner at law firm Corker Binning. 
Judith Seddon, a partner at Ropes & Gray, called the decision a ""victory for principled statutory interpretation"".

The SFO still has Overseas Production Orders, a new power introduced in 2019 to speed up the MLA process to secure electronic data held overseas if a co-operation treaty exists between jurisdictions. Companies seeking to avoid prosecution can also voluntarily cooperate with the agency.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 09:31AM ET</span>","'To the moon' or to a lawyer, GameStop investors cope with stock's rollercoaster","By Krystal Hu
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eric Diaz, an operations manager in Tampa, Florida, remains committed to his GameStop shares even after their steep retreat from highs they hit last week. ""It got personal,"" he said. 
Like many other people, Diaz first invested $3,000 after reading about the video game retailer's stock on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets. The so-called ""Reddit rally"" to squeeze shortsellers rocketed  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares from below $18 a share in early January to as high as $483 last week. Diaz sold some to take profits of $1,500 and hold on to the rest, 10 shares. 
After watching the shares plunge on Thursday to close at $53.5, Diaz said he plans to buy more if the price keeps dropping. 
""At first it was investing in an idea,"" said Diaz. ""But then after all the shenanigans when retail investors who wanted to purchase were prevented from doing it, it got personal. So I'm just going to hold until it plays out.""
The wild swings of GameStop and other Reddit rally favorites were cast as a David versus Goliath tale of individuals taking on Wall Street hedge funds. With trading volume swelling last week, online broker Robinhood and other investing apps placed restrictions on GameStop and other shares. 
The fierce rally damaged some hedge funds when they could not cover short positions. Still, many people on Wall Street have also made money off GameStop, while some small investors were hurt by its rapid decline.
Many financial professionals had warned the rally could not last forever. Still, lawyers said their phones have been ringing with GameStop shareholders hoping to recoup losses. Even during this week's swoon, many recent Reddit posts pledged to hold GameStop until the stock goes ""to the moon."" 
""IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN""
Those who were late to the party are likely looking at losses, if they did not hedge their long positions somehow.
John Gjolaj, a restaurant manager in New York and longtime user of Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, invested in over 300 shares of GameStop last week at $269 a share. He plans to hold on. Gjolaj said he believed GameStop's team can turn around the company.
""I’m hoping I can sell it at $500 or so. But if it takes years, I’ll be holding,"" Gjolaj said. ""I invested in bitcoin at its height in 2017. I can stomach all this volatility.""
Jerry Corley, a gardener in Arkansas, joined WallStreetBets' thread on Reddit last week and bought three shares of GameStop on Monday. Looking at a loss, he has drawn encouragement from Roaring Kitty, the online handle of an investor who championed GameStop and whose posts claimed he turned an investment of a few thousand dollars into millions.
""He has got his money where his mouth is. This guy's no dummy. That's a great sign right there,"" said Corley.
On Wednesday, Roaring Kitty, also known as DeepF***ingValue on WallStreetBets, posted a screenshot on Twitter of the GameStop stock, which was traded at around $4 in July, adding ""I like the stock."" 
Keith Patrick Gill, a trained financial advisor who is behind the Roaring Kitty streams, did not respond to a request for comment. His recent posts show he still holds a position worth over $8 million in the stock. 
Some followers on Reddit posted after his Wednesday tweet: ""If he's still in, I'm still in."" 
CALLS TO LAWYERS 
Diaz tried to get around Robinhood's trading restrictions by using several trading platforms. But the trading limits quickly drew a backlash from investors and U.S. lawmakers from both parties, and have also sparked lawsuits.
Levin Papantonio Rafferty attorney Michael Bixby said his firm has gotten dozens of calls with ""every sort of complaint you could imagine"" related to Robinhood's handling of GameStop trading. 
""If you lost $10,000, that might be a heck of a lot of money to the individual but it would be difficult to justify the cost of litigation,"" Bixby said. 
A representative for Robinhood declined comment on the lawsuits. Previously, the online broker said the trading restrictions were put in place to because of the collateral it needs to post required by clearinghouses to backstop many of the trades.
Matthew Schwartz, attorney at Kass Shuler in Florida, said most of the calls he received were from individuals trading options that could not buy, or who had traditional equities that were restricted. 
The Reddit rally also had winners that remain in play. Bryan Towey, a 20-year-old entrepreneur in New York, said he made over 890% returns on GameStop since he invested in 10,000 shares at an average cost of $22.10 per share in early January after reading about the company's e-commerce sales growth. 
Towey has gradually sold his holdings since it hit $165, but still owns 2,200 shares, in the hope for another breakout.

""I’m like a gut investor type of person,"" Towey said. ""I have a good feeling about the business. If there is another bubble, I'll probably get rid of it.""

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",World shares near record levels as vaccines inject hope,"By Lawrence White and Hideyuki Sano
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - - Global shares approached record highs on Friday while the dollar and oil topped recent milestones, as progress in vaccine distribution and U.S. stimulus hopes prompted bets on further normalisation in the global economy.
An index of the world's major 50 markets, MSCI ACWI, rose 0.21% to 668.1, coming within reach of a record high of 670.82 touched about two weeks ago. It was the fifth consecutive day of gains.
Oil hit its highest level in a year, above $59 a barrel, supported by hopes of a quicker economic revival and supply curbs by OPEC and its allies. 
The STOXX index of Europe's 600 largest stocks was up 0.3% at 410.8, though slower vaccination rollouts in continental Europe and disappointing industrial data from Germany tempered optimism.
U.S. President Joe Biden's drive to enact a $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid bill gained momentum early on Friday as the U.S. Senate narrowly approved a budget blueprint allowing Democrats to push the legislation through Congress in coming weeks, with or without Republican support.
Better-than-expected data on U.S. job markets released in the past two days fanned further hopes of a strong payroll report at 1330 GMT.
""Following from a positive U.S. trading session on Thursday supported by decent earnings numbers, it looks as though Democrats will go on their own on stimulus and not try to compromise with Republicans, so you might get something closer to the $1.9 trillion rather than a compromise,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London.

Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields rose in anticipation of the large pandemic relief bill from Washington as well as on rising inflation expectations. 
The benchmark 10-year yield stood at 1.130%, having risen to a three-week high of 1.162% the previous day. The 30-year bond yielded 1.922%, near its 10-1/2-month high of 1.951% touched on Thursday.
Bond yields rose in Europe as well, with Germany's 30-year government bond yield climbing back into positive territory for the first time since September.
Germany's DAX index was flat after data showed orders for German-made goods fell more than expected in December.
MSCI's gauge of Asian shares outside Japan rose 0.4% while Japan's Nikkei rallied 1.5%.
A market gauge of future U.S. inflation was at its highest since October 2018. A similar gauge for the euro zone hit its highest since May 2019.
While it was a strong day for conventional assets, the leading names in the recent U.S. retail-share trading fad fared worse.
The ""Reddit rally"" stocks GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) plunged further after two weeks of wild swings fuelled by the WallStreetBets Reddit forum.
Deep-pocketed investors instead last week pumped a record $4.2 billion into big technology stocks, BofA's flow data showed, taking advantage of the slight pullback on Wall Street while retail traders ploughed into the Reddit favourites.
DOLLAR SMILE
The dollar headed for its best weekly gain in three months, confounding dollar bears and tracing a trading pattern known as the ""Dollar Smile"", which in previous years has preceded major U.S. economic rebounds and currency surges.
The U.S. dollar index stood near a two-month high, having risen 1.1% so far this week, on course for its biggest weekly increase since late October.
""It seems markets are now trying to trade on economic normalisation based on progress in vaccination,"" said Arihiro Nagata, general manager of global investment at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank.
""The fact that the only currencies that are doing better than the dollar over the past two days are the British pound and the Israeli shekel, the two countries that are going further ahead in vaccination, seems to support that."" 
The British pound stood at $1.3696, not far from a two-and-a-half-year peak of $1.3759 hit late last month.
The shekel has risen over the past two days, reversing its decline since mid-January after the Bank of Israel intervened to stem its rise.
Gold edged up 0.7% to over $1,805 per ounce, but was still set for its worst weekly dip in four after hitting a two-month low of $1,785.10 on Thursday. 
Oil prices extended gains on the upbeat economic mood, falling inventories and a decision by OPEC+ to stick to its output cuts.

Brent crude was up 60 cents, or 1%, to $59.44 by 1130 GMT, after hitting $59.67, its highest since Feb. 20, 2020. U.S. crude was up 57 cents, or 1%, to $56.76, after reaching $56.95, its highest since Jan. 22, 2020.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading higher Friday, continuing a four-day winning streak ahead of the closely-watched monthly jobs report.
At 7:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 150 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 48 points, or 0.4%. 
The major indices on Wall Street have recorded four straight days of gains, and are on course for their best weekly performance since November. They have been helped by signs of progress in the country’s vaccination program, hope for a substantial stimulus plan as well as optimism over its economic recovery.
The January nonfarm payrolls report, a widely-watched barometer of economic health, is due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), with an improvement from December’s weak report widely expected. Analysts are looking for 50,000 jobs to have been added last month after 140,000 were lost in December.
This follows initial jobless claims falling to the lowest figure since the end of November on Thursday, while Wednesday’s report from payroll processing firm ADP indicated private companies added 174,000 new jobs in January.
Sold corporate earnings results have also helped the tone, with data provider Refinitiv stating that of the almost 200 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings to date, 84.2% have beaten expectations.
More companies are scheduled to report Friday, including the likes of drugmaker Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and cosmetics firm  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL). Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) and auto giant Ford (NYSE:F) are set to go in different directions after their published results late Thursday, while the Chamath Palihapitiyah-backed Clover Health will also be in focus after its 12% drop on Thursday.
On Capitol Hill, the Senate approved a budget resolution early Friday that will allow the Democrats to go ahead with a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill even if Republicans choose not to offer bipartisan support.
Oil prices firmed overnight, reaching their highest levels in a year on optimism of future economic growth as well as the continued commitment by major producers to curb supply.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $56.75 a barrel, after touching a high of $57.09, its highest since Jan. 22 last year, and is on track for a weekly gain of nearly 9%, which would be its biggest weekly gain since October.
The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.7% to $59.41, after hitting a high of $59.74, its highest since Feb. 20 last year, and on track to rise 6% this week.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,801.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1982.

1126,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",One U.S. company's risky effort to build a new mask factory during COVID,"By Timothy Aeppel
LA VERNE, Calif. (Reuters) - Dan Izhaky is betting $4 million that the pandemic will change what Americans are willing to pay for high quality face masks from his new factory here in this suburb of Los Angeles.
It’s a risky wager.
Before COVID-19 hit, the United States imported much of the personal protection equipment needed by health care providers, mainly from Asia. Some U.S. companies pivoted in the crisis, such as liquor companies churning out hand sanitizer and plastics firms making face shields. 
But one item that remains in tight supply is N95 face masks, which provide a high level of filtration against airborne contaminants and are closely regulated by the U.S. government.
Izhaky is president of United Safety Technology Inc, a startup that is poised to open a new N95 mask factory possibly within weeks. While the plant is still being fitted with machinery, his goal is to make 1 million masks a day when it’s up and running. Izhaky said if they get approval from regulators soon, the plant could be shipping that amount by the end of the second quarter.
“The big question we face is what happens post-pandemic,” said Izhaky, “when you have a hospital administrator or whoever it is that’s in charge of purchasing” and looking at U.S.-made masks that cost more. The pricing of many types of protective equipment remain elevated by shortages, but once the market normalizes Izhaky estimates his masks will cost about 30% more than Chinese masks, or about $1.15 each.
Other domestic producers are likely to face the same challenge, including industry giants Izhaky will compete with. 3M Co has quadrupled its domestic production of N95 masks since the start of the pandemic, expanding a factory in South Dakota and hiring 300 workers and now makes nearly 100 million masks in the U.S. a month. Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) has opened “multiple new locations in the Phoenix area” to make N95 masks, said spokesman Eric Krantz, and converted a significant portion of a factory in Rhode Island that also makes safety glasses.
Krantz said Honeywell doesn't view the expansion as a risk. 
“We’re confident there will be continued demand for high-quality respiratory protection products,"" he said in an email. ""We’ve made smart, strategic investments in expanding our N95 production.""
But many smaller producers aren't so sure.
“China subsidizes their face masks,” so every producer faces a challenge in competing with China after the pandemic, said Vitali Servutas, CEO of AmeriShield, which built a factory that makes single-use surgical masks, not N95 masks, in Virginia last year in response to the crisis.
Izhaky hopes, but is not certain, that the pandemic will make Americans more willing to pay a premium, or that U.S. government policy will mandate more domestic sourcing which would benefit his venture. Actions by the incoming administration of President Joe Biden, including an executive order aimed at increasing the production of a wide range of goods in domestic factories through Buy American programs, have made him more optimistic.
David Sanford, the brigadier general who directs the supply chain advisory group at the Department of Health and Human Services working on COVID-19 response, has been helping Izhaky and other manufacturers work through the process of getting certified and connected to domestic distributors of medical goods. He said Izhaky’s new factory is exactly the kind of project the U.S. needs to encourage.
“But there’s always a risk,” said Sanford. He adds there are ways the government can support businesses like this, short of giving direct government contracts to purchase goods at higher prices. A requirement to buy U.S.-made protective equipment could be built into Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, for instance.
Making masks isn’t that hard. The process is highly automated and doesn’t require a costly cleanroom. But getting a dependable supply of the materials, particularly the specialized layers of filtration material that makes them effective, is a challenge. 
“You can buy a face mask machine for a few hundred thousand dollars and start it up in 90 days. That’s happening all over the world,” said Sara Greenstein, CEO of Lydall (NYSE:LDL) Inc, a U.S. producer of the material that has agreed to supply Izhaky’s operation. 
Lydall, aided by federal funds provided early in the crisis, has nearly tripled capacity at its one U.S. plant capable of making the material. With competing Chinese material expected to continue to sell at much lower prices after the pandemic, Lydall CEO Greenstein has ""high confidence"" there will be government-led programs in the United States and Europe ""to buy product made here to help keep that supply chain stable and competitive.”
At the United Safety Technology plant in La Verne, engineers are busy fine tuning the first of the machines that will eventually turn out cup-shaped masks. 
Edward Zheng, Izhaky’s partner in the venture, said their goal is to source all the materials domestically, with a key exception: the machines that make the masks in the factory are imported from China.

1127,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 06:04AM ET</span>",StockBeat: A Tale of Two Bond Yields Lifts European Markets,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets may have closed Thursday at new record highs, Europe’s are still to get back to their pre-pandemic levels, thanks to stricter lockdowns and a largely sluggish rollout to national vaccination campaigns.
But that may be set to change. A look at two bond yields shows why.
The first is the U.K. 2-Year Gilt, which is set to break above 0% for the first time in nearly three months, after the Bank of England - in a typically backhanded, passive-aggressive, British kind of way - more or less ruled out the possibility of negative interest rates.
The Bank said on Thursday that it would want to give the U.K. banking system six months to prepare for the change to negative rates, a timeframe that makes any such move impossible before August.
By then, however, even if one thinks negative rates would do any good (and plenty at the BoE obviously don’t), the need for them will largely have passed: the U.K. government projections suggest that every adult in the country will have been vaccinated by June and - assuming that the vaccines are also effective against newer strains of the Covid-19 virus - the economy will no longer be at risk of renewed shutdowns.
Against that background, the two-year Gilt yield started the week at -0.15%, and is on course to end it at -0.02%. The upward pull in bond yields worldwide stemming from the U.S. Treasury market may easily be enough to take it above zero by the close. 
U.K. bank stocks have profited handsomely as the threat to their margins recedes: Natwest Group (NYSE:NWG) stock has risen 13.6% this week, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) stock has risen 12.5% and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) stock 11%.  Other reopening plays have also prospered: pub groups J D  Wetherspoon  (LON:JDW) and  Mitchells & Butlers  (LON:MAB) have risen 12% and 14.6% respectively (M&B even had the confidence to reject a hefty premium bid from private equity at the start of the week),  Restaurant Group  (LON:RTN) stock has leaped 25% and SSP Group (LON:SSPG), which operates eateries and snack bars at the U.K.’s airports and train stations, has risen nearly 14%.
It’s a different story with the other important bond movement of the week. Italy’s 10-Year yield has fallen from 0.65% to as low as 0.51% in response to Mario Draghi’s return to Italian politics. Draghi has accepted the task of forming a new government after the collapse of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s coalition. More importantly, the yield premium that Italy pays relative to Germany – a reliable indicator of market confidence in Italian stability - has fallen back under 1%.
That doesn’t change a thing about the long-term challenges that Italy faces (and many people in the market are overlooking Draghi’s poor record as a consensus-builder at the ECB and what that may mean for his ability to succeed politically), but it does remove a serious source of risk to the broader Eurozone economy in the near term. Italy’s banks, which are still more or less stuffed full of Italian government debt, have been almost alone in outperforming U.K. ones this week as a result. Results from Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) later Friday, and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) next week, may well give extra impetus to that trend."

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Column: Volatility storm gives way to inflation gale,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Whether it's durable or not, investors are bracing for several months of inflation angst that challenge the structure of world market positioning far more than January's amateur stock frenzy.
Amid hopes the worst of this latest pandemic wave has passed as vaccines roll out, market-based inflation expectations are creeping higher again. Some gauges from the swaps and index-linked bond market hit their highest in over two years in the United States this week and in more than 12 months in the euro zone.
Regardless of pledges of easy central bank money ahead, the cost of long-term borrowing is following suit. Thirty-year U.S. and German government bond yields hit their highest since the pandemic unfolded, with the latter turning positive on Thursday for the first time since March and yield curves steepening to their highest in almost four years. 
What's for sure is a jump back in headline inflation rates - much like the rebound to almost 1% in the euro zone in January after five months of falling prices - is now largely inevitable everywhere. 
Annual base effects from last year's sales tax cuts and 12-month price comparisons against pandemic-driven energy, food and commodity price slumps of last spring will ensure several months of sparky headlines ahead. 
United Nations data shows annual food price inflation was running above 10% last month, thanks mostly to surging cereal prices, and the index it compiles was at its highest since 2016.
At just under $60 per barrel, world crude oil prices turned positive again year-on-year in February. If they just stay here for the next three months the collapse in Brent crude to as low as $15 through March and April of last year will start to feed a skull-thumping annual energy price pulse to inflation numbers. 
What's more, COVID-related disruption to supply lines has spurred shipping and transport costs too, with the likes of the RWI/ISL Container Throughput Index hitting record highs late last year, with annual rises above 5% for the first time since 2018.
Whether that is just transient around a reboot of the world economy or whether it gets entrenched in long-term inflation assumptions is the central issue - as with all inflation spikes.
Policymakers and central banks seem relaxed and prepared to see through it - even if neither the U.S. Federal Reserve nor the European Central Bank have any specific yield caps to soothe anxious bond markets in the interim. 
Chicago Federal Reserve chief Charles Evans said on Wednesday he saw a spring inflation pop as temporary and headline rates would return to between 1.5-1.75% by the end of the year. Even 2.5-3.0% wouldn't be a problem in the meantime, he said, as the Fed was now targeting an average 2% rate over time. 
The Congressional Budget Office's long-range forecasts from last week were also serene - showing core U.S. inflation below 2% until 2024 and averaging just 2.1% from then through 2031.
MAGIC NUMBER
So shouldn't these short-term mechanical effects all be embedded in market pricing by now already? 
After all, many investors appear convinced the bumpy inflation ride this year will abate - as economists doubt commensurate pay rises will follow, given jobless rates are still high and even assuming possible minimum wage hikes.
And yet incoming official numbers are not playing ball with forecasts and Citi's global inflation surprise index turned positive in January for the first time since December 2018.
And if inflation surprises are in store for the next six months, erratic market risk alone may make investors jumpy. 
For multi-asset investors at least, the sustainability of super low long-term borrowing rates has been the central force driving the sky-high valuations that overall equity indices now enjoy. And even marginal moves in nominal bond yields from here could trigger an outsize correction.
Pascal Blanque, Chief Investment Officer at Europe's biggest asset manager Amundi, said this week that 10-year Treasury yields were less than 20 basis points from forcing that rethink. 
""Should 10-year yields rise further, equity market performance will be challenged. A 1.3% level for the UST 10Y would, in our view, test the market,"" he said, adding he didn't see this soon but it underlined the need for some hedging.
Others, such as Pinebridge multi-asset chief Mike Kelly, think that equity trigger may be much higher and closer to 2%.
But Kelly questions why the Fed would even contemplate that. ""If you advocate fiscal authorities should spend more, why would you then let the rate curve take away the benefit?"" he said.
In the absence of overt yield caps, uncertainty will build around just how high bond borrowing rates could go during this inflation storm before knocking over interest rate-sensitive, or 'duration' positioning in equities, commodities and currencies.
For Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategists, the ""magic number"" comes down to relative income for many investors. Its year-end forecast of 1.75% for 10-year Treasury yields puts it above the dividend yield on more than half of S&P500 stocks - compared with 70% of stock yields topping bonds today.

While other metrics on past tipping points put a crunch point much higher, the picture has changed since the last crash in 2008, the BofA team added, and since then average recommended stock allocations have been just 50% with Treasuries above 1.5%.

(Reuters) - A bidding war for Signature Aviation took a new twist on Friday as former Gatwick owner GIP joined forces with Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Bill Gates' investment vehicle on an offer valuing the private jet services firm at $4.73 billion.
Signature said it was recommending the new proposal and had withdrawn its support for a previous offer by GIP, which last month raised its bid to $5.50 per share.
This topped a $5.17 joint offer last month by Blackstone and Signature's top shareholder, Cascade.
The latest offer of $5.62 per share could end a months-long takeover battle for London-listed Signature, which at one point attracted interest from private equity firm Carlyle.
""We await with interest to see whether Carlyle or any other interested party make a higher offer,"" Peel Hunt analysts said. 
The latest cash offer is to buy all of Signature's shares other than the 19.01% owned by Cascade Investment and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. 
Signature's shares were were down 2.7% at 413 pence by 0841 GMT, but still above the new 411 pence ($5.62) offer price. 
Interest from big buyout firms comes as the private jet industry is faring better than commercial airlines as wealthy travellers avoid crowded planes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Signature rejected an initial approach from New York-based GIP in December, saying the price was lower than the proposal outlined by Blackstone.
The stock has jumped nearly 60% since Blackstone's takeover interest was first disclosed in December, which Signature then said was its sixth such proposal.
GIP, which still manages a 49.99% stake in Gatwick, and Blackstone will each own 35% of the Signature bidding consortium, while Cascade will own 30%.

Palihapitiya's SPAC raised $720 million in April 2020 and six months later announced the tie-up with Clover. 
In recent months, the popularity of using SPAC's has exploded among startup companies who want to avoid the more traditional route of using an initial public offering to enter the market.
Clover shares closed down 12.33% at $12.23, the biggest daily percentage drop since Oct. 6. Volume in the session topped 68 million units, by far the most active trading day in the stock's history and well above its 10-day average of about 14.4 million. 
Shares of Clover had fallen 16.8% so far this year before Thursday's tumble. 
In September, Hindenburg issued a report on Nikola Corp calling it an ""intricate fraud built on dozens of lies."" Shares of the electric truck maker have fallen about 35% since the report. 
In a Dec. 15 report, Hindenburg said it remained short on Loop Industries (NASDAQ:LOOP) with a $0 price target. Shares of Loop have climbed nearly 50% since.

An army of retail investors went toe-to-toe with Wall Street professionals last month by buying into stocks that were heavily shorted by hedge funds. In the tussle, some funds had to sell out of their long positions to cover the losses, causing wider falls in stock prices.
""Big client zeitgeist in past two weeks has unambiguously been to buy the FAANMG (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) underperformance,"" said Michael Hartnett, BofA's chief investment strategist.
Big Tech has been one of the biggest winners of the pandemic, with revenues turbocharged by stay-at-home rules and increased interest from investors who are taking advantage of the cheap money available.
Meanwhile, a sudden jump in equity volatility last week also sent investors running for safety with bonds attracting $21.2 billion, the largest in four months. Those fears, however, receded this week with Wall Street's main indexes hitting record highs.
Away from the Wall Street noise, emerging markets stocks have been the top pick among investors as they poured in $5.7 billion in the week to Wednesday, marking inflows in 19 of the past 20 weeks.

The retail trading fever also sent silver surging past $30 an ounce for the first time since 2013 before prices fell back. The precious metal attracted a record $2.8 billion in the week to Wednesday, BofA said.

Germany's DAX index was flat after data showed orders for German-made goods fell more than expected in December, ending a seven-month streak of positive data as restrictions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic dragged down demand from other euro zone countries.
""Today's data shows that stricter lockdown measures since mid-December, as well as the Christmas break, have finally hit German industry ... but at face value, this only looks like a temporary breather,"" strategists at ING wrote in a note.

Car factories around the world are shutting assembly lines because of the chip shortages, which in some cases have been exacerbated by the former Trump administration's actions against Chinese chip companies.
Taiwan, home to tech firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip maker, has become front and centre of efforts to resolve the shortage.
""The U.S. side thanked us for our help on this,"" Wang told reporters of the meeting, which she said was attended by senior executives from companies including TSMC and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.
But she said the focus of the talks was not on auto chips and the issue of whether to prioritise their production was not brought up. 
Wang said TSMC also discussed its planned new $12 billion plant in the U.S. state of Arizona, although she did not give details.
TSMC declined to comment on the meeting. 
The auto chip shortage has affected Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler and other car makers.
The closed-door event, joined by the Taiwan minister and what she described as ""very senior U.S. officials"", is the first announced high-level exchange between Taiwan and the Biden administration, which took office on Jan. 20.
The State Department said last week that Deputy Assistant Secretary for Trade Policy and Negotiations Matt Murray would take part.
The de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan, Brent Christensen, did attend, and was seen getting into his car after the meeting was over.

Despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, the United States is Chinese-claimed Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Friday, helped by strong earnings from the likes of  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) as well as optimism that the worst of the pandemic is over, and hopes that Mario Draghi will be able to steady the ship in Italy, the EU's third-largest economy.
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8%, and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.1%. The FTSE MIB also rose 0.7% as Italy's 10-year yield spread over Germany fell back below 100 basis points.
The euro zone has been hard hit by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the region’s GDP falling by 0.7% in the final quarter of 2020 as governments introduced new restrictions and lockdowns to try to curb the virus. 
More evidence of this slowdown emerged Friday, as German factory orders fell 1.9% in December, a sharp drop from the revised 2.7% gain the previous month.  
Growth in the first quarter of the new year is also likely to be negative, but there is hope ahead. The Bank of England, for example, while keeping its monetary policies unchanged Thursday, said the U.K. economy is heading for a rapid pickup thanks to a bold vaccination effort. Government projections put the country on course to vaccinate every adult by June.
“With Covid-19 cases now declining in certain regions, including the U.S. and the U.K., there will be a glimmer of hope that the worst is now behind us, particularly as the rolling out of vaccinations picks up,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Also helping the tone Friday is the release of more solid earnings data. 
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) stock rose 0.8% after the French bank provided upbeat guidance for 2021, helped by strong trading figures in the fourth quarter of last year. It also announced a dividend payout in May.
 Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) stock rose 2.9% after the French drugmaker said it aimed to grow earnings per share this year after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results.
Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) stock climbed 3.1% after the Danish brewer beat full year net profit expectations, helped by a strong rebound in China, and proposed new stock buybacks. 
Away from Europe, the focus will be on the official U.S. employment report later in Friday’s session, with job growth expected to have rebounded in January as authorities began easing restrictions on businesses.
Oil prices firmed Friday, reaching their highest levels in a year as global stockpiles continue to shrink against a backdrop of output discipline by major producers.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $56.67 a barrel, after touching a high of $56.84, its highest since Jan. 22 last year, and is on track for a weekly gain of nearly 9%, which would be its biggest weekly gain since October.
The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $59.34, after hitting a high of $59.41, its highest since Feb. 20 last year, and on track to rise 6% this week.

Demand dropped 1.9%, damped by investment goods and orders from the euro area. Orders were still up more than 6% from the previous year.
The manufacturing sector has held up better than services in recent months as global supply chains and external demand were less badly affected by the virus than during the first wave of infections in 2020. Restaurants and wide parts of the retail sector are much more directly hit by the latest restrictions, which are set to run at least until the middle of February.
The government in Berlin cut its growth forecast for the year to 3% from 4.4% last month. It agreed this week to further support companies and citizens hit by the fallout from the pandemic, including through the increase of the amount of losses a business can write off against tax.
While the German economy eked out growth of 0.1% in the final three months of last year, it’s headed for a contraction in the first quarter amid the drawn-out curbs on activity. The slow and chaotic start to vaccinations across the euro area is threatening to compound the challenge.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 01:05AM ET</span>","Investors flock to $5 billion Alibaba bond deal, shrug off regulatory woes","By Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd's $5 billion U.S.-dollar bond offering received demand for eight times the debt offered, underscoring global investors' faith in founder Jack Ma's e-commerce behemoth despite a regulatory crackdown on his empire.
Pricing for the deal was set on Friday tighter than initially flagged by the company on Thursday, indicating robust demand to buy the rare debt float. The latest international bond offering is Alibaba's third, according to data from Refinitiv.
Several sovereign wealth funds were among the buyers, along with high profile U.S. long-only funds, a person with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters, adding demand was ""extremely strong"" across the various maturity-tranches.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the oversubscription rate or the nature of its investors.
Investor response to the deal was seen as a sentiment test towards Alibaba amid regulatory heat for billionaire Ma's business empire, triggered by a speech in late October in which he publicly criticised the country's regulatory system.
That set off a chain of events that resulted in the halting of affiliate Ant Group's $37 billion stock market listing. Authorities also launched an antitrust probe into the tech sector, with Alibaba firmly in the crosshairs.
Ma subsequently disappeared from public view for three months.
Alibaba required permission from China's central economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), to issue the bonds, the source said, giving investors confidence the regulators were not cracking down too heavily on the company.
""Ant Group seems to be reaching some kind of progress and Jack Ma was out in public, so there was a sense that the clouds are clearing,"" the source said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. 
The $5 billion was raised in four tranches of 10-, 20-, 30- and 40-year debt. Alibaba decided to tighten pricing by 30 to 40 basis points, double the usual amount from initial pricing for U.S. investment grade bonds, on strong demand, according to the final terms. 
Alibaba had flagged it would use the money to help pay down offshore debt and fund future potential acquisitions and investments in ""complementary businesses"".
""Alibaba does not need cash. It does look like many of the tech companies are trying to take advantage of the low interest-rate environment,"" analyst Mitchell Kim, who publishes on independent investment research network Smartkarma told Reuters.
The 10-year bond raised $1.5 billion and was priced at U.S. 10-year Treasuries plus 100 basis points, while a 20-year tranche, Alibaba's first sustainable bond raised $1 billion at 100 basis points over the benchmark.

A higher proportion of Asian investors bought into this deal than the last time the company issued U.S. dollar debt in 2017, which was dominated by U.S. buyers at that time, the source said.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 01:05AM ET</span>",'The police will visit you': why GameStonk won't come to China,"By Samuel Shen and Tom Westbrook
(Reuters) - In his Hangzhou apartment in eastern China, Wen Hao had just finished his daily stockpicking video when he discovered he'd been barred from social media platform Toutiao, a day after inviting netizens to join his stock-recommending community. 
In a country where trading activities are closely monitored and the internet censored, Wen, 35, reckoned his own blocking showed why the mass buying that sent shares in U.S. videogame retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) more than 2,000% higher over two weeks could never happen in China.
""It's OK if you have one hundred followers,"" said Wen, a self-styled investment adviser who livestreams his stock recommendations everyday via Wechat. ""But if you ask thousands of followers to buy a stock at the same time via social media in China, the police will visit you.""
GameStop's rally grabbed world market headlines for the manner in which swarms of Reddit users took on big short-sellers and hedge funds. 
Efforts to emulate that sort of drama in Asia's idiosyncratic markets have been isolated so far. There was a small-scale online crusade to support Malaysia's heavily shorted glove makers, and calls in South Korea to retain a ban on short-selling.
But such retail cheerleaders have struggled to attract much of a following. China's stock market once had the reputation of being a casino, yet the country's stringent censorship, absence of famous short-sellers and a general tendency to not cross state directives stymie their efforts. 
Dean Li, a blogger on Xueqiu.com, a Reddit-like investor community, said the GameStop saga had demonstrated that ""if a short-seller dares to rashly announce bearish bets against a listed company, it will be in trouble."" But both short-selling and option trading, the key drivers of GameStop's stratospheric rise, are restricted in China, making such a duel impossible, he said. 
Huang Wei, founder of an online investment community that comprises what he calls ""grassroots investors"", said he emphasizes with U.S. retail investors in their ""riot"" against Wall Street short-sellers, but in China, there's no grounds for a retail investor uprising. 
""It's a clash of people's value outlook. It's like farmers uprising against tyranny,"" Huang said.
NO CHE OR MAO 
""There isn't widespread public discontent at the moment.... so you don't see Che Guevara or Mao Zedong in the market,"" Huang said, referring to the charismatic leaders in Cuban and Chinese revolutions. 
The chance of a Chinese equivalent to GameStop emerging has been dimmed further by recent capital market reforms aimed at weeding out weak companies and encouraging long-term investment. Chinese regulators are also cracking down on price manipulation and Internet stock recommendations.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission campaign last September scrutinized illegitimate stock recommendations, also taking aim at ""market black mouths"" who spread misleading information to influence stock prices, as well as ""black apps"", which attract investor clients using chat groups on social media. 
Chinese hedge fund manager Yuan Yuwei said the trading patterns seen in GameStop are not new in China, or Hong Kong, where speculators have talked up stocks in pump-and-dump schemes. 
""The pattern is identical. You drive up share prices and attract followers. And then, you dump your holdings to late comers. The only difference is that you have no or little short positions (in China),"" he said, adding such practices have become much less common in China in recent years. 
Still, Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer equity research at Tellimer, said he expected the retail frenzy to flare up soon in Asia, including China. 

""That could be a perfect storm where you have the use of these Robinhood-type platforms, plus, the spread of internet chat groups, plus, the highly shorted names. That would create a potent cocktail,"" said Tiruchelvam, who identified stocks including China Literature and MTR Corp as potential targets. ""This is actually the beginning of a massive wave of investing behavior along these lines.""

Investing.com –  Kuaishou Technology  (HK:1024), which operates the most popular short-video service in China after ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin, soared 194% in its $5.4 billion Hong Kong Stock Exchange debut.
Shares in the Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.-backed firm were at HK$303.60 ($39.16) by 11:23 PM ET (4:23 AM GMT), after soaring up to HK$345. They opened at HK$338 against the IPO price of $115 and valuing the company at $179 billion.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and China Renaissance acted as joint sponsors of the deal.
The deal was the biggest internet IPO globally since Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc raised $8.1 billion via its U.S. share sale in May 2019, after Kuaishou sold around 365 million shares at the top of its price range.
Bytedance, reportedly in talks to list some of its own assets in Hong Kong, will no doubt be encouraged by its rival’s success. 2020 has been a hard hear for the company, long rumored to be an IPO candidate, after it was labelled a national security threat and banned in the U.S.
“A successful listing by Kuaishou will pave the way for its larger rival. Douyin will be more motivated to come to the market and investors can get better insight into China’s short-video industry with Kuaishou’s regular disclosures going forward,”said Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling.
The company was founded by Su Hua, a former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) employee, and Cheng Yixiao, in 2011, starting life as an app built around sharing animated GIF images. It made the move to short video in 2013, with live streaming following in 2016. The company recorded an average of 264 million daily active users on its main Kuaishou app as of November 2020, according to its prospectus, less than half of Douyin’s 600 million users."

Once the top exporter of nickel, Indonesia stopped nickel shipments last year, in an effort to develop a full nickel supply chain, starting from extraction, then processing into metals and chemicals used in batteries, to meet the demand for electric vehicles (EVs).

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Friday morning, extending gains into a fourth day as investors digested corporate earnings and positive U.S. employment data.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.36% by 9:41 PM ET (2:41AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.65%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.04% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.95%
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.90% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.70%.
Asian shares followed their U.S. counterparts, which saw record highs during the previous session. Ebay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and  PayPal Holdings Inc  . (NASDAQ:PYPL) saw their shares surge on upbeat forecasts, and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares saw gains after raising its service prices in Japan.
Bullish sentiment in U.S. stocks remains on “solid footing” as a rebound in activity and corporate profits as well as accommodative U.S. Federal Reserve policy create a supportive environment for equities, UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) analysts said.
Positive U.S. employment data released on Thursday also boosted investor sentiment. The data said that 779,000 initial jobless claims were filed over the past week, fewer than the 830,000 claims predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 812,000 claims reported during the previous week. Further jobs data, including non-farm payrolls, is due later in the day.
“We certainly seem to have shifted our focus back to fundamentals ...the virus news is getting incrementally better at the very same time that the earnings season and economic data seem to be showing some improvement. Markets are actually focusing on what we’re supposed to be focused on and less concerned about the machinations of getting fiscal policy out and what’s going on in Reddit-land,” National Securities Corp. chief market strategist Arthur Hogan told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile,  GameStop Corp  . (NYSE:GME) shares tumbled for a second day, with the weekly drop exceeding 80% as retail traders flocked to new targets, including small drug developers. The market volatility seen during the previous week, driven by social media forum Reddit, has calmed down but investors are fearful of a second round, this time in Asia.
One country under scrutiny is South Korea, with investors worried that the country’s COVID-19-induced ban on short-selling has artificially propped up the country’s recent stock market rally. The ban, the world’s longest such measure, was extended earlier in the week thanks to pressure from retail investors. However, worries remain that the move could backfire.
Other countries have started lifting similar restrictions, with Indonesia due to lift its ban later in the month. France, which introduced a ban in early 2020, lifted it after only a few months."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Thursday more than doubled the amount of money it plans to invest on electric and autonomous vehicles, to $29 billion, even as it posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.8 billion.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said the global semiconductor chip shortage could lead to a 10% to 20% loss in first-quarter production, resulting in a potential hit to operating earnings of $1 billion to $2.5 billion. But its shares gained 1.5% in after-hours trading as the fourth-quarter operating results and 2021 profit forecast were above Wall Street's expectations.
""If EVs continue to quickly gain favor, especially with commercial customers, we want to be clear that we will not cede ground to anyone,"" Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters on a conference call. 
Ford said it was ""doubling down"" on connected electric vehicles and said it will invest $22 billion in electrification through 2025, nearly twice what it had previously committed to EVs. Ford also said it would invest $7 billion in self-driving, or autonomous, technology development over 10 years through 2025 – $5 billion of that from 2021 forward.
""We are accelerating all our plans,"" Chief Executive Jim Farley said, including increasing battery capacity and adding more electric vehicles in its future portfolio. 
He said on a conference call with analysts that the $22 billion investment does not include potential investment in battery production, whether through at Ford itself or via a joint venture. He added that Ford will have more announcements soon around its EV partnerships.
Farley told Reuters last fall Ford was considering making its own battery cells as sales volumes of electric vehicles rise globally.
Ford previously committed to invest $11.5 billion in electrification, including gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, through 2022. That included the launch of the Mustang Mach-E EV crossover, and electric versions of the F-150 pickup and Transit van. 
A Ford spokesman said the $22 billion includes hybrid vehicles, but the commitment is ""overwhelmingly"" on EVs.
U.S. rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has said it will spend $27 billion by 2023 on electric and autonomous vehicles, a total that does not include hybrids. It said it plans to offer 30 EVs globally by 2025 and is targeting topping annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025.
Asked whether Ford would match GM's announcement that it aspires to stop selling gasoline-powered light vehicles by 2035, Lawler told reporters Ford is focused on selling high-volume EVs now, a possible reference to GM's initial EV product launches being lower-volume, higher priced models. 
For 2020, Ford reported a net loss of $1.3 billion. It had previously said it expected a full-year profit of between $600 million and $1.1 billion.
Ford had a loss in the fourth quarter of $2.8 billion, or 70 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.7 billion, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter included several previously disclosed charges related to a recall, remeasurement of pensions and the closure of the company's Brazilian manufacturing operations.
Excluding the charges, Ford's operating profit was 34 cents a share, easily topping the 7-cent loss analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based company projected operating earnings would climb to $8 billion to $9 billion in 2021, compared with $2.8 billion last year.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy said in a research note the forecast was above Wall Street consensus expectations for $6.9 billion.
The forecast includes a $900 million non-cash gain on Rivian, the electric vehicle startup in which Ford has invested, but does not include the effect of the ongoing global semiconductor shortage. Farley said the Rivian investment was strategic despite Ford previously shelving a vehicle based on a Rivian platform. 
In COVID-19 pandemic-ravaged 2020, Ford's total revenue fell to $127 billion, from $156 billion in 2019. 
Ford ended the quarter with nearly $31 billion in cash and $47 billion of liquidity, compared with almost $30 billion and more than $45 billion respectively in the prior quarter.

Its operating margin in the fourth quarter was 4.8%, compared with a full-year target of 8%.

(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), owner of popular photo-messaging app Snapchat, on Thursday warned that upcoming privacy changes by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) could hurt Snap's ad business although user growth and revenue beat analysts' fourth-quarter estimates.
Snap stock fell 7% to $54.02 after the bell.
Apple's planned changes, to ask iPhone users for consent to track their data for personalized ads, could present a ""risk"" to advertiser demand, Snap said, but added it was unclear how that could affect business in the long-run.
""The disruption to ad targeting caused by the iOS 14 privacy changes will clearly be a worry for Snap, which has been steadily growing its armory of ad formats and advertisers,"" said Tom Johnson, chief transformation officer at ad agency Mindshare Worldwide.
Snap's larger tech rival  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) has been waging a public fight against Apple's changes, accusing the iPhone maker of anticompetitive behavior and hurting the social media company's ad-targeting business.
During an earnings call with analysts, Snap Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman struck a different tone, saying that Snap shares Apple's philosophy on protecting users' privacy. 
""We admire Apple and believe they are trying to do the right thing for customers,"" Gorman said, adding Snap is well prepared to guide advertisers through the iOS changes.
Snap's daily active users (DAUs), a metric watched by investors and advertisers, rose 22% year-over-year to 265 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts had expected 258 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The app made the biggest gains outside North America and Europe, with 55% growth in daily active users.
Revenue, which Snap generates mainly from ad sales, grew 62% to $911 million, easily beating Wall Street's consensus estimate of $857.4 million.
Advertisers have been drawn to Snap's young audience, and it has developed features that appeal to marketers, including Snap Map, which lets users find local businesses near them.
Snap's net loss narrowed to $113 million, or 8 cents per share, from $240.7 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier.

The company forecast first-quarter daily active users would grow 20% year over year to 275 million, and revenue of $720 million to $740 million.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 06:55PM ET</span>",High levels of toxic heavy metals found in some baby food: U.S. report,"By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional investigators found ""dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals"" in certain baby foods that could cause neurological damage, a House Oversight subcommittee said in a report released on Thursday in calling for new standards and testing requirements.
The panel examined products made by Nurture Inc, Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) Group Inc, Beech-Nut Nutrition and Gerber, a unit of Nestle, it said, adding that it was ""greatly concerned"" that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) Co and Sprout Organic Foods refused to cooperate with the investigation. The U.S. baby food market was worth an estimated $8 billion in 2020, according to Euromonitor.
The report said internal company standards ""permit dangerously high levels of toxic heavy metals, and documents revealed that the manufacturers have often sold foods that exceeded those levels.""
The report urged U.S. regulators to set maximum levels of toxic heavy metals permitted in baby foods and require manufacturers to test finished products for heavy metals, not just ingredients, while baby food companies said they were working to reducing levels of metals that occur naturally in food products.
Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat who chairs the panel that released the report, said it found ""these manufacturers knowingly sell baby food containing high levels of toxic heavy metals ... It’s time that we develop much better standards for the sake of future generations.""
A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) spokesman said the agency was reviewing the report.
The agency noted toxic elements are present in the environment and enter the food supply through soil, water or air. ""Because they cannot be completely removed, our goal is to reduce exposure to toxic elements in foods to the greatest extent feasible,"" the FDA said. 
Campbell said in a statement on its website that its products are safe and cited the lack of a current FDA standard for heavy metals in baby food. The market's sixth biggest brand said it thought it had been ""full partners"" in the study with congressional researchers.
Walmart said it submitted information to the committee in February 2020 and never received any subsequent inquiries. The retail giant requires private label product suppliers to hew to its own internal specifications, ""which for baby and toddler food means the levels must meet or fall below the limits established by the FDA.""
Happy Family Organics said it was ""disappointed at the many inaccuracies, select data usage and tone bias in this report. We can say with the utmost confidence that all Happy Family Organics products are safe for babies and toddlers to enjoy."" It added it welcomes ""additional guidelines from the FDA.""
Hain Celestial - the baby food market's No.4. player which makes Earth's Best - said the ""report examined outdated data and does not reflect our current practices"" and said it ""inaccurately characterized a meeting with the FDA.""
Hain added since then it ""took several steps to reduce the levels of heavy metals in our finished products – including no longer using brown rice in our products that are primarily rice based, changing other ingredients and conducting additional testing of finished product before shipping."" 
A representative from Gerber - which sells about a fifth of all baby food in the United States - said the elements in question occur naturally in the soil and water in which crops are grown and added it takes multiple steps ""to minimize their presence.""
Beech-Nut Nutrition said it was reviewing the report and is working with other companies ""on science-based standards that food suppliers can implement across our industry.""
The report was critical also of the administration of former President Donald Trump, saying it ""ignored a secret industry presentation to federal regulators revealing increased risks of toxic heavy metals in baby foods.""
The report said ""in 100% of the Hain baby foods tested, inorganic arsenic levels were higher in the finished baby food than the company estimated they would be based on individual ingredient testing.""
It said that in August 2019 the FDA received a secret slide presentation from Hain that said ""corporate policies to test only ingredients, not final products, underrepresent the levels of toxic heavy metals in baby foods.""
The report said the FDA took no new action in response. ""To this day, baby foods containing toxic heavy metals bear no label or warning to parents. Manufacturers are free to test only ingredients, or, for the vast majority of baby foods, to conduct no testing at all,"" the report said.
The FDA has declared that inorganic arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury are dangerous, particularly to infants and children, the report noted.
The FDA in August finalized guidance to industry, setting an action level of 100 parts per billion inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal.

""We acknowledge that there is more work to be done, but the FDA reiterates its strong commitment to continue to reduce consumer exposure to toxic elements and other contaminants from food,"" the FDA said Thursday.

(Reuters) -  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) on Thursday forecast its 2021 results above Wall Street estimates after posting a 26% rise in fourth-quarter 2020 revenue, driven by sales of its antiviral drug, remdesivir, which is used to treat COVID-19 patients.
Shares of Gilead were up 2.5% in extended trading. 
Gilead said the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect its sales, including its treatments for hepatitis C and HIV, due to fewer people going to their doctors. It expects a gradual recovery in underlying market dynamics starting the second quarter of this year.
Remdesivir, which is sold under the brand name Veklury, brought in $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, above analysts' estimates of $1.34 billion. Excluding Veklury, Gilead said its quarterly sales fell 7%.
The company said remdesivir continues to be a critical tool during the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting 2021 sales of up to $3 billion for the drug.
Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said that unlike current COVID-19 vaccines and some other drugs, remdesivir does not target the spike proteins of the coronavirus, which are altered in some recently-identified, more transmissible variants of the virus.
""We have not so far seen mutations that would impact the efficacy of remdesivir,"" he said during a conference call.
Gilead said it continues to work on an inhaled version of the COVID-19 drug - which is given intravenously to hospitalized patients - but more clinical study is required.
For 2021, the California-based company projected an adjusted earnings range with a midpoint of $7.10 per share, on product sales with a midpoint of $24.4 billion, ahead of respective Wall Street estimates of $6.85 per share and $24.27 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
""We think the $7 number is higher than where investors were looking for and provides a good base to continue to grow,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said in an email.
He said Gilead projected 2021 operating expenses at less than analysts have estimated. 

The company's fourth-quarter revenue totaled $7.42 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $7.33 billion. Adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.19 were ahead of Wall Street expectations of $2.15 per share.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp is expected to extend earnings recovery when it reports third quarter results on Monday as frothy markets drive a rally in the value of its tech investment portfolio and offer fertile ground for listings.
The Japanese conglomerate is seen posting a net profit of 171 billion yen ($1.63 billion) in the October-December quarter, according to an average estimate of four analysts polled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. 
That compares with net profit attributable to shareholders of 55 billion yen in the same period a year earlier, when operating profit was almost wiped out as the $100 billion Vision Fund plunged to a loss on investments like office sharing firm WeWork.
Monday will see ""a lot of talk about how Vision Fund is back,"" said Kirk Boodry, analyst at Redex Research. 
SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son dropped the operating profit measure in the first quarter as the benchmark for success, pointing instead to the value of the group's assets, which the company put at 14,528 yen per share on October 1.
The conglomerate's shares hit a two decade high of 8,946 yen last month amid a rally in tech shares like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and a surge in equity raising. 
Vision Fund-backed food delivery app operator Doordash and home selling platform Opendoor went public in December, with the latter listing via a blank cheque vehicle backed by investor Chamath Palihapitiya.
SoftBank also aims to ride the mania for special purpose investment companies (SPACs), which are seeing record activity, to raise funds using its own SPAC vehicles.
SVF Investment Corp, backed by Vision Fund's managers, raised $604 million and is trading a third above its IPO price, with a second SPAC headed by group Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure aiming to raise $200 million.
Even WeWork is in talks to go public via a SPAC deal, a source has said. SoftBank owns most of the startup's shares following a bailout but its earnings are not consolidated and there is little disclosure of financials.
Investors will also be eyeing the performance of new trading unit SB Northstar, which has been placing SoftBank's growing cash reserves in public stocks but reported derivative losses last quarter. 
SoftBank's ""very aggressive growth strategy and financial policy"" means it ""may change very quickly so we need to monitor the company very closely,"" said S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings analyst Hiroyuki Nishikawa. 
Company executives are trying to diversify the group's holdings beyond Son's most successful investment,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, which dominates the portfolio.
Alibaba's shares have fallen 17% from October highs after Chinese regulators halted the bumper IPO of its fintech affiliate Ant.

1156,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 06:09PM ET</span>",Debt-Laden Oil Majors in Retreat Mode Even as Crude Rallies,"(Bloomberg) -- The wreckage of 2020 still looms large in the boardrooms of Big Oil as executives this week laid out deep spending cuts and plans to repay stubbornly-high debt even as crude rallies to the highest in more than a year.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc on Thursday added itself to the growing list of supermajors to post disappointing fourth quarter results. Like many of its peers, the Anglo-Dutch company reported weak cash flow and net income that fell short of expectations.
The earnings came as an unpleasant surprise to investors that had been expecting a tailwind after crude recovered from last year’s historic lows. But with Covid-19 lockdowns still depressing fuel sales and refining margins, the industry’s focus is on playing defense rather than on taking advantage of a rally that’s pushing Brent crude toward $60 a barrel.
Big Oil’s performance is still “reflecting the worst of Covid-19,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) analyst Christyan Malek. “Cash flows generated in the fourth quarter are a low point,” but should improve this year, he said.
The supermajors were forced to take on large amounts of debt to survive last year’s unprecedented slump in oil demand, and now the bill is coming due. They’re relying on assets sales and cuts to jobs and investment to repay borrowings and keep up with dividends, the cornerstone of their investment case.
The consequence is likely to be lower oil and natural gas production in coming years.
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has all but abandoned its counter-cyclical growth strategy. It’s reduced capital expenditure to a record low this year, and plans to cut some $50 billion from its planned spending over the next five years. Sounding chastened, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said he will “make adjustments to our capital program depending on market conditions” and prioritize debt repayment.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX).’s capital spending is at the lowest in at least a decade and less than half 2014 levels. The California-based company is unwilling to resume its previous spending plans in the Permian shale basin, its key growth asset, until the effects of the pandemic are behind it. BP (NYSE:BP) Plc’s planned $13 billion capital expenditure for 2021 is already at the lowest end of its budgeted range.
Still, investors got some good news. Shell reiterated its commitment to grow its dividend, with a 4% hike promised for the first quarter. Exxon pledged to maintain the S&P 500 Index’s third-largest payout payout even after making its first annual loss in four decades.
But still the pair bled cash. Neither company generated enough cash from operations to cover capital expenditures and payments to shareholders in the fourth quarter.
Earnings season isn’t over. France’s Total SE and Italy’s Eni SpA will publish results in the coming two weeks.
The French energy giant in particular has so far weathered the crisis so far better than its peers, having managed to preserve its dividend, expand oil and gas output and make the greatest inroads into clean energy, an area all the European majors have committed to growing.
And with crude prices rising the outlook is more positive.
“The only thing in their favor this quarter are oil and gas prices,” said JPMorgan’s Malek. The industry still has problems to overcome in refining and fuel marketing, but the “positive tailwinds” from prices should help improve cash flow.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 06:05PM ET</span>","In GameStop saga, U.S. regulator examining all aspects and parties: sources","By Chris Prentice and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking at every aspect of and parties involved in the ""Reddit rally"" of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other stocks, said two people familiar with the matter, suggesting a swath of industry participants may be swept up in the regulator's review of the trading frenzy.
The people added that the furious surge in shares of GameStop, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings and other stocks contained familiar patterns, in that it involves users of online platforms hyping up stocks – something seen in the past on bulletin boards and social media platforms. 
However, manipulation cases can be complex and may rely on more than simply language posted on a message board, they said. 
Thousands of Reddit users trading on low-cost retail platforms including Robinhood banded together to drive up the prices of GameStop and other ""meme"" stocks, squeezing hedge funds that had taken short positions, or bets against those shares.
The resulting volatility triggered massive margin calls from post-trade ""clearing"" houses that guarantee stock trades, prompting several retail brokers to suspend buying in the affected securities. The Reddit effect then appeared to spread into the silver market last week.
Several U.S. lawmakers expressed outrage at trading limits on individual investors, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened a meeting of market regulators.
On Monday, acting SEC chair Allison Herren Lee told National Public Radio the agency was examining the conduct of retail brokers, potential market manipulation, the role of hedge funds that bet against the companies, and whether the companies tried to exploit the rally by raising money.
In recent days, questions have grown around the arrangements retail brokers have with market making firms to which they route orders; the role of the clearing houses; and whether some hedge funds jumped on the Reddit bandwagon and bought up GameStop to amplify their rivals' pain. 
GameStop and other Reddit rally stocks have since dropped sharply, with GameStop down 38% on Thursday.
BEYOND THE HYPE
Proving manipulation may be tough due to ambiguous U.S. securities laws, said Joseph Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law and a former SEC commissioner.
""The law governing market manipulation is almost as chaotic as the trading in GameStop shares,"" he said.  
Still, the episode is not entirely novel territory. In 2000, the SEC charged individuals in two separate ""pump-and-dump"" schemes that used internet message boards to drive up stocks. In December, it sued a former day trader who profited from spreading false rumors about public companies in online forums.
The SEC would look beyond generalized hype for users who disseminated false or misleading information about material company issues, such as revenues and products, or coordinated efforts to force buying or selling, said lawyers.
""I think the existing SEC playbook still functions fairly well,"" said Philip Moustakis, counsel at Seward & Kissel and a former SEC senior enforcement counsel. If the trading was driven by a decentralized crowd with no organizers, that could pose challenges, he continued. ""They might have to rely on a more novel theory of market manipulation.""
The SEC will likely also probe whether hedge funds properly disclosed risky bets to clients and allowed some clients to cash out before others, said Ken C. Joseph, a managing director at Duff & Phelps LLC and former SEC official.
Broker trading restrictions will also raise questions over fair access to markets, said Robert Frenchman, an attorney with Mukasey Frenchman & Sklaroff. 
""Fair access to markets has long been a regulatory priority,"" he added. 

Robinhood has said its decision to suspend trading in some shares was purely a risk management decision and that it is committed to its customers.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose more than 1% on Thursday and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted record closing highs after another batch of upbeat earnings and data suggesting the labor market may be stabilizing.
The Dow and S&P 500 rose for a fourth straight day, with investor hopes of further progress on a pandemic-relief package also boosting the market. Democrats in the U.S. Senate were poised to take a first step toward the ultimate passage of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief proposal.
On the economic front, the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits decreased further last week, according to the Labor Department's report. 
The economic data, earnings news and $1.9 trillion stimulus package talks are all ""good for Wall Street,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago. ""That's why we're seeing the market continue to rally."" 
Stronger-than-expected results so far in the fourth quarter have driven up analysts' expectations, and S&P 500 companies are now on track to post earnings growth for the quarter instead of a decline as initially expected.
A pandemic-driven surge in online shopping during the holiday season helped e-commerce firm eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and payment platform  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) top quarterly earnings estimates. PayPal shares rose 7.4% and eBay gained 5.3%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 332.26 points, or 1.08%, to 31,055.86, the S&P 500 gained 41.57 points, or 1.09%, to 3,871.74 and the Nasdaq Composite added 167.20 points, or 1.23%, to 13,777.74.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index also registered an all-time closing high, while the Cboe Volatility index - Wall Street's fear gauge - extended recent losses and closed at its lowest level in two weeks. 
The major indexes have bounced back sharply this week also as a recent buying frenzy driven by social media appeared to stall following a bout of market volatility last week.
Shares of videogame retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other recent favorites of retail investors fell again on Thursday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that she and financial market regulators needed to ""understand deeply"" what happened in the recent retail trading frenzy before taking any action. GameStop shares ended down 42.1%.
Investors will be watching closely the U.S. government's monthly employment report due out Friday. 
According to a Reuters poll of economists, payrolls likely increased by 50,000 jobs in January after declining by 140,000 in December.
Volume was down from last week's levels. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.09 billion shares on Thursday, compared with the 15.5 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.78-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 241 new highs and 2 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told Reuters on Thursday there are ""very active"" conversations between the White House, Congress and stakeholders about including assistance to the struggling transportation sector, which has sought more than $130 billion in a COVID-19 relief bill. 
President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion proposal includes only $20 billion for public transit systems. 
Airline unions are seeking $15 billion in payroll assistance while bus and ferry companies want $40 billion, state transportation departments have asked for $18 billion, Amtrak wants $1.5 billion, airports want $17 billion and public transit has asked for $39.3 billion.
""They should be all taken seriously because this is about making sure we get the transportation sector back on its feet,"" Buttigieg said in a phone interview. ""Just about everybody needs help getting back to pre-COVID levels.""
Buttigieg referred to Biden's $20 billion transit proposal as the ""initial conversations but those conversations are ongoing because we do want to make sure we're supporting a robust return for the sector and supporting workers."" 
Democratic leaders in Congress are likely to back $14 billion to extend the airline payroll support program for six months which would keep nearly 30,000 airline workers after the existing program expires on March 30 as well as additional funding for the sector, congressional aides and industry officials say.
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA representing workers at 17 airlines, confirmed at a House Transportation and Infrastructure hearing on Thursday that $14 billion was being discussed for airlines and $1 billion for contractors.
""Congress has to come up with more funds to support these workers,"" Nelson said. ""It is urgent that we get this done.""
Asked if Biden supports new airline assistance, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday, ""the priorities of the president are already in the bill,"" but added it could change as Congress debates it.
House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio referenced Psaki's comments and said he has been ""very vocal"" about the need for new funding for airline workers, transit, private bus companies, contractors and others.
""Congress is an independent entity so we are going to accomplish (Biden's) goals and some of our own,"" DeFazio added.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) on Wednesday said 13,000 employees are at risk of furlough starting on April 1; United Airlines sent new furlough warnings to 14,000 employees.
Congress previously approved $40 billion in two rounds of prior payroll support.

Buttigieg said government needs to rebuild the transportation sector post-COVID-19 ""with an eye to the future because every form of travel is evolving and the 2020s specifically I think will be a decade that has some of the swiftest changes and transformations that we've seen really in modern times.""

Investing.com - Peloton reported Thursday raised its annual forecast after reporting better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, but struggles to keep up with demand amid supply chain constraints overshadowed the upbeat results.   
 Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) was down more 5% in after-market trading.
The company guided fiscal-third quarter revenue of $1.10 billion and expected to add 1.98 million connected fitness subscribers. The revised annual forecast anticipates slow but steady progress in narrowing PTON's order-to-delivery windows over the remainder of the fiscal year.
For fiscal 2021, the company sees sales of between $4.075 billion from the $3.90 billion.  
""Our revised forecast anticipates slow but steady progress in narrowing our order-to-delivery windows over the remainder of the fiscal year,"" the company said.

(Reuters) - Electronic voting systems maker Smartmatic on Thursday sued Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News cable network and Rudolph Giuliani, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump, claiming they falsely accused the company of helping to rig the U.S. presidential election in favor of Joe Biden.
The defamation suit, filed in New York County Supreme Court, also names as defendants former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, Fox Corp and Fox hosts Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro.
Smartmatic alleged Fox and other defendants invented a story that the election was stolen from Trump and made Smartmatic “the villain in their story."" 
“Fox News used the story to preserve its grip on viewers and readers and curry favors with the outgoing administration,"" the lawsuit said. 
The suit seeks more than $2.7 billion in compensatory and punitive damages. Smartmatic also asks for defendants to retract false statements.
“Fox News Media is committed to providing the full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear opinion,"" a Fox News Media spokesperson said in a statement. ""We are proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend this meritless lawsuit in court.”
Dobbs referred questions to Fox News for comment, as did a representative for Bartiromo. The other defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Florida-based Smartmatic's technology was only used in one place for the Nov. 3 presidential election - Los Angeles County, which Biden won.
""This is a first step in trying to recover our reputation and trying to set the record straight,"" said Smartmatic Chief Executive Antonio Mugica in an interview. 
After the election, Trump and some of his supporters spread false claims of election fraud, including that Smartmatic and competitor Dominion Voting Systems manipulated the results. 
Smartmatic in December demanded Fox News retract allegations leveled by its employees and guests, but Fox did not comply. 
Instead the network aired an interview on the three hosts' programs with an outside expert who said there was no evidence to support the Smartmatic claims by Fox hosts and guests. 
Dominion Voting Systems has filed similar lawsuits against Giuliani and Powell. 

Recovering over $2.7 billion in damages will be difficult, said George Washington University Law School professor Roger Schechter. Smartmatic will need to back up its claims of future earnings and harm to that potential. “There’s two contingencies heaped on each other here,"" he said.

Shares of the company jumped nearly 10% in extended trading as its first-quarter sales growth forecast of a rise in the low 70% range also beat Wall Street expectations of 56% growth.

The shift to virtual interactions has also increased engagement on social media platforms, with Pinterest's monthly active users jumping 37% to 459 million in the fourth quarter.
""We welcomed over 100 million additional monthly active users to Pinterest in 2020, more than any other year in our history,"" Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Ben Silbermann said in a statement.

1166,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 04:14PM ET</span>","Jobs Report, Consumer Credit, Stimulus: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks rose for a third day on Thursday as lawmakers moved ahead on President Joe Biden’s stimulus plan.
Improving economic data lifted Wall Street’s bullish mood after better than expected numbers on jobless claims. First-time claims fell last week and were lower than estimates.
That sets up expectations for Friday’s critical nonfarm jobs report from the government, always a barometer of economic health. The good news and a speedier rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, helped push bond yields higher, with the difference between short and long-term Treasury yields at their widest in five years.
Banks benefited, because higher yields allows them to make more money off loan products. But the technology sector also notched gains after PayPal and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) had positive earnings surprises. 
So-called meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) fell as the Robinhood crowd’s short squeeze from last month petered out.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. January’s Nonfarm payroll report
Has the economy improved since December? There’s reason for optimism, according to the estimate for Friday’s nonfarm jobs report from the government. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release numbers at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Analysts are expecting 50,000 jobs were added last month after dropping 140,000 in December. 
2. A reading on consumer credit
The consumer credit reading for December will be released at  3:00 PM ET and is expected to be $12 billion, down from $15.7 billion in November. That dip might be in line with the jobs report, which showed attrition in employment going into the holiday season.
The November report was a positive surprise as consumers continued to tap sources of credit like auto and student loans, but not their credit cards. 
3. Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus
Looks like Democrats are ditching the bi-partisan spirit and forging ahead with their $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Investors don’t hate the idea, as the stock market has shown gains this week while lawmakers maneuver on Capitol Hill.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs Thursday, as tech and cyclical stocks racked up gains as investors bet on the economy charting a faster recovery amid an improving backdrop.
The S&P 500 jumped 1.07% to a record 3,871.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.08%, or 332 points, and the Nasdaq Composite ended 1.23% at a record high.
Initial jobless claims fell 33,000 to 779,000 in the week ending Jan. 23, beating economists' estimates for a smaller decline to 830,00. That marked the third consecutive week of declines as well as the lowest level since the end of November.
""The third consecutive week of decline, while still elevated, the ongoing improvement in claims suggests layoffs have slowed, a positive sign for the labor market as well as the broad-based recovery effort,"" Stifel said in a note.
The upbeat labor market data added credence to investor bets that the job gains rebounded last month after falling in December.
""Following a 140,000 decline in December, we forecast a solid 250,000 increase in January nonfarm payroll employment with a 290,000 increase for private employers and a 40,000 decline in government payrolls,"" Nomura said.  
""We expect food services employment to increase in January after falling sharply in December, but look for further moderation in employment growth for other industries that have been less affected by the pandemic,"" it added.

PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) rallied more than 6% after beating quarterly estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The payments processor has seen its market cap rise above $300 billion for the first time.
Align (NASDAQ:ALGN) Technology jumped to record high, up more than 12%, after reporting quarterly profit and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, was up more than 2% on reports that it had tapped Hyundai to support its push into the electric vehicle market. The Apple Car could make its debut on the road in 2025, according to media reports.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which both reported markedly better-than-expected quarterly results earlier this week, were roughly flat on the day.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 03:26PM ET</span>",Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier to retire at the end of June,"By Manas Mishra and Michael Erman
(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Thursday Kenneth Frazier, one of only a handful of Black executives leading major U.S. companies, will step down as chief executive officer at the end of June and be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis. 
Frazier, 66, will not be handing over the reins completely, at least for now. He will remain with the drugmaker as executive chairman for a transition period.
Frazier was one of only five Black CEOs in last year's Fortune 500 list, released in June 2020. That number has dropped even lower since then, as TIAA CEO Roger Ferguson, Jr. will also retire in March. 
However, joining the ranks, Rosalind Brewer, who was previously Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)' Chief Operating Officer, is set to become CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc in March.
The dearth of Black CEOs at top American companies comes as corporate boards are being pressured to focus on improve their diversity, particularly among their companies' leadership.
He was set to retire in 2019, but the company scrapped a policy requiring its CEO to retire at the age of 65.
Davis will inherit a company with one of the world's best selling drugs in its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda and a tightened focus after it completes the spinoff of its slower growing women's health, biosimilar drugs and older products later this year.
Frazier joined Merck nearly 30 years ago and climbed the ranks, becoming CEO of the Fortune 500 company in 2011. He made his name at Merck as general counsel by steering the company safely through daunting litigation over Vioxx. He also played a significant role in Merck’s 2009 acquisition of U.S. drugmaker Schering-Plough, which then held Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, as a pipeline asset.
""That deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were,"" he said. ""None of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab.""
Under Frazier's leadership, Keytruda has eclipsed Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb’s cancer immunotherapies, which hit the market first. Keytruda's sales topped $14 billion last year.
Shares of the company more than doubled over his tenure.
Frazier, the grandson of a sharecropper, made headlines in 2017 when he became the first business leader to leave former U.S. President Donald Trump's manufacturing council following Trump's comments on a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""His shoes won't be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to important issues facing society today,"" Davis said on a post-earnings conference call. 
Frazier's transition follows the recent retirement of Roger Perlmutter, who ran the company's research and development division for much of Frazier's tenure and was also considered a major force behind the success of Keytruda. Dean Li took over for Perlmutter on Jan. 1.
Davis has been CFO since 2014 and in charge of the company's business development, real estate and other corporate strategic functions since 2016. 
A career healthcare executive, he was the president of Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX)'s medical products business before joining Merck, and also spent 14 years at Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co. 
Citi analyst Andrew Baum said the elevation of Davis suggests the company will work to reduce its dependency on Keytruda.
The company also reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.32 per share that missed analysts' estimates of $1.38 per share on lower-than-expected sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet. 

It forecast a better-than-expected profit in 2021, although it said the COVID-19 pandemic would hurt sales of certain drugs, especially vaccines.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 02:55PM ET</span>","Canada's Trudeau says airlines will survive, Atlantic region frets about route cuts","By Steve Scherer and David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday insisted Ottawa would ensure airlines survived the COVID-19 pandemic even as industry advocates said that without a promised aid package many routes would die, crippling the economy.
Air travel is critical for Canada, the second largest country by area and one which stretches across six time zones. For many communities, flights are the only reliable option.
The government and major airlines such as Air Canada and WestJet have been in talks for months about an aid package but insiders say the negotiations are going slowly.
""Canada needs and will have a vibrant competitive airline industry after this is all done. That is one of our fundamental understandings,"" Trudeau told Reuters in a phone interview.
""We're having great discussions with them (the airlines), we're continuing to, but we're just needing to make sure that the package is right for Canadians, right for the industry and right for the future.""
Air Canada has slashed bases and routes, particularly in the Atlantic region, prompting fears about the impact if the services do not return.
The head of the Business Council of Canada and the Unifor trade union issued an open appeal to Trudeau on Thursday, saying it was ""both baffling and tragic"" that Ottawa had not yet come up with an aid package.
""Without government assistance, a vital part of Canada's national strategic infrastructure will suffer serious damage,' they said.
Trudeau said there had already been ""massive disruptions"" to service in Atlantic Canada and said Ottawa's priority was to ensure regional routes were restored.
Atlantic Canada covers almost 195,000 square miles (500,000 sq km) with a population of just 2.3 million people. Air Canada alone has shut down six bases and scrapped 17 routes in the region.
Residents in Halifax, the largest city in the region, and one which has lost six Air Canada routes, urged Trudeau and the government to ensure the connections survived.

Most of the cut routes and bases are in parliamentary constituencies held by Trudeau's Liberal Party, which has 26 of the region's 32 seats in the House of Commons.
If routes do not come back and he is blamed, it could pose a political risk in an election that many insiders predict will come later this year.

Margaret Brigley, chief executive officer of Halifax pollster Narrative Research, said the issue was not in the headlines for the time being because no one was traveling. The firm's most recent polling showed the Liberals still had a commanding lead in the region, she said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 rallied to near all-time highs Thursday, led by tech and cyclical stocks like banks as investors bet on the economy charting a faster recovery amid an improving backdrop.
The S&P 500 was up 0.86% to $3,863.16, near the all-time high of 3,870.9. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.84%, or 257 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.91%.
Initial jobless claims fell 33,000 to 779,000 in the week ending Jan. 23, beating economists' estimates for a smaller decline to 830,00. That marked the third consecutive week of declines as well as the lowest level since the end of November.
""The third consecutive week of decline, while still elevated, the ongoing improvement in claims suggests layoffs have slowed, a positive sign for the labor market as well as the broad-based recovery effort,"" Stifel said in a note.
The upbeat labor market data added credence to investor bets that the job gains rebounded last month after falling in December.
""Following a 140,000 decline in December, we forecast a solid 250,000 increase in January nonfarm payroll employment with a 290,000 increase for private employers and a 40,000 decline in government payrolls,"" Nomura said.  
""We expect food services employment to increase in January after falling sharply in December, but look for further moderation in employment growth for other industries that have been less affected by the pandemic,"" it added.
The signs of an improving economy coupled with expectations for speedier vaccine rollout in the months ahead have pushed U.S. Treasury yields higher, widening the 5-to-30 year treasury curve – a gauge on the health of the economy  – by the most since March 2016.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) were up more than 2%.
Technology was not far behind after giving up its gains late into the close Thursday as earnings continued to surprise to the upside.
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) rallied more than 6% after beating quarterly estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The payments processor has seen its market cap rise above $300 billion for the first time.
Align (NASDAQ:ALGN) Technology jumped to record high, up 13%, after reporting quarterly profit and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, was up more than 2% on reports that it had tapped Hyundai to support its push into the electric vehicle market. The Apple Car could make its debut on the road in 2025, according to media reports.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon, which both reported markedly better-than-expected quarterly results earlier this week, were roughly flat on the day.  
The retail-led short-squeeze trade in AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop continued to run out of steam, with both stocks down 19% and 35%,, respectively."

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 01:31PM ET</span>",Union leader says U.S. domestic testing requirements could bankrupt airlines,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top aviation union leader warned on Thursday that mandatory COVID-19 testing requirements for travelers boarding U.S. domestic flights could devastate the airline industry and potentially lead to bankruptcies among airlines.
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA representing workers at 17 airlines, asked at a U.S. House of Representatives committee hearing why airlines and not other transit modes were being singled out.
""Isolating the airline industry and not doing the same thing for mass transit or doing this at grocery stores or restaurants doesn't make any sense,"" she told the transportation and infrastructure committee.
U.S. government-required testing before domestic flights could lead to ""airline bankruptcies. That is how devastating it could be,"" she said.
Representative Peter DeFazio, the Democrat who chairs the committee, said such testing would require at least a 50% increase in current daily COVID-19 testing.
""I question whether this would be effective,"" DeFazio said. He also asked if a testing mandate would need to be extended to other travel modes like buses, trains and interstate trucking and personal vehicle travel.
The federal government has been mulling additional measures to fight the spread of the coronavirus. A senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said last week that officials were ""actively looking"" at mandatory testing.
Last week, the United States implemented mandatory COVID-19 testing for nearly all arriving international passengers and added South Africa to its ban on entry of non-U.S. citizens arriving from most of Europe and Brazil.
Senior U.S. airline executives have said requiring testing for domestic flights could devastate the already depressed demand for air travel, and have been calling lawmakers and senior Biden administration officials to raise concerns.
Representative Rodney Davis, a Republican, said at the hearing such testing could ""punish this industry and stop it at its most critical time.""
Aviation unions last week called for $15 billion in additional payroll support for airlines. Davis said he supported that idea.
Airline assistance is not part of the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief proposed by President Joe Biden that is currently under consideration in Congress.

Asked if Biden supports airline assistance, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday ""the priorities of the president are already in the bill"" but added it could change as Congress debates it.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>",GameStop stock slide accelerates; Yellen promises scrutiny,"By Tom Westbrook and Susan Mathew
(Reuters) - The slide in shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other recent favorites of retail investors deepened on Thursday, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she needed to ""understand deeply"" the trading frenzy that has gripped Wall Street. 
A swarm of buying by amateur traders over the past two weeks sparked big moves in shares of companies that hedge funds had bet against in a confrontation some framed as a battle between Wall Street and Main Street. 
Many of those stocks have notched sharp declines this week: GameStop shares were down 37% in mid-day trading at $58.39 versus a peak of $483 a week ago, while AMC's value has more than halved after two weeks of the battle that has pitched amateur traders against Wall Street institutions.
Meanwhile, directors and executives at Koss Corp, another stock caught up in the trading blitz, sold at least $44 million in stock this week, according to CNBC. Koss shares were recently down 21%.
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, said retail investors burnt in the wild gyrations of the past two weeks were now likely to be more cautious in bidding up shares of companies with a high short interest. ""(Retail investors) can see that this is a roller-coaster ride and not a one-way trip up, and that's probably given them a little more pause before pushing the buy button.""
Hedge funds are once again setting their sights on stocks they believe are overvalued. Health insurance startup Clover Health, which is backed by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, tumbled 9% after it was criticized in a report by Hindenburg Research.
On WallStreetBets, the Reddit forum at the center of the squeeze that has hurt hedge funds and other ""short"" sellers, some denizens urged each other to hold the line and not sell GameStop, while others expressed frustration at the stock's big drop. “It’s funny how everyone on here is telling others to hold but stock keeps falling meaning y’all are actually selling,” said a user with the handle the_undergroundman. “You’re getting played by your own brethren.”
MARKET DISTORTIONS
Set to meet on the issue on Thursday, Yellen said on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that she and financial market regulators were seeking to ""understand deeply"" what had happened in the frenzy before considering action.
Yellen will meet with the heads of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Reserve Board, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday to discuss the affair.
Analysts say focus could fall on the online forums where mass buying of GameStop and AMC was discussed last week, and on the ever-larger role played by hedge funds in financial markets.
""Any kind of market distortion by investors agreeing to cause the distortion goes against the smooth and transparent functioning of markets,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.
""The reason this might not be covered by regulation yet is simply because it has never happened before. But now it might find its way into regulation in a more explicit way.""
Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester told CNBC that she does not see the Fed making any adjustments in reaction to the GameStop frenzy.
The SEC is reviewing social media posts for signs of potential fraud, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.
Hindenburg, which called Clover a ""broken business"" in the title of its report, said it had taken no short or long investment position - market code for a bet on its shares - in the company. The group added it was important investors understood the role short-sellers and their research played in financial markets.
Famous as an early Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) executive and the minority owner of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, Palihapitiya was among the tech sector billionaires who encouraged the GameStop trade last month by saying he had bought into the company's shares.
Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted his support for cryptocurrency Dogecoin, sending its value surging more than 50%. Musk's tweets about certain companies - including GameStop - and cryptocurrencies have contributed to the recent rally.
Many analysts think the squeeze is probably over and broader market attention has begun to turn to the possible fallout.
""The retail frenzy that provided an unusual distraction over the last couple of weeks appears to have lost momentum,"" said Craig Erlam, market analyst at OANDA Europe.

""A comeback tour may be planned at some point in the not-too-distant future but whether it will be as effective, we'll have to wait and see.""

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>",Ford cuts output of F-150 pickups due to semiconductor shortage,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said Thursday it is cutting shifts at two plants that build its highly profitable flagship F-150 pickup trucks starting next week due to a global shortage of semiconductor chips, raising fears the problem could be worsening.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it will run one of three shifts of production at its Dearborn Truck Plant the week of Feb. 8, while the truck portion of its Kansas City Assembly Plant will run two of three shifts of production during that week. Both are expected to return to three shifts the following week.
Ford declined to say what part or supplier were involved or how much volume would be lost. 
Global automakers have been caught off guard by the shortage of crucial semiconductors, used for everything from computer management of engines to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking. 
Other automakers hit by the shortage include General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co and Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp.
Up to now, automakers have largely focused on cutting production of less profitable vehicles as they manage through the shortage, but Ford cutting output of its high-profit trucks will raise concerns the impact is spreading.
Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker declined to address why the F-150 had been affected, but the Dearborn, Michigan-based company may discuss the matter further when it reports fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday.
Felker said the automaker was ""working closely with suppliers to address potential production constraints tied to the global semiconductor shortage and working to prioritize key vehicle lines for production."" Ford has previously cut other production because of the issue.
Also on Thursday, union sources told Reuters that automaker Stellantis will slow production at its Melfi plant in Italy next week due to a shortage of microchips and other parts and will put over 7,000 workers on furlough. Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp said it expected a production cut of 7,000 vehicles this month as a result.
On Wednesday, GM said it would cut production at four of its plants due to the chip shortage. 

On Tuesday, a group of 15 U.S. senators including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican John Cornyn urged the White House to work with Congress to address the global semiconductor shortage hitting auto manufacturing.

In her first news-media interview since taking the Treasury’s helm last month, Yellen also spoke to the need for Congress to swiftly adopt measures to reduce suffering and protect the economy from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. She also reiterated the case for a large-scale bill.
“Seeing long lines of people waiting to get food around the country is something we should never see in the United States,” she said. “We need to act forcefully to make sure Americans don’t suffer needlessly.”
She also said President Joe Biden would still like to see Covid-relief measures passed on a bipartisan basis. “I think everybody knows what America needs now,” she said.
Biden has made a $1.9 trillion proposal to speed vaccine distribution and offer additional aid to households and businesses. Republicans have argued the price tag is far too high and the package is filled with long-sought Democratic measures, like raising the minimum wage. Some more moderate Democrats have also balked at the cost.
“We need to act big,” Yellen said. Many Americans “really need help to make it to the other side,” she said.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",McKinsey to pay $600 million to settle with U.S. states over opioid crisis role,"By Jonathan Stempel and Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Consulting firm McKinsey & Company on Thursday said it has agreed to pay nearly $600 million to resolve investigations by most U.S. states into its alleged role in ""turbocharging"" sales of opioids, fueling a nationwide epidemic.
McKinsey struck a $573 million settlement with 47 states, the District of Columbia and five territories which will go toward opioid treatment and prevention. It reached separate deals with Washington state and West Virginia that boost the total.
The states alleged that McKinsey contributed to the opioid crisis by helping drug manufacturers including OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, owned by Sackler family members, design marketing plans and boost sales of painkillers.
""They were part of a machine that disrupted, in fact destroyed, lives and families in America,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
McKinsey, which did not admit wrongdoing, must also turn over internal documents concerning its work. It will continue investigating whether employees, including two partners, tried to destroy documents in response to probes.
""We deeply regret that we did not adequately acknowledge the tragic consequences of the epidemic,"" McKinsey Global Managing Partner Kevin Sneader said in a statement.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 as part of a proposed settlement it valued at $10 billion to resolve lawsuits alleging its painkiller marketing helped fuel the epidemic. It pleaded guilty in November to related criminal charges.
More than 3,300 lawsuits are pending, largely by states and local governments, seeking to hold drug makers and distributors responsible for an opioid addiction epidemic that according to U.S. government data resulted in 450,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2018.

The states and localities have also been negotiating $26 billion in settlements with distributors  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

“The truth is, back in November and December, I had basically decided that it was time to move on now,” Zucker told employees on a morning call on Thursday. “But since then, I've had a change of heart. And I want to stay. Not forever, but for another year.”
Zucker, who joined CNN in 2013, has a storied reputation in the TV business marked by early success. He was the executive producer of NBC’s “Today” show in his 20s, then became the president of NBC Entertainment. 
CNN, part of AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia division, has seen an uptick in ratings as the United States enters a new political era. It delivered record ratings in January as the top cable news network that month, with a 153% increase in total viewers from the same period a year ago.
Under WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar, AT&T is investing heavily in its HBO Max streaming service, a company priority at a time when consumers are increasingly dropping their cable packages in favor of a la carte streaming services. That focus has led to speculation by media insiders that the company could spin off CNN - which AT&T has so far denied.
AT&T has been looking to sell off its non-core assets and pay off debt since CEO John Stankey took over in June. In December it announced plans to sell its animation business Crunchyroll to Sony Corp (T:6758) for $1.175 billion. 

Sources have told Reuters AT&T has entered into exclusive talks to sell a minority stake in satellite television unit DirecTV to private equity firm TPG in a deal seen valuing the division at above $15 billion.

MIG said on Thursday that investors in its funds would now receive 340 million euros from the sale of an unspecified stake in BioNTech, following a payout of 260 million euros last year.
MIG's funds have provided funding to BioNTech, which developed the vaccine with U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), since the German biotech company's inception in 2008.
BioNTech now has a market capitalisation of around $28.4 billion, more than eight times its valuation of $3.4 billion when it made its stock market debut on the Nasdaq exchange in October 2019. 
MIG AG general partner Kristian Schmidt-Garve said the investment firm was proud of BioNTech's role in fighting the pandemic.
""We are also very pleased that we could realise considerable returns for the shareholders in the involved funds, which amount to a multiple of the initial deposits,"" he added.
MIG did not say how many BioNTech shares were sold and how many it still holds in the company
According to the prospectus of a $512 million BioNTech capital increase in July 2020, three MIG funds held a combined 3.9% in BioNTech after the capital raise, down from 4.4% before because they sold some shares.
BioNTech's largest shareholders are biotech investors Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who hold about half of the company's shares between them.

1188,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 09:47AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Higher as Recovery Hopes Strengthen; Dow up 120 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday as another drop in weekly jobless claims added to signs of an improvement in the labor market, while a heavy flow of earnings produced its share of both positive and negative surprises. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 123 points, or 0.4%, at 30,847 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
Earlier, the Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to their lowest in two months, although they remained high in absolute terms at 779,000. The figures came a day after private payrolls processor ADP reported net hiring of 174,000 in the month through mid-January. 
Leading the way higher was PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock, which rose 7.9% after reporting a strong end to 2020 and a forecast of 28% revenue growth in the first quarter, ahead of consensus forecasts around 22%. The company said its decision to offer customers cryptocurrency in wallets had led to a clear rise in engagement in the fourth quarter. Canada Goose stock rose 25% after a strong quarterly update, the highlight of which was a 42% rise in online sales in China.
Bank stocks were the other clear gainers from the economic news, which steepened the U.S. bond yield curve further. That widens the spread that banks can make on their lending operations.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) stock rose 3.8% and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock and PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) stock all rose more than 2%. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) likewise rose 2.6%.
Going in the other direction were GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), where an intense short squeeze continued to unwind. GameStop stock was down 10.8% while AMC stock was down 8.1%.  GameStop stock has now retraced all its gains since the short squeeze exploded on January 26th, while AMC is still up some 60% from that date. Both are down heavily from last week's highs, however. 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is due to meet with other regulatory agencies to discuss the events of the last couple of weeks, with the role of online brokers, hedge funds and retail traders all set for scrutiny.
Other big fallers included the  Churchill Capital IV  (NYSE:CCIV) founded by former Citibank investment banking chief Michael Klein, which fell another 6.1% on the back of a Wall Street Journal article that highlighted its lack of progress in securing an acquisition target, despite heated speculation that it will be the vehicle through which electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors goes public.
Chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) also fell 9.2% to a seven-week low after a disappointing quarterly report in which it noted that the worldwide shortage of chips would constrain sales growth in the current quarter.

The watchdog, BaFin, said it had asked Goldman Sachs to comply with due diligence obligations regarding customers and risk analysis requirements under Germany's anti-money laundering laws. 
Goldman Sachs said in a statement that BaFin's order followed an audit undertaken by BaFin in 2020. ""The required implementation is already underway,"" the bank said.
People familiar with the matter said that Goldman Sachs had not fully complied with German know-your-customer standards when transferring British customers to Germany. 
The data on the transferred customers did not always provide sufficient clarity on which persons were linked to certain accounts, the people said. They also said that BaFin could impose fines if Goldman Sachs did not address the issue sufficiently.

Goldman Sachs is moving customers with roughly $60 billion in assets to Germany from the United Kingdom because of Brexit, people familiar with the matter have said.

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 07:20AM ET</span>","Oil on the boil, stocks and bonds toil","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets were fighting for a fourth day of gains on Thursday as a near one-year high in oil prices, a revitalised dollar and rising bond yields refocused attention on inflation and normalising economies.
With the WallStreetBets/Reddit retail trading tumult having eased this week, markets were back in their comfort zone of corporate earnings, economic data and central bank meetings.
Oil was approaching $60 a barrel after OPEC and its allies extended production cuts [O/R]. London, Frankfurt and Paris share indexes edged 0.1%-0.5% higher, helped by more German stimulus (EU) and as the dollar's renewed swagger shoved the euro back under $1.20. [/FRX]
Britain's sterling also saw its biggest fall in three weeks as traders waited to see whether the Bank of England would formally endorse negative interest rates as a potential future option.
At the end of last year, expectations were building that their introduction could be imminent. But Britain's speedy COVID-19 vaccine rollout since then has eased those bets. 
""The BoE will maintain a quite cautious tone,"" said Silvia Dall'Angelo, a senior economist at fund management firm Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), adding it was likely that the bank would talk about negative rates. ""But at this stage there is very little appetite to use this measure.""
Hopes that the COVID pandemic can be brought to heel by extensive vaccination programmes, combined with expectations of unswerving global economic stimulus, has begun to see bond market focus returning to rising debt and possible inflation.
Germany’s 30-year government bond yield on Thursday was almost back in positive territory for the first time since September. The gap between two- and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields at more than 100 basis points is now the widest in almost three years.
New U.S. President Joe Biden had told House Democrats on Wednesday he was more concerned that too little would be provided rather than too much when it came to economic relief.

U.S. stock futures were up in Europe. Wall Street had seen the NYSE Fang+ index of leading tech giants hit an intraday record high on Wednesday, thanks to a 7.4% gain in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) following its strong earnings.
But markets had been softer in Asia overnight. MSCI's ex-Japan Asian-Pacific index fell 0.6%, led by 1.3% and 0.4% drops in South Korea and China. Japan's Nikkei lost 1% as it ended a three-day winning streak. 
Rising Chinese short-term interest rates kept risk appetite low, though analysts also noted position adjustments before the Lunar New Year starting next week are likely to play a role too.
Higher interest rates have raised worries that Chinese policymakers may be starting to shift to a tighter stance to rein in share prices and property markets.
""There's persistent speculation that the Chinese authorities may want to tighten its policy,"" said Wang Shenshen, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities.
Markets on the whole have calmed in the past few days with the Cboe Volatility index slipping to its lowest levels in over a week.
As the retail trading frenzy seen last week faded, stock prices of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other social media favourites have steadied, although cryptocurrency Ethereum has been on a tear ahead of the introduction of futures contracts next week. 
Among the mainstream currencies, the dollar hit a near-three-month high versus the Japanese yen of 105.19.
The euro lost 0.4% to $1.1989, having already hit a two-month low overnight.
The single currency had failed to capitalise on improved sentiment in Italy after former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi accepted the task of trying to form a new government in the country.
Gold fell 1% to $1,810 per ounce though oil continued to advance after the OPEC+ alliance of major producers stuck to a reduced output policy and U.S. crude stockpiles fell to their lowest since March last year.
U.S. crude rose 0.8% to $56.14 per barrel and Brent gained 0.6% to $58.89. Both stood near their highest levels in about a year.

""OPEC have come in and said they are looking to remove the supply but the main driver is markets are starting to price in demand recovery, especially from emerging markets,"" said Legal & General Investment Management's Justin Onuekwusi.

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Unilever's back to the future goals disappoint,"By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Unilever (NYSE:UL) restored its pre-pandemic sales growth target on Thursday, underwhelming investors seeking more ambitious goals amid strong consumer demand for plant-based food products and home care brands.
The Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soap maker said it would be ""laser focused"" on driving top line sales growth and would invest 1 billion euros in each of 2021 and 2022 in high growth areas including business to business e-commerce retailing, plant-based food and beauty products. 
This would help Unilever to achieve a long-term underlying sales growth target of 3% to 5%, restoring a previous forecast set in 2020 but pulled in April due to uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Unilever shares were down about 4%. 
""Even though we have come close to hitting the 3-5% target range in 2020, it is not enough,"" Unilever chief executive Alan Jope said.
Jope also said the company would be focused on making acquisitions in hygiene, skin care, functional nutrition and plant based foods. 
Rival consumer goods group P&G last month raised its fiscal 2021 sales growth forecast to a range of 5% to 6%, from 3% to 4%, mainly on the back of a strong first half.
The coronavirus pandemic has boosted sales of packaged food companies such as Unilever, Nestle and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), but there have also been sharp declines in foods served in public places such as on beaches and at restaurants. 
Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said the company expected the food service business to continue to be hit in Europe, where a spike in cases has led to stringent lockdowns. 
Pitkethly also said he expects a mid-to-high-single digit rise in raw material costs in the first half of 2021, which Unilever hopes to offset by raising prices. 
""Looking forward the group sees a return to more predictable sales growth as we move beyond the pandemic later this year,"" Steve Clayton, fund manager at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said.
""Ongoing restructuring to position the group further toward digital commerce will hold back earnings in the near term, perhaps explaining the market’s lack of enthusiasm for the numbers this morning,"" Clayton said.
Unilever's full-year underlying sales growth came in at 1.9%, in-line with market estimates. Emerging market sales rose 1.2% in the full-year.
China returned to growth in the second quarter as restrictions were eased, while India returned to growth in the third quarter. Sales accelerated into the high single digits in the fourth quarter in these two markets. 
""Slower EM's (emerging markets) in Q4 is the root cause of the top line miss to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) estimates, playing out against a background of extended lockdown activity worldwide,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. The brokerage expected fourth quarter underlying sales growth of 4.4%. 
Developed market sales rose 2.9% in 2020, driven by strong demand for in-home foods, ice-cream and hygiene products in North America. In Europe, sales were driven by home care products. 
The company's results end a historic year for the company which in November ditched its Anglo-Dutch dual-headed structure in favor of a single corporate entity based in London. 
Turnover for the quarter came in at 12.1 billion euros ($14.53 billion), versus analysts' estimates of 12.16 billion euros. Full-year 2020 turnover came in at 50.7 billion euros, slightly lower than the 50.81 billion euros, analysts had expected. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the year were 2.48 euros, one cent lower than analysts' estimates.

(Reuters) - World's largest pot producer  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) Corp on Thursday launched a new line of cannabis-infused soft chews and drops for dogs, after its partner and lifestyle guru Martha Stewart's line of pet treats recorded strong sales last week.
Pot-based products, especially gummy bears, brownies and drinks, were the biggest beneficiaries of a demand windfall for weed companies last year, as COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders limited people's entertainment options and raised stress.
Canopy and Stewart now eye dominating the market for cannabidiol (CBD) based pet products, estimated to reach worth C$460 million in annual sales by 2023, nearly triple of this year's forecast of C$170 million by BDS Analytics. 
CBD, a non-psychoactive compound derived mainly from hemp, is being researched for various medical applications and is widely advertised to have relaxing properties.
A Canopy Growth spokesperson told Reuters its e-commerce site Shop Canopy has had a record-breaking week, with traffic up in triple-digit percentage since Martha Stewart's CBD-infused pet products were launched on the platform on Jan 26.
Canopy's line of treats for dogs, SurityPro, will include soft chews marketed under four different categories — calm, active, multi and healthy aging. The line also includes oil drops in chicken, bacon and peanut butter flavors as well as unflavored drops.
Flavors in the SurityPro range of products will be different from Stewart's line.

Canopy claims the products help make dogs calmer, improve joint health and flexibility, healthy aging, and enhance physical and mental well-being. The products will be available on Canopy's e-commerce website and at Direct CBD Online.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen largely unchanged Thursday, cautiously continuing the recent gains as the earnings season rolls on and ahead of the weekly jobless claims release.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 10 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded just 1 point higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 40 points, or 0.3%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both eked out small gains on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite closed marginally lower. These indices are all on course for solid gains this week, currently posting gains of between 2.5% and 4%, with the DJIA and S&P on course for their best week in three months.
Sentiment has been boosted by the expectation of another U.S. stimulus package, and the Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday that President Joe Biden could be open to compromise on the size of the package in order to obtain support from Republican Senators so the bill can pass reasonably quickly.
Meanwhile, the earnings season continues, with pharmaceutical giants Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) set to report results before the opening bell Thursday, while auto giant Ford (NYSE:F), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) as well as Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) after the close. Stocks like online market eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), e-commerce player PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and semiconductor Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) will also be in focus after they issued quarterly earnings after the close Wednesday. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is expected to meet top financial regulators to discuss the recent stock market volatility, driven by frenzied trading in social media favored stocks, including GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).
More U.S. jobless data are due out Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), with initial jobless claims expected to be 830,000, a fall from last week’s 847,000, and continuing claims seen at 4.7 million, a drop of 71,000.
ADP stated Wednesday that private-sector employment rose by 174,000 last month, surpassing the 70,000 job gains expected, while Friday sees the release of the official employment report for January.
Oil prices pushed higher Thursday, boosted by the commitment of a group of top producers to continue to curb output as well as U.S. crude stockpiles falling to the smallest level in more than 10 months.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, extended its current oil output policy at a meeting on Wednesday, a move designed to balance a market having to cope with a pandemic-induced cut to demand.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $56.14 a barrel, after reaching their highest settlement level in a year on Wednesday. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $58.86, having earlier climbed to its highest in nearly a year.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1% to $1,816.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1991, falling to a two-month low.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Ant to hive off credit data in revamp; sees IPO in 2 years - sources,"By Julie Zhu, Yingzhi Yang and Kane Wu
(Reuters) - Ant Group Co plans to spin off its consumer-credit data operations, people with knowledge of the matter said, a concession to aggressive regulators that should help the Chinese fintech giant get its massive public share sale back on track. 
Hiving off the treasure trove of data on more than 1 billion people is a key part of Ant's business overhaul in response to a regulatory crackdown that resulted in the abrupt suspension of its $37 billion initial public offering (IPO), which would have been the world's biggest, the people told Reuters.
The data spinoff, along with Ant's conversion to a more strictly regulated financial holding company, will mean the affiliate of e-commerce behemoth  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd could proceed with the IPO within two years, two other people said.
Ant's restructuring plan, which Reuters reported on Wednesday, could ease billionaire founder Jack Ma's regulatory woes. The mammoth credit information and rating operations, as a separate unit, will also be subjected to regulatory supervision, said two of the sources. 
""Ant's financial holding firm will be granted the license from the PBOC and will be allowed to go public after the overhaul,"" one of the people said, referring to the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
The plans are not final and are subject to change, cautioned the people, who asked not to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Ant declined to comment. The PBOC, which is leading regulatory efforts on Ant's restructuring, did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. 
PBOC Governor Yi Gang, asked last week about a revival of Ant's IPO, replied, ""I'd say that you just follow the standard of legal instruction, you will have the result.""
'BIGGER AND STRONGER'
The regulatory crackdown on Ma's business empire in China, where he commands a cult-like reverence, followed an Oct. 24 speech in which he blasted the country's regulatory system. Ant pulled its IPO just days before the Hong Kong and Shanghai dual debut was scheduled.
Authorities launched an antitrust probe into the tech sector, with Alibaba taking much of the heat, and pushed Ant to revamp its business structure to bring it under tighter regulatory supervision. The garrulous Ma disappeared from public view for three months.
The planned tighter regulation of Ant will give it a market value in line with financial institutions, far lower than its initially envisioned valuation as a fintech company.
Alibaba's share price is down 15% from the IPO halt, although it has recouped much of its early plunge as Ma has re-emerged and the outlook for the Ant listing has improved.
Ant, which began as Alibaba's payments arm, sits on an enormous cache of consumer data. That is the backbone of China's internet platforms, with companies offering financial products from consumer loans to investment products via smartphones.
Big platforms have been hesitant to share or hand over their data to credit agencies run or backed by regulators.
Spinning off Ant's consumer data - a possible template for its Chinese peers - will bring its main business-data operations under one unit, making regulatory oversight easier.
Ant offers limited borrower information to about 100 banks, collecting ""technology service fees"" - typically a hefty 30%-40% cut of the interest on loans it facilitates, analysts estimate.
Regulators have warned online companies to protect user data as the government tightens rules for fintech firms that collect and use personal data in financial services.
The PBOC last month issued draft rules clarifying the scope of information and businesses to be included in credit scoring regulation and urging agencies to apply for licenses and not to over-collect user data.
Ant's mega-app Alipay collects data from more than two-thirds of China's 1.4 billion people, many of them young and without credit cards or sufficient credit records with banks, as well as from 80 million merchants, according to the company's prospectus and analysts.
Ant runs Zhima Credit - the name means ""Sesame"" - one of China's biggest private credit-rating platforms, with proprietary algorithms to score people and small businesses based on their use of Ant-linked services.
The holding company, which will include Ant's payment processing and technology offerings in areas like blockchain and food delivery, will also hold Ant's equity investments in other companies, one of the people said.

Ant's businesses, especially lucrative ones, have to be tightly regulated to prevent the loss of personal information and avoid systematic financial risks, he said, adding the regulators believe it can still be ""bigger and stronger.""

1204,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 06:08AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Nokia's 'Jam Tomorrow' Message Is a Reality Check for Reddit Crew,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It might be expecting a bit too much from a Finn in the middle of a six-month winter to join in a chorus of “to the moon!!!” but the message from Nokia (NYSE:NOK) on Thursday is really not one that deserves rocket-ship emojis.
The Finnish maker of telecoms equipment, whose last hot streak was back in the 1990s, has been the highest-profile European stock among those beloved of the R/WallstreetBets crew. It’s the best performing telecom stock in Europe year-to-date, with an 18% gain, thanks to the (relatively modest) short squeeze in its American Depositary Receipts.   
But its latest quarterly report makes it clear why the stock was shorted in the first place: its long-term underperformance, its failure to make the most of a merger with Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) and its subsequent loss of market share, its weak margins, and its failure to capitalize on a generational surge in investment as operators upgrade to 5G networks across the world.
Nokia has the good fortune to operate in a sector that hasn’t been negatively affected by the pandemic: quite the reverse, as shown by the explosive growth in data demand visible in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) earnings earlier this week. The company reckons it lost only 200 million euros in net sales last year due to Covid-19, which was more than offset by 250 million it saved on travel and personnel expenses.
The company brought back Pekka Lundmark, a Nokia veteran who decamped briefly to power producer Fortum, as CEO last year in an effort to turn things round. But after half a year in charge, Lundmark is still saying things will get worse before they get better.
“We expect 2021 to be challenging, a year of transition, with meaningful headwinds due to market share loss and price erosion in North America,” Lundmark said in a statement.
Net sales were down 5% in the fourth quarter, and the midpoint of its new target range for revenue this year implies a further drop of over 3%.  “Competitive intensity” in the fight for market share in 5G – in the U.S. market particularly – will hit margins as well: the midpoint of the new target range for this year (7% to 10%) implies a drop of over 1 percentage point in operating margins.
Ex-President Donald Trump has already made things markedly easier for Nokia in much of the world by queering the pitch for its biggest rival, Huawei. Nokia stock ought to have something to show for that already. Instead, it is up 2.3% from a year ago, while Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) – which hit a 52-week high on the back of its competitor’s results Thursday – is up 43%. On a three-year comparison, it looks even worse, having fallen 16% while Ericsson has more than doubled.
You might expect some kind of mean reversion alone to unwind that underperformance. That seems to be the most powerful argument behind its recent rally. Lundmark did no harm to his reputation at Fortum and is well enough respected in the industry, but as far as investors are concerned, the onus really is on him to deliver the turnaround that Nokia has been promising for years. Instead, the promise is of another year of hard slog.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 05:25AM ET</span>",McKinsey to pay $573 million to settle claims over opioid crisis role: source,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Consulting firm McKinsey & Co has agreed to pay at least $573 million to resolve claims by 40-plus U.S. states related to its role in the opioid epidemic and advice it gave to OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The settlement is with 43 states, the District of Columbia and three territories, the person said on Wednesday. Several attorneys general said they planned announcements on the opioid epidemic on Thursday.
They included Vermont's attorney general, T.J. Donovan, whose office said it would announce its participation in the first multi-state opioid settlement ""to result in substantial payment to the states to address the epidemic.""
Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said he had reached a separate, $13 million settlement with McKinsey that was on top of the reported multi-state agreement.
McKinsey did not respond to requests for comment.
McKinsey previously came under scrutiny for its role advising Purdue Pharma and the wealth Sackler family that owns the drugmaker.
A lawsuit by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey alleged McKinsey advised the Sacklers on how to ""turbocharge"" opioid sales.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 as part of a proposed settlement it valued at $10 billion to resolve lawsuits alleging its painkiller marketing helped fuel the epidemic.
More than 3,200 lawsuits are pending, seeking to hold drug makers, distributors and pharmacies responsible for an opioid addiction epidemic that according to U.S. government data resulted in 450,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2018.
The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and distributors of ignoring red flags indicating the prescription painkillers were being diverted for improper uses. They deny wrongdoing.

The states and local governments have been also in negotiations for settlements with drug distributors  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) and Amerisourcebergen Corp and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",Shell's profit slumps in 2020 as the pandemic bites,"By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s profit last year dropped to its lowest in at least two decades as the coronavirus pandemic hit energy demand worldwide though the company's retail network and trading business helped cushion the blow.
The Anglo-Dutch oil major's annual profit slumped 71% to $4.8 billion as its oil and gas production and profits from refining crude into fuels dropped sharply.
In a sign of confidence, however, Shell said it planned to raise its dividend in the first quarter of 2021, which would be the second slight increase since its slashed its payout by two-thirds at the start of last year due to the pandemic.
Analysts said that while Shell missed forecasts for both its fourth-quarter profit and cash flow, the results overall were not as bad as feared, especially after rival British BP (NYSE:BP) posted a loss of $5.7 billion earlier this week.
""We are coming out of 2020 with a stronger balance sheet,"" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in a statement.
Shell shares were little changed at 0915 GMT, slightly underperforming the broader European energy index.
Shares in Shell collapsed in 2020 along with rivals to hit 878.1 pence on Oct. 28, their lowest in more than a quarter of a century. They have recovered since but are still down 40% since the end of 2019, before COVID-19 savaged oil markets.
""Earnings were below consensus and cash flow too, but that hides the fact that expectations were low after what BP reported on Tuesday,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Giacomo Romeo said.
U.S. rivals  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) reported huge losses in 2020, battered by the prolonged slump in energy demand during pandemic lockdowns. BP's loss was its first in a decade while Exxon reported a massive $22.4 billion annual loss, its first as a public company.

LOW-CARBON STRATEGY
Shell's results come week before it presents its long-term strategy to become a net zero emissions company by the middle of the century and tries to persuade investors that it has a profitable future in a low-carbon world.
It is planning a major restructuring as part of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and aims to cut 9,000 jobs, or more than 10% of its workforce.
The reorganisation will lead to additional annual savings of about $2 billion to $2.5 billion by 2022, above and beyond cuts of $3 to $4 billion announced last year.
Like its rivals, Shell responded to the unprecedented drop in oil and gas demand last year by cutting spending sharply. 
Shell invested $17.8 billion in new projects in 2020, about $6 billion less than a year earlier, and slashed its operating costs by 12% to $32.5 billion, helping its cash flow.
Reducing costs is vital for Shell's plans to move into the crowded power sector and renewable energy where margins are typically lower than for fossil fuels. 
It is betting on its expertise in power trading and rapid growth in hydrogen and biofuels markets as it shifts away from oil, rather than joining rivals in a scramble for renewable power assets.
Graphics: Shell's quarterly profits - https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-RESULTS/dgkvlknxgpb/chart.png
CASH FLOW MISS
Despite a 28% drop in fuel sales last year, Shell's adjusted earnings from trading and marketing, which includes sales at its global network of more than 45,000 filling stations, only fell 3% from a year earlier to $4.6 billion.
But at the same time, Shell's cash flow was down nearly a fifth from 2019 while its debt-to-equity ratio rose to 32% from 29%, exceeding the company's target.
Shell's fourth-quarter profit fell 87% from a year earlier to $393 million - missing analyst forecasts for a profit of $597 million - dragged down by weak liquefied natural gas prices, lower production and weak refining margins. 
Shell's net debt at the end of the fourth quarter rose about $2 billion on the previous quarter to $75.4 billion, with its gearing - or debt-to-equity ratio - ticking up to 32.3%.
Shell cut the value of its oil and gas assets by a further $2.7 billion after writing them down by $17.8 billion last year following the lowering of its energy price outlook.
The latest writedowns were due in part to charges related to the Appomattox field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the closure of refineries in the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States as it streamlines its refining hubs. 

Shell said, however, that it planned to raise its dividend for the first quarter of 2021 by 4% from the previous quarter.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 03:46AM ET</span>",Investment banking boom lands Deutsche Bank first profit since 2014,"By Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) eked out a small annual profit in 2020, its first since 2014, saying on Thursday it had made strong gains at its investment banking division.
Over the past 10 years, Deutsche has lost a total 8.2 billion euros ($9.8 billion) and the return to profit marks an important milestone for Chief Executive Christian Sewing as analysts had been predicting another loss in 2020.
""We have built firm foundations for sustainable profitability and are confident that this overall positive trend will continue in 2021, despite these challenging times,"" he said in a statement detailing the results.
Sewing was promoted in 2018 to turn around Germany's biggest bank after years of losses and fines over money laundering failings and its role in the mortgage crisis.
Analysts expect Deutsche to deliver another profit in 2021, a consensus forecast of their estimates shows.
Deutsche said its net profit attributable to shareholders for 2020 was 113 million euros ($136 million), which compares with a 2019 loss of 5.7 billion euros. Analysts had expected a loss of about 300 million euros for 2020.
Deutsche's shares, which were up 3.6% in early Frankfurt trade, were trading 1.3% lower at 0815 GMT.
A big question is how sustainable the profits will be as Deutsche, like its competitors, experienced a trading boom amid market volatility linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This boosted its investment bank, whose revenue rose 32% to 9.28 billion euros in 2020, and by 28% in its key fixed-income and currency sales and trading business.
However, low interest rates and a slowdown in global trade pressured revenue at Deutsche's other divisions, such as those for corporate and retail clients. 
A regulatory source said that the investment banking boom had provided welcome relief for Deutsche, but although it is on a firmer footing than a year ago its overall business strength still lags competitors in the European banking industry.
Deutsche declined to comment on this.
SUSTAINABLE?
The bank has been trying to become less reliant on its investment bank in an effort to stabilise its business.
Sewing, in announcing 18,000 job cuts and the closure of its global equities business in a major revamp announced in 2019, said the investment bank should contribute only 30% of core revenues. In 2020 it accounted for close to 40% of core revenue.
Investment banking trading revenues soared globally for the entire industry 2020, research firm Autonomous said in a recent report which said ""nobody thinks this is sustainable"".
Deutsche believes a good part of its business is. 
""We see a substantial portion of investment bank growth as sustainable even as markets normalize, as we expect in 2021,"" Sewing said, according to prepared remarks to analysts.
Sewing told employees in a memo that the division was off to a ""very good start"" this year.
The bank, which broke off talks to merge with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) two years ago, is trying to make itself fit for a potential merger if an opportunity arises, Deutsche bankers say.
One banker with direct knowledge of the matter said Deutsche is getting closer to the issue of potential mergers as consolidation pressures rise. The bank is dealing with the topic, but has no concrete plans, the person said.

Deutsche ended the year with a fourth-quarter net profit of 51 million euros, against a net loss of 1.6 billion euros in the same period a year earlier and analyst expectations for a loss.

Although regulators have not yet signaled what form any official actions could take, potential targets could include retail brokers' capital requirements. The SEC is also reviewing social media posts for signs of potential fraud, Bloomberg News reported.
** STOCK SWINGS - Frankfurt listed shares in GameStop dipped 12% on Thursday after steadying in the United States on Wednesday.
** VOLATILITY - The U.S. CBOE volatility index returned on Wednesday to levels last seen earlier in January, indicating the big swings caused by the frenzy have eased. [MKTS/GLOB]

The State Department has said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Trade Policy and Negotiations Matt Murray would take part in the closed door meeting. It will be the most senior announced exchange between Taiwan and U.S. President Joe Biden's administration so far. 
Car factories around the world are shutting assembly lines because of the chip shortages, which in some cases have been exacerbated by the former U.S. administration's actions against Chinese chip factories.
Wang said semiconductors will be the ""main topic"" of the rare high-level economic talk between Taipei and Washington, but noted that the ""main focus"" of the meeting is not on auto chips. 
""It's actually a broader theme of future collaboration and goals for the semiconductor supply chain,"" she told reporters.
Wang acknowledged that the chip shortage had led to a ""great impact"" on the global scale, but she said as a democratic government, Taiwan ""cannot interfere"" in company operations. 
Taiwan, home to tech firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip maker, has become front and centre of efforts to resolve the shortage.
Germany's economy minister wrote to Wang last month to call for help to resolve the problem, and last week she met chip company executives including from TSMC to push them to ramp up production. 
Some Taiwanese politicians have floated the possibility of exchanging auto chips for COVID-19 vaccines, which have yet to begin arriving on the island. Vaccine supplies worldwide are under pressure.
Wang said the economic ministry has told Germany that Taiwan hopes it could help with the purchase of German vaccines whenever possible, but ""it is definitely not exchanging chips with vaccines."" 
The issue of vaccine will not be discussed in Friday's meeting, she added.
Taiwan-U.S. ties were stepped up under former President Donald Trump, angering China, which claims Taiwan as it own territory. 
Biden's administration issued a strong statement of support for Taiwan in January amid stepped up Chinese military activity near the island, calling the U.S. commitment to Taipei ""rock solid.""
Wang has said Washington has already been in touch with Taiwan to discuss the auto chip supply crunch.

The shortage has affected Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler and other carmakers.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed on Thursday, as investors pause for breath after a three-day rally while the earnings season continues.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2% and Italy’s FTSE MIB futures climbed 0.1%.
Expectations of additional U.S. stimulus have boosted global stock markets of late, particularly after the Democrats in Congress pushed ahead with a maneuver to ensure President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid relief package gets through largely undiluted, even without Republican support.
The retail trading frenzy of the last few days appears to be fading, with the prices of social media favored stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) subsiding after online brokers, especially Robinhood, curbed trading.
In Europe, the Italian market could lead the way again after former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi accepted a request from Italy’s head of state to try to form a government of national unity that will combat the pandemic and a deep recession.

Nokia (NYSE:NOK) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue following a strategy revamp from new CEO Pekka Lundmark, while Shell 's(NYSE:RDSb) fourth-quarter profit dropped 87% from a year earlier, dragged down by continued weak energy consumption. Consumer giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) meanwhile reported a solid 3.5% rise in underlying sales growth in the three months through December.
On the economic data front, retail sales for the euro zone are expected to show a rebound in December after November’s sharp drop.

Ping An Co-CEO Xie Yonglin told an earnings conference on Thursday that the company was now leading a creditor committee handling the debts in China Fortune Land, in which the company has a 25% stake. 
Over the years, China's biggest insurer has invested some 18 billion yuan in the equities of China Fortune Land Development and 36 billion yuan in its debts, said Xie. Those investments are part of Ping An's 8-trillion-yuan investment portfolio, he added. 
Chinese authorities have since 2016 sought to limit lending to the over-leveraged property sector to prevent systemic risks. Regulators outlined borrowing caps known as “the three red lines” last August while the central bank in December also introduced caps on property loans granted by banks. 
China Fortune Land's operations are facing some challenges including a tight regulatory environment which is affecting payment collection, the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the company's aggressive expansion, said Xie.
The company said in a statement on Monday it had missed payment of principal and interest totalling $813 million.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 11:50PM ET</span>",Rio Tinto board could face pressure on Indigenous broken promise claim,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) chairman Simon Thompson is set to face further pressure over the board's handling of the destruction of sacred rock shelters in Australia after an Indigenous group accused him of breaking a personal promise, analysts said.
The traditional owners of the rock shelters said Thompson had told them Rio's acting head of iron ore, Ivan Vella, who had led reconciliation efforts, would see the process through to its end, The Australian newspaper reported on Thursday, citing a letter to Rio from the traditional owners.
Rio announced last week that Vella would move to Canada to head up its aluminium business, while Chief Commercial Officer Simon Trott would take charge of iron ore. 
The PKKP had told Rio of their concerns that frequent leadership turnover prevented the groups building longstanding relationships of trust, the newspaper said. 
The destruction last year of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters, while legal, sparked a public and investor uproar that led to the resignation of then CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies, and a promise by Rio Tinto to repair ties.
Thompson is likely to face increasing pressure to step down, given the recent spotlight on social issues that is worrying investors, even with solid financial results, said David Lennox of Fat Prophets in Sydney which holds Rio shares.
""The institutional shareholders are starting to get a greater whiff of the responsibilities of being a shareholder. In the past, they didn't care. Those days are long gone,"" he said.
In the letter to Rio, Wilson said the group had explicitly asked Thompson to clarify who would be responsible for mending the relationship, following the destruction of the shelters to extend iron ore mining, The Australian said.
""Mr Thompson was unequivocal in his response; Ivan Vella was nominated as having full board imprimatur for repairing the relationship from a Rio Tinto perspective. This responsibility was to have lasted from that meeting through to the conclusion of the repair,"" the letter said.
Shareholder advocacy group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the latest move by the global miner suggested ""that Rio still views its relationship with traditional owners as 'an afterthought'.""
""ACCR believes that investors should hold Thompson and other board members accountable, and insist on necessary, constructive change to the company's board composition,"" it said in a statement.
Rio is due to hold its London annual general meeting in April and its Australian AGM in May.
""The empty 'trust' bucket just got knocked over by the chairman ... it is becoming increasingly clear that changes need to be made at the board level,"" said analyst Peter O'Connor at broker Shaw and Partners in Sydney.
The PKKP said it only found out about the recent leadership changes through the media, and that Thompson had not made any formal contact to explain the changes and their impact on the reconciliation process, the paper said. 
The PKKP told Reuters through a spokesman it had been in contact with Rio Tinto recently but declined to comment on the specific nature of any correspondence or discussions.
Asked for comment on the report, Rio Tinto said rebuilding trust with the PKKP remained a ""priority"", and that it was appropriate the relationship be led by the head of iron ore.

""We are encouraged by the progress on the planning for the remediation of the Juukan Gorge area but readily acknowledge we have a lot more work ahead of us,"" it said in a statement.

Raimondo, in written questions from Senate Republicans, was asked about the two companies, as well as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation and the Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and others. They are on a list that requires U.S. firms to obtain government licenses if they want to sell American tech and intellectual property to the Chinese companies.
“I understand that parties are placed on the Entity List and the Military End User List generally because they pose a risk to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” said Raimondo, the governor of Rhode Island. “I currently have no reason to believe that entities on those lists should not be there. If confirmed, I look forward to a briefing on these entities and others of concern.”
Raimondo when asked about the issue during her Jan. 26 Senate confirmation hearing didn’t specifically commit to keeping Huawei on the list. That prompted several House Republicans to ask their Senate counterparts to delay her confirmation. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee voted 21-3 on Wednesday to advance her nomination.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Thursday morning, retreating from a three-day rally in global stocks. A mixed U.S. session also provided little incentive for investors to increase their risk positions.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.52% by 10:13 PM ET (3:13 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.22%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.56%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.81%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.63% and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.23%.
Caution prevailed in the market, even as the recent trading frenzy driven by social media calmed down. Shares in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). And AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc., two companies that saw wild swings in their share prices, rebounded following Tuesday’s drop.
The global fight against COVID-19 also continues, with AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) and the University of Oxford studying how to re-engineer their COVID-19 vaccine to be effective against the virus’ new mutations.
“The second half of this year is really dependent on the vaccine, so that’s a risk,” Harvard Kennedy School Megan Greene told Bloomberg.
“The labor market is certainly healing but there is a long way to go,” so “some of the scarring could offset some of the pent-up demand that investors are hoping for,” she added.
On a positive note, data released in the U.S. overnight showed small signs of a pickup in U.S. activity. January’s services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 58.3, against the 57.4 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and December’s 57.5 figure. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI also beat expectations, coming in at 58.7 against the forecast 56.8 and December’s 57.7 reading.
Investors now await the release of the U.S. payrolls report for January, including non-farm payrolls, on Friday to evaluate the economic recovery from COVID-19 further.
Progress also continues for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden in Congress. The Senate began debating a budget resolution for the 2021 fiscal year on Tuesday, the first step towards passing the package.
All this caused other investors to remain optimistic.
“There has been a ton of noise in the stock market these past few weeks, so it’s encouraging to see solid economic reads … there may be signs of overextension when it comes to single stocks, but under the surface there is an economy regaining serious momentum,” E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp managing director of investment strategy Mike Loewengart told Bloomberg.
On the central bank front, the Bank of England handing down its policy decision later in the day. Although it is widely expected to keep both interest rates and quantitative easing steady, investors will look for clues on the likelihood of negative interest rates."

It said that China's electric vehicle industry and government policies had undergone major changes since the agreements were signed in 2017 and 2018, prompting Ford's decision. Ford didn't specify which changes triggered its move.
Last week, Ford said its China joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co would start making all-electric Mustang Mach-E vehicles.
In a statement on Thursday, Ford said it would pursue a more ""flexible business model in China"" that would see it utilise its existing operations in the country and elsewhere, and build related business centres. 
Zotye did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In 2017, during a visit by former U.S. President Donald Trump to China, Ford and Zotye said that they would invest a combined $756 million to set up a 50-50 joint venture in China to build small electric passenger vehicles. 
A year later, the two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding for another venture that would make electric vehicles for ride-hailing fleets. 
EV makers from home-grown Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc to U.S. leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc have been expanding manufacturing capacity in the world's largest auto market, where the government is heavily promoting greener vehicles as a means of reducing chronic air pollution.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd on Thursday set in motion its $5 billion U.S. dollar bond deal by announcing the initial price guidance in a marketing term sheet reviewed by Reuters. 
Alibaba flagged a price range of 130 basis points over U.S. 10-year Treasuries for the 10-year tranche and 140 basis points over U.S. 20-year Treasuries for the 20-year tranche. 
It is selling the debt in four tranches which also includes 30 and 40-year bonds, the term sheet showed.
Investor response to the deal will test sentiment towards Alibaba founder Jack Ma's business empire amid regulatory scrutiny triggered by a speech in late October that publicly criticised the country's regulatory system.
That set off a chain of events that resulted in the halting of affiliate Ant Group's $37 billion stock market listing.

(Reuters) - GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other social media darlings rebounded in calmer trading on Wednesday from their sharp sell-off in the prior session as investors turned their focus to the possibility of tighter U.S. trading regulations.
However, the so-called ""Reddit rally"" cooled again in after hours trade, as GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), the main targets hyped on investment forums, fell.
Mass buying over the past two weeks by amateur traders following posts on social media fueled a fierce rally in companies that big hedge funds had bet against, including videogame retailer GameStop and cinema operator AMC.
GameStop had soared as high as $483 last week, fueled by posts on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, then dived and on Tuesday fell briefly below $90.
On Wednesday GameStop shares closed up 2.68% at around $92.41. They seesawed all day but within a range, while shares of AMC rose 14.71% a day after dropping 41%. 
After the closing bell, GameStop was off 2.61% while AMC dipped 2.23%. 
Some professional investors bemoaned the volatility and warned that retail investors who piled in could ultimately face big losses.
“The fundamentals are well known and obviously the stock prices have detached from the fundamentals,” said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities. “I have told people just stay away, it is dynamite and who knows when, how or where it blows up.”
Many Reddit users on WallStreetBets exhorted one another to stay in the stocks despite the big swings.

Yellen has asked to discuss volatility and promoting fair and efficient markets.

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc shares fell 7.6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as the company said that semiconductor supply constraints that have roiled the industry were hampering its sales growth.
The results come as chip shortages force automakers such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday to cut production at multiple plants. While Qualcomm does not make the chips that are holding up automotive plants, the company works with some of the same chip contract manufacturers that are backed up. Qualcomm executives told Reuters that supplies will remain tight through the first half of 2021 without detailing the supply issue. 
""If we could make more, we could sell it,"" Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters in an interview.
The share price declines for the San Diego, California-based chip designer came even as it forecast fiscal second-quarter sales and profits above Wall Street expectations, driven by a wave of phone buyers around the world upgrading their devices for 5G network connectivity.
Wall Street had expected healthy gains for the company after the U.S. government blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, a move that made it difficult for the Chinese brand to build handsets. Analysts had expected much of its market share in the premium smartphone market to flow to Android-based rival makers who use Qualcomm's chips, but the gains disappointed investors.
""Now with the change in the market, we have kind of 16% of the market that was not available to us before being available. So as we kind of look further out, we see this as a pretty material expansion of (addressable market) for us,"" Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said on a call.
Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein, called Qualcomm's results ""respectable"" but said expectations had been high. ""It's not a blowout,"" he said.
Qualcomm's strategy is changing as its chips become more profitable and a bigger part of its business, but a concurrent decline in its lucrative license revenues held its gross margins flat. 
For the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 27, Qualcomm said sales and adjusted profit were $8.24 billion and $2.17 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $8.27 billion and $2.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Chip and licensing revenue were $6.53 billion and $1.66 billion, respectively, beating estimates, according to FactSet data.
Qualcomm forecast sales with a midpoint of $7.6 billion and adjusted profit at a midpoint of $1.65 per share, slightly above expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Qualcomm is the world's biggest supplier of chips that help mobile phones connect to cellular data networks, providing chips to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other handset makers. Qualcomm disclosed Wednesday that chip sales to Apple are slightly less profitable than chip sales to other phone makers because Apple does not also buy additional software from Qualcomm in the way that Android device makers do.
But the company is also building out businesses supplying chips to automakers such as General Motors, which last week disclosed a deal to source chips from Qualcomm, and challenging  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) with new processors for laptop and desktop computers.
Two of the company's newer business lines - radio frequency chips to help devices handle newer 5G signals and internet-of-things chips for devices such as wireless headphones - have now become billion-dollar-per-quarter businesses. 
Cristiano Amon, the company's president who will take over as chief executive in June, said the company was ""well hedged"" among chip suppliers because it sources parts from multiple contract manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd. But he added that demand was outstripping supply as rivals of Huawei, which largely did not use Qualcomm's chips, moved in to take the Chinese brand's market share.
""We're seeing growth of share in a preeminent high tier,"" Amon said.
Qualcomm forecast a midpoint of $6.25 billion in revenue for its chip business in the fiscal second quarter, beating estimates of $5.62 billion, according to data from FactSet. Qualcomm forecast a midpoint of sales for its licensing business, which has higher margins than its chip business and generates much of its profit, of $1.35 billion, lower than estimates of $1.43 billion, according to FactSet.
The higher sales of chips - and chips with better margins - accounted for the company's above-expectations profit forecast despite falling short of estimates for its licensing business, Palkhiwala told Reuters.

Qualcomm said first-quarter sales for handset chips were $4.22 billion, jumping 79% from a year before on the strength of 5G phone upgrades. Sales of radio frequency chips, a growth area for Qualcomm, increased 157% to $1.06 billion. Automotive chips sales were $212 million, up 44% from the previous year.

The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of coronavirus vaccines could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility around the world. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June. 
The trial will examine the immune responses of an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca's, as well as vice versa, with intervals of 4 and 12 weeks. 
Both the mRNA shot developed by Pfizer and Biontech and the adenovirus viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca are currently being rolled out in Britain, with a 12-week gap between two doses of the same vaccine. 
It is expected more vaccines will be added to the trial when they are approved and rolled out.
Recruitment for the study starts on Thursday, with over 800 participants expected to take part, the researchers said. That makes it much smaller than the clinical trials that have been used to determine efficacy of the vaccines individually.
The trial will not assess the overall efficacy of the shot combinations, but researchers will measure antibody and T-cell responses, as well as monitor for any unexpected side effects.
Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said initial results could inform vaccine deployment in the second half of the year.
""We will get some results through, we expect, by June or thereabouts that will inform the use of booster doses in the general population,"" he told reporters.
The trial is looking to recruit people over the age of 50 who may be at higher risk than younger people and have not been vaccinated already.

AstraZeneca's shot is also being tested in combination with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, and British drugmaker's research chief has said more studies on combining vaccines should be done.

1227,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",Ebay earnings beat on pandemic-driven surge in online shopping; shares soar,"By Akanksha Rana and Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - E-commerce firm eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) said on Wednesday it would emerge ""stronger"" from the COVID-19 crisis after a pandemic-driven surge in online shopping helped the company beat estimates for sales and profit in the holiday quarter.
Shares of the company were up nearly 10% in extended trade.
The global health crisis has forced millions of Americans to stay indoors, leading to a jump in online orders for e-commerce companies including eBay, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's online business. 
""We'll be stronger coming out of the pandemic than we were going in,"" eBay Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone said in an interview with Reuters.
The company was benefiting from its updated strategy, Iannone said, which includes drawing shoppers through fashion offerings including sneakers and watches, enabling easier payments and improving its mobile app. 
EBay, a marketplace known for unique or hard-to-find inventory, is not focused on copying larger e-commerce rivals, he added.
""Our buyers were very active during the holiday season. In the United States, one in 10 online shoppers bought something on eBay. In Germany, that number was one in seven and in the UK, it was one in four,"" Iannone said on a conference call with analysts.
EBay also projected first-quarter revenue in the range of $2.94 billion to $2.99 billion, above estimates of $2.53 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""EBay is increasingly proving that it has the ability to sustain the gains it is seeing from Covid. We expect these trends to increasingly become ingrained in consumer behavior, providing support in 2021,"" Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian said.
The company also expanded share repurchase authorization by an additional $4 billion.
Annual active buyers grew by 7%, to a total of 185 million global active buyers, while refurbished gifts emerged as a top trend for the holiday shoppers, the company said.
Revenue in the fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31, rose to $2.87 billion from $2.24 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.70 billion.

Excluding items, eBay earned 86 cents per share, above estimates of 83 cents per share.

(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said on Wednesday that some 13,000 employees are at risk of furlough when a U.S. aid package for airline workers expires on April 1, blaming slow vaccine rollouts and new international travel restrictions for dampening demand.
""We are nearly five weeks into 2021, and unfortunately, we find ourselves in a situation similar to much of 2020,"" Chief Executive Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in a memo to employees which was also included in a regulatory filing.
Fort Worth, Texas-based American furloughed 19,000 workers when a previous round of government payroll support ended on Oct. 1 but recalled them in December after a fresh $15 billion for the industry through March.
Aviation unions are already pushing for another $15 billion in U.S. payroll assistance to protect jobs through the summer.
""The vaccine is not being distributed as quickly as any of us believed, and new restrictions on international travel that require customers to have a negative COVID-19 test have dampened demand,"" American said, adding that the company will not fly all of its aircraft this summer as planned.
United Airlines has sent fresh furlough warnings to 14,000 employees, while Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co have averted layoffs mostly thanks to voluntary leave programs.
American and United also offered voluntary deals to reduce staffing last year but were still forced to furlough.
American said it was launching a fresh round of exit packages in an effort to mitigate potential involuntary furloughs, similar to plans by United.
They are required by law to inform employees whose jobs are at risk, generally within 60 days.
American's potential furloughs include 1,850 pilots and 4,245 flight attendants. United's pilots approved a deal late last year to prevent furloughs until June.
Last month American's wholly owned regional subsidiary, PSA Airlines, said it planned to resume pilot hiring this year, as have ultra low-cost carriers including Allegiant and privately owned Frontier Airlines.
The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's pilots, said actions by management and their treatment of the airline's balance sheet ""have placed American in a more precarious situation than our competitors.""

American is the most leveraged of the major U.S. carriers. Last week it took advantage of a sharp rise in shares after a mention on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum to launch a fresh $1 billion stock sale to boost liquidity.

(Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, with a coronavirus-driven shift to online shopping and digital transactions driving record levels of payment volumes for both the quarter and the year. 
PayPal said it was expecting an addition of about 50 million active users in 2021 and forecast annual revenue of about $25.5 billion, well above the $21.4 billion estimated by analysts. Its shares were up 5% in trading after the bell.
""At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers amid lockdown had no choice but to do all of their shopping online,"" Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said. 
""Today, the vast majority of consumers state that post pandemic, they will continue to shop online at their current elevated levels because it is more convenient, easier and saves time,"" Schulman added. 
Online payments have got a boost since the start of the pandemic as people stuck indoors rely on mobile apps for shopping and paying bills.
San Jose, California-based PayPal said 2020 was its strongest ever annual performance as it processed a record $936 billion in payments. 
U.S. holiday sales jumped 8.3% last year to record their best growth in at least 19 years, the National Retail Federation said last month. 
PayPal's processed payments in the latest quarter rose 39% to $277.1 billion, with an additional 16 million net new active customers.
Venmo, PayPal's service that allows individuals in the United States to send each other money through an app, processed 60% more in payments in the quarter.
Quarterly revenue rose about 23% to $6.12 billion, topping estimates. 
The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, higher than analysts' average estimate of $1 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES.

Schulman said PayPal saw an exceptional response for its new cryptocurrency offering.

MetLife reported adjusted earnings of $1.84 billion, or $2.03 per share, beating analysts' average estimates of $1.52 a share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Variable investment income totaled $778 million in the quarter, nearly all from private-equity investments.
MetLife earned $1.126 billion in such income for the full year, topping the target of $900 million to $1.1 billion it set a year ago. 
On underwriting, payouts for dental and other non-medical health claims were lower, cushioning the effect of higher claims from life insurance caused by COVID-19-related deaths, the company said.
Adjusted earnings of the insurer's U.S. business jumped 51% to $1.02 billion, while the company's overall net investment income grew by 13% to $5.24 billion on strong returns from private equity investments.
That helped MetLife offset weak performance in Latin America, where its business was impacted by claims from deaths linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Global life insurers are taking steps to curb payouts stemming from the health crisis, including long-term health consequences that are not fully understood.nL1N2JP1SV]
In the United States, 8% of reported group life insurance claims from April to August attributed the cause of death to COVID-19, according to the U.S. Society of Actuaries.
MetLife also said its net derivative losses widened 7% from a year earlier to $1.56 billion.

The insurer holds a book of derivatives to hedge against the risk of market swings. Such gains do not indicate the actual performance of the company, but reflect the effect of accounting rules, an issue that has occurred in some previous quarters.

Investing.com - Paypal reported a sharp jump in earnings as the pandemic-fueled increase in e-commerce shopping drove up online payments.    
 PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) was up 1.8% on the news after a run-up of nearly 9.72% year to date.
Earnings per share rose to $1.32 per share from 43 cents per share a year earlier, while revenue was up 235% to $6.12 billion.
Total payment volume rose 39%, to $277 billion, in the fourth quarter from the prior-year period as net new active accounts jumped 24%, to 16 million. 
Venmo, its peer-to-peer payments app, processed about $47 billion in payment volumes in Q4, up 60% annually.
Looking to 2021, the company guided non-GAAP EPS growth of about 17%, in-line with consensus estimates but well below the 31% pace of growth in 2020, while revenue was expected to grow 28% for the year. 
""The online payment industry has a strong upside at a time when e-commerce is gaining traction and market share like never before,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar. ""PayPal has positioned itself strategically by acquiring a variety of companies during the past five years that allowed it to keep pace with the rapidly-changing financial technology. In addition, the company is trying to make itself stickier with consumers once the pandemic is over. It’s adding more services to its wallet, including instalment lending, crypto investing and bill payment.  For these reasons, PayPal is still very much in a growth phase even after taking into account the explosive growth of the past year, making the stock a good buy-and-hold bet for long-term investors.""

Alphabet shares ended up 7.3% and provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The Google parent late Tuesday posted results that topped quarterly sales expectations for its advertising and Cloud businesses, helped in part by the pandemic.
With recent stronger-than-expected results from Alphabet and other companies, S&P 500 companies are now on track to post earnings growth for the fourth quarter of 2020 and to defy expectations for another quarterly profit drop due to the pandemic, based on data from Refinitiv Wednesday.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 04:40PM ET</span>",Ford's forecast in focus as it wraps up year with quarterly loss,"By Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's investors are likely to brush aside the company's quarterly loss on Thursday and focus on its 2021 forecast and production target for the revamped F-150 pickup truck, a consistent bestseller in the U.S. automobile market.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker needs to strengthen the inventory of F-150 pickup trucks to bolster its profits for the year. The company had previously said production of the F-150 would take a hit in the fourth quarter as it ramped up production of the new version.
Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley, who took over the helm in October, has promised to move more capital to the automaker's high-growth areas, such as the F-Series pickup truck and its commercial business.
""We expect soft fourth-quarter results driven primarily by F-series downtime. Ford could provide better than expected 2021 outlook, benefiting from new F-150, Bronco, Mach-E launches; better warranty performance, and large restructuring savings from South America,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) auto analyst Emmanuel Rosner said.
THE CONTEXT
Ford's three launches - the redesigned F-150 pickup, electric Mustang Mach-E and the revived Bronco sport-utility vehicle - are considered a make or break for the automaker.
The F-Series truck has been around since 1948, while the F-150 debuted in 1975. Profits from the new F-150 is key to paying back the billions of dollars Ford has borrowed to ride out the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic.
The company also needs to reduce its warranty repair costs - the primary reason why the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker' s financial performance in North America has lagged that of its archrival, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Papa John's International (NASDAQ:PZZA) Inc on Wednesday won the dismissal of a lawsuit accusing the pizza chain and founder John Schnatter of defrauding shareholders by concealing its ""toxic"" workplace environment.
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan said Papa John's had no affirmative duty to disclose problems in its workplace, including published accusations of sexual misconduct against Schnatter, despite the rise of the #MeToo movement against such behavior.
She found no proof the alleged problems would materially hurt Papa John's results, and said the company's public statements about its culture were ""immaterial puffery"" and too general to support a securities fraud claim.
The proposed class action against Papa John's was led by the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System.
It said the Louisville, Kentucky-based company inflated its share price over 4-1/2 years by concealing problems, and that the price fell during the summer of 2018 when the truth came out, causing losses for shareholders.
Lawyers for the shareholders and for Papa John's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""We're pleased with the court's decision,"" said Steven Mintz, a lawyer for Schnatter and two other former Papa John's executives. ""It affirms that securities fraud pleadings require more than unconfirmed press reports about a company's culture.""
Wood dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. The lawsuit had been amended twice, and the judge said it would be ""futile"" to try again.
Schnatter resigned as Papa John's chairman in July 2018 and apologized after a published report said he used a racial slur when discussing Black people.
He stepped down as CEO in December 2017 after saying the National Football League's handling of players protesting racism and police misconduct was hurting sales at Papa John's, then a league sponsor.

The case is Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System v Papa John's International Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-07927.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 04:05PM ET</span>","With Bezos out as Amazon CEO, is this the end of his ominous question-mark emails?","By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - For staff at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the departure of CEO Jeff Bezos may spell the end of one of the company's unusual and, for some managers, frightening practices: the ""question-mark"" email.
Bezos, whose email address is public, receives customer complaints that he then forwards to a relevant executive whose team is responsible for fixing the problem. Sometimes landing overnight, these emails from the world's second-richest person had no salutation, no commentary or thank you - just a single question mark.
Or worse, said one former manager.
""'This can't be true' was a bad one. 'Fix this' was another,"" the manager said on condition of anonymity. ""By the morning, I better have a damn good resolution to whatever this is.""
Amazon said Bezos sent question-mark emails occasionally to manage the volume of customer messages he received.
It was an effective tool: efficient for Bezos - who juggled oversight of retail, technology, media and space businesses - and motivating for employees who feared for their jobs, the former manager said.
Bezos will step back from the company he founded 27 years ago and become executive chairman this summer, Amazon said Tuesday.
Some recall the practice with nostalgia. Sean Scott, a vice president of autonomous delivery who recently left Amazon after nearly 15 years, said working with Bezos was rewarding but stressful.
""Meetings with Jeff were always an unbelievable amount of work in prep during the lead up (as were the ? emails) but the dialog and the Q&A during the meeting would remain with the team forever,"" he said in a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post Tuesday.
No one can predict how incoming CEO Andy Jassy will govern in his boss' shoes. The cloud computing head cares just as much about fixing customers' problems. 

But three executives who worked with him said the single question mark is not his style.

Investing.com -- Stocks rose modestly on Wednesday as big tech earnings surprises rolled in.
Google parent Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) helped lift the broader market after better-than-expected profit and revenue as ad spending returned to YouTube and Search businesses. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), on the other hand, fell slightly after news its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos was stepping away from day to day management later this year.
The biggest influence in the market is a report that President Joe Biden is considering compromises on his proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus, including sending checks to a smaller group of Americans.
The apparent olive branch could potentially sway some Republicans to warm up to the idea of backing the bill, helping Democrats secure the GOP votes that would be needed in the Senate.
The economic recovery continues to strengthen, according to job and other data that will be confirmed by the government’s official job report for January this Friday. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings from big pharma and oil majors
Pharmaceutical giants Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) report earnings on Thursday, as does oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC Class A (AS:RDSa). 
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect Merck to report earnings per share of $1.38 on revenue of $12.7 billion. Bristol Myers is seen with EPS of $1.41 on sales of $10.7 billion. Shell is expected to have EPS of 14 cents on revenue of $53 billion.
2. Jobless claims
More jobless data is due out Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), namely in the form of unemployment benefit claims. Initial claims are expected to be 830,000 and continuing claims are expected to be 4.7 million.
On Wednesday, ADP said private-sector employment rose by 174,000 last month, surpassing the 70,000 job gains expected.
3. Zoom Video gets a competitor
The software IPO boom continues with Wednesday’s debut of  video-marketing company  ON24  Inc (NYSE:ONTF). The shares surged 45% on their first trading day to above $70 after pricing at $50.
ON24 raised $315 million in the offering. The pandemic-winning online communication company  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) also jumped big-time after its 2019 IPO. Last month it said it was going to sell another $1.5 billion shares in a secondary offering."

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 03:15PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Merck anti-baldness drug Propecia has long trail of suicide reports, records show","By Dan Levine and Chad Terhune
(Reuters) - Newly unsealed court documents and other records show that Merck & Co and U.S. regulators knew about reports of suicidal behavior in men taking the company’s anti-baldness treatment Propecia when they decided not to warn consumers of those potential risks in a 2011 update of the popular drug’s label.
Internal records from Merck were made public in late January, when a federal magistrate in Brooklyn, New York, granted a 2019 Reuters motion to unseal 11 documents filed in years of litigation alleging Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction and other harmful side effects.
Since the 2011 decision on the warning, the FDA has received more than 700 reports of suicide and suicidal thoughts among people taking Propecia or generic versions of the drug. Those included at least 100 deaths. Before that, in the first 14 years the drug was on the market, the agency received 34 such reports, including 10 deaths.
Annual U.S. prescriptions of finasteride, as the drug is known, for hair loss increased to over 2.4 million in 2020, more than double the number in 2015, according to health data company IQVIA.
European and Canadian regulators, citing similar reports among men taking finasteride, require a warning of suicidal thoughts on the label, though they note that research has not proved that the drug causes such thoughts. To this day, the U.S. label contains no mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts.
As early as 2009, Merck knew of more than 200 reports of depression, including suicidal thoughts, in men taking Propecia, according to an internal “risk management” assessment from that year. The company decided there were too few reports of serious depression and suicidal behavior and not enough specifics about those cases to warrant more than “routine” monitoring of safety data.
In 2011, two years after the Merck risk analysis, the FDA was weighing a company request to add “depression” to the drug’s label as a potential risk, with no warnings related to suicide. FDA analysts disagreed about adding a warning related to suicide, according to previously unreported government documents. But the regulator ultimately agreed with Merck’s request on the grounds that the number of suicides was lower than one would expect in this group of patients.
CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY
Some medical researchers and patient advocates said Merck and the FDA have left American consumers in the dark about potentially life-threatening dangers associated with finasteride.
“No family should ever have to learn about this after the fact,” said Kim Witczak, a consumer advocate who serves on an FDA advisory panel for psychiatric drugs. She has called for drug companies and regulators to issue stronger warnings after her husband died from suicide in 2003 five weeks after being prescribed an antidepressant for insomnia. Merck “had an opportunity to put suicide on the label, but they didn’t want to do that because it’s all about sales.”
Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist and Harvard Medical School faculty member whose own research has found possible links between finasteride and suicidal behaviors, said Merck’s handling of the risk analysis and the FDA’s inaction keep critical information from the public. Merck “definitely should have provided a more complete picture,” Irwig said.
In a statement to Reuters, Merck said that “the scientific evidence does not support a causal link between Propecia and suicide or suicidal ideation and these terms should not be included in the labeling” for the drug. “Merck works continuously with regulators to ensure that potential safety signals are carefully analyzed and, if appropriate, included in the label for Propecia.”
Merck has said in past statements that Propecia has been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s. It also has argued in court that “premature hair loss itself, the very condition for which Propecia is prescribed, is associated with low self-esteem, poor body image, and depression.”
In a statement, FDA said it “continues to monitor postmarketing safety data for Propecia.” Overall, the agency noted that the presence of a report in the FDA database “does not mean the drug caused the adverse event” and medical problems may stem from the “underlying disease being treated, caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons.”
FDA declined to comment further about its handling of Propecia and reports related to suicide.
Merck’s analysis of a potential suicide risk stayed secret in court for over three years -- and only became public after Reuters intervened in the proceeding. The insights in the recently unsealed documents echo findings from Reuters’ 2019 investigation, “Hidden Injustice,” which revealed how U.S. judges routinely allow makers of consumer products to file under seal in lawsuits information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one.
The Reuters investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured in recent decades by allegedly defective products -- including drugs, cars and medical devices -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained hidden.
In granting Reuters’ motion to unseal Merck documents, U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo last month ruled that the company’s arguments for continued secrecy “are so weak that they would not overcome even a low presumption of access under the common law.”
INTERNAL DIFFERENCES
In addition to the risk management plan, Kuo unsealed other Merck documents including an internal marketing report from prior to the drug’s launch and some communications with regulators regarding sexual dysfunction. Reuters obtained the FDA documents discussing suicide from a separate online repository maintained by the agency.
In 2010, while reviewing Merck’s proposal to add potential depression risk to Propecia’s label, an FDA safety evaluator recommended also adding a warning for suicidal thoughts and behavior, noting nine suicides and reports of other suicidal behaviors among patients who took finasteride, the FDA documents reviewed by Reuters show.
The reports of suicidal behavior analyzed by Merck and government regulators, known as “adverse event” reports, are filed by consumers, doctors and other members of the public. They are compiled in a public database by U.S. regulators, as well as drug-safety agencies in other countries.
In her November 2010 report, FDA safety evaluator Namita Kothary wrote that the nine suicides were difficult to assess due to incomplete information. “However, we cannot exclude that finasteride may have contributed to the events,” she wrote. Kothary did not respond to requests for comment.
Two other FDA reviewers disagreed. The two physicians -- Amy Woitach and David Kettl -- said the data supported adding depression to the label. Suicidal ideation, however, should be left off because the number of suicidal thoughts, attempts and deaths was “lower than would be expected in this patient population,” according to their December 2010 report. Kettl and Woitach did not respond to requests for comment.
The European Medicines Agency found the relationship between finasteride and depression was hard to assess, but still required a warning about suicidal ideation in 2017, in part because Propecia is not prescribed for a serious condition, according to EMA committee meeting minutes. Doctors and patients generally weigh risks differently for a drug to treat a life-threatening health problem, versus something less severe.
When Health Canada required its warning in 2019, it noted 368 international reports of suicidal events reported in patients treated with finasteride through September 2018. Merck did not respond to questions about these regulatory moves.
The FDA approved Propecia in 1997, and sales climbed steadily through the 2000s, peaking at $447 million in 2010. Soon after, Merck’s patent expired. Overall sales of finasteride have remained strong as cheaper generic versions have hit the market.
PERSISTENT DYSFUNCTION
The new information regarding a potential suicide risk emerged as a result of longstanding controversy about sexual problems associated with the drugs.
From the beginning, Merck’s label said Propecia caused sexual dysfunction in nearly 4% of its clinical study participants. However, the 2009 risk management report also shows that the company was aware of reports that those sexual problems continued for some men after they stopped taking the drug.
The FDA in 2012 approved Merck’s request to add a warning of erectile dysfunction that continued after stopping the drug, as well as “libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders.” Even so, Merck at the time said scientific evidence did not establish that Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction.
The warning prompted more than 1,100 lawsuits against Merck by men alleging their sexual problems lasted long after they stopped taking Propecia. Merck in 2018 agreed to settle most of the lawsuits consolidated before Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn federal court for a combined $4.3 million.
Reuters reported in 2019 that prior to the settlement, plaintiffs’ lawyers had alleged that Merck, when revising the drug’s original label, understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials and how long those symptoms lasted. The allegation was part of a sealed court brief a Reuters reporter was able to read because of a redaction error. The brief cited internal Merck communications, filed under seal. Reuters intervened in the case, seeking to unseal those communications.
“IMPORTANT POTENTIAL RISK”
The 2009 risk management report unsealed last month shows that while depression did not emerge as a risk in clinical trials, Merck deemed it an “important potential risk” after the company received 218 global reports of depression from 1998 to 2008. Of those, 10 involved serious depression, and an additional nine involved suicidal behavior.
Merck noted limitations with both the depression reports and the nine involving suicidal behavior. Four provided “insufficient information to allow a full evaluation.” Three of the men had other medical conditions, and for two, the symptoms developed after they stopped taking the drug.
“One fatal report was received from a sheriff’s office and described a male who committed suicide by shooting,” according to the report. “The medical examiner did not think this event was related to Propecia, in addition, the report provided insufficient information to allow for assessment.”
The report contained no additional details about the patient’s identity or the medical examiner’s investigation. Merck did not respond to questions about what steps it took to learn more about the case.
In its statement to Reuters, Merck said adverse event reports reflect only the opinions of the person who files them. “While consumers and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report adverse events, the reaction may have been related to the underlying disease being treated, or caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons,” the company said.
Dr W. Vaughn McCall, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavior at the Medical College of Georgia, agreed that relying on adverse event reports to monitor drug safety has its limitations. However, he said one of those limitations is that injuries and deaths are often underreported because people aren’t familiar with the process or don’t have time to examine a specific case.
He said there is a plausible biological explanation for a potential link between Propecia and suicidal thoughts. The drug reduces a testosterone-related hormone, which in turn could impact an anti-depressive steroid produced in the body.

“There is a reason to be suspicious,” McCall said.

(Reuters) - Companies raised $546 billion from new bond and share issues in January, as a flood of central bank money-printing and recovering stock markets brought record numbers of new listings, SPAC deals and share sales, Refinitiv data showed on Wednesday. 
The numbers included $106.15 billion in initial public offerings (IPOs), SPACs and secondary offerings, with the amount of money raised by SPACs alone soaring 20 times to $24.26 billion from a year earlier, the data showed.
Companies also raised nearly $439.9 billion in corporate debt in January, a 5% fall since the same period last year, but still the second largest January in 25 years. 
A SPAC, a shell company that raises money in an IPO before later merging with a privately held company to take the latter public, has become many investors structure of choice over the past year. 
January's haul was already 30% of a total $79 billion raised by SPACs in the whole of 2020. 
Traditional IPO volumes in the United States, however, remained higher than SPACs in January, hitting a 25-year high of $33.9 billion. 
Some 47% new bond and share issues were U.S. offerings in January this year, with China second with $23.96 billion.
Nasdaq was the clear winner among exchanges, with 167 issues raising $41.12 billion, followed by the New York Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange a close third, with both raking in a little more than $18 billion respectively.
That was in stark contrast to European financial hubs London and Frankfurt, which raised $4.29 billion and $1.72 billion respectively.

Chinese online video company Kuaishou Technology is the biggest IPO globally so far this year, raising $5.42 billion in Hong Kong, followed by Polish parcel locker business InPost SA which raised $3.40 billion in Amsterdam.

GW Pharma (NASDAQ:GWPH)'s Epidiolex, the first marijuana-derived drug to be approved in the United States, generated sales of over $500 million for the U.K.-based company last year. Analysts expect sales to breach $1 billion soon.
The drug was approved in June 2018 for use in patients aged two years and older with rare childhood-onset forms of epilepsy that are among the most resistant to treatment. It has since received wider approvals, including in children of one year and older. 
The deal took some cannabis-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by surprise. Many saw it as a seal of approval for the medical marijuana industry by traditional pharma companies.
""Today could be a notable turning point as a more traditional pharma company has agreed to purchase GW Pharma,"" said Nawan Butt, portfolio manager of the Medical Cannabis and Wellness UCITS ETF.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",Bayer reaches $2 billion deal over future Roundup cancer claims,"By Tom Hals and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) struck a $2 billion deal to resolve future legal claims that its widely used weedkiller Roundup causes cancer, the German company said on Wednesday.
    Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) has been struggling to finalize the settlement of claims that Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of cancer. Bayer inherited the business and the litigation as part of a $63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
The company has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and glyphosate are safe for human use.
Wednesday's settlement would cover future claims brought by individuals who have been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and were exposed to Roundup before their diagnosis. The settlement also includes benefits for people who were exposed to Roundup and develop the cancer in the future.
    Roundup, which Monsanto first brought to the market in 1974, is widely used by farmers across the United States and Brazil, alongside crops that are genetically engineered to withstand the its herbicidal effect.
Glyphosate will remain on the market. Bayer agreed to seek permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide a reference link on labels so consumers can find scientific studies on the weedkiller. 
Under the proposed plan, Bayer will provide $2 billion for a four-year period as compensation and to cover outreach and diagnostic assistance. Future claimants could receive up to $200,000 under the deal. 
The parties can agree to extend the settlement period. 
The company said the settlement amount was disclosed last year. 
The agreement must be approved by U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco. 
Chhabria in June questioned the legality of a prior settlement plan that Bayer proposed, which envisioned creating a panel of scientists who would rule on the viability of claims.
Under the revised deal, anyone who does not make a claim during the four-year period would then be able to sue in court, according Elizabeth Cabraser, an attorney for the proposed class. She also said anyone diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who does not like their compensation offer under the class plan can go to the court system and try for a better result.
In June, Bayer reached a wider $9.6 billion settlement that would resolve the bulk of the more than 100,000 U.S. lawsuits that were already filed over Roundup.     
    Bayer's stock has been battered by the litigation, but also by billions of euros in writedowns, and a bleaker profit outlook, in large part related to the $63 billion Monsanto takeover.

    The group last year announced 9.25 billion euros in impairment charges on agricultural assets and shocked markets by predicting a slight decline in core earnings per share in 2021 on weaker demand by farmers.

Investing.com -- Google's parent Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) jumped 8% on Wednesday after the company reported better-than-expected revenue and profit for the fourth quarter. 
Several analysts raised their price targets on the stock following the positive earnings news. Alliance Bernstein bumped its target to $2,500, reiterating its buy rating. The new target implies the stock has another 24% upside from its current price around $2077, which is a 52-week high.
Guggenheim, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), and Cowen analysts raised their price targets to $2,400. UBS raised its target to $2,300.
The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $22.30 on revenue of $56.90 billion after the closing bell on Tuesday. Analysts expected EPS of $15.90 and $53.13 billion in revenue, Alphabet’s revenue increased 23% on an annualized basis thanks to a recovery in ad spending."

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) said on Wednesday that it would invest $15 billion in affordable housing initiatives over the next five years, tripling its commitment as a booming mortgage market caused it to hit its prior goal early. 
In 2019, the second-largest U.S. lender said it would give $5 billion to 20,000 low-to-moderate income homeowners through a mix of grants and loans through 2024.
""I'm pleased to say that we've gotten a lot further than that and we already have done over $5 billion to help create 21,000 new homeowners to the commitment,"" President of Retail Steve Boland said in an interview.
The new $15 billion commitment aims to reach 60,000 new home buyers and includes down payment and closing cost grants which could provide customers with up to $17,500 to help finance their new home.
Strong mortgage demand fueled by low interest rates during the pandemic helped the bank beat its expectations, Boland said. The bank also tripled the number of dedicated community lending officers to help find new customers.
Last year, the bank also got a green light to start paying agencies that advise struggling home buyers for referrals after regulators relaxed rules barring kickbacks between such agencies and lenders that may increase the cost of buying a home.
The announcement comes against the backdrop of growing calls to address the national shortage of affordable housing amid record unemployment. The issue is also of major interest to President Joe Biden, who included a $640 billion housing plan in his campaign.

Half of the bank's outstanding home loans are to low- to moderate-income or multicultural families and communities, it said. Still, more than two thirds of its $237 billion mortgage portfolio was dedicated to jumbo loans to wealthy customers as of September, according to Inside Mortgage Finance data.

GameStop and AMC saw a collective $26.1 billion in trading last week, compared with $20 billion in WTI contracts, according to a group of RBC analysts led by Michael Tran. To be sure, a crude short squeeze appears improbable, given that positioning in WTI futures is net long at the moment, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows. Also, the barriers to entry into energy futures for non-specialists are significant.
RBC analyzed the level of oil interest within Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum over the last month and found it paltry relative to the total volume of posts. The analysts spotted 136 posts that referenced the crude market out of 6 million posts from 680,000 unique users. Of those posts, 39% expressed negative sentiment toward oil, while 20% were positive and the remaining 41% were neutral.
Even when commodities experience sudden price dislocations, things normalize in the medium term, the analysts wrote.
“Even when temporary bouts of inefficiency occur, such as when WTI prices infamously printed sub-zero last year, the extreme mispricing was exceptionally short lived before commodity investors, hedge funds or physical trading houses arbitraged away inefficiencies and reverted the market toward intrinsic value,” they wrote.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>","Daimler to spin off truck unit, give clear investor focus on Mercedes-Benz","By Nick Carey
(Reuters) - German carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) plans to spin-off Daimler Truck, the world's largest truck and bus maker, as it seeks to increase its investor appeal as a focused electric, luxury car business.
Daimler's decision to break itself up follows the example of other German companies, such as Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), after investors pressed boards to break up conglomerates. 
It also highlights efforts by the Mercedes-Benz luxury car brand to challenge Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Porsche, BMW and others in the market for electric, premium vehicles.
""This pure play luxury car company is even more attractive to investors who seek a return in that area,"" Chief Executive Ola Källenius said during a conference call Wednesday.
A final decision on the separation will be taken at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting that could be held at the end of the third quarter and the business could be listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange by the end of 2021, Daimler said.
Analysts said the breakup was logical and the truck business did not add to Daimler's share price.
""The outcome is extremely positive for all shareholders,"" Bernstein analyst Arndt Ellinghorst wrote in a client note, adding there was ""very little industrial and cultural logic for combining these two very different businesses"".
Daimler Truck delivered around half a million trucks and buses to customers in 2019 and generated 40.2 billion euros in revenue from trucks and 4.7 billion euros from buses. 
In the truck market, Daimler faces traditional rivals such as Sweden's AB Volvo, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) unit Traton and Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) Inc 
It has been racing to bring to market fully-electric heavy-duty trucks to compete with Tesla's long-awaited Semi truck model.
Truckmakers and suppliers are also working fast to roll out self-driving technology. 
Under the planned spin-off, a significant majority stake in Daimler Truck would be distributed to Daimler shareholders.

""We have confidence in the financial and operational strength of our two vehicle divisions,"" Källenius said.

The Geneva-based WEF, which last month delayed the event by 12 days in May, said on Wednesday it would now be held from Aug. 17-20.
""Although the World Economic Forum and Government of Singapore remain confident of the measures in place to ensure a safe and effective meeting, and local transmission of COVID-19 in Singapore remains at negligible levels, the change to the meeting's timing reflects the international challenges in containing the pandemic,"" it said in a statement.
Global travel restrictions have made planning difficult for an in-person meeting in the first half of the year, while differing quarantine and air transport regulations increased the lead time needed to ensure participants can join, it added.
Singapore's ministry of trade and industry said the government understood the challenges the WEF faced and had agreed to reschedule.

The annual meeting typically takes place in January in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, but the pandemic made that impossible this year.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Wednesday as strong earnings from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) revived faith in the growth narrative around technology stocks, while the hotly-traded meme stocks of last week continued to bubble in the background.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite was up 55 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, underperformed with a loss of 31 points, or 0.1%, to 30,656 points. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock was up 6.4% after the company recorded a banner quarter for Internet advertising through its search and YouTube platforms. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was flat, as blowout earnings and revenue in the fourth quarter were overshadowed by the announcement late on Tuesday that founder Jeff Bezos will step down as chief executive, to be succeeded by Andy Jassy, head of Amazon's cloud-hosting unit. The decision was taken by some as potentially signaling a shift away from the group's e-commerce roots. 
It wasn't all one-way traffic in tech, however. Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock fell 8.1% after a disappointing quarterly update, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) slipped 0.5%, still weighed on by the biggest safety recall in its short history, which affects over 150,000 vehicles. 
Elsewhere, the battle between retail investor bulls and Wall Street short sellers continued to bubble over, with the handful of heavily-shorted 'meme stocks' largely rising in early trade after losses of as much as 60% on Tuesday.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock was up 6.7%, still well above its historic 2007 record high, while AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock was up 6.3%. Koss stock was the standout name, as the maker of speakers and headsets gained just under 40%. They and others appeared to weaken as the early buy orders fizzled out. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock was the first to turn red, losing 0.5%.
Earlier, the market had had a boost from payrolls processor ADP, which said that private-sector employment had risen by 174,000 in the month through mid-January - more than three times as many as the 49,000 expected. December's figures were also revised to show a much smaller fall in employment than originally reported. The figures prime the market for an upside surprise when the official labor market report is released on Friday.
Oil and gas stocks were largely supported by the signs of unity coming out of a regular ministerial meeting of OPEC and their allies. The bloc's output restraint has whittled away global stockpiles to a point that the world market is fast approaching OPEC's shorthand definition of balance. World oil stocks are set to hit their five-year average by June, the group's technical committee said on Tuesday.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 1.7% and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 2.5%, shrugging off concerns voiced by Mizuho, whose analysts said the group needs an average oil price of $60 a barrel to meet both its capex and dividend outlays. "

The world's biggest vaccine maker by sales said on Wednesday it expected adjusted earnings to fall by a mid- to high-single digit percentage at constant exchange rates. 
Turnover for the fourth-quarter of 2020 fell 2% to 8.74 billion pounds ($11.9 billion) and adjusted earnings came in at 23.3 pence per share, both slightly higher than analysts' average forecast. 
While the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted demand for GSK's over-the-counter painkillers, it has disrupted other parts of its business as patients have made fewer trips to doctors. 
Earlier on Wednesday, GSK said it was teaming up with German biotech firm CureVac to develop a COVID-19 vaccine to target several variants of the virus with one shot.
Rather than developing its own COVID-19 shot, GSK has so far focused on supplying its vaccine booster, or adjuvant, to other drugmakers. But it has had two big setbacks, as a project with  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) was delayed, while China's Clover ended its deal with GSK on Monday. 
Meanwhile, companies using new technologies that don't require adjuvants, including Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), are already rolling out COVID-19 vaccines. 

GSK last year launched a two-year programme to split in two after the merger of its over-the-counter products business into a venture with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) that created a market leader with brands from Sensodyne toothpaste to Panadol painkillers. That will be split from its drug making business.

1270,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 07:03AM ET</span>","Nasdaq Futures Rise 100 Pts; Alphabet, Amazon in Focus","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher Wednesday, helped by strong earnings from tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as well more progress towards an additional stimulus package. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 21 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.4%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 90 points, or 0.7%. 
Strong quarterly results from tech behemoths Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) after Tuesday’s close have helped the tone Wednesday. 
Google parent Alphabet topped sales expectations for its advertising and Cloud businesses, helped in part by the pandemic, resulting in its stock climbing over 7% premarket. Online retailer Amazon reported quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time, but its stock move was tempered by the news that highly respected CEO Jeff Bezos was stepping down from the role.
Helping the positive tone was the news that Democrats have taken the first steps in Congress toward advancing President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid plan without Republican support, opening a debate on a fiscal 2021 budget resolution.
The idea of this Covid relief plan has helped buoy stock markets over the last couple of months, but it had run into opposition from Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the size and nature of the spending proposed.
Meanwhile, the recent retail-driven market turmoil which resulted in sharp gains for heavily-shorted stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME), appears to have fizzled out amid trading restrictions from major brokers.
More companies are scheduled to release results Wednesday, with earnings due from the likes of drugmakers AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) before the opening bell, as well as chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), e-commerce giant eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and online payments company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) after the market close.
The main economic data release will be the January private payroll number for January, at 8:15 AM ET (1315 GMT). This is expected to show gains of 49,000, an improvement from the drop of 123,000 in December, and will be seen as a precursor to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls. 
Oil prices traded slightly higher Wednesday, pushing to around the highest levels in a year after an unexpected fall in U.S. crude oil supply. 
The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday crude inventories fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a small build. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $55.12 a barrel, after hitting a one-year high of $55.26 on Tuesday. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $57.97, after earlier climbing to $58.05, its highest in more than 11 months.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,836.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2016.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 06:55AM ET</span>",Global stocks rise as Reddit 'tumult' comes under U.S. scrutiny,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - World shares rose on Wednesday as volatility caused by a retail trading frenzy on Wall Street subsided on expectations of tougher regulation, while optimism about U.S. fiscal stimulus also supported sentiment.
The prospect of former ECB chief Mario Draghi becoming prime minister in Italy added to the cheer, along with record sales at Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) which offset a tepid reception to news that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will step down as CEO.
The MSCI world equity index was up 0.3% by 1119 GMT, inching closer to its record peak following gains in Asia overnight and a positive open in Europe. 
World shares recovered from wild swings last week when a Reddit-driven trading fever boosted heavily shorted stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME), forcing hedge funds to reduce their equity books.
Investors were bracing for tougher U.S. markets regulation after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen asked to discuss whether trade had been consistent with fair and efficient markets. Officials were set to meet as soon as Thursday. 
""Regulators have acknowledged the tumult,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists led by Jim Reid said in a note.
Mass buying by amateur investors had lifted GameStop, the U.S. videogame retailer at the core of the frenzy, tenfold before the shares started deflating. In pre-market trade on Wednesday they were down 81% from their peak.
Markets also had renewed hopes for U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid bill after the Senate took steps to allow Democrats to pass Biden's package without Republican support.
Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures were up 0.7 and 0.4% respectively.
Shares in Alphabet rose 7% in premarket trade after Google's parent topped quarterly sales expectations for its advertising and cloud businesses.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares were however subdued premarket as the departure of Bezos raised questions about what's next for the group, overshadowing quarterly sales surging above $100 billion for the first time ever.
DRAGHI TO THE RESCUE?
Italian bonds and stocks outperformed on expectations former European Central Bank chief Draghi could become the country's next prime minister, ending weeks of political crisis.
Italy's 10-year bond yield fell more than 10 basis points to around 0.55%, its lowest in almost two weeks. It was set for its biggest one-day fall since mid-January. Italian stocks rose 2.7%, lifted by banks.
The gap between Italian and German 10-year yields narrowed to 101.7 bps from 113 bps late on Tuesday.
The head of state was set to receive Draghi at 1100 GMT and is expected to give him a mandate to put together a high-profile administration that he hopes will win the backing of a fractured parliament. 
""A Draghi-led government with a clear mandate and a wider majority is likely to be seen by investors and European partners as the most credible option to face Italy's policy challenges,"" said UBS analysts and economist led by Giovanni Montalti.
""A technocratic government represents the upside case scenario,"" they added.
Elsewhere, spot silver, which briefly surged on Monday as small traders bought up the metal, rose 0.4% to $26.7 an ounce. That was a minor rebound from an 8% tumble on Tuesday, and analysts said the retail trader-driven rally to a near eight-year peak in the previous session had faded. 
Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,835.1 per ounce.
Oil prices continued their upswing, supported by an unexpected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles and a producer estimate of a global oil market deficit this year. 
Brent crude futures hit an 11-month high and were last up 0.8% at $57.94 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures climbed 0.6% to $55.1 a barrel, just shy of a one-year high.

In foreign exchange markets, the euro hit a fresh 2-month low against the dollar, as investors looked to a widening disparity between the strength of U.S. and European pandemic recoveries.

1272,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Prospect of Draghi's Return Lifts Italian Stocks,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Italy’s stocks and bonds roared back to life on Wednesday after President Sergio Mattarella confirmed he will invite Mario Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank, to form a new government.
By mid-morning in Europe, the FTSE MIB was the standout performer in the region, gaining 2.2% to 22,560 points, while the spread between the Italian and German 10-year bond yields tightened by 11 basis points to the narrowest since 2016.  Conspicuously, Italy’s banks were much the best performers in their sector in Europe, with Unicredit (MI:CRDI) stock rising 4.7%,  Intesa Sanpaolo  SpA (MI:ISP) stock rising 5.7% and Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) stock rising 3.2%.
The moves reflect the strength of Draghi’s reputation in financial markets that goes back to the dark days of 2012 when he faced down a terrifying attack on Italy’s bond market that nearly forced it out of Europe’s currency union. It also reflects his success in sustaining asset prices with ever more radical measures to loosen monetary policy, but overlooks his failure over eight years to arrest a long-term downward trend in inflation.
Mattarella is due to meet Draghi at 12 PM local time in Rome (5 AM ET, 1100 GMT), with a view to installing him as the head of a government of national unity. That follows the collapse last month of the previous coalition of center-left parties with the 5 Stars Movement.
If he accepts, Draghi will face a difficult task: the structural reforms he called for at every ECB press conference for eight years were constantly resisted by Italy’s main parties, who knew they would be unelectable if they enacted them. As a result, Italy still has the worst growth record of all the major European economies and, despite some improvements under Matteo Renzi and Giuseppe Conte, one of its highest jobless rates too.
The big question is whether Draghi, 73, will want to repeat the experience of Mario Monti, the technocratic prime minister who hauled Italy out of its last crisis (with Draghi’s help) in 2012/13. Monti’s reward for his efforts was to be demonized as a lackey of the European establishment putting Brussels’ and Berlin’s interests ahead of his country’s.
That line of polemic helped shape Italy’s current political landscape, with both 5 Stars and the right-wing Lega party of Matteo Salvini drawing much of their energy from the populist urges nurtured by Monti’s austerity. Both parties are only likely to support a Draghi government to the extent that they believe they can dodge the anger his reforms are likely to provoke. Both will find it easy to stoke suspicions that he intends to deliver Italy into the hands of the Commission’s bailout police.
Draghi has two big advantages over Monti. First, Italy is set to receive over 200 billion euros from the EU’s Recovery Fund, a measure of direct fiscal support that Monti never enjoyed; second, Draghi has more capital with the ECB than any other Italian and can be assured of its unequivocal support in any likely scenario.  Thirdly, Draghi’s achievements in 2012, averting Italy’s financial ruin, would ensure his premiership starts with more domestic political capital than Monti’s.
However, the challenge he faces is essentially the same one, of reconciling a stagnant, ageing country to the need of radical reform. Even Super Mario will struggle to meet that."

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 04:40AM ET</span>",Elon Musk's banter with Robinhood CEO triggers stampede for Clubhouse app,"By Jane Lanhee Lee, Elizabeth Culliford and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - A surprise chat between tech billionaire Elon Musk and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev on new audio-based social network Clubhouse has helped propel the app to the top of the startup charts and sparked a scramble for invitations to the exclusive service.
The interaction between the two entrepreneurs on the platform on Sunday came amid intense interest in news around Robinhood, the online brokerage caught up in a wild stockmarket battle between retail investors and big Wall Street funds.
Demand for invitations to the less-than-a-year-old service -- members get to invite a limited number of friends during its pre-launch period -- is so hot, a market for them has grown on platforms like Reddit, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and Craigslist.
In China, invitations are being sold on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s second-hand market place Idle Fish, even though Clubhouse isn't available in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s app store in that country.
In Japan investors, tech workers and the media have swarmed the service.
As of Tuesday, data analytics firm Sensor Tower said there were about 3.6 million installs worldwide for the app--only available on Apple's iPhone--with 1.1 million of them coming in the last six days.
Investors were so eager for a piece of the action that at one point on Monday they pushed up shares in Clubhouse Media Group, a completely unrelated stock, by 117%.
Chinese tech firm Agora Inc, listed on Nasdaq, saw its shares jump 30% on media reports that it may be a technology partner to Clubhouse. Agora declined to comment while a Clubhouse spokeswoman declined to comment on questions about technology partners.
The San Francisco-based company's latest round of financing in Jan. 24 valued the company at $1 billion, a source familiar with the matter said. The funding was led by Andreessen Horowitz, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm.
CLUBBY
Amid the buzz, Clubhouse has also drawn backlash from those who criticize the closed-door nature of chats like the one between Musk and Tenev.
Jessica Lessin, editor-in-chief of tech news outlet The Information tweeted that Marc Andreessen, a founding partner of Andreessen Horowitz, which also backs Robinhood, had blocked many reporters from listening in on Musk's talk.
The chat between Musk and Tenev took place on a regular Clubhouse event called ""The Good Time Show.""
Andreessen Horowitz didn't reply to Reuters' request for comment on this issue.
However, Clubhouse CEO Paul Davidson told Bloomberg TV on Monday event hosts could choose who is allowed to listen, underscoring concerns about the clubby nature of the app.
Andreessen Horowitz separately said in a blog in January that it was launching new ""media property,"" adding to its already active podcasting and blogging activities.
Clubhouse aspires to make the app widely available, and foresees business opportunities in subscriptions or tickets to events like the one Musk starred in.
It will have to contend with moderating the kind of site abuses, from hate speech to harassment, that major social media platforms face. Clubhouse has been criticized over reports of harassment and hate speech in its rooms, some of which are private and some public.
A spokeswoman for the app said it has already banned some individual users from the platform for violating its rules but declined to share more details.
The company has said it does not allow racism, hate speech, sexism and abuse on the network, though it says it does allow ""general rudeness."" It has said users who found clubs on the app will be able to set rules for their communities.

The Clubhouse spokeswoman said it currently has about 10 staff. The company has said it is investing in tools that detect and prevent abuse as well as features for users to moderate.

GameStop, the poster child for Redditors looking to squeeze short sellers, plunged 60% Tuesday, and has now erased more than $27 billion in market value from last week’s intraday high of $483.

GameStop’s rapid retreat has coincided with a sharp reduction in short interest after bearish investors appeared to cover their positions. That has loosened a squeeze on the stock caused by day traders who used Reddit forums to tout and bid up out-of-favor stocks that also included American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd.
“The loss of momentum in the short-squeeze frenzy highlights that triggering such reverberation in the market is not easy, after all,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, said in written comments. “We could wait a while before seeing a similar phenomenon in the future.”
GameStop has now given up more than 80% of the sharp gains that were fueled by last month’s attack on short sellers. Even with the latest pullback, however, the Grapevine, Texas-based retailer is still up 377% year-to-date, based on most recent closing values.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 03:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's FAW considers acquiring BMW partner Brilliance for about $7.2 billion - sources,"By Julie Zhu
(Reuters) - FAW Group is looking at acquiring Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd for about $7.2 billion in a two-stage deal that would see BMW's main Chinese partner taken private, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Brilliance shares soared by as much as a quarter in value following the news.
The potential acquisition by state-owned FAW, China's No. 2 automaker, comes at a time when Brilliance's top shareholder Huachen Automotive Group is on the brink of bankruptcy, having defaulted on 6.5 billion yuan ($1 billion) in debt obligations late last year. 
Under plans being discussed, FAW would first purchase 30.43% of Brilliance owned by Huachen and 11.89% held by the state-controlled Liaoning Provincial Transportation Investment Group, said the sources.
It would then make a mandatory bid for the rest of Brilliance's shares. It is considering offering about HK$11 per share for both stages of the deal, representing a 70% premium to its average share price over the past month of HK$6.48. 
To conduct the deal, FAW is looking at setting up an offshore investment vehicle and is inviting other investors to participate, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the discussions were confidential.
FAW and BMW declined to comment. Brilliance and Liaoning Provincial Transportation Investment Group did not respond to requests for comment. 
Huachen said the information was false but did not elaborate. Liaoning province's state asset regulator, which owns a majority stake in Huachen, said it has not been in contact with FAW about a potential take-private deal for Brilliance.
Reuters reported in September that Liaoning Provincial Transportation Investment Group was planning to lead a consortium of Chinese state-backed investors to take Brilliance private. However, the plan has been put on hold due to differences in valuations and financing difficulties, said one of the people. 
Brilliance, based in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province, and BMW have 50-50 joint venture, BMW Brilliance Automotive, which accounts for nearly all of Brilliance's profits. But BMW plans to lift its stake by another 25% for 3.6 billion euros next year, taking control of the venture.
Based on that plan, first announced in 2018, Brilliance's stake is worth 7.2 billion euros ($8.7 billion), far more than its current market value. Brilliance's shares finished Wednesday trade 13% higher, giving it a market capitalisation of around $4.7 billion.
Huachen's debt woes have weighed heavily on Brilliance and the sources said prospective investors believe that the company is undervalued. 
Before Wednesday, it was trading at 2.8 times forward earnings, far below the industry's median multiple of 14, according to Refinitiv data. 
Brilliance also owns 51% of a venture with France's Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) making vans and sport-utility vehicles, and has a stake in an auto-financing firm.
FAW, based in Changchun, Jilin province, partners with Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp to make passenger vehicles in China. It also makes heavy duty trucks under its own brand. 
The potential acquisition would add to a surge in deals where strategic investors and buyout firms have tapped Hong Kong companies for take-private opportunities. Buyers often cite undervalued shares as a reason for the deals.

The total value of buyouts of Hong Kong-listed companies reached $25 billion last year, up 190% from 2019 and the highest level since 2017. The number of such transactions - at 60 - was also an annual record, Refinitiv data showed.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 02:50AM ET</span>","Alibaba beats revenue forecast, shares slide amid regulatory challenges","By Chavi Mehta and Josh Horwitz
(Reuters) - China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd beat estimates for third-quarter revenue on a pandemic-driven jump in e-commerce, but its shares dropped amid regulatory heat for founder Jack Ma's business empire.
It also announced a bond sale worth as much as $5 billion though sources have said plans for the fundraising were in the works before the regulatory clampdown.
Ma's current woes stem from an Oct. 24 speech in which he blasted China's regulatory system, leading to the suspension of his Ant Group's $37 billion IPO just days before the fintech giant's listing.
Regulators have since launched an anti-trust probe into the tech sector, while tighter regulations for Ant are also being considered.
Ma, who has been keeping an uncharacteristically low profile these past three months, was also conspicously snubbed this week by his omission in a state media list of entrepreneurial leaders.
Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said changing regulations for internet and fintech firms in China presented a near-term challenge. 
""We regard this as important opportunities for re-assessing and improving business practices,"" he told an earnings call.
Alibaba also said it was ""unable to complete a fair assessment"" of the impact that Ant's stalled IPO will have on the company. Zhang said, however, that any potential reduction in consumer credit offerings from Ant would not have an impact on Alibaba's e-commerce business.
Shares in Alibaba dropped 4% in Hong Kong on Wednesday, having closed down nearly as much on the New York Stock Exchange.
Alibaba's total revenue rose 37% to 221.1 billion yuan ($34.2 billion) in the three months ended Dec. 31, above analysts' estimates of 214.4 billion yuan, according IBES data from Refinitiv.
Core commerce revenue from its main e-commerce sites rose 38% to a record high of 195.5 billion yuan, powered by the company's Chinese operations.
In November, Alibaba's China-focused Singles Day sale - the world's biggest online shopping event that eclipses the revenues generated on U.S. shopping holidays Black Friday and Cyber Monday - registered sales of $74 billion.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was 79.4 billion yuan, or 28.85 yuan per American depository share, compared to 52.3 billion yuan, or 19.55 yuan per ADS, a year earlier.
Revenue for cloud computing rose 50% year on year, hitting 16.12 billion yuan, with the division posting positive EBITA for the first time.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Prominent hedge funds including Dan Sundheim's D1 Capital Partners and Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management chalked up deep losses last month as hotly traded GameStop (NYSE:GME) hurt returns while others like Jason Mudrick's Mudrick Capital posted gains during January's turbulent trading, investors in the funds said on Tuesday.
The bulk of January's hedge fund returns were influenced by a late-month rally in unloved stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). The Standard & Poor's 500 index ended January down 1.1%, with the vaccine rollout and stimulus plans a large focus for the month. 
Melvin Capital, one of the biggest funds betting on a drop in GameStop's share price, lost 53% in January when the stock price was forced higher by an army of retail investors using the Robinhood online trading app.
Other funds like Point72, which invests with Melvin Capital, lost nearly 9% and D1 tumbled 20% while Maplelane, which was also short GameStop, lost 45%, people familiar with the returns said. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital lost 11%.
Citadel lost 3%, a person familiar with the returns said on Sunday. Balyasny Asset Management, was down 0.5%, an investor in the fund said.
William Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings, which holds only a handful of stocks and does not traditionally bet that stock prices will drop by shorting, lost 1.3% in January as many stocks sold off amid the trading turbulence.
But there were winners too. Mudrick Capital posted its best month ever with a 9.8% gain after a 11.2% gain in 2020, a person familiar with the returns said. Mudrick is not a short seller and is seen as a hero to the retail crowd for having rescued AMC Entertainment with clever financing. 
Dinakar Singh's Axon Capital, which bet last year that a vaccine would soon boost travel, posted an 8.5% gain in January and is up another 8% in the first two days of February, a person familiar with the returns said.
ExodusPoint, a multi-strategy fund founded in 2017 by Michael Gelband and Hyung Lee that now manages $13.5 billion, gained 1.2% last month. Rick Gerson's Falcon Edge Capital, a $4 billion fund that returned 43% last year, gained 4.3% in January.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>",Column: Basking in 'pseudo wealth'? - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - If ""pseudo wealth"" is a source of often unexplained economic volatility, then the financial rollercoaster accompanying the pandemic has many wild rides in store.
The theory of ""pseudo wealth"" - developed by Nobel laureate Joe Stiglitz and others - riffs off the idea people's consumption is altered by assumptions about future gains or even losses in investments or asset bets. 
But unlike other economic models that fall back on mysterious animal spirits or wealth effects for unfathomable ebbs and flows, this contends that there is no shared feeling or common rationale - but differing beliefs about the future that spur asset price speculation as they diverge. 
The wider the dispersion of expectations, the bigger the capacity for economic turbulence absent any particular shock. This then blows financial bubbles or traps economies in slumps.
The paper published last week doesn't reference recent events per se, but Stiglitz wrote that when there are enough opportunities for trade and large enough dispersions in beliefs ""this perceived wealth may be dangerously untethered from either market wealth or the real wealth of the economy"".
The eye-popping and sometimes puzzling surge in technology stocks or crypto-currencies to unprecedented valuations during one of the biggest global downturns in history last year may speak to that - even if many argue that it's a rational response to lockdowns, fiscal spending and historically cheap borrowing. 
But the shenanigans of the last couple of weeks in beaten down small caps spotlights a dispersion of ideas with little common turf amid another market-wide volatility storm.

For a graphic on Mean VIX:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbexdmvq/VIXmean.png
VOLATILTY STORM 
Taking multiple closes above 30% in the VIX index of implied S&P500 volatility as a measure, there have been four such episodes in just 12 months. The prior four spikes took 10 years.
Perhaps more importantly, the VIX has not returned below its 30-year mean since Feb. 21 last year. 
A pandemic shock will do that of course. But the latest bout of angst is not based on any particular fundamental of slump or recovery - more on a speculative game between individual, often amateur, punters and big Wall St firms over bombed-out equity in ailing companies and crowded trades in general.
Should anyone else care about the jousting or will it all average out to nothing? And what does it say about untethered pseudo wealth?
Some clearly think the volatility and speculative frenzy is just a symptom of cheap credit, excess money and the blanket cash injections supporting households during lockdown - just too much money chasing a quick buck with unforeseen consequences.
Others see it as a vignette in the pandemic saga - but one that signals a power shift in financial markets - individuals wresting some control from hedge funds and brokers in money-making transactions. 
Federal Reserve officials appear keener to dismiss it.
Echoing Fed chief Jerome Powell last week, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari on Monday said the saga had nothing to do with ultra-loose Fed policy and stock markets just go up and down all the time for any number of reasons.
One group of speculators battling another was part of the mix, Kashkari said, adding: ""If they make money, fine. And if they lose money, that's on them.""
His colleague and Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan rowed back slightly on Tuesday and said it may be wise to acknowledge it was at least something to do with the liquidity flood. 
And many market economists also think it's too blase for policymakers to ignore micro bubble bursts out of hand and insist there are potential economic consequences.
""Although this is a relatively small amount of people affected, loss aversion will exaggerate the scale of their losses,"" said UBS economist Paul Donovan. ""And of course generally, this is taking money from the many and giving it to the few.""
For Stigliz, swings in pseudo wealth can't be treated as just noise and have economic policy implications - if not in monetary policy then in regulation over the variety and avenues of speculation.
""Expanding the set of betting opportunities - in the way that financial liberalisation and structured finance has allowed - may well increase the level and volatility of pseudo wealth,"" he wrote. ""Making short-sales easier, while it may reduce the volatility of market wealth, may increase that of pseudo wealth.""
In the GameStop battle between short-selling hedge funds and crowds of online Reddit users using fairly sophisticated options plays on widely-available trading apps, the avenues of speculation have clearly opened up well beyond Wall Street.
Some dismiss retail options punting as simply buying lottery tickets with money you can afford to lose if you're number doesn't come in.
Yet all would appear to be wallowing in considerable pseudo wealth if one or the other group loses out. 
If it's just located in these highly-shorted small cap stocks, the strain may be easy to absorb. If it's the wider stock market at record highs, then regulators need to look long and hard.

1289,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 02:06AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Higher; Draghi Return in Focus,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Wednesday, helped by progress towards further U.S. stimulus and the vaccine rollout, but disappointing Chinese data may limit gains.
Italian stocks are likely to take the spotlight later after President Sergio Mattarella asked former European Central Bank Governor Mario Draghi to form a government of national unity, something that would end the latest political crisis in Rome. FTSE MIB futures were up 2.7% as of 2:25 AM ET (0725 GMT).
Elsewhere, the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
In the U.S., the Senate began debating a budget resolution for the 2021 fiscal year on Tuesday, the first step towards passing a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden without Republican support.
The Senate voted along party lines, with Democrats edging out Republicans 50-49, to open debate on a fiscal 2021 budget resolution with coronavirus aid spending instructions. 
Additionally, the roll-out of vaccines in many countries is slowly gathering pace: the U.K. has now  inoculated 10 million of its population, although health authorities remain concerned by the spread of new variants of the Covid-19 virus. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has agreed to deliver nine million more doses of its vaccine to the European Union in the first quarter of this year, a region which has been slow on the inoculation uptake.
Dampening spirits somewhat, January’s Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index, released earlier Wednesday, came in at 52, against December’s 56.3, suggesting a slow down in the recovery in the world’s second largest economy.
The Eurozone composite PMI for January will be published later, as well as inflation numbers for January.
Earnings season continues apace, with the likes of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), Volvo (ST:VOLVb),  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN),  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and Publicis (PA:PUBP) all reporting. 
Oil prices traded mixed, still around the highest levels in a year after an unexpected fall in U.S. crude oil supply. The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday crude inventories fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a small build. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the day.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, said on Tuesday it expects oil stockpiles to fall below their five-year average by June, an important milestone in its campaign to rebalance the market.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $54.99 a barrel, after hitting a one-year high of $55.26 on Tuesday. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $57.78, after earlier climbing to $58.05, its highest in more than 11 months.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,839.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2040.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of 15 U.S. senators on Tuesday including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican John Cornyn urged the White House to work with Congress to address the global semiconductor shortage that is hampering auto manufacturing.
The senators, from key auto states like Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and South Carolina, in a letter to the White House warned the ""shortage threatens our post-pandemic economic recovery.""
Automakers around the world are shutting assembly lines because of problems in the delivery of semiconductors, which have been exacerbated in some cases by the former Trump administration's actions against Chinese chip factories.
The shortage has impacted Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers.
""We believe that the incoming administration can continue to play a helpful role in alleviating the worst impacts of the shortage on American workers,"" the senators wrote.
A U.S. spokeswoman for Nissan said Tuesday the automaker made some short-term production adjustments because of the shortage ""starting with three non-production days on the truck line at our Canton, Mississippi, facility."" 
The senators, including auto caucus chairs Democrat Sherrod Brown and Republican Rob Portman, urged the White House ""to support efforts to secure the necessary funding to swiftly implement the semiconductor-related provisions in the most recent National Defense Authorization Act, which would boost the production of semiconductor manufacturing and incent the domestic production of semiconductors in the future.""
Matt Blunt, who heads the American Automotive Policy Council representing U.S. automakers, praised the senators ""who recognize it is a significant challenge for the auto sector."" 
The White House did not immediately comment.
Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), and other major tech firms, is at the center of efforts to resolve the shortage.
Taiwanese companies have pledged to ramp up production and the government has urged them to address the problem.
Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua will hold a virtual meeting with the United States at the end of this week to discuss supply chains, with semiconductor firms present, her office said last Friday.

Automakers around the world are adjusting assembly lines caused by the shortages and have cut some production, caused by manufacturing delays that some semiconductor makers blame on a faster-than expected recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
In 2019, automotive groups accounted for roughly a tenth of the $429 billion semiconductor market, according to McKinsey.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is calling a meeting of top financial regulators this week to discuss market volatility driven by retail trading in shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) , silver and other stocks favored on social media.
Yellen will convene the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Treasury said on Tuesday.
Yellen sought and received permission from ethics lawyers before calling the meeting, according to a document seen by Reuters, along with clearance to engage on wide-ranging issues in the financial services industry. 
Yellen's decision to seek the waiver followed a report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-treasury-yellen-analys/analysis-gamestop-saga-may-provide-early-test-of-biden-administration-ethics-pledges-idUSKBN2A125E by Reuters that because of speaking fees she was paid by a key player in the GameStop saga, hedge fund Citadel LLC, she may need permission to deal with matters involving the firm.
A Treasury official, who declined to be identified by name, said the meeting would be held this week, possibly as early as Thursday.
""Secretary Yellen believes the integrity of markets is important and has asked for a discussion of recent volatility in financial markets and whether recent activities are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets,"" Treasury spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna said in a statement to Reuters.
VOLATILITY CONCERNS
Yellen's action comes after days of gyrations in the shares of video-game retailer GameStop, headphone maker Koss Corp, cinema chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and other stocks and commodities favored on the Reddit social media site's Wall Street Bets forum.
Retail traders last week bid up the shares to force short-sellers, who profit if a stock falls, to close their positions at massive losses, sending GameStop to a dizzying high of $483. 
But GameStop crashed back to earth, closing down 60% at $90 on Tuesday, leaving many traders with huge losses. Silver prices also fell.
The SEC last week warned https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-market-volatility-2021-01-29 that ""extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence.""
The Federal Reserve Board declined to comment and the SEC, New York Fed and CFTC did not respond to queries about the meeting late on Tuesday.
The Treasury official said Yellen was looking for an update from the top U.S. financial regulators. The meeting signals heightened concern about the volatility just a week after Yellen was sworn in as the first female U.S. Treasury secretary.
The saga is likely to expedite a regulatory review of the ever-larger role played by non-bank firms in the financial markets, regulatory experts say.
One of these is Citadel, which extended hedge fund Melvin Capital a $2.75 billion lifeline last week after the latter firm suffered massive losses in short positions.
Yellen earned more than $700,000 in speaking fees from Citadel, as recently as last fall. In an ethics agreement https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/18A4D129DD5675888525864F0081071C/$FILE/Yellen,%20Janet%20L.%20final%20EA.pdf, she pledged not to involve herself in specific matters involving the firm - as well as major banks including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) - without first seeking authorization.
MARKETS, SECTOR CLEARANCE
Treasury ethics attorneys have given Yellen flexibility to work on any related markets or broad financial services sector issues, with no limits on current or future matters, the Treasury official said. She may need to seek further authorization to deal with specific firms she listed.
In the memo granting Yellen permission to call the meeting of regulators, a Treasury ethics official, Brian Sonfield, said it would be ""difficult, if not impossible"" for Yellen to recuse herself from matters involving market volatility. 
""You are the Secretary of the Treasury, the duties of which require you to be involved in a broad array of matters focused on these sectors,"" Sonfield wrote.

""Issues relating to these sectors could arise at any time without the opportunity for consultation with the ethics office,"" and ""argue in favor of prior authorization.""

(Reuters) -Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said Tuesday that while the Fed's massive bond-buying program is creating plenty of liquidity in financial markets, there are no signs of broad market instability at present.
""I don't see anything right now systemic,"" Kaplan said in a CNBC interview, responding to a question about a possible link between the Reddit-fueled frenzy in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares and monetary policy. Kaplan did not comment on GameStop directly, and instead addressed the broader question of how Fed policy affects financial markets.
""Some of the current situation you are seeing - one of the factors - is there is a lot of liquidity, and some of that relates to Fed purchases of $80 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities every month: I think it's wise for us to acknowledge that."" 
The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since last March and has pledged to keep them there until the economy has returned to full employment and inflation has reached, and is on track to overshoot, the Fed's 2% goal. 
It has also said it will keep buying at least $120 billion of bonds each month until there is ""substantial further progress"" toward the Fed's full employment and 2% inflation goals, a benchmark that Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida has said may not be reached until next year. 
The bond-buying and low interest rates are aimed at making borrowing cheap and boosting investment and hiring to blunt the economic fallout of the pandemic. Critics say it can distort markets and create dangerous asset bubbles.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said it is ""premature"" to consider reducing the Fed's bond-buying program, given the millions of Americans still out of work. 

Kaplan said Tuesday he supports the Fed's current ""aggressive"" policy.
""I still think we need to be doing what we are doing right now, in the teeth of the pandemic, but again, I think if we go beyond it, it will be healthier to start limiting this liquidity and normalizing policy down the road,"" Kaplan said.

Market experts have raised questions about whether the trading controversy around GameStop and Robinhood could help erode investor trust and the integrity of financial markets. As Treasury secretary, Yellen is chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was set up in the wake of the global financial crisis to monitor systemic risks. This week’s meeting about GameStop is not a formal FSOC meeting.
GameStop, a video-game retailer, was one of a handful of companies whose shares began soaring in late January, driven by an army of retail investors active on the online forums hosted by Reddit. Some investors openly called on others to bid up the shares of certain names in order to trigger losses for hedge funds that had bet their prices would fall.
GameStop shares went from $19.95 to a peak of $347.51 on Jan. 27 in just 10 trading days, and with no meaningful change in the company’s profit outlook. It has since swung wildly and fell 60% to close at $90 on Tuesday.
The wild trading has left politicians in both parties in two branches of government grasping for responses to the new phenomenon of retail investors banding together on social media.
On Monday, the House Financial Services Committee announced that it would hold a hearing on Feb. 18 regarding “recent market volatility” involving GameStop and other companies.

1295,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 09:44PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Mixed Over Disappointing China Data,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning. The previous week’s retail trading that fueled volatility in heavily shorted shares stabilized, companies reported better-than-estimated revenue and progress was made in passing more U.S. stimulus measures, which all helped boost sentiment However, this was damped by disappointing data from China.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.28% by 9:36 PM ET (2:36 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.27%.
January’s Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 52, against December’s 56.3. The release follows disappointing economic data released earlier in the week suggesting a slowdown in the Chinese economic recovery. The Caixin manufacturing PMI was 51.5, the manufacturing PMI at 51.3 and the non-manufacturing PMI at 52.4 respectively.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.61%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.67% and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.43%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.10%.
U.S. shares rose after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported better-than-estimated revenue. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will also step down from the role in the third quarter of 2021 and will be replaced by Andy Jassy, currently the CEO at Amazon Web Services.
The collapse in Reddit speculative trades that saw shares in  GameStop Corp  . (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) fall sharply also gave shares a boost.
""The fact that markets have cooled down a bit with the retail-trading frenzy, that’s giving a little bit of optimism. Anytime there’s more stability to markets, there’s a breath of relief of all investors,” Verdence Capital Advisors director of portfolio strategy Megan Horneman told Bloomberg.
“Wallstreetbets is hitting the point of diminishing value … retail traders will still be a force to be reckoned with, but we are perhaps past the peak you-only-live-once world with the cat out of the bag,” AxiCorp Financial Services Chief Global Markets Strategist Stephen Innes told Reuters.
Treasury yields edged higher as progress was made towards further U.S. stimulus measures. The Senate began debating a budget resolution for the 2021 fiscal year on Tuesday. The debate is the first step towards passing a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden via a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold required for most legislation.
All this increased optimism about a global economic recovery from COVID-19 in 2021.
“All the ingredients for a rapid recovery from the second quarter onwards are getting sweetly baked into the reopening party cake,” said AxiCorp’s Innes.
However, other investors struck a more cautious note. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). analysts issued a warning about rising bullishness, saying that a sentiment indicator is close to hitting a “sell” signal.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) analysts expressed concerned over elevated earnings expectations, noting that share prices may be ahead of themselves by about 10%.
The Bank of England will hand down its policy decision on Thursday. The U.S. payrolls report for January, including non-farm payrolls, will be released on Friday."
1296,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 08:26PM ET</span>",Bezos to give Amazon reins to cloud boss Jassy as sales rocket past $100 billion,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos will step down as CEO and become executive chairman, naming the head of its lucrative cloud computing division as successor in a sign of the company's transformation from web retailer to internet conglomerate.
This summer, Bezos, 57, will hand the keys of the world's largest online retailer to Andy Jassy, head of its cloud division Amazon Web Services known as AWS. The announcement on Tuesday settles a long-running question about who would replace the world's second-richest person at the company's helm.
Bezos is ending his role as CEO on a high note: the business he began as an internet bookseller 27 years ago is now one of the world's most valuable companies and posted three consecutive record profits after losses in decades prior. On Tuesday, Amazon reported quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time.
Jassy, 53, joined Amazon in 1997 after Harvard Business School, founding AWS and growing it to a cloud platform used by millions of customers, the company's website said. He had been a clear contender for the top job since Amazon created two CEO roles reporting to Bezos years ago, the other held by recently retired consumer CEO Jeff Wilke.
Tom Johnson, chief transformation officer at global marketing firm Mindshare, said Jassy's promotion underscored the centrality of the web hosting business to Amazon's strategy.
""Jassy’s background in steering AWS shows just how top of mind those services are to Amazon's business strategy. It’ll be interesting to see how that affects their strategy and balancing that priority with a growing ad business and the commerce behemoth,"" he said.
Jassy is known for understanding highly technical details and has regularly taken jabs at legacy player  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and cloud rival  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), which AWS continues to exceed in sales. Bezos has made fewer public remarks about competitors.
Under Jassy's leadership, Amazon's cloud business has signed major customers including Verizon (NYSE:VZ), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON). Silicon Valley startups have long relied on AWS, and the division's annual revenue grew 37% in 2019 and 30% in 2020, helping cement its position as the market leader. 
One contract AWS failed to win was the $10 billion ""JEDI"" project from the Pentagon, which was awarded to Microsoft.
Jassy has aimed to bestow a rock-star aura to keynotes at AWS's annual Las Vegas conference, speaking before over 60,000 attendees in 2019 after upbeat music preceded his talk.
Bezos, who already has focused on other personal enterprises in years past, said in a note to employees posted on Amazon's website, ""As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions."" Blue Origin is Bezos' space company.
He added, ""I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring.""
Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts that Bezos would work on ""large one-way door issues,"" such as acquisitions and other strategies where there is a high cost to reversing course.
COVID SPENDING DOWN
Amazon's net sales rose to $125.6 billion as consumers turned to the world's largest online retailer for their holiday shopping, beating analyst estimates of $119.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Amazon shares were up less than 1% in after-hours trading.
Jassy's AWS, traditionally a bright spot, fell slightly short of expectations in the fourth quarter. While the cloud computing division recently announced deals with ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC), the BMW Group and others, it posted revenue of $12.7 billion, short of the $12.8 billion analysts had estimated.
Amazon said it was not naming an AWS replacement for Jassy at this time.
Meanwhile Amazon's e-commerce business has never been as big. Since the start of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, consumers have turned to Amazon for delivery of home staples and medical supplies. While brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors, Amazon recruited over 400,000 more workers to keep up with demand.
That has placed the Seattle-based company at the center of workplace tumult. More than 19,000 have contracted COVID-19 as of September, and some staff have protested and demanded facility closures. Others, at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse, are seeking to be the first at the company to unionize in the United States, with an election to begin next week.
Olsavsky told reporters on a conference call that costs associated with the pandemic in the first quarter are expected to total $2 billion, down from $4 billion in the fourth quarter as shopping volumes decrease. The company has taken an array of COVID-19 precautions and written government officials - including U.S. President Joe Biden - saying it is eager to offer vaccine shots to staff.
A boost in revenue came from moving Amazon's marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, lengthening the holiday shopping season.

Net sales for the current quarter are expected to be between $100 billion and $106 billion.

""A key element of our Transformation work is to hold our business leaders accountable not only for the performance of their own teams, but for how we collectively operate our firm and deliver the outcomes for which we are responsible,"" Fraser said in a memo.
The team will consist of Fraser's executive management team, the group's treasurer and leaders of Citigroup's various units, including its investment-banking unit, Global Wealth operations and U.S. consumer unit.
Fraser added that Sunil Garg, global head of Citi Commercial Bank, will become the next CEO of Citibank, upon current Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat's retirement.
""Sunil also will chair the Risk and Controls project group of our Transformation effort,"" the memo said.
Citi will conduct a search for Garg's successor as the CEO of its commercial bank.
Citigroup has asked Zdenek Turek, who was the Chief Risk Officer on an interim basis, to take on the role permanently, according to the memo.
Fraser also named Margo Pilic as her chief of staff, moving her from her current role of Finance Lead for Citi's institutional clients group in Latin America.

Last year, Citi named current president Jane Fraser as its next chief executive making her the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank. She will take the reins from CEO Michael Corbat on March 1 when he retires.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>",Alphabet's Google posts record sales as retailers shell out for ads,"By Paresh Dave and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc on Tuesday topped quarterly sales expectations for its advertising and Cloud businesses, helped in part by the pandemic, and said it will resume big spending on hiring and facility construction.
Alphabet shares jumped about 8% to $2,067 in extended trading. 
Google, which generates more revenue from internet advertising than any other company, benefited from lockdowns that drove retail and other clients online, helping offset cutbacks by travel and entertainment advertisers.
""Google's products and support have been a lifeline for millions of small medium businesses hit hard by the pandemic,"" Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on a conference call.
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat described the fourth quarter as a ""great end to a challenging year.""
Alphabet's 2020 sales growth of 13% was the slowest increase since 2009 when it posted 8.5% growth. Still, matched with spending cuts, Alphabet increased its cash hoard by $17 billion in 2020 to $137 billion.
But now with coronavirus vaccines deployed and advertising spending on the uptick, Porat and other executives said the company would return to expanding the Google Cloud business with staff and data centers and incorporating artificial intelligence into more services.
In a new disclosure, Alphabet said Google Cloud posted an operating loss of $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter and a $5.6 billion loss for 2020, about 21% steeper than 2019's annual loss.
Google has long faced questions over whether it can spin the cash from its advertising business into a newly profitable venture. Pichai acknowledged that reaching that goal may take some time.
Aided by $3 billion in unrealized startup investment gains, Alphabet's fourth-quarter profit rose 43% to $15.2 billion, or $22.30 per share, beating estimates of $15.95 per share. 
Google's advertising business, including YouTube, accounted for 81% of Alphabet's record $56.9 billion in quarterly sales, which rose 23% compared with a year ago. 
Cloud sales, also benefiting from the pandemic, were $3.83 billion, or $13.1 billion for the full year, up 46% from 2019.
Analysts tracked by Refinitiv had estimated quarterly revenue of $53.1 billion and Cloud sales of $3.82 billion.
Alphabet said it expects a $2.1 billion boost to operating results in 2021 after a new assessment extended the useful life of its servers and networking gear by a year or more.
Graphic: Google content, data costs soar - https://graphics.reuters.com/ALPHABET-RESULTS/dgkvlkynqpb/
COSTS, SCRUTINY SOW CONCERNS
Alphabet remains undervalued compared with some rivals.  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares trade at 10 times expected revenue over the next 12 months and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) seven times, while Alphabet shares about six times.
Rising costs, increased competition and a line of regulatory battles are among big concerns for Alphabet investors.
Alphabet’s costs to license programming for YouTube, operate data centers and stock consumer products have soared in recent years. Those other costs of revenue now account for about 27 cents for every $1 in sales, up from 23 cents four years ago. 
Google's lead over the global internet advertising market is shrinking as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) becomes a bigger threat and China-focused vendors such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) grow quickly. Last week, research company eMarketer estimated Google will capture 30% of the market in 2021 while increasing sales by 18% to $117 billion. 
Google is fighting antitrust investigations or charges across Australia, Asia, Europe and North America.
In addition, Google has threatened to pull its search engine from Australia if the country enforces new rules that would require the company to negotiate fair payments to news publishers to include their content in results.

Analysts also have expressed concern about potential revisions to content moderation and data privacy laws under new U.S. President Joe Biden. Those laws currently favor companies such as Google.

(Reuters) -  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) on Tuesday raised its annual sales outlook, betting on strong sales of its sports titles including ""FIFA 21"" and ""Madden NFL 21"" as more people turn to videogames to keep themselves entertained during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Shares of the company, however, fell 5% in extended trading after EA's 98 cents adjusted profit forecast for the current quarter missed analysts' average estimate by 2 cents.
Videogame sales in the United States hit a record $56.9 billion last year, according to research firm NPD, as demand for virtual entertainment soared after major public events were canceled to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.
EA said new players on its battle royale game ""Apex Legends"" jumped 30% year-over-year. The soft launch of its mobile version is expected in the next three to six months, Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgenson told Reuters.
The company also extended its multi-year licensing agreement with UEFA for exclusive club competition rights for its ""FIFA"" franchise, adding that the latest soccer title would launch on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s cloud gaming service, Stadia, on March 17.
EA is doubling down on its sports division, a major money-spinner for the publisher, by striking an exclusive partnership to develop simulation college football videogames set to release in the coming years, the company announced earlier on Tuesday.
The launch of new installments in ""Battlefield"" and ""Need For Speed"" franchises and the integration of recently-acquired UK-based Codemasters is expected boost growth in fiscal 2022, the company said.
EA raised its full-year adjusted sales forecast to $6.08 billion from $5.95 billion, edging past analysts' estimates of $6.01 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The company's adjusted revenue for the holiday-quarter, ended Dec. 31, was $2.4 billion, narrowly beating analysts' average estimate of $2.39 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",Chipotle's profit misses estimates as COVID-19 costs mount,"By Nivedita Balu and Hilary Russ
(Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) on Tuesday missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit, hurt by costs related to keeping its business running during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the burrito chain's shares falling nearly 2% in after-hours trading.
Strong digital operations at the fast-casual chain, a standout performer in the industry during the coronavirus, have helped it ride out the worst of the impact, even as its expenses have climbed as it bolsters its delivery network.
Digital sales rose nearly three-fold and drove a 5.7% rise in comparable sales, helped by a surge in online orders in some parts of the United States. 
Total revenue increased 11.6% to $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, the company said.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $3.48 per share, missing the estimate of $3.73, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
""It is now well established that November was weak across the space, and while Chipotle is resilient, it is not immune,"" Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analysts wrote in a note after earnings report. 
The company's share price was up more than 10% so far this year and rose 66% in 2020 - by far the best-performing stock in the restaurant industry, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Its success came partly from its ability to ramp up digital sales quickly during the pandemic. For the full-year 2020, Chipotle's digital sales grew 174.1% to $2.8 billion and made up 46.2% of sales. About half of digital sales were for delivery orders.
The chain is testing quesadillas, as well as smoked brisket, after its January nationwide launch of cilantro-lime cauliflower rice for a limited time.
Chipotle has not been providing sales forecasts during the pandemic. However, for 2021 it said it expects to open 200 new restaurants and have an effective tax rate between 25% and 27%.
About 70% of its new restaurants will include ""Chipotlane"" digital drive-thrus. Sales at locations with Chipotlanes are 10 about 10% higher on average than those without, Chief Technology Officer Curt Garner told Reuters in an interview.
The company is also testing out ""carside"" pickup, where an employee brings orders out to a customer's car, in 29 restaurants. 

""What we've seen so far has been really encouraging,"" Garner said.

(Reuters) - A Delaware judge on Tuesday rejected former McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook's bid to dismiss a lawsuit by the fast-food chain seeking to recoup millions of dollars in severance pay because he allegedly covered up improper sexual relationships with employees.
McDonald's knew that he had engaged in one, non-physical consensual relationship with an employee when the company agreed to a severance package estimated at $41.8 million in November 2019, both sides agreed. 
The former CEO argued in his motion to dismiss that the restaurant company had evidence of his other sexual relationships with employees on its computer system so should have been aware of them. 
Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Court of Chancery inDelaware, however, said McDonald's was justified in relying onEasterbrook's statements that he had only a single inappropriaterelationship when the Chicago-based company ousted him.
A lawyer for Easterbrook did not immediately respond torequests for comment.
McDonald's said it looked forward to proving Easterbrook'smisconduct.
""He violated the company's policies, disrespected itsvalues and abused the trust of his co-workers, the board, ourfranchisees and our shareholders,"" it said in a statement.
McDonald's sued Easterbrook in August, nine months afterreaching the severance package, claiming he never gave directorsa complete picture of his relationships with employees.
It said that after Easterbrook's ouster, an anonymous tipled to the discovery of dozens of nude or sexually explicitphotos of women, including three employees, that Easterbrooksent to his personal email account from his company account.
McDonald's said Easterbrook deleted the emails shortlybefore his ouster, but they remained on a company server.

""This active concealment makes it at least reasonablyconceivable the company had no way of knowing the full extent ofEasterbrook's misconduct,"" Slights wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan said on Tuesday Whole Foods Market must face a proposed class-action lawsuit claiming it deceived shoppers about the contents of its 365 Organic Honey Graham (NYSE:GHM) Crackers.
U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods said Chandra Campbell plausibly alleged that the words ""Honey"" and ""Graham"" on the box misled reasonable consumers into thinking that the crackers contained more healthy whole grain flour than non-whole grain flour, and that honey rather than sugar was the main sweetener.
""It is not implausible that consumers would understand the words on the box to say what they mean,"" Woods wrote in a 31-page decision. The box also shows a honey dipper in a bowl of honey.
Whole Foods and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The chain, part of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), has said Campbell was being ""unreasonably literal,"" and could have checked the ingredient list on the back if she were unsure.
Woods said Campbell may pursue claims under New York consumer protection laws.
He dismissed fraud and negligence claims, and said the Manhattan resident lacked standing to demand packaging changes because she now knew what was in the crackers and would not buy them.
In letting the case proceed, Woods cited a 2018 federal appeals court's revival of a lawsuit against Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co for labeling Cheez-Its as ""whole grain"" when the primary grain content was enriched white flour.
Woods also wrote that before the case began, ""this judge did not know that the 'graham' in graham cracker referred to a type of flour: the crackers might have been named after a famous person named Graham, in the way that Peach Melba and Melba Toast were named after an opera singer,"" Australia's Nellie Melba.
Campbell's lawyer Spencer Sheehan said he welcomed the rulings in her favor. Sheehan has filed many lawsuits accusing companies of mislabeling products.

The case is Campbell v Whole Foods Market Group Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-01291.

(Reuters) -  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares more than halved in value on Tuesday and silver prices retreated as the Reddit-driven trading frenzy that roiled stock and commodity markets appeared to fizzle, at least for now.
The videogame retailer's shares, whose wild gyrations have made or lost billions of dollars for hedge funds and other investors in recent weeks, closed down 60% at $90. They are now worth less than a fifth of their high of $483 last week.
Posters on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets, which was instrumental in fueling the rally, bemoaned the fall. ""Our darkest hour,"" read one post https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1jk5/our_darkest_hour by user name kigfik who said they were still holding the stock. Another user, Cinther, posted that they bought at $390 and ""lost so much that I don't even care anymore"" but were still holding. 
""The rally is likely over (since) the short positions are pretty well taken care of,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
""That's the game you play when you do this thing. It can work for a while until it stops working and when it stops working, it reverses pretty quickly.""
Short sellers saw paper gains of $3.39 billion during Tuesday’s session, according to S3 Partners. Year-to-date realized and unrealized losses for shorts recently stood at $9.2 billion. 
""We have had a lot of shorts take their losses and walk away from the trade,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of predictive analytics.
Spot silver prices, which became an alternative focus in the battle between small traders and Wall Street hedge funds last week, fell more than 8% after hitting an eight-year high on Monday. The main silver ETF was down 8.3%.
The retail frenzy in silver has left some dealers scrambling for bars and coins to meet demand.
Analysts said the silver pullback may show the limits of small investors' impact in a large and complicated market. 
Online broker Robinhood, on whose platform much of the buying and selling has taken place, raised trading limits on GameStop Corp, AMC and other stocks, according to an update on its website on Tuesday. 
'BIZARRE SITUATIONS' 
Analysts predicted that the market frenzy, which has drawn the attention of regulators and politicians, was likely to fade, and said it was just a question of how soon. 
""This is a pretty narrow strategy that likely creates some bizarre situations like GameStop and AMC but it's not broad enough to change how institutional investors are going to invest,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""The strength of the move was so severe that it really opened up people's eyes to the power of social media in the investment world. But having seen it and how short-term the nature of it is, I think it'll lose its surprise.""
Broader markets appeared to be moving on. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.57%, the S&P 500 gained 1.39% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.56%.[MKTS/GLOB] (N) 
Other so-called meme stocks caught up in the Reddit rally also sold off. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and Koss Corp each dropped by more than 40%, Express Inc and Naked Brand Group Ltd lost about a third of their value, while BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd and  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY) showed double-digit percentage losses. Nokia (NYSE:NOK)'s U.S.-listed shares fell 7%.
With hedge funds at the center of the market drama, the GameStop saga is likely to expedite a regulatory review of the ever-larger role played by non-bank firms in the financial markets, regulatory experts said.
Melvin Capital, one of the biggest funds betting on a drop in GameStop's share price, lost 53% in January. Other funds like billionaire investor Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management lost nearly 9%, investors in the funds said.
Point72 has opened to new cash and raised more than $1.5 billion in commitments, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Meanwhile, Robinhood's app recorded more downloads than any other U.S. trading app last week, despite concerns its restrictions on transactions would alienate some users, according to market research data providers.
Robinhood, which raised $3.4 billion in emergency funds in the past week, plans an initial public offering later this year. 
Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev said in a blog post that it was time to consider real-time settlement in U.S. equities trading, which currently follows a two-day settlement system. 
""There is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time. Doing so would greatly mitigate the risk that such processing poses,"" said Tenev.
CME RAISED SILVER MARGINS
One big drag on silver prices was a Chicago Mercantile Exchange margin hike on contracts for the metal, which makes speculative trade more expensive.
Mining stocks including  First Majestic Silver  (NYSE:AG) and Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) fell.
Posts on Tuesday on WallStreetBets ranged from those giving up on the GameStop trade to calls to stick with the stock.
""Redditors are focused on meme stocks and that fight should continue - right now they think that silver is a distraction to their cause,"" said Ephraim Rinsky, a novelist who was one of the first Redditors to post about buying silver on WallStreetBets.
The forum was in a sober mood on Tuesday.
""Guys. This only works (if) we work together. Buy the dip and hold. For all of us. The movement isn't over,"" said one post from ""mwybert"" that garnered more than 8,000 comments, most of them supportive.

GameStop, AMC, Koss, BlackBerry and Bed Bath & Beyond have not responded to requests seeking comment.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished sharply higher for a second straight day on Tuesday, helped by gains in Amazon.com and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ahead of their results and by optimism over progress on a U.S. pandemic relief package.
While Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended the regular session up 1.1%, the company shocked investors after the bell with news that Jeff Bezos would move to the role of executive chairman in the third quarter and be replaced by Amazon Web Services head Andy Jassy as chief executive officer. 
The stock was flat in after-hours trading, even as Amazon.com beat estimates for holiday-quarter sales. 
Alphabet shares shot up more than 6% after the bell following its earnings report. The stock ended the regular session up 1.4%.
During the session, the market's rally was broad-based. All of the S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with the S&P 500 financials sector rising 2.5%.
More than 80% of reports from S&P 500 companies so far have surpassed analysts' earnings expectations, with 97% of reports from technology companies beating, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Investors also were optimistic as Democrats in Congress prepared to take the first steps toward fast-track passage of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package.
Adding to the upbeat mood, new cases of COVID-19 in the United States fell for a third week in a row, the first time since last September.
""Some form of the Biden proposal will pass, and there are certainly investors who are willing to look down the road and think the market and economy will look brighter,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 475.57 points, or 1.57%, to 30,687.48, the S&P 500 gained 52.45 points, or 1.39%, to 3,826.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 209.38 points, or 1.56%, to 13,612.78.
The recent market mania driven by retail traders over heavily shorted assets showed some signs of fizzling out.  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), one of the stocks that had been pushed up sharply in the frenzy, fell 60% on Tuesday, dropping for a second day.
""Hedge funds are looking for places to put money and the easy trade for them is to go into big-cap stocks and probably the broad market in general, just to ensure that they are not left behind,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, New York. ""That's probably where we're getting all of the extra flows here.""
Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility index, retreated further.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) posted its first annual loss as a public company. However, its shares ended up 1.6% as its quarterly adjusted profit topped estimates.
Shares of  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) climbed 2.6% after it beat quarterly profit estimates on a surge in home delivery volume due to pandemic-fueled online purchases of holiday gifts and staples.

""There is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time. Doing so would greatly mitigate the risk that such processing poses,"" Tenev, who is also a co-founder of Robinhood, said in a blog post https:// The securities industry currently follows a two-day settlement system.
Retail investors, egged on by Reddit thread WallStreetBets, have sent shares of heavily shorted companies such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) through the roof, leading to what is called as a short squeeze that has forced a handful of brokerages to book heavy losses.
Robinhood, which has been at the heart of the historic trading frenzy, drew investor ire after it was forced to curb trading in certain hot stocks due to a 10-fold rise in deposit requirements at its clearinghouse.
""The clearinghouse deposit requirements are designed to mitigate risk, but last week's wild market activity showed that these requirements, coupled with an unnecessarily long settlement cycle, can have unintended consequences that introduce new risks,"" Tenev said. 
The brokerage was forced to raise $1 billion in emergency funds from investors last week to meet its financial obligations. The company also said on Monday that it had raised an additional 2.4 billion.
Sheila Bair, former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, took to Twitter on Monday to comment on the two-day trade settlement period.
""Kind of surprising that with all of the anger and recriminations being hurled at Robinhood, hedge funds, short sellers, retail traders, SEC, etc., not much ire at a central culprit-our antiquated payments infrastructure,"" she said.

(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) on Tuesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as sales of newer drugs offset lower revenue from older off-patent medications, but the biotech company forecast 2021 earnings below Wall Street estimates.
For the full year, Amgen said it expects adjusted earnings of $16.00 to $17.00 per share on revenue of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion. Analysts were looking for $17.03 per share on revenue of $26.45 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amgen said physician-patient interactions remained below normal levels in the fourth quarter and it expects that to continue through 2021.
In a statement, the company said recovery in the latter part of the year is contingent on the speed and effectiveness of the global vaccination rollout.
For the fourth quarter, Amgen reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.81, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.40 per share. The number of Amgen shares outstanding fell 13% from a year earlier.
Net profit for the quarter fell 3% to $2.76 per share.
Quarterly revenue rose 7% to $6.6 billion, in line with analysts’ estimates.
Sales of older rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel fell 5% to $1.27 billion, shy of analysts' estimate of $1.3 billion.
Sales of newer migraine drug Aimovig totaled $104 million for the quarter, short of the $115 million projected by analysts. But sales of cholesterol fighter Repatha rose 27% to $253 million, beating Wall Street estimates of $223 million.
Sales of Neulasta, which fights infections by boosting white blood cells, fell 19% to $536 million, while sales of kidney drug Sensipar dropped 58% to $45 million in the face of increased competition from cheaper generics and biosimilars.

Amgen, which produces its own biosimilar versions of drugs from rival companies, said sales of those medicines rose in the fourth quarter.

Invsting.com - Amazon.com said Tuesday that founder Jeff Bezos will step down as chief executive officer in the third quarter. The news comes as the e-commerce giant reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' forecasts, led by a pandemic-led surge in online shopping in North America. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares gained 1.10% in after-hours trade following the report.
Bezos will transition to the role of executive chair, while Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, will become CEO of Amazon.   
Amazon.com announced earnings per share of $14.09 on revenue of $125.6 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $7.16 on revenue of $119.68 billion.
Net sales in North America rose to $75.35 billion, up from $53.67 billion in the the prior-year period, and beating a forecast for $57 billion.
Amazon Web Services, its fast-growing cloud revenue segment, grew to $12.74 billion from $9.95 billion.
For the first-quarter, the company guided net sales of between $100.0 billion and $106.0 billion, or to grow between 33% and 40% year-on-year, with about $2.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.57%, or 475 points. The S&P 500 was 1.35%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.56%.

Investing.com -- The Dow rallied nearly 600 points on Tuesday as the short selling squeeze in stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC ran out of steam.
Attention turned to efforts to fight the pandemic and its economic fall out.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said it would pull forward its vaccine production schedule to get more of the drug to market by May rather than mid-summer. More Americans are getting the vaccine, and new infection rates are falling.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to debate another economic relief package, but the two sides are far apart on the dollar amount. President Joe Biden wants another $1.9 trillion in relief, while Republicans have countered with a $600 billion package after the two sides met at the White House this week.
Traders await quarterly results from tech giants Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) after the closing bell.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings continue to pour in
After big reports Tuesday night from Alphabet and Amazon, a couple of pandemic success stories report on Wednesday. Analysts expect  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) to report earnings per share of 99 cents on revenue of $6.08 billion.  Grubhub Inc  (NYSE:GRUB) is seen reporting earnings of 7 cents a share on revenue of $500 million.
2. Jobs data puts focus on recovery
ADP will publish its employment change number for January, and it could set the tone for negotiations over a relief package in Washington. It is expected to show gains of 49,000 when it comes out at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT). In December, the number was a negative 123,000.

MECCA, Calif. (Reuters) - Deemed an essential workforce during the pandemic, California's mostly Latino farmworkers are also underrepresented in the state's vaccination program, health officials and activists say, prompting the delivery of shots in the fields.
In one such campaign, public health officials vaccinated about 250 workers on Monday, including about 150 from Hadley's Date Gardens, in the first of what they hope will be a weekly visit to agricultural lands. 
""We're essential for the country, to be able to feed the other families,"" Maria Razo, 45, a date sorter, said from the vaccination site in Mecca, California, about 140 miles (225 km) east of Los Angeles. 
""Now that we have it, we’re going to work a little safer,"" Razo said after getting her first of two shots of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX).
Though falling behind health workers and first responders in vaccination priority, farmworkers are critical to California's agricultural industry, which accounts for a large chunk of the country's food supply. Many lack the internet connectivity and transportation most Americans take for granted and use to get their shots.
With our without a vaccine, their jobs are dangerous enough. Date-pruners climb atop the fronds of the date palms with an extra long ladder, chopping away with a recurved machete to dethorn the trees in preparation for harvest.
Early data shows Blacks and Latinos have been underrepresented in COVID-19 inoculations given to healthcare workers and nursing home residents, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
Moreover, California has lagged most other states in vaccinations administered per capita, CDC data show.
""We knew that this was going to be a community that was going to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. So we designed this community-based strategy to bring resources to them,"" said Conrado Bargaza, chief executive of Desert Healthcare, a public entity that provides healthcare services.
Riverside County health officials have worked with the Todec Legal Center, which provides legal advice and education for Latino immigrants in the inland area of Southern California, to take vaccines to the workforce. 

""COVID has shed a light to all these inequalities that we have,"" said Todec Executive Director Luz Gallegos, who has been combing the fields making sure farm workers get tested and vaccinated. ""We're talking about the most vulnerable workers.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sahm Adrangi, whose Kerrisdale Capital cemented its reputation with successful bets against Chinese internet companies, came out with a long position in Beijing-based UP Fintech Holdings Ltd on Tuesday, calling it ""The Robinhood of China."" 
Adrangi's Kerrisdale, which manages approximately $500 million as of February 2020, gained 25% last year, an investor in the fund said. The fund rose to fame about a decade ago for shorting Chinese companies traded in the United States that he viewed as fraudulent. 
Shares of UP Fintech rose to a session high of $21.99, their highest since April 2019, after Kerrisdale's note and were last trading up 10.37% at $20.64. 
In the note, Kerrisdale pointed out UP Fintech is the holding company of Tiger Brokers, ""which we believe is positioned to become the Robinhood of China"" and pointed to the similar user profile with tech-savvy millennials as 72% of Tiger's customers are under 35-years old. 
In addition, the service makes it easier for Chinese citizens to invest in prominent companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and NIO Inc which ""ordinary Chinese citizens have historically had difficulty getting access to.""
While online brokerage players such as E*Trade, acquired by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in October and TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), which was acquired by  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), also in October, have established large footholds in the market, Kerrisdale points out Robinhood was still able to ""carve out a sizable niche for itself with its low fees, user-friendly design and mobile-first approach."" 
Government mobility restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic have helped fuel a surge in online trading, as Robinhood's app recorded more downloads than any other U.S. trading app last week despite concerns about its restrictions on transactions.
That has also helped fuel spectacular surges and drops in stocks that have been favored in groups on social media network Reddit, such as Gamestop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings. 
While other noted short sellers such as Andrew Left of Citron Research have recently said they will no longer publish short-selling research, Kerrisdale disclosed a short on  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) Inc on Jan. 20.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With hedge funds at the center of market drama for the second time in less than 12 months, the GameStop (NYSE:GME) saga is likely to expedite a regulatory review of the ever-larger role non-bank firms play in the financial markets, regulatory experts said.
Scrutiny of the non-bank financial sector was already expected to be high on newly appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's agenda after hedge fund de-leveraging contributed toward turmoil in the U.S. Treasuries market in March 2020. 
But the sector is likely to garner much closer attention after a retail buying frenzy in GameStop and other stocks burned several hedge funds that had bet against the companies and led retail brokerages to restrict trading in the affected stocks.
The incident appeared to spark market-wide volatility as hedge funds scrambled to meet their obligations and close out bad bets, trading the highest volume of shares since 2009, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). 
It has shone a spotlight on the huge footprint of non-bank equity trading firms, particularly that of Citadel Securities, which accounts for over 20% of all U.S. equities volume and roughly 39% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, according to its website. Its heft has raised questions over the company's market power. 
""Washington was already expected to scrutinize various non-bank financial markets, but this episode increases the urgency,"" Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a note. ""Citadel Securities will certainly be part of the conversation.""
A spokeswoman for Citadel Securities declined to comment. 
After the 2009 financial crisis, Congress imposed tough rules on banks, pushing riskier activities into more lightly regulated sectors, such as asset managers and private funds.
In response, the Treasury's Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) began a review of the asset management sector. In 2016 it warned that leveraged hedge funds could cause instability during market stress if they became forced sellers. 
The FSOC said it would continue monitoring hedge fund risks, including leverage, and address data blindspots. But months later, former President Donald Trump's administration shut down that project, according to Yellen and public records.
With a Democratic administration in power and a new crop of regulators due to take over, regulatory advocates expect the Treasury to revive the project. 
""This is a decent moment to step back and think about what trading activities in the financial system regulators should really be concerned about from a broader systemic perspective,"" said Gregg Gelzinis of Washington think tank Center for American Progress, who has advocated for FSOC to take on hedge funds.
The Managed Funds Association, which represents the sector, did not provide comment on recent developments, but has said that hedge fund investments help pension funds and other institutional investors manage risk and deliver returns. 
Hedge funds will not be the only ones in the spotlight. Open-ended funds and money market funds, which have also grown in systemic importance, are already under review internationally by the Financial Stability Board.
""We need better oversight of the non-bank financial sector, to make sure we have rules and safeguards in place that create a financial system that serves the economy,"" said Gelzinis. 
The Treasury did not respond to a request for comment, but Yellen has been a strong advocate of FSOC's work and has previously said March's Treasury market turmoil showed that the risks FSOC had identified were ""real and serious.""
During that episode, highly leveraged hedge funds dumped treasuries to meet margin calls, prompting the Federal Reserve to prop up the market, according to the Bank for International Settlements. It added that September 2019 dislocations in the repurchase agreement market were a ""precursor"" to the March turmoil and involved similar players.
As of 2020, aggregate net U.S. hedge fund assets were $2.9 trillion. But taking leverage into account, gross assets were $6.3 trillion, said FSOC. While aggregate leverage was relatively small, much of it was concentrated among a small number of players, FSOC found in 2016. 
""There's no public policy reason why you should let people take on infinite leverage for what is essentially short-term speculation,"" said Marcus Stanley, policy director at the progressive think tank Americans for Financial Reform.

""We're going to see a big push on this.""

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>",White House plans to send millions of vaccine doses to retail pharmacies,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Carl O'Donnell
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House next week will start shipping coronavirus vaccines directly to retail pharmacies alongside ongoing deliveries to states, increasing weekly supplies of shots nationwide to 11.5 million, a top aide said on Tuesday.
U.S. President Joe Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, Jeff Zients, said the program will launch on Feb. 11 and will make 1 million doses available to 6,500 stores. As supply grows, the program could expand to as many as 40,000 stores, he said.
Biden said last month that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been a ""dismal failure"" so far and vowed to boost the speed at which shots are given to Americans, with a focus on ensuring equitable access regardless of geography, race, or ethnicity.
The Trump administration in November announced it had partnered with 19 pharmacy chains and networks nationwide - including CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc - to begin distributing COVID-19 vaccines as they became available.
The federal government will distribute a million vaccine doses to the 6,500 stores next week, Zients said, adding that the amount will grow over time.
That is in addition to 10.5 million doses that the federal government plans to ship weekly to states and territories for the next three weeks, he added. 
""This will provide more sites for people to get vaccinated in their communities,"" Zients said, adding that supply constraints will limit the program in its early days.
The initial pharmacy locations were selected to improve access to vaccines in hard to reach areas and among socially vulnerable communities, Zients said.
CVS said in a news release that its pharmacies will be participating in the program. It will receive 250,000 doses directly from the federal government for its initial rollout, CVS said, adding that it has capacity to provide 20 million to 25 million doses per month in total. 
Zients also said the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will reimburse states for some COVID-related costs they had taken on since the U.S. coronavirus outbreak began last January, such as for personal protective equipment and deployment of the national guard. 
He said Congress does not need to approve funds for FEMA to do this and that the total payments to states will be between $3 billion and $5 billion. 
Zients added that the federal government has acquired supplies of equipment healthcare providers need to get six doses from each vial of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine rather than five.
The Biden administration has said it is willing to use emergency wartime powers if necessary to secure the specialized low dead space syringes and other supplies needed to eliminate vaccine waste and improve administration efficiency.

The major winter storm that hit the east coast of the United States this week has not disrupted vaccine deliveries but has forced some vaccine administration sites to shut down or reduce operating hours, Zients said.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said on Tuesday it expects to generate $15 billion, or about a quarter of its total revenue this year, from sales of its COVID-19 vaccine co-developed with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX).
Sales from the vaccine - on track to be the drugmaker's top product this year - could top $15 billion if the company signs more supply contracts, it said.
Pfizer aims to make two billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview that the company wanted to be conservative in its target and is working on numerous initiatives to exceed that output.
""We've increased the batches we run per week, we've doubled the output - the yield per batch - we've dramatically improved our success rates, we've made process improvements to the assembly lines,"" Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said in the interview.
""All these things are things we're continuing to examine to see what else we can do to try to produce more doses faster,"" he added. 
Pfizer also said it expects there could be a long-lasting need for COVID-19 vaccines, to combat new virus variants that emerge and to boost peoples' waning immune responses.
The company is launching a study to determine whether a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, administered 6-to-12 months after the initial shots, can extend and improve efficacy with more contagious variants circulating in communities around the world. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is currently administered as two doses three weeks apart.
Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said he believes mRNA vaccines like Pfizer's generate a strong enough immune response to repel the currently circulating variants, and that a booster, rather than a redesigned vaccine, is the right approach for now.
Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he was optimistic that revenue contributions from the vaccine could be sustainable beyond 2021. 
Pfizer expects to supply 200 million doses to the U.S. government by the end of May.
To achieve the goal, it will have to deliver an average of around 10 million doses per week, more than double the rate Pfizer and BioNTech delivered to the United States through the end of January, according to Reuters calculations.
The vaccine, which uses synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to prompt an immune response against the virus, was the first shot to be authorized for emergency use in the United States, marking the first regulatory nod for the new technology. 
mRNA vaccines and COVID-19 could prove transformative for Pfizer, which is already one of the world's largest drugmakers, CEO Bourla said. A potential flu vaccine based on the technology could hit the market by 2025, executives said on a conference call. 

Pfizer forecast 2021 sales between $59.4 billion and $61.4 billion. The company raised both ends of its full-year adjusted profit forecast by 10 cents and now expects to earn $3.10 to $3.20 per share.

(Reuters) - Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) is expected to post a fourth straight fall in quarterly revenue on Wednesday as the blow from fresh lockdowns in Europe eclipses a China-driven recovery in sales of its luxury handbags and apparel.
A spike in coronavirus infections from late last year forced many European governments to put their economies back into lockdown, keeping consumers away from stores during the crucial holiday shopping season.
Capri not only has to deal with store closures in Europe and sluggish department store traffic due to the pandemic, but also a ""stale"" Michael Kors brand image, Jane Hali & Associates retail analyst Jessica Ramirez said.
CONTEXT
Investors will be hoping that Capri's Versace and Jimmy Choo brands can emulate fashion giant LVMH's growth in China, which helped cushion some of the pandemic's impact in other markets.
Sales of luxury goods in China have been rising since the easing of COVID-19 measures in the second half of 2020, sparking hopes that one of the world's biggest markets for high-end fashion could ease the pain of companies suffering in regions where the virus continues to rage.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 01:05PM ET</span>",Amazon to pay $61.7 million to settle charges it stole driver tips,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc agreed to pay more than $61.7 million to settle allegations it cheated Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) drivers out of nearly one-third of tips from customers for more than two years, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday.
The money paid to the FTC will be used to compensate drivers, the agency said.
The FTC said Amazon in 2015 advertised that a program called Flex would pay drivers $18 to $25 an hour to make deliveries and that they would receive 100% of any tips. But in late 2016 Amazon ""secretly reduced its own contribution to drivers' pay,"" according to the FTC complaint.
""Amazon used the customer tips to make up the difference between the new lower hourly rate and the promised rate,"" the FTC said in a statement.
The FTC said Amazon dropped the controversial payment model in August 2019 after the agency opened an investigation.
Amazon said it disagreed that the way it reported pay to drivers was unclear. 

""In total, Amazon stole nearly one-third of drivers' tips to pad its own bottom line,"" Commissioner Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, said in a statement.
He urged the FTC to examine whether workers need to be protected from ""other dominant middlemen.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The Reddit online forum that fired up a global trading frenzy was in a more sober mood on Tuesday, with many retail investors begging others to ""buy the dip"" as their favourite stocks plunged.
An army of retail punters had sent shares in U.S. videogame chain GameStop (NYSE:GME) and cinema operator AMC soaring in the past two weeks, causing billions of dollars of losses for Wall Street hedge funds which had made costly ""short"" bets that the share prices would fall.
But with GameStop halving in value on Tuesday, bringing its loss since Thursday's peak to 75%, and AMC losing another 40%, the earlier euphoria was fizzling out, judging by posts on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets.
""Guys. This only works (if) we work together. Buy the dip and hold. For all of us. The movement isn't over. Balls of steel ... We can do this,"" said one post from ""mwybert"" that had garnered more than 8,000 comments, most of them supportive.
Another wrote: ""This is looking ROUGH. To be honest I already made my money last week but I am holding the few I have left. But without people out buying the hedgies ... this is as good as done.""
The squeeze on short-sellers in Reddit-favoured ""stonks"" - an intentional misspelling of ""stocks"" - upended Wall Street, forcing hedge funds such as Melvin Capital to post declines of more than 50%.
Short-sellers such as Andrew Left's Citron Research have shifted their approach to focus only on long positions.
More retail traders joined the Reddit crowd as their focus widened to take on short-sellers in other asset classes, but they have struggled to make the same explosive impact.
Silver was a new battleground. But spot prices slid nearly 9% on Tuesday, reversing most of the gains notched up in the previous two sessions and showing how much tougher it is for small investors to shift a global commodity than to move individual stocks.
""With volumes in all the hot stocks collapsing, silver attack met by margin, Robinhood having to seek fresh collateral at a rampant speed, the signals that the retail mania could unravel rapidly are aligning,"" said Mark Taylor, a London-based equity sales trader with financial group Mirabaud.
GameStop and AMC shares, which small investors traded on Robinhood and other online platforms, are still more than double their Jan. 22 levels when the buying mania erupted.
But many small investors that piled in late last week said on Reddit they were sitting on paper loses of more than 50%. 
Some wrote on the forum on Tuesday that they would capitalise on the drop in GameStop and AMC to load up on more shares.
A few said the ""vibe"" on the forum had changed, making unfounded claims that internet bots had infiltrated the group to dampen the mood. 
Yet others pledged to hold, no matter what.

""It""s not a loss until you sell,"" wrote one post, while another declared: ""Down 50% on gme. Zero or hero.""

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 12:15PM ET</span>","Pandemic pushes Exxon to historic annual loss, $20 billion cut in shale value","By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp on Tuesday posted a historic annual loss after the COVID-19 pandemic hammered energy prices and reduced the value of the company's shale gas properties by more than $20 billion. 
Exxon last year slashed spending on new projects by nearly a third, outlined plans to cut up to 15% of its workforce while adding $21 billion to its debt to cover the losses and restructuring.
The changes come amid ""the most challenging market conditions Exxon has ever experienced,"" said Chief Executive Darren Woods, and over time will cut costs by $6 billion a year compared to 2019. 
The company reported a net annual loss of $22.4 billion for 2020, on the writedown and losses in oil production and refining, compared with a full-year profit of $14.34 billion in 2019. 
Exxon declined to comment if it has ever had an annual loss, but the company churned out profits since Exxon merged with Mobil in 1999 and through the 1980s oil bust.
OILMAN JOINS BOARD
The company remains under fire from environmentalists and activist investors pushing for a board overhaul and a strategy that would transition to cleaner fuels. Exxon pushed back against their calls for clean energy expertise, naming the former head of Malaysia's state oil company, Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, to its board. It is in discussions with other candidates, the company added.
Other oil majors posted losses for the year as pandemic-related travel restrictions cut fuel demand and triggered huge writedowns. Rivals BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) posted annual losses.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc reports financial results Thursday. 
Exxon posted a net loss of $20.2 billion, or $4.70 per share, in the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year ago. Excluding the impairment and other charges, the company earned 3 cents per share, beating analysts' average expectation of a one-cent gain, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Exxon shares, which have lost a quarter of their value in the past 12 months, rose 4.3% to $46.84 on Tuesday.
""The turnaround story will take some time,"" said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, noting that the company is not yet covering its dividend and capital spending with cash from operations.
But with oil prices recovering, Exxon can start to cover dividend and begin paying down the $68 billion in debt on its balance sheet, Woods said. Oil is up 11% so far this year, and trading at pre-pandemic levels. 
Exxon still has ""plenty of wood to chop"" but the willingness to cut costs to pay the dividend will play well with investors, said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds.
Project spending fell nearly a third last year and this year will near the bottom of the company's $16 billion to $19 billion forecast, Woods said. Spending will rise to as much as $25 billion from 2022 through 2025, he said.
LOWER OUTPUT IN OIL AND REFINING
Exxon's oil and gas output was 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas per day in the fourth quarter, down 8% compared with a year earlier.
It projects a doubling of Permian Basin output to 700,000 barrels per day by 2025, down from the million-barrel target it previously had expected to hit by 2024 in the top U.S. shale field, Woods said.
Exploration and production, Exxon's largest business, lost $18.5 billion in the fourth quarter on the natural gas asset impairments, compared with a profit of $6.1 billion the year prior.
Its chemicals business earned $691 million on better margins in part from lower oil prices, up from a loss of $355 million a year ago. Refining lost $1.2 billion, compared with a profit of $898 million last year, on weak margins and lower output as the pandemic limited global travel.
The writedown lays bare the size of the miscalculation that the company made in 2010 when it paid $30 billion for U.S. shale oil and gas producer XTO Energy.
The move to shake up its board comes as Exxon faces a proxy fight with hedge fund Engine No. 1, which has proposed four candidates and wants the board to include clean-energy experience.

"" Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) shareholders deserve a board that works proactively to create long-term value, not defensively in the face of deteriorating returns and the threat of losing their seats,"" Engine No.1 said in a statement. 
On Monday, Exxon said it would invest $3 billion on lower emission solutions through 2025 and that it has created a business that will focus on commercializing its carbon capture technology.

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 10:30AM ET</span>",Airlines flying blind into summer capacity sweepstake,"By Laurence Frost and Sarah Young
PARIS (Reuters) - European airlines buffeted by successive lockdowns have little idea what kind of summer to expect. But they must place their bets anyway.
Time is short to commit to flight schedules for the main holiday season, whose profits usually tide the industry through the winter, but whose outlook has never been so uncertain.
Cash-strapped carriers must decide when to trigger the costly process of returning parked planes and furloughed staff, or even rehiring. Getting it wrong means losing more money on half-empty flights or – if demand is underestimated – handing badly needed business to rivals.
""It's like trying to sail a boat when the wind changes direction every couple of minutes,"" said Robert Boyle, a former British Airways executive whose firm Gridpoint Consulting advises the industry.
""I've spoken to airlines that normally do about three versions of the schedule, and now say they're on their 50th.""
Scheduling for the peak season opening on March 28 is a guessing game with higher stakes than ever, as the risk of a second lost summer hangs on the race between faster-spreading COVID-19 variants and vaccine rollouts.
The first wave of lockdowns saw airlines drop 72% of the 755 million seats scheduled in Western Europe last summer, according to flight data specialist OAG. Many of the 684 million summer 2021 seats now posted are also likely to end up cancelled.
""Most airlines are currently planning to operate quite large parts of their networks but will inevitably scale back,"" OAG analyst John Grant said, rendering capacity plans ""pretty meaningless"".
PLANNING NIGHTMARE
Further complicating the task, consumers beset by uncertainty have embraced last-minute booking on a scale that haunts the nightmares of network planners, who usually track early reservations against the previous year's curve.
""Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) patterns are out the window,"" Grant said. ""So there's an increasing use of analytics and metasearch data, social media chat and Google to try to identify patterns.""
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and online travel marketplace Skyscanner have moved to fill the void, with tools allowing airlines to extrapolate real demand from internet searches.
Consumers ""look at Skyscanner probably earlier in their thinking,"" said Hugh Aitken, the company's flights chief. ""We can give that pent-up demand view.""
Last month, for instance, Skyscanner saw a 20% rise in October UK-Spain searches. Its data also show how quickly demand can snap back when restrictions ease: on the day  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine was pronounced effective, UK bookings jumped 37%.
""Past trends are no predictor,"" Aitken said. ""Airlines will have to be very nimble with their decision-making.""
Air France-KLM said it acted on online search data to order a swift fourfold ramp-up in French Caribbean flights that brought in much-needed cash over Christmas.
The Franco-Dutch carrier and German peer Lufthansa - another Google data client - both say the large majority of their planes can return at short notice.
LOW-COST OFFENSIVE
Summer also promises the first salvos in a recovery offensive by low-cost carriers, which have used previous crises to ratchet up their market share.
A freeze on entitlements to take-off and landing slots at once-busy airports has eased some of the pressure on incumbent airlines.
But budget carriers are likely to pull off a nimbler restart, observers say, thanks to more variable costs and robust balance sheets to underpin risk-taking and discounting.
""It's not only much easier to ground all of your fleet, it's easier to put your aircraft back in the sky,"" said Geoffrey Weston, a Bain & Co. partner who heads the management consultancy's global transport business.
""You're winning on the way down and you're winning on the way up.""
Irish budget carrier Ryanair is already ""out there recruiting cabin crew at the moment"", Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said - despite the cloudy outlook.
""It will lead to some extra costs,"" Sorahan told Reuters. ""But again we want to be ready for when things spike up.""
With simulator access limited, Ryanair has even run some empty flights to keep pilots' hours above the requirement for immediate return to service, CEO Michael O'Leary said.
EasyJet is also focused on flexibility, CEO Johan Lundgren said, but added: ""The sooner we can have transparency on how these restrictions are unwound, (the) better.""
As a hedge against the deep uncertainty, airlines are likely to push point-to-point trips to European summer destinations.
Planned flights to France, Greece and Portugal are down by less than 8% on pre-crisis 2019 levels, while Egypt and Tunisia are down by a quarter, according to OAG data - although all are set to fall further.
If summer travel gets a green light it may come very late, said Wizz Air CEO Jozsef Varadi, and the ultra-low cost carrier can restore flights in under three weeks.

""People will want to get away from cities,"" Varadi told Reuters. ""Seaside destinations will be incredibly popular.""

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>","Tesla to recall 135,000 U.S. vehicles under pressure from auto safety regulators","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has agreed to recall 134,951 Model S and Model X vehicles with touchscreen displays that could fail and raise the risk of a crash after U.S. auto safety regulators sought the recall last month, according to a recall posted on a government website Tuesday.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) made the unusual recall request in a formal Jan. 13 letter to Tesla, saying it had tentatively concluded the 2012-2018 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles pose a safety issue. Automakers usually agree to voluntary fixes before the auto safety agency formally seeks a recall.
The agency said touchscreen failures posed significant safety issues, including the loss of rearview or backup camera images, exterior turn-signal lighting, and windshield defogging and defrosting systems that ""may decrease the driver’s visibility in inclement weather.""
NHTSA had required Tesla to respond to its recall demand by Jan. 27. Tesla agreed that same day to the recall, the company said.
Tesla said in its filing with NHTSA that ""in the interest of bringing administrative closure to the investigation and to ensure the best ownership experience for our customers"" it agreed to a voluntary recall. 
NHTSA opened a probe in June 2020 into complaints that media control unit (MCU) failures led to touchscreen displays not working.
The agency said other automakers issued numerous recalls for similar safety issues stemming from the touchscreen failure.
NHTSA said in November when it upgraded its probe that it reviewed 12,523 claims and complaints about the issue.
NHTSA said last month that ""during our review of the data, Tesla provided confirmation that all units will inevitably fail given the memory device’s finite storage capacity."" 
Many complaints had said Tesla required owners to pay to replace the unit once warranties expire. Tesla will replace the defective part and reimburse customers who paid to replace a part that failed because of lifetime wear.
Tesla acknowledged the problem but said if the display was not working, ""the driver can perform a shoulder check and use the mirrors. If the screen is not visible to control the climate control and defroster settings, the driver will be able to manually clear the windshield.""
The recall will begin March 30. NHTSA sought a recall of 158,000 vehicles but Tesla said the recall does not include some vehicles with upgraded processors built after March 2018.

Tesla said 88% of U.S. owners have gotten over-the-air updates to some functionalities that may be lost if displays fail.

1337,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",A Onetime Giant of Volatility Has Gone Haywire in OTC Trading,"(Bloomberg) -- On a day when U.S. stocks rallied the most in two months, a leveraged note that should struggle when markets are rising did something unusual: It surged 21%.
Even as the value of its underlying holdings dropped, the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term soared Monday to the highest since Nov. 3. While these days it trades over-the-counter with the ticker (OTC:TVIXF), the note is perhaps best known to most as TVIX, once one of the largest exchange-traded volatility products in the world.
The gain came out of the blue for TVIXF, but was perhaps inevitable. The note has existed in a kind of limbo ever since issuer Credit Suisse Group AG delisted it back in July. In the process, the Swiss bank suspended new share creations, meaning arbitragers can’t push the price back in line with its intrinsic worth.
As a result, TVIXF was trading at a 44% premium to its fair value on Tuesday.
It echoes an incident back in August, when a natural gas note known as DGAZF -- which was delisted alongside TVIXF -- jumped more than 6,000% in a matter of days. That spurred short sellers to take to Twitter, claiming they faced huge margin calls to cover their positions.
It’s possible a similar scenario is now playing out with the volatility note.
“If anyone wants an intriguing short squeeze idea and if familiar with the DGAZ story, I can see the attractiveness of at least giving a short squeeze a shot,” said Bill Luby, chief investment officer of Luby Asset Management and an expert on volatility products. But “this should be too risky for sophisticated investors -- too much like playing Russian roulette,” he said.

The $157 million note is a leveraged play on near-term futures on the Cboe Volatility Index, otherwise known as the VIX Index, or Wall Street’s fear gauge. It’s a popular way to hedge against market crashes, so it’s possible the moves were caused by investors betting on more turmoil.
But it’s also a tool for short sellers who seek to profit from calmer markets and the gradual decay of its holdings, and some 7% of TVIXF’s shares are sold short, according to S3 Partners LLC.
Several of the latter have surged in recent days, most notably  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME)., which was a buying target of retail investors seeking to punish hedge funds that bet against it.
Since being delisted, TVIX has lived on in over-the-counter markets, a wild west of trading where prices can quickly get out of whack. “$TVIXF should be in exactly nobody’s portfolio,” tweeted Dave Nadig, chief investment officer of ETF Trends.
In August, Credit Suisse eventually redeemed DGAZF at an average of its indicative value over several days, providing relief to short sellers but hitting traders who bought the note at inflated prices.
Candice Sun, a spokesperson for Credit Suisse, declined to comment.

(Reuters) - James Villalobos, a communications consultant for an insurance company in New York, downloaded the Robinhood online brokerage app back in September. 
He was hesitant about getting involved in the stock market – ""I never understood what it was, what it did"" – but a few months later he created an account and bought shares in airlines and cruise lines, figuring the industries, slammed by COVID-19 disruptions, would eventually rebound. 
He started watching YouTube videos about stocks, and joined a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group created by a friend who is ""really into options trading."" Villalobos was quickly down $1,200. But he was ready to make his money back. 
Last Monday, he put $551 into a clutch of shares that included BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc, part of a group now known as ""meme stocks"" for their popularity on online forums like Reddit.
Tapping at an iPhone, Villalobos was playing his part in a surge of retail trading that unleashed chaos on the markets last week, sending big names on Wall Street scrambling, with U.S. hedge funds buying and selling more stock than they had in the previous decade, according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) note on Friday.
That Villalobos is 25 years old should come as no surprise. 
Apex Clearing, which helps facilitate trades for brokerages, said the nearly 6 million accounts it opened in 2020 represented a 137% increase from the year before. About 1 million of those belonged to Gen Z investors born in the late-1990s or younger, with an average age of 19.
Robinhood says the average age of the 13 million users on its platform is 31. 
In interviews with more than a dozen digital brokerage users, Reuters found a younger generation that approaches trading much differently than the suits of Wall Street. 
    These are young women and men who feel comfortable on digital communities, whether monitoring threads on Reddit, following tips on Twitter or swapping ideas in Slack groups.
They are also coming up in a time of cheap, fast online trades, fed recently by cash from government stimulus programs and plenty of free time thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Though most of those interviewed described themselves as ""buy and hold"" investors who generally avoid swing trading plays, they said they were open to the occasional gaming of speculative stocks.  
""I look at it as essentially gambling. I don't put more than I'm willing to lose,"" said Will Callewaert, a 27-year-old Robinhood user who started trading during the coronavirus lockdowns.
CONFIDENCE
J.J. Buckner, 29, who gives his views on stocks to 250,000 followers on YouTube, lost more than $7,000 on options for AMC, Blackberry (TSX:BB) and Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) on Thursday. But he told his viewers that he's holding on, in the hope the rally will resume.
""It's one for history books,"" he told Reuters.
Part of what makes people like Buckner so confident is the power of the crowd. 
""What we saw in Reddit this week was that you need a group to make it effective,"" said Evan Keegan, 25, who does financial services public relations and has been trading on Robinhood for seven years. ""You need to have enough people because the average retail investor isn't moving the kind of money that the hedge funds are.""
It helps that retail investing today is so much easier than during the dot-com bubble of the late 90s, when traders had to pay higher transaction fees and purchase entire shares to get in on a stock, according to investment management experts. 
Now, the advent of free trades and fractional shares allows investors to scale into investments without putting too much cash on the line at once.
Nisha Desai, chief executive at Andav Capital, a New York-based venture capital firm, said although these younger investors may not be following the rulebook, that doesn't mean they can't make money.
""If you can invest tomorrow and get out in two weeks who's to say it's not an efficient transaction or that it's not a rational decision?"" Desai said.
Villalobos earned $3,800 within hours of trading Blackberry and AMC options last week, but most of those gains evaporated when brokerages, including Robinhood, put restrictions on trading the stocks due to volatility.
After depositing money regularly into his Robinhood account, he said last week he was planning to take a break until the end of February. 
""I told myself this week, 'Chill, you've lost enough,'"" he said.
But reached again on Monday, Villalobos said he'd changed his mind after reading chatter on the internet, and put another $510 on AMC options. 

He was waiting to see what happens next.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading sharply higher Tuesday, continuing the positive tone from the previous session, amid growing optimism based on progress towards a stimulus package and strong corporate earnings. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 223 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 29 points, or 0.8%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 97 points, or 0.7%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.8%, or 229 points higher on Monday. The S&P 500 ended up 1.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.6%. These indices had reported their worst week since October last week. 
President Joe Biden met with a group of Republican Senators late Monday in an attempt to get bipartisan support for a Covid relief plan amid opposition over the size of his proposed $1.9 trillion package. That said, top Democrats also filed a $1.9 trillion budget measure in a step toward bypassing Republicans, so that funds can still be raised even if their support doesn’t materialize in Congress.
Also helping the tone has been signs that the recent retail-driven market frenzy may be settling down. Shares in GameStop (NYSE:GME), the stock at the heart of last week’s protest, are falling in premarket trading Tuesday. Similarly, silver, which saw heavy buying on Monday, has dropped over 2% so far today.
The earnings season continues Tuesday, with numbers due from leading pharmaceutical  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) before the bell and tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) after the market close.
This fourth quarter of earnings is shaping up to be one of the strongest on record. Overall, 37% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported results, with about 82% reporting EPS above estimates, which is above the five-year average of 74%, according to FactSet.
U.S. economic data are thin on the ground Tuesday. The news out of Europe was slightly encouraging as the euro-zone economy contracted by less than expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. The region’s gross domestic product fell by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, for a 5.1% year-on-year decline.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, helped by newswire reports that the major oil producers have shown restraint in terms of production levels in January even as prices rose.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later Tuesday, will be keenly awaited, especially after last week’s hefty draw, while OPEC+'s Joint Technical Committee is also due to discuss the state of the market. 
U.S. crude futures traded 2.6% higher at $54.92 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.5% to $57.76. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,847.30/oz, while silver futures were down 6.3% after their spike on Monday at $27.57. EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2033.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",Ford to invest $1 billion to upgrade South Africa operations,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  will invest $1.05 billion in its South African manufacturing operations, including upgrades to expand production of its Ranger pickup truck, the U.S. automaker said on Tuesday.
The investments aim to increase Ford's installed capacity in South Africa from 168,000 to 200,000 vehicles, said Andrea Cavallaro, operations director of Ford's International Market Group.
""It's the biggest investment in Ford's 97-year history in South Africa and one of the largest ever in the local automotive industry,"" he told an announcement event.
Ford joins global carmakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) in ramping up production in Africa, viewed by the industry as a large, untapped market for new car sales. 
Around a third of Ford's local production is sold in South Africa and other sub-Saharan African countries, with the rest exported elsewhere.
Ford's South African investment includes $683 million for technology upgrades and new facilities at its plant in Silverton, a suburb of the administrative capital Pretoria, and $365 million to upgrade tooling at major supplier factories.
The plant will also manufacture Volkswagen pickup trucks as part of the Ford-VW alliance.
The expanded production will create 1,200 jobs with Ford in South Africa, increasing the local workforce to 5,500 employees, while adding an estimated 10,000 new jobs across the carmaker's supplier network. 
Ford also aims to make the Silverton plant entirely energy self-sufficient and carbon neutral by 2024, Cavallaro said.
South Africa has big ambitions for its automotive sector, putting it at the heart of attempts to revive economic growth and reduce unemployment via industrialisation.
Speaking at Ford's announcement, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the company had already helped to bring 12 automotive component suppliers to the country.
""Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is like a beautiful flower and it has attracted all these wonderful bees that keep coming here,"" he said.
The government's plan targets a more than doubling of the industry's annual production to 1.4 million vehicles by 2035 and raising the proportion of auto components made locally to 60% from 39%, supported by investment and tax incentives.

The goals have been dealt a blow by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, with both local sales and exports down by around 30% last year.

Impossible Foods, the maker of the plant-based Impossible Burger, and rival Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc have been the leaders in plant-based alternatives over the past two years as consumers, worried about their health, environmental impact and animal welfare, look to broaden or shift from chicken, pork and beef-based diets.
Demand for plant-based meat also rose during the pandemic after beef and pork producers shut many meat plants to curb the rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
California-based Impossible Foods, which has already cut prices for food distributors twice in one year, said it would keep lowering prices of their products.

The suggested retail prices for Impossible Burger would drop to $5.49 in about 17,000 U.S. grocery stores, the company said in a statement, adding that it will introduce similar price cuts at retail stores in Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong.

1351,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 05:54AM ET</span>","Reddit Trades Crumble as GameStop, AMC and Silver Plunge","(Bloomberg) -- The wild run-up of trades popular with Reddit crowds is starting to come crashing down.
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). sank 23% in U.S. pre-market trading, extending a 31% plunge on Monday. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. slid 21% and  Express Inc  (NYSE:EXPR) lost 15%. Silver tumbled 5% after surging to an eight-year high.
The speculative activity hatched online has captivated global markets, drawing attention from U.S. politicians and overwhelming brokerages around the world. Now, the speculative tide is turning.
“The short squeeze momentum met its inevitable end,” said Mark Taylor, a sales trader at Mirabaud Securities. “It seems reasonably clear that as the cheerleading and rage against the machine dies down, the man on the street is left holding the bag again.”
In GameStop, short interest plunged to 53% of the available shares, from more than 140% just last month, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Trading volume on Monday slowed to around one-third of the average of the past five sessions.
It’s anyone’s guess whether this marks an inflection point for the manic gains that have spread from one asset to the next in recent weeks. But the pullback lends credence to market watchers who’ve said it was only a matter of time before the rallies began to fade.
For now, the broader market seems largely immune to the intense volatility in GameStop, AMC and silver. Global equities rallied sharply into the U.S. morning on Tuesday, with the focus shifting to big tech earnings. S&P 500 futures were up 1% as of 5 a.m. in New York.
The easing of trading restrictions is likely playing some role in the recent market action. On Monday afternoon, Robinhood let users to purchase up to 20 GameStop shares, compared with one share before the market opened.
In silver, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) asked traders to put up more collateral after reviewing market volatility. The exchange raised margins on Comex silver futures by 18% to to $16,500 per contract. That mood on Reddit boards also started to fizzle, with some users urging their fellow investors to back away from silver.
Silver’s retracement “isn’t surprising, as any longer-term price upside due to social media-driven collaboration and conspiracy theories was always going to be unsustainable,” said Gavin Wendt, a senior resource analyst at MineLife Pty.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: How a GameStop share pullback could hurt some investors,"By Ross Kerber, April Joyner and Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - Any pullback in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME)'s shares potentially exposes some investors to losses. Those at risk could include people who bought the stock at recent highs, or on margin, and those using options trading strategies.
Shares of GameStop, which had seen a spectacular rally, fell 31% on Monday to close at $225, 53% lower than their Jan 28 peak of $483.
WHICH INVESTORS COULD TAKE A HIT?
Analysts worry some new or inexperienced investors could face losses if they bought in as the stock was peaking.
Particularly vulnerable would be those who bought ""on margin,"" using money borrowed from brokers to buy extra shares. 
The strategy can boost gains when share prices are on the way up, but magnify losses on the way down especially if brokers issue ""margin calls"" requiring clients to add money or face forced sales to bring an account's equity back to required levels. 
Brokers are not required to notify clients when they sell shares in a margin call, ""although most do so as a courtesy,"" according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/margin-calls, the industry's self-policing body. 
Riley Adams, a 31-year-old financial analyst who runs youngandtheinvested.com, a financial blog aimed at millennials, said if investors bought on margin late to the party ""you're definitely exposed right now.""
Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR), estimated about half the platform's 1.2 million accounts are margin accounts. Thousands of margin calls occur on a typical day and the rate increased last week, he said. Peterffy said about 27,000 accounts had some sort of position in GameStock, and many positions liquidated were owned by traders who had shorted GameStock.
Representatives for brokerages TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and Robinhood declined to share details about how many clients may have traded GameStop shares on margin. A Schwab representative did not respond to questions.
However, Robinhood has restricted https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility buying shares, which limits investor exposure on its platform. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR TRADERS USING OPTIONS 
Options bets on GameStop shares helped fuel the stock's breathtaking rally. Investors are gauging to what extent they could exacerbate a decline.
Some market watchers say a ""gamma squeeze"" - where market makers who have sold large numbers of calls to investors balance out their positions by buying the underlying stock - was a key driver of GameStop's sharp rally. 
In theory, a sharp drop in the stock could prompt those same market makers to unload their shares, potentially speeding up a plunge. That's what happened last September, after investors piled into call options on tech-related companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. The unwind of those positions helped fuel a sharp decline in the Nasdaq.
For now, however, it appears that open interest in GameStop calls has not accumulated significantly, as many buyers of those contracts have traded them the same day, according to Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
More contracts have remained open among GameStop puts, according to data from Trade Alert. Another key risk would be to market participants who sold those puts, wagering that GameStop shares would not fall below a certain level, if the stock were to tumble significantly below their targets.
But because options prices already account for gigantic swings in the stock, ""people who are short options might not lose as much as you think,"" Murphy said. Overall, GameStop options are now pricing in daily moves of about 27% over the next month, versus around 8.5% at the start of January, according to Trade Alert.
On the other hand, investors who have held onto calls to position for further gains in GameStop shares could lose their entire investment should the stock not hit their targeted price before the options expire. 
WHAT DOES THE TRADING MEAN FOR SHORT-SELLERS?
A slide in GameStop shares would see short sellers looking to capitalize by finding ""attractive exit points,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. Short sellers sell borrowed shares in a bet that prices will fall and the shares can be bought back at a lower level.
At the same time, a slide could draw new shorts looking to jump on any downward price momentum, Dusaniwsky said. The number of GameStop shares shorted has fallen by more than half in the past week, as shorts have covered their bets, Dusaniwsky said.

If new shorts join in as the stock slides, it would exacerbate the selling, as long holders try to exit their positions to realize profits, Dusaniwsky said.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>","Global business travel to grow 21% in 2021, trade group forecasts","(Reuters) - Business travel spending is forecast to grow 21% this year worldwide, helped by the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, but will not recover to pre-pandemic levels until the middle of the decade, a business travel association said on Tuesday.
Spending on business travel is projected to rise to $842 billion in 2021, according to the Global Business Travel Association's (GBTA) BTI Outlook, after dropping 52% in 2020 to $694 billion due to the pandemic.
After a decade of steady annual growth, business travel is expected to have shown losses in 2020 that were 10 times greater than the declines after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks or the 2008 recession, GBTA said.
Despite the expected growth in travel in 2021, uncertainty around vaccination progress and U.S. President Joe Biden's policies can affect the recovery.
“The continued rollout of the vaccine will be central to recovery globally, as will decisions the new Biden Administration makes regarding global trade and border and quarantine policies,"" said Dave Hilfman, GBTA's interim executive director in a statement.
As U.S. airlines also expect, the group said businesses are likely to spend more on travel that cannot be duplicated with online meetings such as sales calls and service trips. 
The proportion of companies' travel budget spent on internal meetings is estimated to decline 6%, compared with 2019, the group said. 
By the end of 2024, business travel spending is projected to reach about $1.4 trillion, nearly equaling the 2019 pre-pandemic revenue peak of $1.43 trillion, the group said. It projects a full recovery in 2025.

Key developing economies in Asia Pacific will drive global growth in business travel over the next decade, the group said.

Positive momentum from Asia carried through to Europe, with the pan-European STOXX 600 edging up 0.9%.

MSCI's gauge of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose 1.5%, with China's benchmark CSI300 Index climbing 1.5%, helped by easing concerns about tight liquidity and falling cases of new coronavirus infections. Japan's Nikkei 225 added 1%.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index added 0.8%.
Markets were buoyant ahead of negotiations Tuesday between U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican senators on a new COVID support bill. The GOP's $618bn stimulus plan released early Monday was about a third the size of the President's proposal. Top Democrats later on Monday filed a joint $1.9 trillion budget measure in a step toward bypassing Republicans.
""If you have the ability to have stimulus compromise it's going to be very supportive for financial assets in the medium term as it means you will have the ability to have an economic recovery,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""The $1.9 trillion was set as a high bar of the possibilities and in a way to get into a negotiation to get something that would be smaller and more efficient.""
The dollar hovered near a seven-week high, benefiting from a euro selloff overnight after coronavirus lockdowns choked consumer spending in Germany, and on short-covering in over-crowded dollar-selling positions.
The dollar index eased a touch by 0.1% to 90.91.
Against the U.S. dollar, the euro was trading at $1.2078, just above an early December low of $1.2056 hit in the previous session.
The Australian dollar pared gains after the country's central bank said it will extend its quantitative easing programme to buy an additional $100 billion of bonds. The Aussie last stood at $0.7627, nearly flat on the day.
Turkey's lira firmed more than 1%, extending a rally after the central bank promised tight policy for an extended period last week.
With global market sentiment remaining upbeat about U.S. fiscal stimulus, core euro zone government bond yields edged up, with the benchmark German 10-year Bund yield < DE10YT=RR.> around two basis points higher at -0.4980%.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 04:20AM ET</span>",Pandemic drives oil major BP to first loss in a decade,"By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) plunged to a $5.7 billion loss last year, its first in a decade, as the pandemic took a heavy toll on oil demand, and the energy company warned of a tough start to 2021 amid widespread travel restrictions.
Despite the weak environment, however, CEO Bernard Looney told Reuters the company's transition to a greener future remained on track. It is aiming to ramp up renewable power generation to 50 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 from 3.3 GW currently, while slashing oil output to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Capital expenditure is set to rise to $13 billion this year, of which $9 billion will still go to oil and gas, Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss said. That compared with a budget of $12 billion in 2020.
For the last quarter of 2020, BP reported a profit of $115 million, falling short of analysts' forecasts due to weak oil and gas sales and subdued trading, it said on Tuesday. 
""A tough quarter at the end of a tough year,"" Looney said in an analyst call. 
At 0845 GMT, BP shares were down 3.8% at 258.9 pence. 
Flagging a weak start to 2021, BP said: ""We expect renewed COVID-19 restrictions to have a greater impact on product demand, with January retail volumes down by around 20% year on year, compared with a decline of 11% in the fourth quarter."" 
Oil demand is nevertheless expected to recover in 2021, with global inventories expected to return to their five-year average by the middle of the year, Looney told Reuters.
For a graphic on BP's annual profits:
https://graphics.reuters.com/BP-RESULTS/ygdpzalwrvw/chart.png
Tighter global natural gas markets are expected to further support profits, BP said.
Adjusted profit at its downstream - or refining and marketing - business in the fourth quarter collapsed to $126 million, less than a tenth of what it was a year earlier.
BP's shares have lost over 40% of their value over the past year and remain near 25-year lows, battered by concerns over oil demand due to the pandemic as well as investor doubts over BP's ability to successfully carry out its an ambitious plan to shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
Rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) have also seen their market values sink in recent months.
BP's overall fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, of $115 million fell short of the $360 million seen in a company-provided poll of analysts.
That compared with an $86 million profit in the third quarter and a profit of $2.6 billion a year earlier.
For the year, BP reported an underlying loss of $5.69 billion, compared with a profit of $10 billion in 2019.
For a graphic on BP's quarterly profit:
https://graphics.reuters.com/BP-RESULTS/jbyprnwrkpe/chart.png
BP's debt pile of $39 billion is expected to rise in the first half of this year as it continues to struggle with a weak business environment, but the company said it remained on track to reduce it to $35 billion by early 2022.
At that debt level, BP plans to start share buybacks.

1358,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 03:44AM ET</span>",European Stocks Higher; Stimulus Hopes Boost Growth Optimism,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, helped by signs of progress towards further U.S. stimulus, while concerns over volatile retail-led trading receded. 
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.4% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.5%. 
U.S. President Joe Biden sat down late Monday with a group of ten Republican senators to discuss their proposal of a scaled-back Covid-19 stimulus package, in a welcome sign of bipartisan co-operation in Washington.
That said, Biden insisted on keeping the $1.9 trillion price tag that he proposed in January, and senior Democrats later filed a joint budget measure of the same size in a step toward aimed at bypassing Republicans.
Indications that this package may be delivered reasonably quickly buoyed global markets, as well as hopes that economic recovery may not be too far away: vaccination rollouts continue, despite the slow start in continental Europe, and new infections and fatalities are starting to decline slowly in response to lockdowns.
Adding to the optimism were signs that the recent market turmoil caused by retail traders taking on hedge funds over heavily-shorted stocks may be settling down. 
GameStop (NYSE:GME), the stock at the heart of last week’s protest, saw its shares slide 30% on Monday, and they have continued to fall in premarket trading Tuesday. Similarly, silver, which saw heavy buying on Monday, has dropped over 2% so far Tuesday.
In corporate news, Atos (PA:ATOS) stock gained 3.8% after the French IT consulting group ended talks of a potential takeover of U.S. rival DXC Technology. British pub group Marston’s  (LON:MARS) also continued to rise in the wake of rejecting a bid from private equity, gaining 0.3% to an 11-month high.
Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS) stock slumped 13% after the health care firm warned its adjusted net profit would likely drop this year, due to more of its long-term patients dying of Covid-19, while BP (NYSE:BP) stock fell 3.3% after the oil major reported a full year loss of $5.7 billion, its first in a decade. 
On the data front, the eurozone will publish preliminary fourth-quarter growth numbers later Tuesday, which are expected to confirm that the region's economy shrunk in the year.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, helped by newswire reports that the major oil producers have shown restraint in terms of production levels in January even as prices rose.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later Tuesday, will be keenly awaited, especially after last week’s hefty draw, while OPEC+'s Joint Technical Committee is also due to discuss the state of the market. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $54.20 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.1% to $56.98. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,851.80/oz, while silver futures were down 5.5% after their spike on Monday at $27.77/oz. EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2077.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 03:30AM ET</span>",Five things to watch in Reddit stocks trading mania,"(Reuters) - Silver dropped more than 4% on Tuesday and  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) sank 33% in early European deals, raising questions about how long a social media-fueled trading frenzy in stocks and other assets would last.
The populist trading rally, organized in online forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets, has helped attract a flood of retail cash into stocks such as GameStop, burned hedge funds that had bet against the stocks and roiled broader markets.
Here are five things to watch on Tuesday:
** SILVER MARGINS - The rally in silver halted overnight with prices slipping back below $30 after CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) raised Comex 5000 Silver Futures maintenance margins by 17.9%. Frankfurt-listed shares of GameStop, the trigger for the slugfest between amateur investors and Wall Street hedge funds last week, also plunged 37% at the open following a 19% slide on Monday.
** BROKER CAPITAL - Robinhood, the easy access brokerage app which has fueled the trades, raised another $2.4 billion in funding on top of the $1 billion it raised last week after its finances were strained by the retail trading frenzy, but will that be enough?
** SHORT OF SHORTS - The number of GameStop shares that were shorted fell by more than half last week as short sellers scrambled to cover their bets due to soaring valuations of stocks they had bet would fall. Still, GameStop short interest stood at $8.82 billion as of Friday, making it the sixth-biggest short by value, according to S3.
** REDDIT FORUMS - WallStreetBets saw a surge in posts on Monday arguing that the bets on silver were undercutting their focus on GameStop and other popular stocks. Swings in the forum's almost 8 million participants may decide where the pack move next. 

** BROADER MARKETS BOUNCE - The S&P 500, hit by the fallout of the battle last week, registered its biggest daily percentage gain since November on Monday. Still, the U.S. stock market which some analysts argue already looks overvalued after a stimulus-powered rally last year, was at risk of falling further if the short squeeze persists. (N)

(Reuters) - Foreigners turned net sellers of Asian equities in January, after three consecutive months of buying, as they booked profits amid worries over rising coronavirus cases and lofty stock valuations.
Overseas investors were net sellers of a combined total of $5.52 billion in South Korean, Taiwanese, Philippine, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian and Indian stocks last month, stock exchange data showed.

Global COVID-19 cases crossed over 100 million last month with more than 2 million dead, and some delay in vaccine distribution around the world also curbed risk appetite.
The MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares' forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) surged to 17.42 at the end of January, the highest since September 2009.
After pouring over $4 billion in South Korean and Taiwanese equities in the last quarter of 2020, foreigners took out vast amounts of money from the two markets in January.
South Korea faced outflows of $5.3 billion, while Taiwan saw net sales of $3.3 billion.
South Korea, which had initial success in containing the pandemic, has experienced its third and strongest wave of infections this winter, and also faced criticism it was slow to secure vaccines for its 52 million people.
""Korea is behind in rolling out its vaccine with the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency promising to inoculate 70% of its 52m population by September"", brokerage firm Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a report.
""We downgrade (South Korean equities) to Modestly Bullish as the equity market looks expensive versus bonds,"" the report said.
On the other hand, Indian and Indonesian equities lured $2.66 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, in inflows last month.
Herald van der Linde (NYSE:LIN), head of Asia equity strategy at HSBC, said investors are moving towards markets such as ASEAN countries, which lagged in price performance last year.
""There is some rotation between markets going on,"" he said.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",British lockdowns drive acceleration in grocery sales growth,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British grocery market saw sales growth accelerate to 12.2% in the latest 12-week period as reintroduced lockdown restrictions to stem the spread of COVID-19 caused people to spend more on food and drink, industry data showed on Tuesday.
Market researcher Kantar said the outcome for the 12 weeks to Jan. 24 compared to year-on-year growth of 11.4% in last month's report and reflected the curtailment of eating out of the home as cafés, restaurants and pubs were forced to close.
In January alone, shoppers spent 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) more on supermarket food and drink items compared with the same four-week period last year, Kantar said, with the average family spending 50 pounds more on groceries.
""Dry January also played a role in increased spend on no-alcohol beer, which grew by 12%. However, many sought to indulge and keep spirits high during a tough winter month and alcohol sales grew overall by 234 million pounds, an uplift of 29% on last year,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.
Online shopping hit a record 14% share of the UK grocery market, boosted by a 229% year-on-year rise in the online spending by retired households.
Morrisons, Britain's No. 4 supermarket group, was the best performer of the four major players with sales growth of 14.3%.
Market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), No. 2 Sainsbury's and No. 3 Asda, an arm of Walmart (N:WMT), saw growth of 12.2%, 12% and 9.9% respectively.
Kantar said UK grocery inflation was 1.3% over the 12 weeks. Prices are rising fastest in markets such as canned colas, skincare and chilled fruit drinks while falling in vegetables, fresh beef and rice/noodles.
Shares in Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have performed solidly in 2021 so far - up 5.2%, 7.5% and 1.4%.
They have been buoyed by expectations of continuing strong trading and by the failed bid by Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard to acquire France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) which has shone light on the sector's value.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Hedge funds have raised their bets against Canadian silver-mining stocks, January short-selling data from a market regulator showed, while the miners' shares and silver itself rose sharply due to buying by retail investors.
A social media-driven buying spree lifted silver to an eight-year high on Monday, spurred by posts on the same Reddit message board behind last week's frenzied buying of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other shares. 
But the rally later cooled on doubts about the ability of retail traders to move prices in a bigger, more liquid commodities market.
""The Reddit-fueled trader is learning that ... the silver market is much bigger than some of the small cap stocks they have been trading,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Between Thursday and Monday, Toronto-listed  First Majestic Silver  (NYSE:AG) Corp and Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) Corp soared 60.5% and 30.7%, respectively. Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM), Fortuna Silver Mines (NYSE:FSM) and Silvercorp Metals (NYSE:SVM) Inc all had double-digit gains over the same time period.
The big rally drew the attention of short sellers who increased their bets on silver stocks to fall, indicating that hedge funds believe the rally is nearing an end.
Short trades as a percentage of total traded volume for First Majestic rose to 28.5% for the second half of January, up from 12.8% in the first half of the month, Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) data showed on Monday.
Short positions in Pan American rose to 35.9%, from 3.3%, over the same period, while Fortuna Silver Mines saw an increase to 36.6% from 2.2%, and  Silvercorp Metals Inc  to 23.1%, from 1.4%.
Hedge funds tend to bet a company share price will fall by borrowing a stock from an institutional investor, such as a pension fund, and selling it back at a lower price when the company dips in value, pocketing the difference. 

Reuters reported Monday that Mexico's government plans to seek more than $500 million from First Majestic Silver as part of an ongoing tax dispute.

China's best known businessman was not mentioned in an front-page article published by the Shanghai Securities News. Instead Huawei Technologies' Ren Zhengfei, Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp's Lei Jun and BYD's Wang Chuanfu were lauded for their contributions.
It was published on Tuesday when Alibaba will also report its latest quarterly earnings. The e-commerce giant did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The catalyst for Ma's current woes was an Oct. 24 speech in which he blasted China's regulatory system, leading to the suspension of his Ant Group's $37 billion IPO just days before the fintech giant's listing. 
Regulators have since launched an anti-trust probe into the tech sector with Alibaba taking much of the heat, while tighter regulations for Ant Group are also being considered. 
Ma, who is not known for shying away from the limelight, subsequently disappeared from the public eye for about three months, triggering frenzied speculation about his whereabouts. He re-emerged last month with a 50-second video appearance.

The Shanghai Securities News said that while some of the entrepreneurs it praised had once behaved like ""reckless heroes"" in their efforts to break away from an old, rigid economic system, they now led ""a group of companies that respected the rules of development and abided by market rules.""

Boeing last week announced a $6.5 billion charge on the 777X in part due to weaker-than-expected demand for the model. It also pushed back its entry into service by a year to late 2023 in anticipation of a longer, costlier certification process. 
""Delays on the 737 MAX and 777X programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft,"" the manufacturer said in a regulatory filing. 
Customers for the 777X include Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd, Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd, ANA Holdings Inc and Lufthansa. 
Boeing lists 350 orders on its website, although some customers have indicated they would like to reduce their orders or push back delivery dates as they grapple with a plunge in international travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
At the end of 2019, Boeing had listed 309 of the 777X orders as firm, meaning it was confident customers still planned to buy that many planes and could finance their purchase. 

Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said last week on an earnings call that the company's order backlog had fallen during the fourth quarter of 2020 due to its accounting standard assessment, including the revised schedule for the 777X.

Investor sentiment was boosted after a “very productive” two-hour meeting on Monday between U.S. President Joe Biden and a group of ten Republican senators who proposed a downsized COVID-19 stimulus package.
However, Biden is insisting on keeping the $1.9 trillion price tag that he proposed in January, saying that the downsized effort does not go far enough to solve the COVID-19 crisis.
Biden told the group “that he will not slow down work on this urgent crisis response and will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
Fears that speculative buying will derail the equity bull market after the market volatility seen during the previous week also receded, adding to shares’ gains.
“We’re still positive on equities while acknowledging the near-term risk of more volatility … our view of a second half recovery supported by improvement from COVID-19 is still intact. The pace of recovery could vary by region, but the outlook of the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest economies, remains positive,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management chief Asia market strategist Tai Hui told Bloomberg.
Positive news came on the vaccine front, with the number of Americans who have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine exceeding the number that tested positive for the virus. Across the Atlantic, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has vowed to offer all Germans a vaccine by the end of September, even if new shots are not approved by then.
Earnings season continues, with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) and GlaxoSmithKline PLC (LON:GSK) among the companies announcing their results throughout the week.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 09:30PM ET</span>","Myanmar coup to dampen U.S. trade, impact footwear companies, experts warn","By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The coup in Myanmar is expected to dampen the interest of U.S. and Western companies in investing in Myanmar, and may prompt some big U.S. companies to pull out, trade experts and analysts said on Monday.
Total trade in goods between Myanmar and the United States amounted to nearly $1.3 billion in the first 11 months of 2020, up from $1.2 billion in all of 2019, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Apparel and footwear accounted for some 41% of total U.S. goods imports, followed by luggage, which accounted for nearly 30%, and fish, which accounted for just over 4%, said Panjiva, the supply chain research unit of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence.
Luggage maker Samsonite and privately owned apparel maker LL Bean are among big importers, along with retailer H&M and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), Panjiva said. 
U.S. imports increased in part due to tariffs on goods from China, but Myanmar still ranked only 84th on the list of U.S. goods suppliers, according to U.S. data.
The World Bank reported a 33% jump in total foreign direct investment commitments in Myanmar to $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2019/2020, led by Singapore and Hong Kong, but said the outlook was uncertain due to the pandemic and market developments.
U.S. direct investment data was unavailable, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said. 
Myanmar's army on Monday handed power to military chief General Min Aung Hlaing and imposed a year-long state of emergency, saying it had responded to what it called election fraud. 
The move sparked condemnation from Western leaders and a threat of renewed sanctions by the U.S. government, and raised questions about the outlook for a million Rohingya refugees.
Lucas Myers, analyst with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said the coup would exacerbate strains in U.S.-Myanmar ties following sanctions imposed by Washington in December 2019 and would further complicate trade relations.
""On trade, the Rohingya situation and Myanmar's troubled human rights record rendered investment less attractive for Western firms as compared with China,"" Myers said. 
William Reinsch, trade expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said U.S. companies could opt to pull out of Myanmar, given new developments and the Biden administration's vow to focus more on human rights.
While some U.S. companies had moved work from China to Myanmar in recent years to take advantage of lower wages, the country's infrastructure was still lacking, which had kept investment from booming, he added.
Most of the U.S. work was in relatively low capital-intensive industries and could be relocated fairly easily, even if doing so would take time, Reinsch said. ""It's not semiconductors. These factories are relatively easy to set up."" 
Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said many of the trade group's members did business in Myanmar and found the coup deeply concerning.
""We urge the full and immediate restoration of democratic rights and institutions,"" he said. ""Our hearts and prayers are with the Myanmar people for a swift, peaceful, and democratic resolution to this crisis – one that does not take away the economic progress made by the hardworking people of Myanmar.""

A spokesperson for H&M said the company was monitoring events and was in close contact with suppliers, but had no immediate plans to change its sourcing strategy. ""We are closely following the developments, but refrain from speculating about what this will mean for us going forward,"" the official said.

But as hedge fund Citadel LLC emerges as one of the key actors in the trading frenzy last week involving  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) - and questions arise over whether the activity exposes deeper risks for the financial system - Yellen could find herself pulled into the fray.
Citadel, together with another fund, extended a $2.75 billion financial lifeline to hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which had suffered heavy losses by betting against GameStop. Citadel Securities, a separate trading arm, pays Robinhood to execute its users' trades, a practice that has drawn some concern from investor advocates. 
The White House has said Yellen is among a handful of officials monitoring the fracas. As head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), Yellen is broadly responsible for the health of the entire trading and investing system.
A sticking point for her to clear, though, may be $700,000 in speaking fees she accepted from Citadel, as recently as last fall. Yellen has pledged not to involve herself in an official capacity in matters involving the firm without first seeking a written waiver from Treasury ethics officials.
Ethics experts say that pledge is not a hard wall for her to scale should the need arise. After ethics violations dogged the Trump administration, some groups are urging Yellen to pre-emptively seek a waiver, and set a precedent.
""This example is a good test of Biden's ethics executive order and the transparency that follows, but it also highlights the revolving door and why restrictions are necessary to protect the integrity of government missions, policies, and programs,"" said Scott Amey, general counsel at Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog group. 
The Treasury secretary normally does not get involved in matters involving individual stocks and concentrates instead on broad systemic risks to the financial system, which the department monitors through daily market surveillance.
""Secretary Yellen of course will abide by her ethics agreement and ethics pledge in all instances,"" Treasury spokesman Calvin Mitchell said. He did not indicate how she would approach the specific Citadel issue. 
SPEAKING FEES 
Like many former government officials, including https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-bernanke/bernanke-enjoys-fruits-of-free-market-with-first-post-fed-speech-idUSL1N0M11FA20140305 her Federal Reserve chair predecessor Ben Bernanke, Yellen took speaking fees from private companies after she left government. 
Yellen filed an ethics agreement https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/18A4D129DD5675888525864F0081071C/$FILE/Yellen,%20Janet%20L.%20final%20EA.pdf with the Office of Government Ethics in December saying she would ""seek written authorization to participate personally and substantially in any particular matter"" related to any companies that paid her speaking fees prior to joining President Joe Biden's administration - for a year after her last speech to each firm. 
Yellen spoke several times at Citadel, most recently on an Oct. 27 webinar, according to the filing. She was paid at least $700,000 in speaking fees by the Citadel while she was in private practice at the Brookings Institution think tank, another disclosure https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/C22B882BBDC40AC78525864F008106AB/$FILE/Yellen,%20Janet%20L.%20AMENDEDfinal%20278.pdf shows.
These speaking engagements, which also include financial heavyweights such as  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), and Goldman Sachs, are not likely to impact her ability to give Biden broad advice on the stock trading matter, government ethics experts say.
""If this becomes a situation where regulators are considering new rulemaking with Citadel as the poster-child, that's different,"" said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of Public Citizen, a group pushing for stronger financial regulation. 
SYSTEMIC RISK 
A major question is whether volatility from Gamestop and similar retail investor revolts against short-squeezes boil over into a systemic event that sends markets crashing broadly. 
Typically a matter involving an individual stock or equity market trading and brokerages would fall to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has said it is examining the matter.
On Friday, SEC commissioners including acting chair Allison Herren Lee said in a statement https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-market-volatility-2021-01-29 they were closely monitoring the extreme volatility in certain stocks and warned market participants to ""uphold their obligations to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing.""
Extreme stock price volatility ""has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence,"" they added.
Biden's choice to run the SEC, Gary Gensler, awaits Senate hearings.
The FSOC that Yellen chairs is charged with identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability. It includes the heads of the Federal Reserve and other major U.S. financial regulatory agencies.
    It has the authority to designate non-bank financial institutions for consolidated supervision to minimize risk to the financial system or to break up firms that pose a ""grave threat."" 
Distress in individual companies rarely rises to such a level. Treasury maintains daily market surveillance, but it is looking for orderly market functioning and broad systemic threats.
Thus far, the situation looks contained, Barclays said in a note to clients on Friday. Short positions in stocks favored on the Reddit social media site total about $40 billion, which would limit the pain to a handful of hedge funds.
""The ongoing short squeeze in a few stocks by retail investors has raised concerns of a broader contagion. While we believe there is more pain to come, we remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,"" Barclays said.
YELLEN HAS FEW WALL STREET TIES
Unlike many previous Treasury secretaries, Yellen has only worked as an academic and for the government, not at a bank or trading firm. 
Richard Painter, a former top ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, said many Treasury secretaries had a great deal more entanglements that would raise conflict of interest concerns than Yellen.
Henry Paulson, a Republican who was U.S. Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial meltdown, sold half a billion dollars in stock from his former employer  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) to satisfy ethics concerns. Paulson later forced Goldman and other major banks to take billions of dollars in taxpayer capital at the depth of the financial crisis.
Steven Mnuchin, Yellen's immediate predecessor, pledged https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mnuchin/trumps-treasury-nominee-mnuchin-pledges-to-divest-assets-worth-millions-idUSKBN14V297 after he was nominated to divest $94 million in investments, and refrain from any decisions involving CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) until August 2018, when he was due a payment of $5 million from the company. 
""Yellen is going to be about as clean as you can get on this stuff,"" Painter said.

Houlihan joins Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), Moelis (NYSE:MC) and Evercore in offering private companies a way to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, an alternative to the traditional initial public offering process offered by bulge bracket banks.
Saddle Point is run by Roy Katzovicz who worked for William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management before launching his own fund, Maxima Fund I, in 2019. In March medical waste company Stericycle (NASDAQ:SRCL) settled with Saddle Point for two board seats.
Katzovicz will be the chief executive officer of Advanced Merger Partners Inc.
The SPAC will ""position us well to capitalize on what we believe to be a secular shift towards go-to-market equity financing strategies that recognize the comparative advantages of 'going public' by way of a business combination with a blank-check company,"" the filing said.
Houlihan Lokey and Saddle Point did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
There will be four independent directors - investors Bruce Zimmerman and Alejandro Santo Domingo, as well as James Ellis, a former academic with expertise in consumer product and retail companies, and entertainment industry expert Ann Daly, who co-founded WndrCo.
Houlihan Lokey Executive Chairman Irwin Gold will also serve as a director and chair of Advanced Merger Partners' investment committee, while Houlihan banker John Mavredakis will be chairman of the board.
Some 248 SPACs raised around $83 billion through IPOs in 2020, more than the prior 5 years combined, according to SPAC Research. The pace has only intensified in 2021, with 91 SPAC IPOs completed so far to raise $25.8 billion.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google will spend $3.8 million, including $2.6 million in back pay, to settle allegations that it underpaid women and unfairly passed over women and Asians for job openings, the U.S. Department of Labor said on Monday.
The allegations stemmed from a routine compliance audit several years ago required by Google's status as a supplier of technology to the federal government.
Google said it was pleased to have resolved the matter.
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs had found ""preliminary indicators"" that Google from 2014 to 2017 at times underpaid 2,783 women in its software engineering group in Mountain View, California, and the Seattle area. 
Investigators also found hiring rate differences that disadvantaged women and Asian candidates during the year ended Aug. 31, 2017, for software engineering roles in San Francisco, Sunnyvale, California, and Kirkland, Washington.
The settlement includes $2.6 million in back pay to 5,500 employees and job candidates and calls on Google to review hiring and salary practices. 
Google also will set aside $1.25 million for pay adjustments for engineers in Mountain View, Kirkland, Seattle and New York over the next five years, according to the settlement. Any unused funds will be spent on diversity efforts at Google.
The company already conducts annual pay audits, but like other big tech companies, it remains under public scrutiny for a workforce that does not reflect the country's makeup in terms of race and gender. 

The company said in a statement, ""We believe everyone should be paid based upon the work they do, not who they are, and invest heavily to make our hiring and compensation processes fair and unbiased.""

(Reuters) -The S&P 500 registered its biggest daily percentage gain since Nov. 24 on Monday after a steep sell-off last week, and technology-related shares led the advance, while a move by retail traders into silver drove up mining shares.
Investors also watched talks over the latest U.S. COVID-19 relief package.
The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) ETF - the largest silver-backed ETF - jumped 7.1%. Silver prices climbed to an eight-year peak of just over $30 an ounce before paring gains.
U.S. small-cap miners Hecla Mining Co and Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) Inc surged.
Last week, retail traders drove big gains in companies such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). GameStop was down 30.8% on Monday.
The frenzy may have changed course but is likely to stick around for a while, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
""The fact of the matter is this is a powerful move in the markets, and it's not just going to dissipate,"" she said.
The S&P 500 technology and consumer discretionary sectors, up more than 2% each, gave the S&P 500 its biggest boosts in the broad market rally. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), due to report results Tuesday, was among the biggest positive influences, along with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple has filed for a six-part notes offering, according to an SEC filing.
Results are also expected this week from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 229.29 points, or 0.76%, to 30,211.91, the S&P 500 gained 59.62 points, or 1.61%, to 3,773.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 332.70 points, or 2.55%, to 13,403.39.
U.S. President Joe Biden was to meet with 10 moderate Republican senators to discuss their proposal to shrink his sweeping $1.9 trillion U.S. COVID-19 relief package, even as Democrats prepare to push legislation through Congress without Republican support.
The CBOE volatility index eased from three-month highs.
Wall Street's main indexes last week logged their steepest weekly fall since October, as investors digested efficacy data from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine trial results, and a battle between Wall Street hedge funds and retail investors added to volatility.
Robinhood, the U.S. online broker that has emerged as a gateway for amateur traders challenging Wall Street hedge funds, has held talks with banks about raising $1 billion in debt so it can continue to fulfill orders for heavily shorted stocks, according to a Reuters report, citing people familiar with the matter.
On the economic front, the latest ISM survey was mixed as U.S. manufacturing activity slowed slightly in January, while a measure of prices paid by factories for raw materials and other inputs jumped to its highest level in nearly 10 years.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.67-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 100 new highs and 15 new lows.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",American Airlines CEO tells employees to brace for furlough warnings,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) workers should brace for another round of furlough warnings as the airline expects to remain overstaffed on April 1, when U.S. aid for industry workers expires, Chief Executive Doug Parker said.
American is among U.S. airlines that received money from a $15 billion payroll support package in December to protect workers' jobs and salaries through March, when the industry had hoped that pandemic-hit demand would have recovered with vaccine rollouts. 
""What hasn't happen is what we'd hoped would happen, that we'd get to April 1 and say oh my god ... everybody we have we're going to need them in the July schedule,"" Parker said during a Jan. 28 employee town hall meeting, according to a recording reviewed by Reuters.
An American spokesman confirmed the veracity of the recording.
U.S. aviation unions are urging Congress to extend a third round of payroll assistance, something Parker said he would support.
""That's a much better solution than having people furloughed again when we know that this (COVID-19) is months away from being eradicated,"" he said during the town hall. 
American furloughed 19,000 workers when a first round of government payroll support expired on Oct. 1 but recalled them in December. Parker said he hoped fewer workers would be impacted this time.
Last week, United Airlines said it had sent furlough warnings to 14,000 employees.
U.S. airlines, which posted record annual losses, hope vaccines will fuel a recovery but distribution has been slow and COVID-19 variants are triggering drastic travel curbs by some countries.
""I hate that we're in that position but we are and we can't ignore it so we have to start figuring out what to do about it,"" he said.
Parker said new COVID-19 testing requirements for people entering the U.S. from abroad had further suppressed international travel demand.

Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) have averted layoffs but have slimmed their workforce through voluntary programs.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 05:45PM ET</span>",All eyes on Alphabet's first-ever disclosure of Google Cloud profit,"By Munsif Vengattil and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc will report the cost and operating profit of its Google Cloud business for the first time on Tuesday, disclosures that are expected to overshadow record overall quarterly sales for the internet's biggest platform for ads.
The transparency marks a milestone after years of aggressive investment and comes as the COVID-19 pandemic is pushing more work, shopping and entertainment online.
That drives the ad business Google dominates over rivals  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and it also has created a surge in demand for both parts of Google's cloud business: computing services for retailers and other companies and corporate productivity suites including tools like Gmail. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Chase Co analysts, among the few to make predictions about Google Cloud, estimate the unit's 2020 operating margin at 2%. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts estimate an unspecified operating loss.
By comparison, Amazon's Web Services, the top cloud vendor by sales, posted third-quarter operating margin of 30.5% and $3.5 billion in operating income.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure, the industry No. 2, does not report comparable figures.
Google got serious about the cloud around 2016, five years after Amazon's unit had become a multibillion-dollar behemoth. But some analysts say Google may be ready to show that its heavy investment in staff and data centers to catch up in the industry is finally paying off.
Alphabet's costs have been an increasing concern for Wall Street as sales growth from the advertising business flattens out. 
The company started disclosing Cloud and YouTube sales a year ago. Alphabet will provide a detailed annual breakdown for Cloud going back three years. 
Wall Street analysts forecast fourth-quarter Cloud sales of $3.82 billion for Google, with expectations for the unit to cross $13 billion in annual sales, according to Refinitiv data.
The JPMorgan analysts estimate Google Cloud spent about 40% more in 2020 than Amazon's cloud unit did in 2016, when it had about $12 billion in sales. Google's spending reflects higher competition, as well as cloud vendors expanding into newer technologies.

Analysts expect Google's advertising business will post $42.6 billion in fourth-quarter sales, pushing overall Alphabet quarterly revenue to $53 billion. That would leave Alphabet with 2020 sales of $179 billion and profit of $11 billion.

(Reuters) -Robinhood has tapped $2.4 billion in funding on top of the $1 billion it raised last week after the online brokerage's finances were strained due to a retail trading frenzy in heavily shorted shares of companies such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). 
The latest round of fund injection means that Robinhood has raised more capital in a week than at any point since its inception in 2013, giving it enough financial muscle to meet any funding needs stemming from the trading boom. 
The funding round was led by Ribbit Capital and included existing investors ICONIQ, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures and New Enterprise Associates. 
The fund raising comes at a time when Robinhood, which has become hugely popular with young investors for its easy-to use interface, is planning a high-profile initial public offering, although it is unclear whether it will push ahead with the plan due to recent developments. 
The online brokerage was at the heart of a mania that gripped retail investors last week following calls by Reddit thread WallStreetBets to trade certain stocks that were being heavily shorted by hedge funds.
The trading frenzy in those shorted stocks raised deposit limits at its clearinghouse, with Robinhood's deposit requirements tied to equities rising ten-fold.
Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said on Sunday that the trading app was forced to place curbs on some transactions because the clearinghouse had asked for $3 billion in collateral.
Those increased deposit limits forced Robinhood to seek emergency funding and also prompted the brokerage to curb the purchase of a handful of hot stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which drew the ire of customers, celebrities and politicians. 
Clearinghouses ensure the completion of a stock trade even if one side of the deal goes bust. 

Robinhood said that it would used the funds to invest in ""record customer growth"".
""This round of funding will help us scale to meet the incredible growth we've seen and demand for our platform,"" Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick said.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 04:55PM ET</span>",'Gamestonks' or silver? Reddit investors worry about losing GameStop focus,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retail investors on the popular online forum WallStreetBets expressed concerns on Monday that bets on silver were undercutting their focus on  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other popular stocks. 
Posts that argued against buying silver at the expense of GameStop swarmed across the 7.9 million-member discussion board as shares of GameStop fell 30.8% to close at $225.00 on Monday. Spot silver, meanwhile, jumped more than 11% before paring some gains, its largest one-day rise since 2008.
""By buying silver ... you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME,"" wrote a user with the handle RizzutosNOTAWORD who urged investors to continue to buy GameStop. ""It will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in.""
The posts discouraging investors from buying silver came after a number of posts over the weekend that touted buying the metal because it was undervalued and shorted by large institutions.
""Its value is seriously being artificially depressed by the big banks,"" a user with the handle https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72m7j/when_should_we_go_all_in_on_silver mrbulldops17 wrote late last week. 
Retail investors had pushed GameStop up more than 1,650% during the month of January as a form of protest against a handful of hedge funds which were betting that shares of the video game retailer would fall.
The short squeeze in Reddit-favorite ""stonks"" - an intentional misspelling of ""stocks"" - has upended Wall Street over the last month, forcing hedge funds such as Melvin Capital to post declines of more than 50% while short-sellers such as Andrew Left's Citron Research have shifted their approaches to focusing only on long positions. 
The last two weeks have been ""a wakeup call and retail traders are likely to continue to be a force to be reckoned with, which will likely permanently affect the business models of institutional investors,"" according to a note from  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
Yet the muted trading in silver is one sign that individual investor buying may not sway global assets as they have small-cap stocks with low trading volumes, said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for the Multi-Asset Solutions team at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management. 
""There is a big difference between some of the names in the Russell 2000 and the global silver market or gold market,"" he said. 
GameStop, for instance, began the year with a market cap just north of $1 billion, compared with the roughly $1.4 trillion market value of silver traded worldwide. GameStop's market cap stood at roughly $22 billion on Monday. 

""Guys got way over their skis in terms of how many similar hedge funds have huge short positions in this stock,"" said Andrew Beer of Dynamic Beta Investments. ""I'd be shocked if there are a lot of people who are vulnerably short silver so that if it goes up 5% they have to start buying and suddenly it goes up to 50%.""

1385,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>",Silver dealers scramble to find supplies for retail buyers,"By Arpan Varghese
(Reuters) - A retail investment frenzy in silver driven by social media has left dealers from the United States to Singapore scrambling for bars and coins to meet demand.
Silver prices extended their rally on Monday to an eight-year high as small investors answered calls on social media last week to buy the metal to push up prices. Retail investors cannot directly access the wholesale silver market, so instead they have bought into bars and coins. [GOL/]
""There are massive shortages. We'll be completely out of stock if it carries on like this - the first time since our company opened in Singapore seven years ago,"" said David Mitchell, managing director at Indigo Precious Metals.
Some customers sold gold to buy silver, said Gregor Gregersen, founder of Silver Bullion Pte Ltd, another dealer in Singapore.
""There's a definite shortage of popular silver coins developing (especially North American coins),"" he said. ""However, we're still able to source 1,000 oz good delivery bars at nearly the same premiums for now."" 
U.S. bullion broker Apmex warned of delays in processing silver transactions because of surging volumes.
Other U.S. dealers, including JM Bullion and SD Bullion, warned customers of shipping delays of five to 10 days. Everett Millman at Gainesville Coins in Florida said they were expecting shipping delays, perhaps until perhaps mid-March, for some products like Silver Eagles and Silver Maples.
While a rapid spike in demand has tightened supplies, there is plenty of metal around and delays should ease once metal can be shipped to where it is needed, dealers and industry experts said.
Kevin Rich, global gold market adviser for Australia's Perth Mint, said that while dealers of coins and bars might see some supply constraints and therefore charge higher premiums on these products, the Mint does not anticipate any such issues. 
There is enough airline traffic to ensure supply can move around, he said, unlike last year when the lack of freight capacity disrupted gold markets. 
""In the short term, stocks may run out since it takes a long time for sea shipping, but overall supply is ample,"" said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Hong Kong-based Wing Fung Precious Metals. 
Around 1 billion ounces of silver are produced and consumed each year, and supply has been in surplus for most of the last decade, consultants Metals Focus said.
""There are no signs yet of a broader physical squeeze across silver and we would not expect any at this stage,"" said Frederic Panizzutti, managing director at dealer MKS. 
There was more muted buying in China and India, the leading Asian consumers of physical bullion. 
Chinese investors piled in to the futures market and mining company stocks, but dealers said the rush was yet to actually translate into physical constraints.
Indian buyers typically favour gold as an investment.
""In contrast to what's happening in other parts of the world, silver is seen as more of a consumption, rather than investment, commodity in India,"" the bullion division head of a Mumbai-based silver importing bank said.

Investing.com – The Dow made a positive start to the week Monday, as the spike in volatility that rattled markets in the final days of January subsided after investor focus shifted to another busy week of quarterly results. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.76%, or 229 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.57%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.55%. 
Investor sentiment on stocks returned following a rocky end to the week last month as intensity of the retail-led short-squeeze eased, pushing the VIX – the so-called fear index – down more 9%.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) slumped 31% as retail investors shifted efforts to Silver Futures, squeezing short sellers of the metal. Silver Futures prices rose 9% to a more than eight-year high. But there is growing uncertainty as to whether the bid higher in the metal was driven by retail investors on social media forum Reddit, or by hedge-funds.  Famed-subreddit ""wallstreetbets"" appeared to distance itself from the trade, which appears to be mainly driven by bullish calls on the metal from subreddit ""Wallstreetsilver.""         
The other popular short-squeeze stocks were mostly lower. 
AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) was up 0.5%,  Express Inc  (NYSE:EXPR) fell 17%, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) was up 4%, Nokia Corp ADR (NYSE:NOK) was up 7%, and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) fell 14%.
Tech led the broader market with the Fab 5 leading to the upside.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), both of which report earnings later this week, were up more 4 and 3% respectively. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was up 3%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were up more than 1%.
Apple reportedly plans to sell six-part $14 billion bonds, taking advantage of cheap borrowing rates with a view to returning more cash to shareholders, Bloomberg reported, citing unknown sources.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) are also among the notable companies set to report earnings later this week.
The fourth quarter of earnings is shaping up to be one of the strongest on record, with the roll out of vaccines and easing pandemic impact also helping to improve visibility.
Overall, 37% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported results for Q4 2020, with about 82% reporting EPS above estimates, which is above the five-year average of 74%, the company said.
""If 82% is the final percentage for the quarter, it will mark the second-highest percentage of S&P 500 companies reporting a positive EPS surprise since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008,"" FactSet said.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, turned positive on rising oil prices as Saudi Arabia started to cut production by 1 million barrels a day, following its pledge to do so last month in order to offset production increases by Russia and Kazakhstan.
Focus on stimulus effort were also renewed as a group of ten Republican Senators reportedly proposed a more targeted, but significantly lower $600 billion stimulus package to President Joe Biden.  That is well below the president's $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposal.  
""Reentering stimulus discussions appears to be giving equities a welcome boost as the stock market tries to reset after its worst week since October,"" Stifel said in a note.

Investing.com -- Stocks rallied on Monday ahead of a big week of earnings for tech companies and as volatility eased from last week’s frenzy.
The short-squeeze darling  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) plunged after a crazy week where retail investors battled against professional traders betting against the video game retailer. The same dynamic spilled over into shares of  Express Inc  (NYSE:EXPR),  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY), and others.
Fourth quarter results have been strong so far, with the roll out of vaccines and improving case and death numbers lifting spirits. 
Overall, 37% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported results for Q4 2020, with about 82% reporting EPS above estimates, which is above the five-year average of 74%.

1. All that glitters....
Silver glittered on Monday, but will traders be able to keep the momentum going? Spot silver jumped 7.6%, to nearly $30 an ounce, and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) rose 7% after taking in more than $1 billion of inflows on Friday.
But analysts said the rally might not last. Monday’s run up is giving market watchers a break from the GameStop short squeeze saga. GameStop fell 30% on Monday after last week’s frenzy, but investors won’t be distracted away from equities for long. 
2. Covid-19 vaccine maker earnings
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), which with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) was first out of the gate in the U.S. with emergency vaccine approval, will report quarterly results on Tuesday. Analysts EPS of 52 cents on revenue of $12.2 billion.

The two-shot drug, along with a vaccine from  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) and upcoming candidates from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Novavax  Inc (NASDAQ:NVAX) are seen as key to getting the economy back to normal. 
3. Big tech strikes again
Tuesday is also a key day for big tech earnings from Google parent Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and the e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Alphabet is seen reporting EPS of $15.68 on revenue of $52.9 billion. Amazon is expected to report EPS of $7.16 on revenue of $119.7 billion."

(Reuters) - Robinhood, the U.S. online broker that has emerged as a gateway for amateur traders challenging Wall Street hedge funds, has held talks with banks about raising $1 billion in debt so it can continue to fulfill orders for heavily shorted stocks, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The capital raised would be separate from the $3.4 billion in financing that Robinhood announced on Monday it had secured from its investors since Jan. 29. It reflects the financial pressure that last week's Reddit-fueled frenzy in shares such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) placed on the company, prompting it to restrict some trades.
Robinhood needs the money to backstop trades that its customers place, because its clearinghouse has asked for more collateral due to heightened volatility. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said on Sunday that the trading app decided to place curbs on some transactions because the clearinghouse had asked for $3 billion in collateral.
Robinhood started negotiations with banks about expanding its lines of credit or arranging a new one after it drained its revolving debt facility during last week's frenetic trading, one of the sources said. It is not clear how much debt Robinhood will be able to secure.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Robinhood declined to comment.
Robinhood, which has become popular with young investors for its easy-to-use interface, is at the heart of a mania that kicked off last week following calls by Reddit thread WallStreetBets to trade certain stocks that were being heavily shorted by hedge funds.
The online brokerage faced criticism from some of its users for placing restrictions on transactions. Its woes have raised doubt over whether its plans to launch an initial public offering by April will stay on track. 
The Menlo Park, California-based company was founded in 2013 by Baiju Bhatt and Tenev, aiming to democratize finance. Its platform allows users to make unlimited commission-free trades in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options and cryptocurrencies.

Robinhood said on Monday that its latest equity financing was led by Ribbit Capital, with participation from existing investors including ICONIQ Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Index Ventures and NEA.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",Analysis: Indian ARC may only give banks respite from toxic debt flood,"By Nupur Anand and Aftab Ahmed
MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's plan to set up a bad bank may boost valuations and ease short-term stress for state-owned lenders, but bankers and sector insiders are concerned it will not solve deeper problems.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed creating an asset reconstruction company (ARC) for India's bad-debt laden lenders to offload soured assets, which some analysts estimate now total $100 billion.
""It is a good move but there are more fundamental issues on how to recognise problem loans early and resolve them, which still need to be fixed,"" Sanjoy Datta, Deloitte India financial services practice head, said of the budget proposal.
Indian banks had gross non-performing assets of 7.5% at the end of September, which the Reserve Bank of India warned could nearly double to 14.8% under a severe stress scenario. State-owned banks account for 9.7%, compared to private ones at 4.6%.
Against this background, Sitharaman is attempting to revive a pandemic-hit economy with limited resources and the bad bank move will ease some of her burden by freeing up balance sheets to boost credit growth, which has hovered around 6% this year.
It would also enable the government to fork out less for stimulus and put a greater onus on banks to lend and pull the economy out of an expected 7.7% contraction this fiscal year.
""Banks are flush with funds, but lending can only happen when there is economic growth,"" V.G. Kannan, former head of the Indian Banks' Association said.
The government is looking at setting up an ARC that will take over stressed loans from banks and sell these assets to alternative investment funds and other investors.
In doing so it must learn from more than three decades of global experience of bad banks, said Vinayak Bahuguna, former chief executive of asset reconstruction company ARCIL.
""While the bad bank was a success in Spain, it has been a mixed bag in Asia, with the performance not so encouraging in China and Malaysia,"" Bahuguna said.
""Wherever banks have tried to hold on to the bad assets for long and have lost value due to the delayed sale the experience has been poor,"" Bahuguna added.
The Indian finance ministry and central bank did not immediately respond to emails, sent outside office hours, seeking comment on concerns over the bad bank.
PRIVATISATION IMPETUS
New Delhi intends to privatise two state-owned banks and sell its stake in private lender IDBI to help refill India's depleted coffers. Analysts said that in the short-term an ARC could achieve its immediate goal of boosting valuations.
The Nifty PSU Bank index, which tracks state-run lenders jumped 7.1%, after Sitharaman announced the ARC proposal and the government outlined plans to privatise two state-owned banks in addition to IDBI Bank.
But concerns remain that a government-backed bad bank may do little to recognise deep-seated asset quality problems.
""State-owned banks that are struggling will be able to attract capital only when their balance sheet is cleaned,"" said Avneesh Sukhija, an analyst at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). 
""The creation of the bad bank will make them attractive to institutional investors. (A) bad bank is a short term solution and not a long term fix."" Sukhija added.
Measures introduced by the government and central bank to address toxic loans have not proved effective, bankers said.
""Bad bank is a good idea but the key will be in execution. There are so many problems now with the earlier mechanisms so we clearly need more than just new measures,"" a senior official at a state-owned bank said.
Another banker said that further steps required to tackle the problem included better price discovery for stressed assets, incentivising the sale of these assets and easing the rules for distressed debt funds in India.
A Bank for International Settlements (BIS) analysis of 135 banks across 15 countries, published in a report a year ago, suggests that recapitalising the lenders will also be key.

The segregation of bad loans is only effective in the clean-up and recovery process when undertaken along with recapitalisation, the BIS report said.

As part of a six-year partnership, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker will incorporate the tech giant's Android operating system into its Ford and Lincoln vehicles starting in 2023. 
Ford will offer its customers built-in Google apps, including its map and voice technology. It will deploy Google artificial intelligence technology to improve the efficiency of vehicle development, supply chain and manufacturing operations, the companies said.
The companies will also form a group, Team Upshift, to explore uses of data to develop new retail, create new ownership offers and other services for Ford customers. 
Ford customer data will not be handed over to Google or Google advertisers, Ford vice president for strategy, David McClelland, said during a conference call. 
The automaker will continue to use other cloud service providers and collaborate with other tech companies such as Amazon.com, he said.
“Will Ford be like Foxconn? No. Absolutely not,” McClelland said, alluding to a fear among some auto sector executives that auto manufacturers would be relegated to low-margin hardware assembly, like iPhone assembler Foxconn, in any deal with a technology industry power.
McClelland and Google Cloud chief Thomas Kurian did not disclose details of the commercial terms of the agreement.
The Google-Ford partnership reflects growing pressure on automakers to speed up software and data-enabled services that can generate revenue or cut costs. 
Ford, like its established rivals, has watched electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc become the world's most valuable automaker by far, in part because investors view Tesla as far ahead when it comes to the software and data management required for connected and electric cars.
Last year, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) joined hands with Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp to help manage and monetize data gathered from the automaker's global vehicle fleet, while Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) in 2019 struck a deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to cooperate on cloud computing in China and the United States.

The European Union last week approved a plan that includes giving state aid to Tesla, BMW and others to support the production of electric vehicle batteries and help the bloc cut imports from industry leader China.
The EU's approval of the 2.9 billion euro European Battery Innovation project, which includes more than 40 companies, follows the launch in 2017 of the European Battery Alliance to support the industry during the shift away from fossil fuels.
Business Insider quoted German government sources as saying Tesla would get subsidies of more than 1 billion euros from the federal government and the regional state of Brandenburg, where the Tesla factory is being built.
A spokeswoman for Germany's economy ministry said it was not yet clear how much federal support Tesla would receive.
The ministry said last week that Berlin had made nearly 1 billion euros available for the initial battery cell alliance and planned to support the second project with another 1.6 billion euros.
A spokeswoman for the economy ministry in the state of Brandenburg declined to comment.
Tesla was not immediately available for comment.
The federal government is expected to shoulder the lion's share of the subsidies with Brandenburg likely to contribute less than 10%. The final decision on the exact subsidies for Tesla will probably take several more weeks.

Investors poured 414.8 billion yuan ($64.18 billion) last month into newly-launched equity funds and balance funds, which invests in both stocks and bonds, according to fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. The inflow was a jump of 166% from the previous month.
Investors are lured into a stock market that generated stellar returns last year. The government is also channeling household money into equities to fund innovation.
Although hot fund sales could fuel further rallies in Chinese stocks, it also stokes concerns that a bubble could be brewing. Chinese central bank adviser Ma Jun warned last week that the risks of asset bubble could increase if China doesn't appropriately tightens its monetary policy.
Laura Wang, China Equity Strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), said Chinese stocks are not yet bubbly.
""We don't see the current market sentiment getting overheated,"" she said, adding the market will likely be range-bound amid positive elements such as improving earnings, and short-term uncertainties such as COVID and tighter liquidity.
Feverish demand for Chinese mutual funds will also benefit Hong Kong stocks, which saw heavy inflows recently from the mainland investors seeking bargains. 
HSBC expects roughly 140 Chinese mutual funds to be launched in the first quarter of this year, raising up to 700 billion yuan. These funds can invest up to 50% of their money in Hong Kong via the Stock Connect scheme. 
Morgan Stanley's Wang said that Chinese investors are actively seeking opportunities in Hong Kong, where stocks trade at a discount to their mainland-listed peers, and have underperformed the Chinese market over the past few years.

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 11:05AM ET</span>",Analysis: Reddit is coming for silver. A short squeeze? Unlikely,"By Peter Hobson and Swati Verma
LONDON (Reuters) - Silver prices have rocketed to their highest since 2013 as retail investors, egged on by messages on Reddit, pile into the market in an attempt to push up prices, although most analysts and traders say the rally will run out of steam. 
Spot silver vaulted as high as $30.03 an ounce on Monday from $25 on Thursday morning, while shares of silver miners surged and retailers of bars and coins around the world struggled to meet demand.
But analysts say it will be extremely difficult to subject silver to the kind of short squeeze engineered last week on companies like U.S. video game store chain GameStop (NYSE:GME), which sent its shares up by hundreds of percent, and there is no shortage of the precious metal, so the market is likely to calm. 
WHAT HAPPENED?
The furore began on Thursday after posts on the r/wallstreetbets Reddit message board -- the same one used to spark frenzied buying of GameStop shares -- urged investors to buy physical silver. 
An early post, which quickly spread across social media, encouraged buying of iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), an exchange traded fund (ETF) whose shares represent ounces of silver sitting in vaults.
This would force the fund to create new shares and buy silver to back them, exposing a shortage of supply and pushing prices up, said the post under the headline ""THE BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN THE WORLD $SLV Silver 25$ to 1000$.""
ETF BOOM 
Exchange traded funds are the easiest way for retail investors who tend not to have access to futures and interbank markets to generate unlimited immediate demand for silver. 
Investors can also buy from retailers of bars and coins, but these are relatively small compared to the wholesale market and stock is limited. Buying shares in mining companies has no impact on silver demand. 
Nonetheless, silver mining equities leaped and bar and coin sellers were swamped with orders, in addition to the almost $1 billion that flowed into the iShares Silver Trust in a single day on Friday. 
As a result of these inflows and to back new shares, the ETF added 34 million ounces of silver to its stockpile, taking it to a total of 601 million ounces. [PREC/]
Smaller silver ETFs also saw a boom in activity. 
Silver prices were up more than 9% on Monday, their biggest daily gain since 2008.
This is not the first attempt to bid up silver. In 1979-80 the brothers William, Nelson and Lamar Hunt amassed billions of dollars' worth of the metal, pushing prices to record levels before regulators stepped in and the market collapsed.
WILL THE RALLY ACCELERATE THIS TIME?
Most analysts say no. 
A short squeeze is unlikely. Unlike GameStop, there are no holders of massive silver short positions who can be forced to abandon them in big enough numbers to send prices though the roof.
While many bullion-trading banks have large short positions in U.S. silver futures, these tend to be balanced against long positions in the London Over-The-Counter (OTC) market. 
Most hedge funds and other money managers with positions in silver were already long, betting that the coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath would lift prices. 
It will also be hard for retail investors to create a lasting supply squeeze, analysts and traders say.
Around half a billion ounces of silver trade each day in the London OTC market, the world's biggest, of which two thirds are spot contracts, and around 1 billion ounces are produced and consumed each year with surplus supply for most of the last decade, consultants Metals Focus said. 
The market may face short term issues moving silver in the right forms to the right vaults, but draining liquidity enough to send prices to $100 or $1,000 will be difficult. 

""It's like trying to drain the ocean,"" said a trader in London.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 11:05AM ET</span>",Wall Street analysts say Chevron merger talks a sideshow before Exxon loss,"By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts on Monday gave little credence to the possibility of an Exxon-Chevron mega merger, as news of talks last year between the two largest U.S. oil companies leaked ahead of Exxon (NYSE:XOM)'s results that are expected to show the company posting its first-ever annual loss.
Shares in both the companies were down in early trading in New York, despite a rising overall market and weekend gains in global crude prices.
""At the depths of the market last year... a cost cutting focused merger of the two companies may have made sense and also scale matters in this industry so it would have created by far the largest integrated oil company,"" said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.
However, anti-trust concerns and the new U.S. administration's stance on big mergers make it unlikely that a deal resurfaces, Kapadia said, adding that buying smaller, hard-hit oil companies gives Exxon and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) more value.
As oil producers in Europe adapt to investors' push for a shift into renewables, it is also possible that Chevron or Exxon could buy the oil producing business of a European major in the coming years, Kapadia said.
Exxon's year-end results scheduled for Tuesday are expected to be marred by a charge of up to $20 billion on the value of its natural gas properties.
The collapse in oil prices last April briefly pushed crude into negative territory and created a survival crisis for large parts of the U.S. industry.
""Given the precipitous drop (last year)... it is not surprising that XOM and CVX had a discussion about merging,"" said Mark Stoeckle, CEO of Baltimore-based Adams Funds. 

""The sharp snapback in prices likely cooled both companies. There would no doubt be significant cost synergies to be had, but the antitrust issues in a Biden administration would probably be too much to overcome.""

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares caught up in last week's squeeze on hedge funds' short positions have mostly fallen back from their highs, in a sign local retail investors lack the clout of their counterparts in the United States. 
Shares of U.S. videogame retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) skyrocketed last week as social media-driven investors piled into the stock and forced hedge funds to buy back shares they had borrowed to bet on the stock's decline.
That so-called ""long the short"" trade - or buying shares that hedge funds had shorted - was copied in other stocks across the world. 
But while several of the affected U.S. stocks have continued to rally, many in Europe have fallen back.
Germany's Evotec, for example, has seen its shares fall about 25% from last Wednesday's high, while battery maker Varta and videogame firm CD Projekt are also down more than 20% from their peaks last week. 
Traders said the declines were partly because small investors in Europe do not have the easy access to options that give their U.S. counterparts a bigger sway over market moves.
""And ant and moth investors never really emerged as buyers (in Evotec and Varta),"" said Stefan de Schutter, portfolio manager at Alpha Trading, referring to small investors. 
In Europe, retail investors have a smaller share of the market and operate mainly through mutual funds. That could mean extreme moves become less likely once hedge funds have closed out their short positions.
Trading remains volatile, however.
At 1317 GMT, Evotec shares were up 4.3% after falling as much as 1.3% earlier in the session, while CD Projekt, which fell 4.6% at one point, was up 0.6%. Varta was down 5.2%.

Over the past week, U.S. hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which has been hit hard by losses on its GameStop bet, has reduced its short bets in these three European companies.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust enforcers have claimed a court made legal errors when it scrapped their order for iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to pay 13 billion euros ($15.7 billion) in Irish back taxes, in a filing to have the verdict overturned.
The stakes are high for the European Commission in its crackdown against what it sees as aggressive tax planning by multinationals.
It has a mixed record to date, winning court backing in its case against Fiat Chrysler but losing in the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Belgian tax break cases. 
The Commission is appealing to the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union following a ruling last year by the General Court, which said the EU executive had not met the requisite legal standard to show Apple had enjoyed an unfair advantage.
In its 2016 finding the Commission claimed two Irish tax rulings had artificially reduced Apple's tax burden for over two decades, which in 2014 was as low as 0.005%.
""The General Court's failure to properly consider the structure and content of the decision and the explanations in the Commission's written submissions on the functions performed by the head offices and the Irish branches is a breach of procedure,"" the Commission said in a filing in the Official Journal.
The EU competition enforcer added: ""The General Court's subsequent acknowledgement... that the decision examines the functions performed by the Irish branches in justifying the attribution of the Apple IP licences to them constitutes contradictory reasoning, which amounts to a failure to state reasons.""
Apple said the facts had not changed since lower tribunal's ruling.
""After a thorough review of the facts and the Commission’s claims, the General Court was clear in their determination that Apple has always abided by the law in Ireland, as we do everywhere we operate,"" the company said in a statement.
The CJEU will hold a hearing on the case in the coming months. The case is C-465/20 P Commission v Ireland and Others.

The settlement is the second in a probe by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) into an industry in which life insurers take over corporate pension plans.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Julius Baer posted a 50% rise in 2020 net profit on Monday and said it planned a share buyback, as booming markets and strong client trading helped the Swiss wealth manager overshoot its mid-term targets.
But shares fell 2.7% by 0951 GMT, as analysts said low and negative interest rates were likely to weigh on the group and strong client trading was unlikely to maintain its bumper pace.
Net profit attributable to shareholders rose to 698 million Swiss francs ($783 million) for 2020, as financial instrument gains and a surge in client transactions offset weak interest income.
""We delivered on the first leg of the three-year transformation strategy presented in February 2020,"" Chief Executive Philipp Rickenbacher said, adding that ""structural difficulties"" in the overall environment posed challenges ahead.
""In light of current industry challenges, from negative interest rates to a weak US dollar, we will stay our course and remain fully focused on achieving the 2022 targets we set a year ago,"" he said.
The bank said it intended to begin buying back up to 450 million francs of shares in March and proposed a 17% dividend hike to 1.75 francs per share.
""These are solid results,"" Citi analysts wrote, but said they expected ""low single digit consensus downgrades"" due to lower net interest income and because the current boom in transactions was not expected to continue.
Wealth managers saw a boon from the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, benefiting from bumper client activity levels and amassing fewer loan loss risks than high street peers.
Rickenbacher, appointed CEO in September 2019, has said he wants to focus the Zurich-based wealth manager more on the ultra-wealthy and trim costs, which he told analysts in a call on Monday would affect up to 280 jobs in 2021.
The strategy helped it achieve an adjusted cost-income ratio of 66.4% in 2020, ahead of its mid-term target of 67% by 2022.
Baer saw 15.1 billion franc inflows for 2020, as fresh client money and booming equity markets pushed the lender's managed assets up to 434 billion Swiss francs. But net interest income fell nearly a quarter due to lower interest rates.
The bank reported a 190 million franc goodwill impairment related to its Italian subsidiary Kairos, which has been dogged by poor performance and outflows since 2018.
It also reported a 73 million franc legal provision related to a U.S. investigation into its dealings with global soccer body FIFA.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, recovering just under half their losses from Friday's session as the pressure eased on hedge funds to liquidate long positions to relieve the stress from their money-losing short positions.
The spectacular short squeeze in a handful of heavily-shorted stocks had triggered broad selling across the market as funds were forced to raise liquidity last week.  While the squeeze continued in some names in early trading, it appeared to have eased in others, causing them to give up some of last week's gains.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 231 points, or 0.8%, at 30,214 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite outperformed with a gain of 1.3%.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock was the biggest gainer of last week’s stars, rising another 24%, while Nokia (NYSE:NOK) ADRs added another 7.2%.
However, GameStop (NYSE:GME), the stock which symbolized the retail-driven squeeze of professional investors, fell 8.2% while Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS) stock fell 31%. BlackBerry  (NYSE:BB) stock was down 5.2%.
The loss of momentum in some of last week's retail darlings represents a dangerous moment for those who were late to the rally, given that many of the squeezed names are now trading far above what even their original advocates considered fair value. 
""There will be consequences for the Reddit acolytes when the bubbles burst, "" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a morning podcast. ""Bubbles just transfer wealth from bubble buyers to bubble sellers, and the longer these bubbles go on, the more likely it is that participants will be left having lost wealth.""
The biggest gainers in early trading were small and mid-cap silver mining stocks, beneficiaries of the switch in retail investor focus away from heavily shorted stocks to silver futures, which earlier hit an eight-year high over $30 an ounce before retracing to be at $29.59 an ounce as of 10 AM.   Comstock Mining  (NYSE:LODE) surged 173% while Avino Silver & Gold Mines (NYSE:ASM) rose 63%. More established names such as Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) also profited, rising 13.9%.
Earlier, the Institute of Supply Management's purchasing managers index for manufacturing was revised down to 58.7 from 60, a steeper decline from December than first thought.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government plans to seek more than $500 million from Canadian miner  First Majestic Silver  (NYSE:AG) Corp in what it says are owed taxes for artificially keeping its silver prices low over the past decade, two sources told Reuters.
Audits dating back to 2010 show that the company owes about 11 billion pesos ($534.36 million), the sources said. 
So far, Mexico's Tax Administration Service, or SAT, has sought 5.5 billion pesos ($267.18 million) in tax debt, with the remaining half of the total yet to enter into formal disputes, according to the sources.
Officials are also doubling down on an effort to criminally prosecute First Majestic's local unit, Primero Empresa Minera, for tax fraud related to the scheme, even after a judge held off on filing charges on Thursday, the sources and another person with direct knowledge of the case said. 
Under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, authorities have taken a hardball approach to squeezing taxes out of companies, warning that tax dodgers could face criminal charges and jail time. 
The Mexican leader has threatened to personally expose companies with major tax debts, and has called out Canadian mining firms in particular, without naming them. 
First Majestic, a Vancouver-based company that owns three working mines in Mexico with another eight in various stages of development, did not respond to a request for comment. 
The company has previously said it has made several proposals to resolve taxation disputes with Mexico, and its latest filings show that Mexico's tax authority has called for $219 million in reassessments. 
According to the government's analysis, Primero Empresa Minera, which First Majestic bought in 2018, set its silver prices below market value in a system similar to transfer pricing used by multinationals to shift profits to low tax havens.
Mexico's government won one battle against First Majestic in September with a court ruling that nullified Primero Empresa Minera's pricing arrangement. First Majestic has said it would appeal the decision. 
Officials last year also drew up criminal charges, in line with a recent reform that classifies tax fraud over 7.8 million pesos as a serious crime. According to an official document dated April 2020, reviewed by Reuters, prosecutors sought to recover from Primero Empresa Minera 426.3 million pesos ($20.71 million) in taxes owed in 2015 alone.
A judge in the northeastern state of Durango however declined to file charges last week, saying the tax authorities' audit of the company was incomplete. Prosecutors have appealed the ruling, arguing the full audit was not necessary, said one of the people familiar with the case.
SAT said it would not comment on ongoing investigations.
The finance ministry's tax prosecutor Carlos Romero declined to comment on First Majestic or Primero Empresa Minera. However, in circumstances when a full audit is requested, he said the prosecutor's office could file a fresh complaint once the audit is complete. 
""We fight to the very end,"" he said.
Still, a decision on the appeal could be months away. 
First Majestic's shares surged more than 30% after Bloomberg reported on the court's decision, the same day as a surge in silver stocks. 
Mexican tax authorities reaped payments from nearly 900 large companies last year in their bid to boost state coffers in the country with the lowest tax take in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In two of the biggest deals that were made public, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Mexico unit and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bottler Femsa forked over nearly 17 billion pesos.

LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street's retail trading frenzy has distorted markets, global hedge funds industry body AIMA said on Monday, adding it was concerned that lawmakers were encouraging such moves.
Retail investors gathering in social media chatrooms like Reddit have been driving up the price of stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) shorted by hedge funds, with the focus shifting to other parts of the market on Monday, such as silver.
""What is dangerous, amid this trading frenzy, is that retail investors have been chasing prices so far above any sane valuation and that many will end up nursing losses,"" AIMA CEO Jack Inglis said in a letter to members, who manage $2 trillion.
""The role of some supposedly responsible lawmakers, who have been cheering these events from the side-lines, with a knee-jerk reaction against short selling, is concerning to say the least.""
U.S. Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said last week that people felt ""everyday people"" were finally able to ""get back"" at those who had all the marbles on Wall Street and forced once hedge fund into an existential crisis.
Inglis said finger wagging at hedge funds was not new and short-selling is tightly regulated, requiring positions to be published, allowing others to trade against them.
Some hedge funds have chalked up losses and AIMA said it will help with regulatory investigations.
""Those exposed will have taken it on the chin and will have executed steps to contain losses for their clients, whose savings they manage,"" Inglis said, adding:

""To those commentators who have been clapping with glee at the misfortune of those hedge funds ... what we have witnessed in the past week is a game that has led to a gross distortion in both efficient market functioning and true price determination.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares bounced and silver markets surged on Monday as retail investors expanded their social media-fuelled battle with Wall Street to drive the precious metal to an eight-year high.
Stock markets were roiled last week after a spike in retail demand to buy the stocks most bet against by hedge funds drove huge gains in companies such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), and prompted fresh concern that COVID-19 monetary and fiscal support measures were fuelling a market bubble.
With chatrooms abuzz with talk that silver was the new target, silver-exposed stocks, funds and coins jumped, helping push spot silver up more than 11%, before gains were trimmed and it last traded up around 9%. 
The bullish spirit helped London-listed miners post strong gains, including one of more than 19% for  Fresnillo  (LON:FRES)
After falling 3.6% last week - its biggest weekly fall in three months - the MSCI All-Country World Index rose 0.5% by midday, tracking overnight gains in Asia.
Wall Street looked set for an even stronger bounce-back, with futures for the S&P 500 and NASDAQ both up around 1.2%. The VIX 'fear gauge' was down 7%.
While the retail battle versus Wall Street, coordinated over online forums such as Reddit, created some systemic risks, the bigger danger was in the tech sector, where some stocks had ""eye watering valuations"",  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Jim Reid said. 
""Retail has in many parts driven such valuations in the last 10 months. If this pops the wider market will have bigger issues than last week.""
However, with corporate earnings still beating expectations - around 82% of S&P 500 delivering a positive surprise - Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco, said investors should look through the recent volatility.
""We have to keep in mind that in general, stock market fundamentals are solid.""
Gold followed silver higher, up 0.8% to $1,859 an ounce, while oil also tracked the gains in other commodities, with both Brent crude and its U.S. peer up around 1%. [O/R]

While the stock market tussle continued to grab the headlines, analysts cautioned that the bigger concern was economic momentum as coronavirus lockdowns bite.
Data overnight showed Chinese factory activity slowed in January as restrictions took a toll in some regions. In the euro zone, manufacturing growth remained resilient at the start of the year but the pace waned from December.
British data showed an even greater struggle, with manufacturers facing the twin headwinds of COVID-19 and Britain's exit from the European Union.
While the coronavirus vaccine rollout globally remains slow, with concern about whether they will work on new COVID strains, Europe was also bolstered by news that it would receive a further 9 million doses from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) in the first quarter.
The safe-haven dollar edged higher during the morning session in Europe, with the dollar index last at 90.876 , having bounced from a trough of 89.206 hit early in January.
The euro, meanwhile, extended earlier losses against the dollar, down 0.5% to $1.2075, well off its recent peak at $1.2349, while the pound gave up some of its early gains to trade up 0.1% on the day at $1.3705..
With riskier markets bouncing, Italian government bond yields fell 2-3 basis points across the curve.

German Bund yields, meanwhile, the benchmark for the euro zone, remained anchored around -0.51% on Monday, tracking U.S. Treasury yields that also remained unchanged..

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading higher Monday, rebounding from their worst week in three months as retail investors turn their interest to silver, giving hedge funds a break. 
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 232 points, or 0.8%, S&P 500 Futures traded 38 points, or 1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 135 points, or 1.1%. 
The main U.S. equity indices suffered their worst week since the end of October last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at its lowest level since Dec. 14 and the S&P 500 at a one-month low. 
This broad selloff occurred after a spike in retail demand to buy the stocks most bet against by hedge funds. These funds then had to liquidate large equity holdings to raise cash, hitting the wider market even as the stocks of companies like GameStop (NYSE:GME) soared.
GameStop stock is down 0.5% in premarket trading Monday, although the likes of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) are still higher. But with popular online broker Robinhood continuing to impose trading curbs on these companies, the attention of retail traders, via online chatrooms like Reddit, has turned towards silver.
The metal has soared to an eight-year high, while London-listed miners, including  Fresnillo  (LON:FRES) PLC (OTC:FNLPF), and Polymetal (OTC:AUCOY) have posted strong gains. 
On Capitol Hill, President Joe Biden is set to hold talks with 10 Republican lawmakers later Monday after they posted him a letter suggesting he scales back his $1.9 trillion Covid relief proposal in order to get cross-party support.
The earnings season continues this week, with almost 100 S&P companies set to report, including the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
Economic data due for release Monday includes the final reading of the ISM Manufacturing PMI figure for January, but most eyes will be on the January nonfarm payrolls report at the end of the week. This will give markets the first look at the health of the labor market inherited by U.S. President Joe Biden.
Oil prices edged higher Monday, helped by newswires reports which suggested members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are currently sticking to their agreed output targets, limiting supply despite prices trading above the $50 a barrel levels.
However, patchy coronavirus vaccine rollouts, doubts about the size of President Biden’s relief package and the speed of transmission by new variants of the virus are limiting gains.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $52.69 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.3% to $55.72. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1% to $1,867.95/oz, helped by the surge in the junior metal, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.2085."

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",China's HNA eyes private investors in uphill battle to emerge from bankruptcy,"By Kane Wu and Brenda Goh
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's embattled HNA Group is looking for private investors to help it emerge from bankruptcy, a person with knowledge of the matter said, but bankers and analysts say restructuring may be challenging due to its debt pile and opaque corporate structure.
The creditors' move to file for bankruptcy came after HNA was put under a restructuring exercise led by the Hainan government to resolve its liquidity risks stemming from years of aggressive acquisitions abroad.
HNA, whose flagship business is Hainan Airlines, used a $50 billion global acquisition spree, mainly fuelled by debt, to build an empire with stakes in businesses from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to Hilton Worldwide.
The person close to the restructuring process said while the courts will process creditors' bankruptcy filings, HNA's work group led by its newly-elected party secretary Gu Gang will simultaneously work on bringing in strategic investors.
He said the group was targeting private sector investors, including for its Hainan Airlines business, rather than state-owned ones, adding that some existing shareholders will exit in the process.
Shares in listed companies linked to HNA slumped on Monday, after the troubled conglomerate disclosed that its creditors had applied for its bankruptcy and that nearly $10 billion had been embezzled by shareholders of its three units.
Hainan Airlines, HNA Innovation, CCOOP Group, HNA Technology and Bohai Leasing tumbled between 5% and 10%.
""HNA is in a messy situation. I don't think the restructuring is going to be easy,"" said a senior banker based in Hong Kong, who has had dealings with HNA in the past. The banker declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
Beijing has been putting more pressure in recent years on opaque corporate structures, excess debt and deals it sees as overly aggressive as it tried to control capital outflows and keep its economy on an even keel.
""Fundamentally a bigger but very old story at play - if you expand your business by borrowing money...you better have the money to pay for all this,"" Fraser Howie, an independent commentator and author of books about China's financial system, said.
Noting China's past history of acquisitive conglomerates, he said: ""Every one of them has been dismembered, dismantled and restricted to varying degrees. That type of company is gone and not coming back.""
Unlisted HNA's acquisition of marquee assets was also followed by intense pressure from the regulators overseas to provide greater clarity about who owns the conglomerate, adding to its financial problems. 
ASSET DIVESTMENT
HNA, which has been struggling with liquidity issues in the last couple few years, has $27.5 billion worth of outstanding bonds in various currencies and another $20 billion in loans, according to data compiled by Dealogic.
""We are not optimistic with the credit situation of HNA Group, and reckon the possible result of the restructuring is the sale, spin-off of its core assets, and forced debt-to-equity swaps,"" said D.E. Institute, a think tank that focuses on credit outlook and default analysis.
In recent years, HNA sold assets such as airport services company Swissport and electronics distributors Ingram Micro.
The Hainan government would prefer to keep Hainan Airline as a private carrier due to its own limited financial resources, said Huang Zhenda, a senior co-partner at Beijing Deheng Law Offices and a former HNA executive.
Law firm King & Wood Mallesons has been hired to lead the restructuring, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter, including the first person cited above. The whole bankruptcy restructuring process is expected to conclude within 2021, said the first person,
All sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

HNA declined to comment beyond its public filings. King & Wood Mallesons declined to comment. Calls to the Hainan government went unanswered and it did not immediately respond to a faxed query for comment.

1421,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 05:46AM ET</span>","StockBeat: The Craze for Silver, the Metal Formerly Known as 'Precious'","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Silver mining stocks were, inevitably, the standout winners in European markets on Monday morning after a slew of reports highlighting a surge in interest for the metal by retail traders, accompanied by a surge of attention in social media such as Reddit chat boards.
By mid-morning in London, the three biggest silver miners listed in London were all rocketing higher:  Fresnillo  (LON:FRES) led with a gain of 17%, with Hochschild Mining  (LON:HOCM) gaining 16% and Russian-focused  Polymetal  (LON:POLYP) up a more modest 7.0%.
Europe-listed depositary receipts of U.S.-listed miners were also posting sharp gains, with Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) up 15% and  First Majestic Silver  Corp (NYSE:AG) up 33%.
The arguments for higher silver prices seem solid enough at first glance: silver is, for one thing, mainly an industrial metal rather than a precious one, and the rest of the base metals complex – a rough proxy for global industrial production – is in rude health right now: aluminum, dogged for years by global oversupply, is up by one-third from its April; copper is up by two-thirds and close to an eight-year high; nickel and tin are both on course to set seven-year highs.
True, iron ore futures, the quintessential industrial demand proxy, are off over 10% from their recent high as China’s manufacturing boom shows signs of cooling off, but  most of silver’s industrial demand comes from the solar and electronics industries, two sectors that – for now at least – are enjoying a particularly bright outlook.
The boom in metals reflect a renaissance for global manufacturing, spurred by the shift in spending to goods from services by a population locked down at home, along with – in some cases – tight mine supply that is the result of cyclical factors and – in others – production difficulties as a result of Covid-19 last year. The most important mines of Fresnillo and Hochschild are in Mexico and Peru, respectively, both of which have been ravaged by the virus. And, of course, all of these dollar-denominated prices reflect the deliberate cheapening of the dollar by the U.S. government and central bank.
What it doesn’t reflect is the kind of skewed long-short positioning exploited so spectacularly last week in a handful of relatively small stocks. According to CFTC data, net speculative long positioning in silver is at a relatively high level on a historic basis, suggesting that long silver is already a trade that is pretty crowded.
Much of the money that flowed into silver over the last year was driven, at least in part, by its association with gold and its reputation as a precious metal that would make it a hedge against inflation. And it’s true that the surge in gold last year left silver looking undervalued by comparison. At one point last year, it took over 127 ounces of silver to buy an ounce of gold – an all-time record high. But with gold levelling out in recent weeks, and with silver spiking, that ratio is back down to 63, more or less in line with its average over the last 35 years.
One final point worth considering is that silver has often in the past been a late-cycle asset, neglected while other, sexier trades catch the eye. Its rallies often owe more to perceptions of relative cheapness rather than underlying value.  Too often, it is a classic value trap. It isn’t called “the metal formerly known as Precious” for nothing. The fundamentals for the metal look better than they have done for some time, but rocket fuel for a trip to the moon - they are not"

LONDON (Reuters) - Exuberant share valuations and rock-bottom borrowing costs made it a bumper January for dealmakers in the equity as well as debt space, data shows, with global bond sales topping $600 billion and IPOs more than doubling on the year. 
World stocks had stepped back off record highs on the last trading day of the month, unnerved by the tussling between hordes of small-time traders and big hedge funds but the equity raising juggernaut continued, with bootmaker Dr Martens seeing bumper demand for its IPO and surging 16% on debut.
Dealmaking too shows no sign of flagging; Reuters reported on Friday a potential 3-billion-euro sale of Bertelsmann's stake in a French TV company to Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) and Altice Europa.
Here is some data on capital market milestones for January from financial information provider Dealogic:
1/GOING PUBLIC
Equity raising surged last year as pandemic-hit companies sought to raise capital and others took advantage of soaring stock markets to list shares. Dealogic data showed $49.2 billion worth of initial public offerings (IPO) in January, compared to $11.6 billion a year ago.
IPO volumes had dwindled for years prior to 2020 as more companies tapped private equity funding. But the recovery will likely continue, not least because huge demand for equities offers private equity managers a lucrative opportunity to exit their investments.
It was a record January for emerging market IPOs too, comprising $16.8 billion of the total and doubling from January 2020.
""Stock market valuations have held up strongly and we have had a raft of strong businesses and unicorns reaching the right stage of maturation at the right time,"" said one European banker who manages IPOs.

2/BUMPER FOR BONDS
Global borrowers issued $619 billion worth of bonds in January, though this fell short of last January's $662 billion high. Issuers paid little attention to a mid-month rise in U.S. 10-year yields, using record low global borrowing costs to lock in funding.
There was a noticeable move towards debt maturing 30, 50 or 100 years in future. Slovenia was the latest, selling a 60-year bond on Thursday.
Marc Baigneres, Head of Western Europe, Japan & Australia investment-grade finance at J.P. Morgan said issuance was ""defensive and offensive."" 
""Hybrid debt, for example, can be used to shore up corporates if ratings are under pressure, but can also be used to make acquisitions,"" Baigneres said.
Emerging market borrowers meanwhile sold $120 billion, flirting with the record set in Jan. 2020, driven by investment grade issuers. Prominent deals included Saudi Arabia raising $5 billion and Airport Authority Hong Kong's $1.5 billion deal. 
Cristian Maggio, a strategist at TD Securities attributed the hefty issuance to big redemptions which he expects will lighten in February, with ""some moderation in new paper hitting the primary market going forward.""

Monthly M&A activity totalled $314 billion, the fifth best January on record. That comes after a stop-start 2020 that saw dealmaking slump at the height of the pandemic, only to surge in the second half to $1.1 trillion.
Prominent deals included French luxury group LVMH closing on its $15.8 billion acquisition of Tiffany and Global Infrastructure Partners' $4.63 billion purchase of Signature Aviation. 
The dealmaking world remains abuzz; Aside from the Bertelsman/Vivendi/Altice reports while UK retailer BooHoo is swooping on Debenhams and several other fashion chains.

Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary in a statement described the year as the most challenging in Ryanair's 35 year history.
But he told Ireland's national broadcaster RTE to expect a ""dramatic recovery"" this summer on widespread vaccine roll-out, particularly in the United Kingdom. 
The recovery should accelerate in July and September, the second quarter of the airline's financial year, before returning to 70% and 90% of normal levels between October and March, said Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan.
""We hope to be getting back to some kind of normality"" in the winter, Sorahan said. 
COVID-19 restrictions slashed Ryanair passenger numbers by 78% in the last three months of the year, the third quarter of its financial calendar, pushing it to a quarterly loss of 306 million euros ($371.06 million). That compares with a loss of 300 million euro forecast in a company poll of analysts.
Ryanair's 82% fall in revenue in the quarter compared with falls of 88% at rival easyJet (LON:EZJ) and 77% at Wizz, which both reported results last week. 
Ryanair is widely seen as one of the best-placed airlines in the world to weather the COVID-19 crisis due to its large cash balance and lack of long-haul and business-class.
It said it had cash on hand of 3.5 billion euros at the end of December, compared with 4.5 billion at the end of September. 
""The ‘in-line’ Q3’21 and the strong cash balance sheet of the company may be enough today to buoy investor sentiments after the volatility of last week,"" Citi analyst Mark Manduca said in a note. 
Ryanair's share price was flat at 14.30 euros at 0845 GMT, down 15% from its pre-COVID peak of 16.9 euros on Jan. 10 last year. 
The airline said it would fly between 26 million and 30 million passengers in the year to end-March compared with 149 million in its previous financial year. It could fly anywhere between 80 million and 120 million passengers in the year to end-March 2022, O'Leary said. 
Ryanair in December ordered an additional 75 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets in what was the largest order since the plane was grounded in early 2019 following two fatal crashes. The jet was cleared in January to resume flying in the European Union. 
Ryanair expects its first delivery in March with at least 24 of the 210 it has on order arriving in time for its peak summer season.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Former JPMorgan Asia top banker found not guilty of bribery,"By Sharon Tam and Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong judge on Monday found JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s former vice chairman of Asia investment banking, Catherine Leung, not guilty of bribery following her trial held late last year, saying she had followed the bank's existing procedures. 
Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), in 2019, charged Leung with bribing the chairman of a logistics company, by employing his son at the bank's Hong Kong office in 2010.
She did so, the prosecution told the court last year, in anticipation that Ang Keng-lam, the then chairman of Kerry Logistics Network Ltd, would influence his company to give JPMorgan a role on its up-coming initial public offering (IPO).
However, deputy district judge Emily Cheung told the court, when explaining the reasons for her not guilty verdict, that Leung had not played a major role in the decision to hire Ang's son, Ang Ren-yi, and that Leung had followed procedures required under JPMorgan's client referral programme. 
That programme allowed staff to refer the children or relatives of the company's existing and potential clients for training or employment. 
Cheung said in a three hour-long explanation of her verdict that it was the responsibility of JPMorgan's Junior Resources Management team to make checks with the bank's legal and compliance department when employees were being hired under the scheme. 
Ang Ren-yi worked at JPMorgan from June 2010 until October 2011, according to court documents.
Leung, who left the Wall Street bank in 2015 according to her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, did not comment when approached by Reuters outside the courtroom on Monday. A representative of both Angs' current employer Metropoly Holdings Ltd said they had no comment. 
An ICAC spokeswoman said the Commission ""respects the court ruling. We will study the reasons for the verdict in consultation with the Department of Justice."" 
JPMorgan declined to comment. 
In 2016, JPMorgan agreed to pay U.S. authorities $264 million to resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials, including those working at state owned enterprises in order to win banking deals. [https://tinyurl.com/y5ulgozz] 
At that time a JPMorgan spokesman said the conduct was unacceptable, the hiring programme was halted in 2013 and the bank took actions against those responsible.

1429,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 03:53AM ET</span>",European Stocks Higher; Reddit Horde Shifts Focus to Silver,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, rebounding after last week’s selloff as the army of retail investors that squeezed hedge funds' short equity positions last week shifts its focus to silver.
At 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.8%. 
Global stocks posted their biggest weekly drop in around three months last week, partly on the turmoil fueled by retail traders organizing over online forums to take on hedge funds by buying heavily-shorted stocks, such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).
Such pressure appears to have eased, as the focus of the newly-empowered day traders now seems to have shifted towards silver, which has jumped 6% to a six-month high. This has helped miners, including  Fresnillo  (LON:FRES),  Polymetal  (LON:POLYP) and  Boliden  (ST:BOL), to post early stock gains.
The corporate earnings season has continued Monday. 
Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock rose 0.6% after the budget airline said it remains cash rich and expects a “reasonable summer” despite forecasting it will lose close to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in its current financial year as the Covid lockdowns hit air traffic.
BP (NYSE:BP) stock rose 0.1% after the oil major agreed to sell a 20% stake in its Oman interest for $2.6 billion. Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG) stock rose 1.3% after posting a rise in its first quarter net profit, while  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM) stock slumped 5.7% after the French real estate trust said 70% of its portfolio had been hit by the lockdowns.
In economic data, German retail sales slumped 9.6% on the month in December, as lockdowns hit consumer spending in Europe’s largest economy. The day's other big release in Europe, the Eurozone manufacturing PMI, was more resilient, edging up to 54.8, defying expectations for a slight drop thanks to improvements in France and Italy..
The U.K. issued a record number of Covid-19 vaccines on Saturday, bringing the total number of people to have received their first dose to just short of 9 million.
The rollout of vaccines throughout most EU countries has been less impressive, prompting a diplomatic spat late last week when the EU Commision announced it would impose export controls on vaccines, potentially creating a border between Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and EU member Ireland.
This decision was quickly reversed, but is indicative of the mistrust between the two sides after the tempestuous long-running Brexit talks.
Oil prices edged higher Monday on hopes that the recent surge in Covid-19 cases worldwide has peaked, as well as on output cuts by Saudi Arabia. U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $52.61 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1% to $55.57. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,864.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.2095."

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.8%, with shares of miners including  Fresnillo  (LON:FRES), Polymetal International and Boliden AB leading early gains on the index.
Silver has become the latest focus of a frenzied online movement by retail traders to push up values of assets that big fund managers had bet against.
The STOXX 600 had logged declines of over 3% in the previous week, on concerns around the slow roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines and as a retail trading frenzy led to a rise in volatility.

German shares rose 1%. Data showed retail sales plunged far more than expected in December as a decision to tighten lockdown measures in the COVID-19 pandemic choked consumer spending in Europe's largest economy.

HSBC said the new private bank, which is in one of the most promising wealth markets in Asia, will help it provide clients with access to international capital markets by leveraging its existing infrastructure of advisory and investment methodologies in Asia.
""In Thailand and across ASEAN, private wealth is often created and built through business growth and expansion and as intra-regional trade and activity rebound, we expect commercial, people and wealth flows to increase,"" said Philip Kunz, HSBC's head of global private banking for Southeast Asia.
Last year, HSBC combined its global private banking and retail wealth businesses to create a new unit that manages more than $1.4 trillion in clients' assets, with half coming from Asia.
The team in Thailand will cover client management and advisory services while clients' assets will be booked in HSBC Private Banking in Singapore, a regional wealth management hub.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) had set up its Thai wealth management business in 2016 and Julius Baer teamed up with Siam Commercial Bank (OTC:SMUUY) in 2018 to cater to high net worth individuals.

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 02:45AM ET</span>",Five things to watch in retail stocks' trading frenzy,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Silver has become the latest focus of a frenzied online movement by retail traders to push up values of assets that big fund managers had bet against.
The populist trading rally, organised on social media forums such as Reddit's ""wallstreetbets"", has helped attract a flood of retail cash into stocks such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), burnt hedge funds that had bet against the company and roiled broader markets.
Here are five things to watch on Monday:
** SILVER - Silver prices are at near six-month highs, silver-mining stocks have surged and coin-selling websites are inundated with orders. Australia's ETF Securities' Physical Silver fund witnessed record daily inflows by the afternoon. The iShares' U.S.-listed $16.5 billion Silver Trust ETF, which rose 5.6% last week, could see further inflows.
** STOCKS - GameStop marked a near 400% gain last week, alongside Koss Corp., AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and Express. Still, the heavy short positions, available float and the determination of Reddit investors to not sell could mean further gains for these stocks.
** TRADING VENUES - Online broker Robinhood, one of the hottest venues in the retail-trading frenzy, still has what it says are temporary buying restrictions on some securities, as it tries to raise funding for clearing house-mandated deposit requirements. Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) Group Inc said late on Saturday it has lifted all trading restrictions on options in GameStop, AMC and others hit by recent market volatility.
** REGULATORS - U.S. regulators are looking into both Robinhood and the Reddit forums for evidence of market manipulation and the validity of trading bans, although it appears both parties are protected by laws and user agreements.

** BROADER MARKETS - U.S. stocks had their biggest weekly fall last week, while the dollar and Treasury yields rose, although it is difficult to say whether that was just the Gamestop effect or driven by concerns over a loss of economic momentum in the United States, China and Europe as coronavirus lockdowns bite.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Monday, rebounding after last week’s selloff as retail-inspired pressure on hedge funds lifts with silver in demand.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.8% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.7%.
Global stocks posted their biggest weekly drop in around three months last week, partly on the turmoil fueled by retail traders organising over online forums to take on hedge funds by buying heavily-shorted stocks, such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).
This pressure appears to have lifted, to a degree, Monday, as the focus of the newly-empowered day traders now seems to have shifted towards silver. The metal has jumped 6% to a six-month high, possibly limiting the need for distressed selling by these funds.
This positive start to the European day comes despite two PMI releases from China showing economic activity slowed in January as restrictions took a toll in some regions.
Manufacturing PMI data is scheduled for release in Europe later Monday, and this should detail a similar loss in economic momentum for this region as coronavirus lockdowns bite. German retail sales slumped 9.6% on the month in December.
There was some positive news on the U.K. vaccination program over the weekend, as government records showed a record number of Covid-19 vaccines were administered on Saturday, bringing the total number of people to have received their first dose to just short of 9 million.
The rollout of vaccines throughout most EU countries has been less impressive, prompting a diplomatic spat late last week when the EU Commision announced it would impose export controls on vaccines, potentially creating a border between Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and EU member Ireland.
This decision was quickly reversed, but is indicative of the mistrust between the two sides after the tempestuous long-running Brexit talks.

Back in Europe, results from the likes of  Julius Baer  (SIX:BAER) and Banco de Sabadell (MC:SABE) will be in focus, as well as numbers from low-cost airline Ryanair (LON:RYA). Oil major BP (NYSE:BP) will also be in the spotlight after it agreed a 20% stake in its Oman interest for $2.6 billion.
Oil prices edged higher Monday, boosted by virus infections falling in some areas, more vaccines proving successful in trials as well as output cuts by Saudi Arabia.
However, patchy coronavirus vaccine rollouts and the speed of transmission by new variants of the virus are limiting the price gains.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $52.36 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $55.33.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 12:20AM ET</span>",Reddit-inspired retail swarm in South Korea battle to remove short sell policy,"By Cynthia Kim and Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - A swarm of online traders in South Korea is taking a leaf from the Reddit horde in the United States to quash a government plan to lift a pandemic-imposed ban on short-selling, triggering a rally in the most shorted-stocks such as Celltrion on Monday. 
Almost 30,000 investors of the Korea Stockholders Alliance have come together at a membership-based forum at naver.com, signing online petitions and staging downtown demonstrations calling for permanent ban on short selling of shares. 
The retail investors dubbed the movement as 'kstreetbets,' after Reddit's WallStreetBets forum where a rebellion of retail investors against Wall Street drove video-game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). to dizzying heights last week.
""Save the ants! No to short selling! Why befriend short selling,"" read one of the banners put up by the forum.
""Do you call this a country? If you want to keep exploiting the citizens, better shutter the stock market!,"" one investor wrote. 
Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun on Thursday told Reuters restrictions on the key hedging strategy will eventually be ""reinstated after addressing some of the problems caused by institutional investors.""
In January, the country's financial regulator said its plan is to lift the Kospi and Kosdaq short-selling ban, which has been in place since March 2020, on March 15.
Some see the movement as a hot-button political issue, especially as it comes just two months ahead of hard-fought elections to pick the mayors of the two largest cities, Seoul and Busan.
President Moon Jae-in's Democratic Party is fighting to retain the mayor's offices as the main opposition conservatives pick up momentum with criticism of his failures to deliver on his economic policy pledges.
The self-styled ""Jobs President"", Moon is seeing jobs vanishing at the fastest pace in more than two decades while Seoul housing affordability is at its worst ever despite numerous property-cooling measures. 
Mom-and-pop investors have emerged as dominant players in the local stock market during the pandemic and now account for nearly two thirds of the nation's trading value.
With the benchmark Kospi doubling since last year's lows, these retailers stand to lose against professional short-sellers if they exit their bearish positions. 
""(The temporary ban) is likely to be extended,"" said Shin Yul, a political science professor at Myongji University in Seoul.
""This also has relevance with the election. There are so many stock traders, and any downturn in the stock market would mean reduced household wealth so the political circles will pay attention.""
On Monday, shares of Celltrion, a South Korean biopharmaceutical company, jumped as much as 18.2% as retail investors were encouraging one another to shield the company that has often been a target of foreign short-sellers. 

The benchmark Kospi was up 2.4% by 0500 GMT.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares rallied on Monday and U.S. stock futures recouped early losses as newly empowered retail investors turned their attention to precious metals, promising a respite to some hard-hit hedge funds.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.4% after four straight sessions of losses. 
Japan's Nikkei added 1.2%, after shedding almost 2% on Friday, while Chinese blue chips gained 0.5% as the country's central bank injected more cash into money markets.
Futures for the S&P 500 edged up 0.3%, having been down as much as 1% in early action, while NASDAQ futures firmed 0.1%. EUROSTOXX 50 futures added 0.6% and FTSE futures 0.2%.
Dealers noted a shift in the headline-grabbing battle between retail investors and Wall Street that led hedge funds last week to trade the most stock in a decade amid wild swings in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME).
Talk now was that silver was the new target for the retail crowd, as the metal jumped 6% to a six-month high, possibly limiting the need for distressed selling by stock funds.
Analysts cautioned this entertaining episode was really a sideshow compared with signs of a loss of economic momentum in the United States and Europe as coronavirus lockdowns bite.
Indeed, two surveys from China showed factory activity slowed in January as restrictions took a toll in some regions.
Neither was the news on vaccine rollouts positive, especially given doubts about whether they will work on new COVID strains. 
""It is these considerations, not what is happening to a video game retailer day to day, that has weighed on risk assets,"" said John Briggs, global head of strategy at NatWest Markets. ""So much of the market's valuations, risk in particular, is premised on the fact we can see a light at the end of the COVID tunnel.""
Doubts have also emerged about the future of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package, with 10 Republican senators urging a $600 billion plan.
The jitters in stocks caused only a brief ripple in bonds, with Treasury yields actually rising late last week, perhaps a refection of the tidal wave of borrowing underway.
A record $1.11 trillion of gross Treasury issuance is slated for this quarter, up from $685 billion the same time last year.
On Monday, U.S. 10-year yields had nudged up to 1.08% and nearer the recent 10-month top of 1.187%.
Higher yields combined with the more cautious market mood have seen the safe-haven dollar steady above its recent lows. The dollar index stood at 90.535, having bounced from a trough of 89.206 hit early in January.
The euro idled at $1.2129, well off its recent peak at $1.2349, while the dollar held firm at 104.70 yen.
Gold followed silver higher to $1,862 an ounce, but has repeatedly stalled at resistance around $1,875. [GOL/]

Oil also tracked the gains in other commodities, with U.S. crude rising 21 cents to $52.42 a barrel. Brent crude futures gained 33 cents to $55.37. [O/R]

China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.13% by 9:48 PM ET (2:48 AM GMT), while the Shenzhen Component rose 1.10%.
The economic data, released on Sunday, indicated a slowdown in the Chinese economic recovery.

Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China said that it would not drive-up borrowing costs further over growing concerns about a cash squeeze.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.70% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.82%. South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.49%, boosted by positive trade data released earlier in the day. Exports grew 11.4% year-on-year in January, while imports grew 3.1% year-on-year.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.62%, with the Reserve Bank of Australia handing down its policy decision on Tuesday. Perth in Western Australia state also entered a five-day lockdown after a COVID-19 case was recorded in the city.
U.S. shares closed around 2% lower on Friday amid continued concern about the implications of short-squeezes encouraged on internet forums. Global stocks retreated as retail trading wreaked havoc on some U.S. shares during the previous week.
Meanwhile, silver futures opened over 7% higher as the precious metal became the latest subject to be discussed on the forums.
Retail sites were overwhelmed as increased demand for bars and coins saw demand for silver spike on Sunday. Comments encouraging the purchase of exchange-traded funds linked to silver had begun appearing on Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets during the previous week.
“You have a number of players out there who are finding hedge funds and others with short positions and they’re corralling thousands of investors to squeeze them out … I caution the thinking that this is just a one-off, as we are already talking about silver this morning,” Centersquare Investment Management LLC chief investment officer Scott Crowe told Bloomberg.

Some of Wall Street's largest hedge funds are still licking their wounds after retail traders sought to drive up the prices of stocks that were heavily bet against, resulting in large losses for major investors. 
Melvin Capital, a hedge fund at the center of the GameStop drama, lost 53% in January but received commitments for fresh cash from investors in the last days of the month, Reuters reported on Sunday.
Melvin ended January with more than $8 billion in assets after having started the year with roughly $12.5 billion in assets, according to a person familiar with the matter.
On Friday, Citron Research's Andrew Left, who spent two decades building his brand as one of the world’s best-known short-sellers, turned his back on publicly detailing companies' shortcomings, following an intense backlash against him and others who said video retailer GameStop's stock was not worth its price.
""We saw the might of a new investor base, in terms of their ability to shape not just the fortunes of an individual stock but the fortunes of a large market segment like the Russell 2000,"" said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.
Amid the wild price fluctuations, the amount of position covering last week by U.S. hedge funds, buying and selling, was the highest since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, according to an analysis by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Nevertheless, their market exposure to stocks is still near record levels, the investment bank warned.
""According to Goldman Sachs Prime Services, this week represented the largest active hedge fund de-grossing since February 2009. Funds in their coverage sold long positions and covered shorts in every sector,"" the investment bank wrote in a note late on Friday.
""Despite this active deleveraging, hedge fund net and gross exposures on a mark-to-market basis both remain close to the highest levels on record, indicating ongoing risk of positioning-driven sell-offs.""
Signs are mounting that retail traders who moved the market last week are setting their sights further afield than just U.S. stocks. 
On Thursday and Friday, the price of silver rallied, taking gains to around 10% since messages began to circulate on social media platform Reddit urging retail investors to pile into the market and drive up prices. The price of gold has also rallied.
Such market moves have brought into focus the growing heft that retail traders have on financial markets, which had been dominated in the past by larger institutions. 
""What's been surprising in the last few months has been the scale of retail participation has started to move the dials,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of the multi-asset team at Janus Henderson in London.

""If you looked at that data a couple of months ago, you can see it's been happening. It's not like these guys woke up last week,"" O'Connor added.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 08:30PM ET</span>",Melvin Capital ends month with over $8 billion in assets after investors added cash: source,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Melvin Capital, the hedge fund at the center of the GameStop (NYSE:GME) drama, lost 53% in January but received commitments for fresh cash from investors in the last days of the month, a source familiar with the fund said on Sunday.
Melvin ended January with more than $8 billion in assets after having started the year with roughly $12.5 billion, the source said.
The firm, founded in 2014 by Gabe Plotkin, had bet that ailing video game retailer GameStop's stock, which traded at less than $5 five months ago, would fall.
But a wave of retail investors, comparing notes on social media platform Reddit and using online trading app Robinhood, took the other side of Plotkin's trade to send the stock up 1,625% this month to close at $325 on Friday.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the loss.
""The fund's portfolio liquidity is strong. Use of leverage is at the lowest level since Melvin Capital's inception in 2014,"" the source said.
Hedge funds Point72 Asset Management and Citadel gave a $2.75 billion capital infusion to Melvin Capital earlier in the week, enabling it to close out that position with a large loss.
Citadel’s hedge funds, along with founder Ken Griffin and firm partners, put $2 billion into Melvin. The funds lost less than 1% in January on their Melvin position and are down 3% overall for the month, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 

As news of losses at many hedge funds spread in recent days, speculation mounted about which firms might be forced to shut their doors. Several investors and fund managers said clients have been more patient with certain firms that have a long and strong track record, likely allowing them to survive this month's deep losses.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 08:15PM ET</span>",Shell targets power trading and hydrogen in climate drive,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) is betting on its expertise in power trading and rapid growth in hydrogen and biofuels markets as it shifts away from oil, rather than joining rivals in a scramble for renewable power assets, company sources said.
Shell and its European rivals are seeking new business models to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels and appeal to investors concerned about the long-term outlook for an industry under intense pressure to slash greenhouse gas emissions.
Shell will present its strategy on Feb. 11 and unlike Total and BP (NYSE:BP) the company will focus more on becoming an intermediary between clean power producers and customers than investing billions in renewable projects, the sources said, giving previously unreported details of the plan.
Shell announced in October it would increase its spending on low-carbon energy to 25% of overall capital expenditure by 2025 and the sources said that would translate into more than $5 billion a year, up from $1.5 billion to $2 billion now. 
The Anglo-Dutch company will, however, keep its overall oil and gas output largely stable for the next decade to help fund its energy transition, though gas is set to become a bigger part of the mix, the sources told Reuters. 
A Shell spokeswoman declined to comment on the details of the company's new strategy ahead of its February announcements. BP, meanwhile, plans to slash its oil output by 40% by 2030 and has swept aside its core oil and gas exploration team to focus on renewables, with spending on low-carbon energy set to rise 10-fold to $5 billion over the coming decade.
While Europe's big oil firms are all rolling out strategies to survive in a low-carbon world, investors and analysts remain sceptical about their ability to transform centuries-old business models and triumph in already crowded power markets.
(Graphic: Increase in low-carbon spending - https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-STRATEGY/xklpylookvg/chart.png)
POWER TRADING
Central to Shell's plans are its experience in trading all types of energy from oil to natural gas to electricity and its vast retail network, which has more outlets than either of the world's two biggest food chains, Subway and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).
Shell is already the world's leading energy trader, an activity it calls ""marketing"". It trades about 13 million barrels of oil a day, or 13% of global demand before the pandemic, using one of the biggest fleets of tankers.
It is the top trader of liquefied natural gas (LNG), buys and sells power, biofuels, chemicals and carbon credits, and now aims to use its pole position to snare a large chunk of the fast-growing low-carbon power market.
""The future of energy is particularly bright for our marketing and our customer-facing businesses where we already have scale. So we will accelerate a growth plan which is already underway,"" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in October.
Trading has been key for oil majors for decades, allowing them to use their global operations to quickly take advantage of changes in supply and demand. Shell's trading helped it avoid its first-ever quarterly loss in the second quarter of 2020 even as consumption plummeted due to the coronavirus epidemic.
Nevertheless, analysts say Shell's trading division will face a challenge because it is heavily reliant at the moment on sales of refined fossil fuel products, which also account for a large proportion of its carbon emissions.
""Shell faces difficult choices on how to balance its trading cash flow that leverages oil products while still having carbon-intensive operations,"" JP Morgan analyst Christyan Malek said. ""But because of their scale, customer base and distribution, they can be much more flexible.""
HYDROGEN HUBS
At the same time, Shell plans to boost its consumer base by expanding its electricity supply business for homes and its network of electric vehicle charging points, as well as signing long-term corporate power purchase agreements (PPA).
Shell already has 45,000 retail outlets worldwide, far more than its European rivals, and it is planning to add another 10,000 by 2025.
As a major biofuel producer, Shell wants to ramp up its production of fuel made from plants and waste as an alternative source of energy for transportation, the sources said.
Shell's is also betting on future growth in hydrogen, the sources said. While still a niche market, hydrogen has attracted huge interest in recent months as a clean alternative to natural gas for heavy industry and transportation.
Hydrogen, and so-called green hydrogen which is made solely with renewable power, comes with high costs and infrastructure challenges though Shell is already investing.
Its push will centre initially on Europe, where it is developing a hydrogen hub in Hamburg, Germany, and it is one of several firms developing a hub in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It is also looking to expand into the United States and Asia.
The U.S. state of California, for example, is backing the rollout of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to help achieve its climate goals while countries such South Korea and Japan are betting heavily on hydrogen as an alternative fuel.
The sources did not give any targets for increases in Shell's production of either hydrogen or biofuels.
Like Shell, rivals including BP, Total, Italy's Eni and Spain's Repsol (OTC:REPYY) also plan to expand in hydrogen and biofuels markets, as well as add electric vehicle charging points to generate new revenue away from oil. 
COMPETITIVE EDGE?
However, Shell won't chase the same ambitious targets some of its European rivals have for adding wind and solar generation capacity and will prioritise trading and selling electricity instead, the sources said.
Shell is wary about investing heavily in renewable projects where it won't have any particular competitive edge over other oil companies or utilities, such as Spain's Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) and Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) that are already becoming significant green energy producers.
Shell will still expand its renewable capacity, especially in offshore wind farms where it believes it has an advantage after years of operating offshore oilfields, but the business will centre on profitability rather than size, the sources said.
""Shell will have some volumetric targets but that is not the focus,"" a senior company official told Reuters. ""A single focus on the volume of renewable energy generating capacity could be dangerous and lead us to some bad deals.""
BP wants to boost its renewable generation capacity 20 fold by 2030 while Total is aiming to have 100 gigawatts (GW) of gross renewable energy generation capacity by 2030.
Investors are concerned, however, that they may struggle to hit their profit projections by investing in costly renewable projects which typically have lower rates of return than oil.
Shell provided some details on its new strategy on Oct. 29, including a plan to narrow its oil and gas production to nine hubs, cut the number of refineries to six from 14 and boost its marketing business.

The company also announced plans to cut its workforce by up to 9,000 employees, or about 10%, by August this year as part of a broad cost-cutting review known as Project Reshape.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 07:35PM ET</span>","Exxon, Chevron CEOs discussed merger in early 2020-sources","By Mike Spector
(Reuters) - The chief executives of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) held preliminary talks in early 2020 to explore combining the two largest U.S. oil producers in what would have been the biggest merger of all time, according to people familiar with the matter.
The discussions, which are no longer active, are indicative of the pressure the energy sector's most dominant companies faced as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and crude prices plunged.
The talks between Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods and Chevron CEO Mike Wirth were serious enough for legal documents involving certain aspects of the merger discussions to be drafted, one of the sources said. The reason the talks ended could not be learned.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron, which have market capitalizations of $190 billion and $164 billion, respectively, declined to comment.
Exxon and Chevron's shares nosedived last year after a Saudi-Russian price war and fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the value of oil to crater. Exxon's stock was hit hardest, as investors raised concerns about the company's long-term profitability and spending decisions.
In their talks, the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets, one of the sources said. At the end of 2019, Exxon employed about 75,000 people and Chevron roughly 48,000.
Following the aborted talks with Exxon, Chevron went on to acquire oil producer  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL) in a $5 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed in October.
A proposed combination last year would almost certainly have triggered an intense antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department, a process that typically takes months to complete. And such a review would also potentially have run up against last November's U.S. presidential election, raising additional uncertainty about how soon such a deal might be cleared, if at all. 
Now, under the Biden administration, the window might be all but closed as Democrats historically have been less sympathetic to such deals, one of the sources said. President Joe Biden has put climate change at the forefront of his agenda, promoting jobs in renewable energy as opposed to traditional ones in the oil sector.
Biden recently formally revoked the permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline. General Motors (NYSE:GM) last week said it would aim to stop selling vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, which rely on oil, by 2035.
The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
News of the unsuccessful talks emerged as Exxon has come under pressure from some of its shareholders over its strategic direction.
Engine No. 1, a investment firm based in San Francisco, last week nominated four directors to Exxon’s board and is pushing the company to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and invest more in clean energy. Exxon is also in the crosshairs of hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which is pressuring the company to cut costs and improve performance.
Exxon reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. Chevron last week reported a surprise $11 million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.
COMBINED GIANT
A combined Exxon-Chevron would be eclipsed in size only by  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), which boasts a roughly $1.8 trillion market value and has previously pushed many U.S. drillers to the financial brink by flooding the market with oil. 
Despite inevitable antitrust concerns, the companies could argue a merger would represent the United States' best shot at taking on the Saudi state-owned conglomerate and the world's other largest state-backed oil producers, one of the sources said. 
Last year's Saudi-Russian oil price war, for instance, highlighted the vulnerability of U.S. producers to foreign governments that can effectively dictate the price of crude by forcing energy companies they back to boost or cut output. 
U.S. oil companies each compete among one another and set their own varying production targets, with limited ability of Washington to intervene.
Exxon and Chevron, with their powerful balance sheets, withstood turmoil in energy markets following the pandemic that forced some smaller independent oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy protection. 
Yet they also felt the pain. Demand for oil evaporated in early 2020 as governments imposed travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders to slow the COVID-19 pandemic’s spread. 
At one point in April, the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures turned negative for the first time ever, signifying sellers needed to pay buyers to take the commodity off their hands. Prices have since rebounded to roughly $52 a barrel.

Exxon and Chevron have both cut jobs over the past year. Exxon late last year left its dividend flat after boosting the shareholder payout each year since 1982.

(Reuters) - Playboy Enterprises Inc is nearing a deal to acquire the parent company of sexual wellness chain Lovers as it seeks to grow its lifestyle brand following the shuttering of its eponymous magazine, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 
The acquisition marks Playboy's latest effort to leverage its famous rabbit silhouette logo to expand in the consumer products arena. It already capitalizes on its brand by selling everything from apparel to art. 
The deal would value Lovers-parent company TLA Acquisition Corp at around $25 million and could be announced as early as Monday, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the details were not yet public. 
In October, Playboy agreed to go public by merging with blank-check acquisition company Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp in a deal that values Playboy at $413 million, including debt.
Upon closing of the deal, which is expected in February, Playboy will become a publicly traded company again, having been taken private in 2011 in a $207 million deal led by its late founder, Hugh Hefner, and private equity firm Rizvi Traverse Management. 
Lovers operates online as well as across 41 stores in five U.S. states, selling a sexual wellness and health goods including lingerie and intimacy products.

Playboy last year ceased publication of its magazine, ending a nearly seven-decade run on newsstands that began in 1953 with a debut issue featuring Marilyn Monroe.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 12:05PM ET</span>",Analysis: To the brink and back on GameStop - Wall Street vs Reddit,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Maiya Keidan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - On three hours of sleep a night and with no time to eat, one New York-based hedge fund manager overseeing billions in assets called last week the most stressful of his life.
""Nothing was making sense anymore,"" he said, as he watched the stock of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) soar, while he bet it would fall. 
Wednesday was the worst. Fueled by chatter on Reddit and other social media to take on Wall Street, investors used venues like online trading app Robinhood to bid up the brick-and-mortar retailer. GameStop surged 135%, on its way to gaining more than 1,500% in January without any change in its business outlook. Hedge funds scrambled. By this point trading had become so unpredictable across all sectors that funds were forced to dump their winning stocks to balance out their portfolios.
""It's time to cut out,"" the manager said he told his team. ""Let's live for another day."" 
The experience of this manager and a handful of others interviewed by Reuters over the last days, who all requested anonymity for fear of personal threats from retail investors, is a keyhole into a week of losses on Wall Street they say was far worse for them than last year's historic pandemic sparked sell-off. 
As a new week of trading begins, it remains to be seen how long the Reddit-fueled rally in traditionally unloved stocks will last. 
More immediately, it could mean more market losses if hedge funds have to keep selling to meet redemptions or right their portfolios. Longer term, they may have to shift strategies to find their footing and turn the tide to their advantage. 
""What is not clear as yet is whether this disruption will evolve into a market accident,” said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor of Allianz (DE:ALVG).
CROWDED TRADE 
The extent of losses has exposed a big weakness on Wall Street. Analytics firm S3 said GameStop short sellers had mark-to-market losses of nearly $20 billion so far this year. 
Several hedge fund managers said the idea to short GameStop had long been a favorite at exclusive ""idea dinners"", where fund managers swap their best trades. 
Managers also noted traders, many of whom who work at multi-strategy funds that employ pods of portfolio managers, traders and analysts, often know each other well and may compare notes.Gabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital, one of the funds gored most by GameStop's gains, took a $2.75 billion bailout from his one-time mentor Steve Cohen and Citadel’s Ken Griffin. The funds involved have taken a dent: Cohen's Point72 Asset Management lost roughly 15% in January partly because of its investment in Melvin. Melvin's assets slid during the month from around $12.5 billion to $8 billion, a source familiar with the situation said.
Maplelane Capital, another fund that bet against GameStop, had lost roughly 45% in January, a person familiar with the fund's returns said. Even Viking Global Investors, one of the world's best-performing hedge funds, was off some 7%, people familiar with the returns said. 
Representatives for Plotkin, Cohen and Griffin declined to comment. 
""Being short consensus stocks is just bad business,"" said Dinakar Singh, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trader who now runs hedge fund Axon Capital and was not short the stock. ""It is great while it is working but when it isn't anymore one guy's problem triggers everyone's headache. It becomes a circular disaster."" 
INVESTING ‘INSANITY’ 
Fund managers said the week’s experience is changing the way they do business. Citron’s Andrew Left, who ignited the retail trading frenzy by publicly detailing GameStop's issues, acknowledged defeat by Friday. He had covered his positions, taken a loss, and said he will stop publishing short-seller reports, a strategy that earned him millions and made him a prominent name in the industry. 
Hedge funds will also be much more cautious about having short positions going forward for fear of becoming a ""mindless target"", said one former hedge fund manager, adding that ""kind of defeats the purpose of hedge funds."" Traditionally hedge funds promised investors a cushion against market declines by being able to sell short and make money when stocks drop. 
Funds are also less likely to use trading strategies such as put options, a kind of derivative that has to be disclosed and that Melvin and Maplelane used, the managers said. 
At the same time, though, one thing will not change: Wall Street thinking of new ways to make money again. 
Already the tide started to turn somewhat late in the week for hedge funds as Robinhood and other some online brokerages used by millions of retail investors restricted trading in the stock. 
Many hedge funds still remain on the other side of the GameStop trade, with the number of shares shorted having dropped only 8% during the week as firms like Melvin covered positions. One New York-based banker said his clients were looking for other possible targets of retail trading frenzy and positioning themselves ahead of it to make money if the eye of Reddit turned that way. ""People have spent all week running their screens on other situations that might fit this criteria,"" the banker said. ""You’re going to see more of it.""

""This isn’t investing, this is insanity,"" said Kyle Bass, founder, Hayman Capital Management LP. ""A month, two months from now, I will be flabbergasted if GameStop isn’t below $100.”

The small investors, connected on social media, mobilized to take on institutional short sellers of GameStop and other shares, sparking a short squeeze that sent those stock prices surging. The details of Cohen's holdings were not disclosed, so it was unclear if he was a short seller.
However, Cohen's Point72 and Citadel LLC gave a capital infusion to Melvin Capital, a fund that held a large short position in GameStop, enabling it to close out that position with a large loss and survive. 
Cohen, who previously used Twitter largely to engage with fans of the New York Mets baseball team after he bought a majority stake last year, was among fund managers who received threats as the GameStop saga unfolded. 
On Thursday, Cohen got into a heated debate with blogger Dave Portnoy, who founded the sports and pop culture blog Barstool Sports. Cohen, worth roughly $14 billion, tweeted, ""Hey Dave, What's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make a living just like you.""

Point72 lost between 10% and 15% in value since the start of the year to the middle of the week, people familiar with the numbers said.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>","Analysis: Robinhood and Reddit protected from lawsuits by user agreement, Congress","By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - Robinhood Markets Inc's user agreement is likely to protect the brokerage app from a barrage of lawsuits filed by customers after it blocked a frenzied trading rally in companies such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) that was fueled on social media forums. 
The owners of internet platforms where much of the discussion took place are likewise shielded from liability for users' activity under a 25-year-old law known as Section 230. 
At least a dozen proposed class action lawsuits accuse Robinhood of breaching its contract with customers when it restricted trading on Thursday.
Robinhood's users were at the center of this week's wild rally in a handful of stocks that had been heavily shorted by hedge funds and championed by individual investors in online chatrooms including Reddit's WallStreetBets. 
The lawsuits, brought in federal court, allege that the Menlo Park, California-based company breached its contractual obligation as a regulated broker to execute orders promptly and effectively. 
However, Robinhood is not legally bound to carry out every trade and the lawsuits will not succeed without evidence the company restricted trading for an improper reason, such as to favor certain investors, according to several legal experts.
The user agreement on Robinhood's website says it ""may at any time, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Me, prohibit or restrict My ability to trade securities."" 
Adam Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said the lawsuits are very unlikely to gain traction. 
""The contract says they can do it,"" Pritchard said of the company's decision to restrict trading. ""That seems to be a big stumbling block to the breach of contract claim.""
Robinhood did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The popular commission-free trading platform had branded itself as an app to empower retail investors to take on Wall Street and democratize finance, and the trade restrictions sparked an uproar and claims of betrayal on social media. 
Robinhood said the restrictions were necessary to comply with regulatory capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits, which it said fluctuate with volatility.
SUITS AGAINST BROKERS 
The lawsuits allege the restrictions benefited large funds that were allegedly invested in or allied with Robinhood.
But the customers are unlikely to clear preliminary court hurdles to get to the point where they can demand documents and depositions to investigate Robinhood's actions, said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane University Law School.
She said attempts to sue brokers for mishandling customer accounts have generally been unsuccessful due to limits that federal securities law places on the filing of class actions. For example, a federal judge in 2019 dismissed a proposed class action against TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) Holding Corp for allegedly mismanaging a tax feature of certain accounts. 
The judge said TD Ameritrade customers failed to show the company broke promises or acted unfairly or in bad faith.
The lawsuits against Robinhood seek unspecified damages, including punitive damages, which presents another hurdle to the customers' chances in court, according to experts.
It will be hard to prove users suffered as a result of Robinhood's measures because GameStop and other stocks covered by the curbs fell sharply on Thursday after the restrictions were announced, said James Cox, a professor at Duke Law School. 
""No harm, no foul,"" said Cox.
Some of the lawsuits said investors were harmed because they were unable to short GameStop, or speculate the stock would fall.
But some investment firms did take a big hit, and shares in the companies largely rebounded after Robinhood and other online brokerages said they planned to lift most of the restrictions on Friday.
Melvin Capital Management and Citron Capital had placed large bets GameStop would drop in price and suffered huge losses as the stock rallied.
While Reddit users stoked the rally, the message platform is insulated from claims by the investment funds.
Social media companies are generally not liable for user activity under a statute commonly known as Section 230, a 1996 law that was aimed at encouraging new forms of communication at the outset of the online era.
In the early days of the internet, there were several high-profile cases in which companies tried to suppress criticism by suing the owners of platforms.
One involved a lawsuit against the early online service Prodigy by Stratton Oakmont, the brokerage firm depicted in the Leonardo DiCaprio movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" The court found Prodigy was liable for allegedly defamatory comments by a user because it was a publisher that moderated the content on the service.
The budding internet industry was concerned that such liability would make a range of new services impossible. Congress ultimately agreed and included Section 230 in the Communications Decency Act.
""The whole point of section 230 is to enable sites like Reddit to allow conversations to take place,"" said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law. 

""Knowing that some conversations will be antisocial and in some cases illegal, section 230 says that's not the responsibility of the service that creates the venue of those conversations.""

1455,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2021 07:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: A tulip by another name? 'Gamestonk' and the case for investor caution,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - It sounds like the start of a parable: Investors stuck inside during a pandemic begin to bid up an asset until its price becomes untethered to reality. The value soars until one day the market runs out of buyers and freezes, causing prices to plummet and some unlucky few to lose fortunes more than ten times their annual incomes in the span of a few hours.
The date: February 3, 1636. On that day, the infamous Dutch tulip bubble burst during an outbreak of the bubonic plague, illustrating that asset prices can plummet just as quickly as they soar, leaving only pain behind.
Now, almost exactly 385 years and another pandemic later, Wall Street waits to see how long it will take for history to repeat itself.
Shares of video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) have soared 1,625% since the start of January. Driving the rally are individual investors who have been stuck at home for the last ten months. Many have turned to online forums like WallStreetBets on Reddit and are buying the stock, some as a form of protest against hedge fund managers who wagered that it would fall.
These amateur investors are buoyed by savings built up over the coronavirus pandemic, two rounds of stimulus payments and near zero interest rates. Some, such as billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, have referred to the phenomenon as 'Gamestonk', a play on the intentional misspelling of the word 'stock' on social media.
The stock price rally to above $300 per share has emboldened some small investors to pour even more money into a company that Wall Street analysts tracked by Refinitiv believe is worth slightly more than $13 per share. The surge increases the risk that individuals will get caught up in the euphoria and look past the warning signs and consequences of an eventual crash.
""I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend),"" a Reddit user with the handle ssauron https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and wrote Thursday on WallStreetBets. ""And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others.""
A form of class warfare waged through the shares of a video game retailer is notably different than financial market manias, such as the dotcom bubble in 2000 or the U.S. real estate bubble that culminated in the 2008 financial crisis, both which were fueled by assumptions of broad economic growth.
Yet for those who buy GameStop at the wrong time, the results will likely be the same.
""The reality is that GameStop doesn't hurt Wall Street. It might hurt a couple of hedge fund managers out there, but no one is going to cry for them. The people who will be losing their life savings are small retail investors,"" said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation at GMO.
The total value of short positions in Reddit-favored stocks such as GameStop is about $40 billion, limiting the pain among professional investors to a handful of hedge funds, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Overall, GameStop shorts were down about $5 billion for the year through Tuesday, according to S3 Partners. By comparison, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, another heavily-shorted stock among professional investors, caused short sellers $245 billion in losses in 2020, the firm noted.
""While we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited,"" Barclays said.
The likelihood that most of the losses from the rally in GameStop will come among the same group of retail investors who prodded it higher is leaving many on Wall Street baffled as the bubble continues to grow. GameStop surged 67.9% higher Friday to close at $325 per share.
""GameStop is not worth $500, not worth $400, not worth $300, not worth $200, not even worth $100, not even worth $50,"" billionaire investor Leon Cooperman said on CNBC Thursday. ""I'm not damning them. I'm just saying from my experience, this will end in tears,"" he added.
BURSTING BUBBLES
The dotcom bubble peaked in March 2000 and over the next two years the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index slid nearly 77% as companies that were touted as can't miss investments ran out of financing. By the time the Nasdaq bottomed in October 2002, some $6.2 trillion in household wealth had been destroyed, according to Amir Sufi, a professor at the University of Chicago.
The 2008 financial crisis, meanwhile, wiped away approximately $16.4 trillion from American households through a combination of steep stock market losses and plummeting home equity, according to the Federal Reserve.
No one expects that the GameStop bubble will cause anything close to the same levels of economic pain as the financial crisis or dotcom bust before it, in part because the company has a low share count and was not widely held by institutional or retail investors prior to the start of the year. With $6.5 billion in revenues in its last fiscal year and fewer than 53,000 employees worldwide, it does not have an outsized economic impact.
Yet a fall will be concentrated on those who helped upend Wall Street's notion of what retail investors can do.
""There's going to be some blood on the floor when this is all over, but that's going to be some hedge fund blood and a lot of retail blood,"" said Donald Langevoort, a professor at Georgetown Law who studies retail investors and securities regulation.
Melvin Capital and Citron Research, two prominent GameStop short-sellers, said earlier this week that they had already closed out their positions.
Securities laws that typically protect smaller investors from fraud may be of little help for investors who buy shares of GameStop at elevated levels, Langevoort said.
""I don't know if there is an organization or orchestrator that is using deceit and trickery, especially when the motivation seems to be 'Let's support GameStop and show them,'"" he said. ""The SEC has to take a deep breath and ask itself whether it has a strong enough case to put a stop to this.""
'LIFE OF ITS OWN'
The outsized rally in GameStop is happening at a time when valuations across financial markets appear to be stretched. The S&P 500 index trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 23.1, near its peak during the dotcom bubble, while the cryptocurrency bitcoin jumped 14% Friday after gaining 265% over the past 12 months.
The rise of commission-free trading platforms such as Robinhood have helped inflate asset market bubbles by lowering the bar for retail investors to trade, said Ronnie Sadka, a finance professor at Boston College.
""Retail investors are becoming a systemic risk,"" that the SEC is ill-prepared to handle, he said. ""The challenge with regulation is that this is not a case where Wall Street is squeezing the mom and pops, this is a case where the short-sellers are getting squeezed.""
The surging value of GameStop shares is luring investors who will most likely be burned in the end, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has a $16 price target for the company.
""This is the tulip bubble all over again,” he said, adding that he received a call from a friend who bragged that he put $1,000 into Reddit favorites such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd and was now up $400,000 in two weeks. ""He doesn't even know what GameStop sells,"" Pachter said.
How will the GameStop mania end? If it is like the original tulip bubble, it could lead to a ""short-term crisis of trust"" in financial markets, said Anne Goldgar, a professor at the University of Southern California.
Every jump in the price of GameStop, meanwhile, brings in more short-sellers enticed by ever-growing potential gains and more buyers looking to stick a thumb in the eye of Wall Street, causing the cycle to continue, Pachter said.

""This thing has a life of its own,"" Pachter said.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China gene firm providing worldwide COVID tests worked with Chinese military,"By Kirsty Needham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - BGI Group, the world's largest genomics company, has worked with China's military on research that ranges from mass testing for respiratory pathogens to brain science, a Reuters review of research, patent filings and other documents has found.
The review, of more than 40 publicly available documents and research papers in Chinese and English, shows BGI’s links to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) include research with China’s top military supercomputing experts. The extent of those links has not previously been reported.
BGI has sold millions of COVID-19 test kits outside China since the outbreak of the new coronavirus pandemic, including to Europe, Australia and the United States. Shares of BGI Genomics Co, the company’s subsidiary listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, have doubled in price over the past 12 months, giving it a market value of about $9 billion. 
But top U.S. security officials have warned American labs against using Chinese tests because of concern China was seeking to gather foreign genetic data for its own research. BGI has denied that.
The documents reviewed by Reuters neither contradict nor support that U.S. suspicion. Still, the material shows that the links between the Chinese military and BGI run deeper than previously understood, illustrating how China has moved to integrate private technology companies into military-related research under President Xi Jinping.
The U.S. government has recently been warned by an expert panel that adversary countries and non-state actors might find and target genetic weaknesses in the U.S. population and a competitor such as China could use genetics to augment the strength of its own military personnel. 
BGI has worked on PLA projects seeking to make members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority less susceptible to altitude sickness, Reuters found, genetic research that would benefit soldiers in some border areas. 
Elsa Kania, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank, who has provided testimony to U.S. Congressional committees, told Reuters that China’s military has pushed research on brain science, gene editing and the creation of artificial genomes that could have an application in future bioweapons. She added that such weapons are not currently technically feasible.
BGI’s pattern of collaboration with the Chinese military was a “reasonable concern to raise” for U.S. officials, said Kania. 
In response to Reuters’ questions, BGI said it adheres to international standards and Chinese laws related to open science, data sharing and genomic research. It said its collaboration with military researchers was for academic purposes only. 
“BGI strongly rejects any accusations about links with the PLA, particularly in relation to our COVID-19 test kits,” it said in a statement.
China’s defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
'ENHANCE' SOLDIER STRENGTH
Chinese technology companies have come under increasing scrutiny by the United States and were subject to mounting restrictions under the administration of Donald Trump. In November, the Department of Commerce proposed a rule to add gene editing software to the U.S. export control list, saying it could be used to create biological weapons. Officials in the new administration of President Joe Biden have signalled a continued tough approach to what they see as a rising threat from Beijing.
A technology industry panel on artificial intelligence, appointed by the U.S. government and chaired by former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chief Executive Eric Schmidt, raised the alarm in October about China’s financial support for its biotechnology sector, its advantages in collecting biological data, and the PLA’s interest in potential military applications.
The panel, which will deliver its final report in March, warned about adversaries using artificial intelligence to identify genetic weaknesses in a population and engineering pathogens to exploit them, and genetic research designed to enhance soldiers’ mental or physical strength.
The panel recommended that the U.S. government “take a more aggressive public posture regarding BGI,” citing national security risks posed by the company’s links to the Chinese government and its trove of genomic data.
The U.S. Department of State did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Reuters’ findings.
In response to Reuters’ questions, China’s foreign ministry said the U.S. government had “wantonly misinterpreted and smeared China’s military-civil fusion policy,” and was imposing unreasonable sanctions that would hamper research.
“China’s military-civil fusion policy is aimed at effectively mobilizing military and civilian resources, coordinating socio-economic growth and national defense development, and benefiting the public with scientific and technological progress. This policy is above board and beyond reproach,” the ministry said in a statement to Reuters.
It added that this was “customary international practice” and said the U.S. government had effectively pursued military-civil fusion for more than 100 years.
‘KEY PROJECTS’
BGI Group, based in Shenzhen, has grown quickly by selling genetic sequencing services to universities and health systems around the world and amassing a large DNA databank. It created China’s first cloned pig in 2010.
One science paper authored by BGI founders Yang Huanming and Wang Jian along with the PLA’s Key Laboratory (NYSE:LH) of High Altitude Medicine and the Third Military Medical University focused on experiments with the brains of monkeys suffering altitude sickness.
The study, published in January 2020, stated that it was funded as one of the “key projects of military science and technology” by the PLA. A decade ago, the military university’s research sought to identify genes related to altitude sickness so the PLA could screen for susceptible soldiers. The latest research focused on how drugs interacting with genes could potentially protect a person from brain injury.
An earlier 2017 study designed by BGI’s Wang and published in conjunction with a PLA research centre in Xinjiang looked at the effect of rapid mountain ascent on the bodies of “young, healthy men.”
China has the world’s longest highland border, which includes its border with India, where fighting broke out between the two countries' troops in 2020. A 2018 paper by the same PLA laboratory stated that “high altitude disease is the main reason for reduced combat effectiveness and health damage to soldiers at high altitudes and influences the results of war.” 
Reuters was unable to contact Yang and Wang. BGI said its research collaboration with the PLA lab and the Third Military Medical University, where Yang has been a professor for almost two decades, was “for academic purposes only.”
SEQUENCING COVID
BGI jointly holds a dozen patents for tests that screen for genomes linked to disease with the military university, the PLA’s Academy of Military Medical Science, which is the top medical research institute of the PLA, and PLA hospitals.
One patent was granted in 2015 to BGI and the Academy of Military Medical Science for a low-cost test kit to detect respiratory pathogens, including SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and coronaviruses.
BGI’s current chief infectious disease scientist, Chen Weijun, is listed as an inventor on the patent documents. Chen was among the first scientists to sequence COVID-19, taking samples from a military hospital in Wuhan, according to sequence data later shared internationally.
Chen is listed as affiliated with the Academy of Military Medical Science in three science papers reviewed by Reuters.In response to Reuters’ questions, BGI said in a statement that Chen has not been affiliated with the PLA’s Academy of Military Medical Science since 2012. Chen did not respond to a request for comment.
BGI’s COVID-19 test kit did not use the method jointly patented with the PLA, the company said in the statement. 
Four BGI researchers have also been jointly affiliated with another military institution, the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT), according to publicly available science and conference papers reviewed by Reuters. Hunan-based NUDT is under the direct leadership of China’s Central Military Commission, the top-level body that steers the Chinese military and is headed by Xi. 
The NUDT is on a U.S. blacklist as a threat to national security because its Tianhe-2 supercomputer - one of the world’s most powerful - is used to simulate nuclear explosions, according to a Department of Commerce listing. That listing restricts U.S. companies from supplying NUDT with technology.
One researcher, Peng Shaoliang, was instrumental in developing software to speed up BGI’s sequencing of human genomes using supercomputing developed by NUDT.
Peng has won military awards for his work. He is a member of an expert group advising the Central Military Commission’s Science and Technology Commission, set up in 2016 when Xi began promoting a strategy to integrate China’s civilian and military research.
Patent applications in 2020 show Peng is also a member of the PLA’s Institute of Military Medicine. Liao Xiangke, the head of the NUDT’s supercomputer programme and a major general in the PLA, has published seven scientific papers either co-authored with BGI researchers or crediting them for providing data and source code.
BGI said in a statement to Reuters that Peng and Liao “were two collaborators of BGI for the project at the time for the purpose of academic exchange only. Since the project ended BGI has no more affiliation with them.” 
Peng and Liao did not respond to requests for comment.
BGI said it uses Tianhe-2 on a commercial basis, as well as other supercomputing platforms, to speed up research. The papers it wrote with the NUDT were for academic purposes only, it said, and were open for public reference, while the programmes themselves have ended.

Tianhe-2 has also been used to solve pharmaceutical, cryptology, engineering and climate problems that have no military application, the company said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Manhattan has dismissed most but not all of a shareholder lawsuit accusing  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co of concealing billions of dollars of insurance liabilities and using questionable accounting to prop up its power business.
In a Friday night decision, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman dismissed fraud claims based on GE's alleged misrepresentations about its long-term care insurance portfolio, and most claims concerning long-term service agreements in its power division.
The judge allowed shareholders to pursue claims that Boston-based GE should have disclosed its reliance on factoring, or the sale of future revenue for cash, and to pursue some claims against a former GE chief financial officer, Jeffrey Bornstein.
Furman's 34-page decision followed GE's agreement on Dec. 9 to pay $200 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it misled investors about its insurance and power businesses.
The shareholders, including pension funds and other investors, asked Furman to treat the SEC settlement as proof GE had misled them, while the defendants said the judge could infer they had no intent to defraud. Furman rejected both suggestions.
Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A GE spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on behalf of the defendants, who include former Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt.
GE is in a multiyear turnaround focused on improving cash flow, cutting costs and shedding some units, while retaining aviation, power generation, renewable energy and other businesses.
The proposed class action covers shareholders from February 2013 to January 2018, when GE took a surprise $6.2 billion charge related to its insurance business. Its share price fell by roughly one-half in the last 18 months of the class period.
Furman had in August 2019 dismissed large portions of an earlier version of the lawsuit.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes dropped, closing out the Friday session with the biggest weekly fall since October, as investors gauged the ramifications of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine trial results, while a standoff between Wall Street hedge funds and small, retail investors added to volatility.
Johnson & Johnson fell 3.56% as one of the biggest weights on both the Dow and S&P500 after the drugmaker said its single-dose vaccine was 72% effective in preventing COVID-19 in the United States, with a lower rate of 66% observed globally. 
The results compare to the high bar set by two authorized vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, which were around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in key trials when given in two doses. Moderna shares climbed 8.53% while Pfizer shares edged up 0.11%. 
Worries of a short squeeze that began earlier in the week resurfaced after an army of retail investors returned to trade shares in stocks such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and Koss Corp, which shot higher after brokers including Robinhood eased some of the restrictions they had placed on trading.
""The overall picture is that if there is any bad news that suggests or indicates there could be a longer hibernation period for us to be indoors and not consuming or spending that tends to set the market back and a lot of people sit on the sidelines, particularly with that news,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs in New York. 
""And then what is going on with (Gamestop) and all that stuff, people are a little afraid to trade."" 
The surge in volatility has led to a huge increase in volume, totaling over 20 billion shares in each of the past two sessions across U.S. exchanges for the most active trading days on record going back to 2014, according to Refinitiv data. 
Volume across U.S. exchanges on Friday was 17.13 billion shares, compared with the 15.26 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was closely monitoring any potential wrongdoing, to both brokerages and social media traders.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 620.74 points, or 2.03%, to 29,982.62, the S&P 500 lost 73.14 points, or 1.93%, to 3,714.24 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 266.46 points, or 2%, to 13,070.70.
All three main indexes suffered their biggest weekly fall since the end of October, as the Dow lost 3.28%, the S&P fell 3.31% and the Nasdaq declined 3.49%. For the month, the Dow dipped 2.04%, the S&P shed 1.12% and the Nasdaq gained 1.42%. 
Both the S&P and Dow closed below their 50-day moving average, seen as a technical support level. 
Market participants have speculated that volatility caused by the short squeezes have led to investor favorites including Apple Inc coming under pressure as hedge funds sell to cover billions of dollars in losses. 
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined 3.74% while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell 2.92%. 
Still, while concerns about rising COVID-19 cases and bumpy vaccine rollouts kept investors leery about a pullback and an increase in volatility in the near-term, the start to quarterly earnings has eased some concern about stretched stock valuations.
Of the 184 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Friday morning, 84.2% have topped analyst expectations, well above the 75.5% beat rate for the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv data. 
Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) lost 3.68% after it posted a 13% fall in quarterly profit.
The first known U.S. cases of the South African COVID-19 variant, found to be partly resistant to current vaccines and antibody treatments, was detected in South Carolina on Thursday. 
Data showed U.S. labor costs rose more than expected in the fourth quarter amid a jump in wages, supporting views that inflation could accelerate this year, while another report showed U.S. consumer spending fell for a second straight month in December.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Silver prices jumped and global equity markets sank on Friday amid a growing battle on Wall Street between hedge funds and retail investors, while a dispute over COVID-19 vaccine supply in Europe cooled risk appetite. 
Disappointing vaccine data from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also hurt sentiment but the assault of retail traders using online forums to force hedge funds to reverse short positions - bets that stocks will fall - kept the market on edge.
Shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc surged again after Robinhood and Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) said they planned to ease restrictions after imposing buying halts on Thursday.
GameStop soared 67.9% to $325 a share, five times its closing price a week ago Friday, and AMC gained 53.7%, both in heavy trade. AMC was one of the most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 16.83 billion shares, up from the 10.6 billion average in the fourth quarter. 
Silver rallied and was up 2% at $26.90 an ounce, taking gains to almost 10% since messages began to circulate on Reddit early Thursday urging retail investors to pile into the market and drive up prices.
Anxiety has grown as investors ask whether hedge funds will need to liquidate other positions to address losses in stocks they have shorted, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in Boston.
""Once this short squeeze inevitably ends and there aren't any more greater fools to bid up these stocks, will retail investors get stuck holding the bag?"" Arone asked.
""The unintended consequences of this potential volatility have markets on edge as we end the week,"" Arone said.
Arone added that investors need to take a giant step back as earnings are strong, the economy is improving, fiscal and monetary policy is supportive and vaccines are rolling out.

Delays in COVID-19 vaccine production have snowballed into a spat between Britain, the European Union and drugmakers over how best to direct limited supplies.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc offered eight million more doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union after it unexpectedly announced supply cuts last week. But the bloc said that was far short of what was originally promised, an EU official told Reuters on Friday.

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",Analysis: GameStop's 'Reddit rally' puts scrutiny on social media forums,"By Paresh Dave, Katie Paul and Elizabeth Culliford
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Social media services including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Reddit restrict discussions about weapons, drugs and other illegal activity, but their rules do not specifically mention another lucrative regulated good: stocks.
Some people think they should. Users of a Reddit group, in which 5 million members exchange investment ideas, generated significant profits by gorging on shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other out-of-favor companies that had been shorted by big hedge funds.
Investors have used social media for years. Anonymous posts have fueled cryptocurrency pump and dump schemes, according to studies, but that obscure market generated less scrutiny. The ""Reddit rally"" however, has roiled global stock markets and drawn scrutiny of posts in which thousands of smaller investors trade tips on platforms from Facebook to Instagram to Telegram and Clubhouse.
Individual investors won praise from elected officials and the general public for jabbing powerful hedge funds with a ""short squeeze."" Yet critics have emerged, accusing social media users of manipulating markets unlawfully by pumping shares of weak companies. The manager of one Facebook trading community said she has turned down requests to tout individual stocks.
Social media companies are generally not liable for user activity under a statute commonly known as Section 230. Still, their rules bar illegal behavior like facilitating gun and drug transactions or distributing offensive content that could rile advertisers or generate calls for tighter regulation.
Section 230 also has some carve-outs that in theory could lead to a tech company being penalized for user-generated content, including violations of federal criminal law, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law scholar who wrote a book on the law.
He noted that the bar is high. The speech itself would need to be a criminal violation of a law that explicitly specified distribution of that speech as illegal.
In addition, First Amendment precedents typically hold that the companies must have knowledge of criminal speech posted on their platforms in order to be held responsible for it, said Kosseff.
Harvard Law School professor Jesse Fried said the stock trading forums appear to be ""purely legal behavior: irrationally exuberant buying by amateur investors."" 
Prosecuting users for deceiving investors is tough but possible, said University of California, Berkeley law professor Stavros Gadinis, adding that social media companies should have the same ability stock market operators do to intervene to stop alleged manipulation. 
Identifying bad actors among the frenzy is a challenge. ""There's all of these feedback loops and incentives behind the scenes,"" said Sinan Aral, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. ""We don't know exactly who was in the crowd.""
The vast majority of traffic on Stocktwits, a social media platform for investors, appears to be people talking about stocks without evidence of manipulation, said Rishi Khanna, its CEO. He said the platform was not taking any extra moderation actions on this activity.
GRAY AREA
Although Reddit has stated platform-wide rules - including no illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal transactions - the service relies heavily on community-based moderation. Users who act as moderators make and enforce guidelines about what is permissible.
The founder of the WallStreetBets Reddit community Jaime Rogozinski, who was a moderator of the group until April 2020, said he tried to draw lines on what to allow. He said he and other moderators removed illegal attempts to game the market, such as claiming to have insider information. When there were gray areas, he said they played it safe. 
""You'd have attempts for pumping up stock and I still to this day am not sure what the regulation was, but I never wanted to find out,"" said Rogozinski. 
Archived copies of the forum showed a ban on ""market manipulation"" topped its list of rules by April last year. The current moderators said they struggled to moderate the WallStreetBets group as traffic surged, briefly causing technical errors at Reddit this week. 
A spokeswoman said earlier this week that Reddit would ""review and cooperate with valid law enforcement investigations or actions as needed.""
Discord, which hosts many trading discussions, said its rules bar users from engaging in ""any illegal behavior."" Discord on Thursday said it was working with the ""Wallstreetbets"" room team to moderate its new server, after removing the previous server over hate speech and misinformation. It did not address stock market influence.
A lack of closer scrutiny on the matter has left open the opportunity for potential manipulation. Former Merrill Lynch financial adviser Cassandra Cummings, 47, who now manages 80,000-member Facebook trading group The Stocks and Stilettos Society, said she declined multiple requests in the last year to rally her group around a specific stock.

""They know that I have the power through my group to move that company stock price,"" she said.

Scharf will receive $20.3 million for his work during the year, compared with $23 million in 2019, the bank said. https:// Scharf, who served as a top lieutenant to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon during the financial crisis of 2008, took over the reins at Wells Fargo in 2019. The fall in Scharf's pay compares with a 36% drop in Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive David Solomon's salary and a 20% jump in compensation for  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s top boss James Gorman. JPMorgan held CEO Dimon's annual pay at $31.5 million. Wells Fargo's board cited the drop in the bank's financial results for 2020 as one of the reasons for Scharf's lower compensation, noting that the results were significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank last year posted its first quarterly loss since 2008 and also saw its profit plunge to just 1 penny per share in the first quarter of 2020. However, Wells Fargo ended the year with a rare quarterly profit beat.  
The bank has operated under a dark cloud since 2016 when details emerged about millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers' names without their permission to hit sales targets.

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 05:55PM ET</span>",Sideshow or main event? GameStop stock ride weighed as bubble warning,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are growing concerned that wild swings in GameStop and other stocks driven by small-time traders could be fresh signs of overexuberance that foreshadow volatility for the broader stock market.
GameStop shares closed up 400% for the week after the video game chain's stock became a battleground between retail traders and Wall Street professionals, a tussle that captivated investors the world over. 
Some market-watchers see those massive gains, as well as the moves in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and other heavily shorted stocks, as a sideshow in a rally underpinned by Federal Reserve support, anticipated coronavirus relief spending and expectations that vaccines against COVID-19 will help the U.S. economy rebound later this year. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week pushed back on suggestions that the central bank's super-low interest rates and massive bond purchases were creating asset bubbles. 
But those comments failed to quell some investors' worries that the Fed's monetary policy has encouraged excessive risk-taking across broader markets: The S&P 500 is up 66% since March and stocks stand near their highest valuations in two decades. 
The action in GameStop and other stocks “definitely gives us some cause for concern,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. ""At the very least, you have to consider that there's a chance of a market correction."" 
The moves also drew some comparisons to the internet stock mania two decades earlier. 
""Just the fact that you have a group of investors that are really chasing abnormal gains, that’s what is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble,” Ragan said. 
Some barometers of general over-exuberance are already flashing: Citi said its “Panic/Euphoria” model is in ""elevated euphoric territory."" And the latest fund manager survey from BofA Global Research noted that allocations to cash had dropped rapidly, indicating that investors are putting more funds into riskier assets. 
The frenzied trading dominated the news on Wall Street this week, even as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other corporate heavyweights reported quarterly results. The S&P 500 fell 3.3% for the week, with trading volume surging above 24 billion shares on Wednesday, well above the 14.4 billion-share average of the past 20 sessions. The CBOE volatility index closed above 30 points this week for the first time since early November. 
One potential catalyst for further volatility could come if hedge funds are forced to sell out of positions in order to cover failed short selling bets, although it was unclear whether there would be enough of such selling to create a broad risk to equities. 
Already, some short-selling hedge funds appeared to be changing their approach. Short seller Andrew Left, whose company Citron Research was one of the hedge funds to spark this week’s battle with small-time traders over  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), said in a YouTube video on Friday that his company would no longer publish short selling research.
Others said the ramped-up activity of retail investors - who last year helped drive rallies in shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and other names - could in itself be the latest sign of market frothiness.
“When you think about market bubbles, the last players that jump on board are retail, and that is generally what is happening right now,” said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. 
Analysts at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) doubt the recent ructions in GameStop and other names indicate a broader market bubble, noting that market breadth - which measures how many stocks are participating in a rally - remains healthy and credit markets are functioning ""just fine.""
""Maybe it is simply time for a break"" in the S&P 500's rally, the firm said in a report Friday. 
Others, though, pointed to potential market turbulence ahead. 
Stephen Suttmeier, technical research strategist at BofA Global Research, earlier this week urged clients to ""take some profits"" ahead of February, a comparatively weak month for stocks. 
Other worrisome signs are the explosion of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, and the surge in shares of electric vehicle companies on the heels of Tesla's gains, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors. 
Still, he believes the frenzy over GameStop and other stocks is more of a ""sideshow."" 

Even after their rallies, the market capitalization of GameStop and other companies that have recently seen their stocks soar are ""like a rounding error"" compared with the broader market, he said.

1464,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 05:35PM ET</span>","United sends 14,000 furlough warnings; unions seek $15B new U.S. aid for airlines","By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Friday it warned some 14,000 employees that they might be furloughed, and aviation unions made a new request to Congress and President Joe Biden for another $15 billion in government assistance to keep workers on the payroll through at least Sept. 30.
Chicago-based United warned that once a second round of payroll support expires on April 1, airlines could be forced to make drastic new cuts as the coronavirus pandemic has slashed demand for air travel.
United had recalled 13,000 employees from furlough when a $15 billion airline industry payroll package was passed in December to protect jobs through March.
""Despite ongoing efforts to distribute vaccines, customer demand has not changed much,"" United told employees, while saying it was monitoring demand and advocating for continued government support. 
The $15 billion in December helped bring back more than 32,000 airline employees and followed a $50 billion package in March for passenger airlines divided between payroll assistance and low-cost government loans.
Two union leaders representing 75,000 flight attendants wrote congressional leaders seeking quick action to extend the payroll support program ""with $15 billion to protect jobs"" through Sept. 30 or later.
Union leaders Sara Nelson and Julie Hedrick added: ""The alternative is mass layoffs starting in April.""
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), which had furloughed 19,000 workers in October, did not immediately comment on Friday on whether it would issue new notices of potential layoffs.
Hawaiian Airlines said earlier it had issued furlough warnings to 900 employees.
United's Friday memo said ""we are all working hard toward the day when we can bring back our furloughed co-workers permanently.""
American Airlines chief executive Doug Parker said on Thursday that ""April 1 is approaching and demand hasn’t gotten much better... So we are definitely going to need to address this, unless demand starts to pick up.""

Parker said the company’s unions ""are already talking to the administration in Congress about this... We would obviously be supportive of that.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - UBS has hired Aneliya Crawford, a partner from a leading law firm that works with hedge funds, to defend the investment bank's corporate clients against attacks from activist investors.
Crawford, a partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP who represented prominent activist hedge funds Elliott Management and Trian Fund Management, said she will join UBS next month as co-head of its shareholder activism practice.
Crawford, who joined Schulte in January 2017 from law firm Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP, will concentrate on North America while Darren Novak, who has headed the group from London, will focus on Europe.
Activist Insight first reported the move.
Schulte lawyers have moved from working for activists to defending against them before. In 2015, Schulte partner David Rosewater moved to head activism defense at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Crawford will join a relatively small group of women working in activism defense including Allison Bennington at PJT Partners (NYSE:PJT), Amy Lissauer at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Mary Ann Deignan at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) and Pamela Codo-Lotti at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Defending corporate clients against activist hedge funds has become big business over the last years and many banks are expanding their services to help guide corporations when agitators, such as Starboard Value or Third Point (NYSE:TPRE), push for changes.

While activist campaigns ebbed last year amid the pandemic, the pace is expected to pick up more this year after a late 2020 uptick. Third Point, for example, pushed for chip maker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) to stop a brain drain, hire new talent and explore strategic alternatives, a move that led to the company hiring a new CEO this month.

Investing.com – GameStop rallied four-fold in just five trading days as the Redditors put the squeeze on the short sellers on Friday despite trading platforms including Robinhood imposing limits on trading for the second day in a row.  
GameStop (NYSE:GME) rallied 68% on Friday, racking up a 400% gain for the week. Baring a surge to $413.98 and dip to $250 intraday, the trading action in GameStop was confined to within the $300 price level, though the restrictions imposed on the traders most likely played a role. 
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rose 54% on the day, Naked Brand Group Ltd (NASDAQ:NAKD) rose 19%, while Express (NYSE:EXPR) was up 28% and Blackberry (TSX:BB) climbed 6%.
Robinhood was at the center of attention after the trading platform limited traders to buying just a single share of GameStop, MC, Koss and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA). The popular trading platform went a step further, expanding restrictions on a list of stocks to 50 to include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND). Traders were also limited to just two purchases of stock in  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY)and Qualtric.           
The battle between the retail traders versus the Wall Street short-sellers continued to captivate and divide opinion on Wall Street. 
""There is no reality to [these] trades ... they not based on anything other than speculation,"" said William Galvin, Massachusetts Secretary of State. ""The issue of shorting has to be addressed by the national regulator."" 
Kevin O’Leary, chairman of O’Shares ETFs and co-host of ""Shark Tank,"" disagrees. ""The best thing we could do for this market is leave it alone,"" O’Leary said on CNBC. He argued that no one was considering whether GameStop executives would take advantage of recent appreciate in their stock price to raise capital, build a brand and pivot ""just like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) did when they were shipping out CDs in the mail.""

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 04:46PM ET</span>",GameStop's rally cools as U.S. regulators eye wild trading,"By Sagarika Jaisinghani, Medha Singh and John McCrank
(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission waded into the battle between small investors and Wall Street hedge funds, warning brokerages and the pack of social-media traders that it was watching for potential wrongdoing.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares jumped, awarding retail investors the advantage in the latest round of their week-long slugfest against major financial institutions that had shorted the video game retailer.
The so-called ""Reddit rally"" has inflated stock prices for GameStop and other previously beaten-down companies that individual investors championed on social media forums including Reddit.
GameStop surged 51% on Friday after brokers including Robinhood eased some restrictions on trading. On Thursday, GameStop shares had fallen following the curbs imposed by Robinhood and other trading apps, which drew outrage from politicians and calls for action from regulators.
Robinhood said on its blog late on Friday opening new positions is currently allowed but limited in 23 securities, including GameStop.
Headphone maker Koss Corp was up 77%, although it and GameStop remained below peaks reached earlier this week.
Hedge funds and other short sellers had a bruising week. GameStop short sellers endured mark-to-market losses of $19.75 billion so far this year, according to S3. Even so, the stock remained highly-shorted with $11.2 billion short interest.
The SEC, traditionally cautious with public pronouncements, issued a rare joint statement from its acting chair and commissioners. It said it was working closely with other regulators and stock exchanges ""to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing"" and would ""closely review actions ... that may disadvantage investors"" or hinder their ability to trade stocks.
The showdown between small traders and professional short-sellers also drew scrutiny from lawmakers, President Joe Biden's administration, and the New York Attorney General.
The battle has roiled equity markets as funds were forced to sell some of their best-performing stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), to cover billions of dollars in losses on short positions. The benchmark S&P 500 was last down 1.6%. (N)
Volume has been heavy this week. The Reddit stocks have accounted for as much as 7.6% of total U.S. equity volumes, according to Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analyst Rich Repetto.
""The markets were vulnerable to a decline ... and this Reddit activity was the catalyst that sort of triggered the sell-off,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
REDDIT DARLINGS
On Reddit forum WallStreetBets, whose almost 6 million members are seen as having driven the trading, GameStop and AMC remained overwhelmingly favored.
But many of those favored stocks were off their highs. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rose 46% and Express added 21% on Friday. Virgin Galactic was up 5%, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) was flat, and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) reversed course to trade lower. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) fell 6% after a rally the prior session. 
Since the start of the week, Blackberry (TSX:BB) Ltd more than doubled to touch a peak of $36 on Wednesday before easing back to $20.39 on Friday. (TO) Silver continued a blistering rally.
Some companies that have been mentioned in the WallStreetBets forum are pouncing on the opportunity to raise capital.
Online brokers' restrictions were driven by the high concentration of risk in hot stocks and by increased clearinghouse capital and deposit requirements, Piper Jaffrey said.
Robinhood eased some restrictions on Friday, but was still not allowing purchases of fractional shares in GameStop and 12 other companies, meaning smaller investors must bet more to buy-in. The brokerage was also limited the number of shares any one account could hold, further hampering players with existing positions. 
London-based trading platform Freetrade disabled buy orders for U.S. stocks but will allow users to exit positions.
Noted short-seller Andrew Left, who runs Citron Research and sparked the slugfest with his call against GameStop, on Friday turned his back on publicly detailing companies' shortcomings, capping a week of intense backlash against him and others. [L1N2K41KD]
""When we started Citron, it was to be against the establishment, but now we've actually become the establishment,"" Left said. ""The Citron narrative is going to change and have a pivot.""
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) temporarily took down a popular Wall Street discussion group, Robinhood Stock Traders.
The affected companies have said little about the volatility in their shares. GameStop did not reply to multiple requests for comment. AMC, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) and Koss did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

AN EVENTUAL 'RACE FOR THE EXITS'?
The current battle could limit short-sellers' influence on some stocks, but high-flyers may eventually retreat from lofty valuations, analysts say. 
""You have some people on Reddit message boards who clearly know a bit about what they are doing, and a lot of people who are just following on,"" said David Starr, vice president of quantitative analysis at Simpler Trading.
""These moves ... can go a lot further than people can expect, but they end with a quick move back down. People race for the exits very, very quickly."" 
The chief executive of the London Stock Exchange said regulators should watch out for market manipulation.
Central bank and government stimulus have propelled stock markets to record highs in recent weeks, encouraging a wave of retail investors who pushed trading volumes to new heights.
The ranks of retail investors may have swelled in part because the coronavirus pandemic has left people stuck at home with extra savings.
Robinhood has been one of the hottest venues in the frenzy, but its sudden curbs on buying set off online protests as the firm tapped credit lines to ensure it could continue trading. 
Robinhood temporarily disabled a feature on its app that allows users to buy crypto securities instantly. The brokerage said it had raised more than $1 billion from existing investors.
A website on the short squeeze strategy set up by one WallStreetBets participant, http://isthesqueezesquoze.com/, told traders with Robinhood accounts to ""find a new broker asap,"" listing Vanguard, Ameritrade and Fidelity.

Both Ameritrade and  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) placed some restrictions on trade on Thursday. Fidelity says it has not limited trading in the stocks.

Investing.com -  The Dow closed lower Friday, suffering its worst weekly decline since October after a jolt of volatility swept through markets as the short-squeeze trade resumed even as trading platforms hampered retail traders.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.03%, or 620 points, but was down more than 700 points intraday. The S&P 500 was down 1.93%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2%.
Easing trading restrictions on several platforms prompting retailer traders to put the squeeze on short-sellers once again.  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) jumped 70% to lead the pack of  short-squeeze stocks including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC),  Express Inc  (NYSE:EXPR), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Nokia Corp ADR (NYSE:NOK) and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY).
The CBOE Volatility Index – or so-called fear gauge – jumped rose 9%, giving investors further reason to hit pause on stocks into month-end.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), meanwhile, fell 4% after it released  vaccine data showing its single-shot single-dose candidate demonstrated a 66% overall efficacy rate in preventing moderate to severe Covid-19.
Despite having a lower efficacy than established mRNA vaccines from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA), JNJ's vaccine was shown to be 85% effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalizations/death, which, are ""two primary drivers of the lockdowns/restrictions,"" BofA said in a note.
Top U.S. infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said the Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine news was ""very encouraging"" in controlling Covid-19, though added that the highly transmissible variants were a ""wake up call"" for the public.
Cyclical stocks including financials and energy led the broader market slump, with the latter getting hit from sluggish oil prices on fears prolonged Covid-19 restrictions will continue to hamper demand.
The broader sentiment on risk was also hurt by signs of ongoing slack in the recovery as the consumer spending fell for the second-straight, while the pace of inflation inched higher.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 0.2% last month, but economists suggest the spending will rebound as the reopening of the economy will boost services activity.
""[T]he recent soft patch in spending was driven by goods rather than services … the good news is that both sources of weakness - fiscal policy and COVID - are no longer an issue as we look ahead to Q1 and beyond,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Big tech also played a role in the day of selling on Wall Street as the Fab 5 sold off sharply. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded higher, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed more than 1% lower."
1470,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 04:05PM ET</span>",The stock market wars: U.S. lawmaker Ocasio-Cortez breaks it down,"By Makini Brice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A chat with U.S. Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew more than a million viewers overnight to a website best-known for video game players, where she dissected this week's headline-grabbing battle between Reddit online traders and hedge funds.
A champion of the progressive left, the 31-year-old New Yorker in the U.S. House of Representatives hosted a talk on Twitch https://www.twitch.tv/videos/892140641 about short-selling, lobbying dollars and a hot stock:  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME).
""For so many people at home that are seeing this happen, people were really feeling like everyday people were finally able to proactively organize and get back at the folks that have historically had all the marbles on Wall Street and forced one hedge fund into an existential crisis,"" said the lawmaker, known as ""AOC.""
A member of the House's powerful Financial Services committee, Ocasio-Cortez has a Twitch channel with one million followers and promoted the Thursday broadcast to her 12 million followers on Twitter. 
GameStop, a video game retailer with 5,000 branches, has become the face of a showdown between an army of retail investors who have bought shares of the stock and sent it sky-rocketing, and wealthy Wall Street hedge funds who bet shares of the stock would fall, and are being squeezed.
Ocasio-Cortez hosted Alexis Goldstein, a former Wall Street employee who now pushes for financial reform; Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit (and husband of tennis star Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB)); and video blogger The Stock Guy. They discussed the intricacies of option trading and the complicated role hedge funds play in markets. 
The U.S. government has struggled to educate the general public about the risks of stock trading. On Friday the White House referred questions about whose responsibility that was to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has scolded investors over the GameStop developments.
Many Americans have lingering resentment from the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, which caused millions of people to lose their jobs and their homes, Ocasio-Cortez said.
""A little over 10 years ago, all of us got screwed, frankly, in the recession, and so much of this moment too is that we never saw a single person who was responsible ... we didn't see anyone go to jail for that,"" she said.

1473,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 03:09PM ET</span>",Hedge Fund Pressure Lingers With Short Sellers’ Targets Rallying,"(Bloomberg) -- Trades associated with hedge funds were under pressure again in Friday’s stock selloff, though with less intensity than earlier in the week.
The most visible evidence was a rally in companies with the highest short interest, a basket of which climbed 2%, according to data compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS). Names that had burned bearish hedge funds, from  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). to AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc., bounced back after some brokerages lifted trading restrictions on the shares.
Elsewhere, an exchange-traded fund tracking the industry’s favorite stocks (GVIP) fell about 2%, roughly in line with the market.
While the pain paled in comparison with Wednesday, its persistence is a continuation of this week’s theme, in which professional investors have suffered at the hands of day traders banding together in chat rooms. Despite a rush to cut risky bets in a process known as degrossing, hedge fund selling has yet to reach levels that signal the cycle is over, according to data compiled from Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage unit.
“While we may not follow the same pattern this time, the main point is that several big days of degrossing are not always the ‘end’ of the period as degrossing usually persists, but typically in lesser magnitude, for several weeks to months after,” the firm wrote in a note. “Historically, there’s been continued active degrossing that occurs after the initial shock.”
With day traders waging war on heavily shorted stocks, professional speculators have been forced to dump holdings on the long side of their portfolios. Still, gross leverage, a measure of industry risk appetite that takes into account both bullish and bearish wagers, remained elevated, partly because the short side of the book kept swelling because of a rally in shares such as GameStop. At above 200%, leverage is near all-time highs,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) data show.
At Goldman, clients experienced the biggest one-day decrease in gross leverage on Thursday. Still, at 237%, leverage sat in the 96th percentile of a one-year range.
At JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), client degrossing also seemed limited, with four-week flows having yet to register as a 1 standard-deviation event. While the size of covering in highly shorted stocks would suggest it’s closer to an end, it isn’t clear that bears broadly have been exhausted, according to a JPMorgan note.
“The bigger risk seems to be where the recent long selling that started in earnest this week has to persist for a while longer,” JPMorgan wrote. “The fact that this is not occurring during a broader market weakening in the macro backdrop makes it harder to gauge how much further this should go.”
Industry titans including Point72 Asset Management, D1 Capital and Melvin Capital have been bruised this month as retail traders have driven up the price of popular hedge fund shorts. The losses seen over the last few days may rank as among the worst in some of the managers’ careers.
To Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, the endurance of pros at some level depends on how long these growing groups on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum will hang on to their strategy of wagering on the heavily-shorted stocks.
“It’s almost like it’s a game to them -- where can they get in and stick it to Wall Street,” Fernandez said. “If this grows then in order to cover these shorts, a lot of these people are going to have to start selling some of their more liquid holdings.”
With hedge funds’ favorite stocks heading for the worst week since October and most-shorted shares poised for the most painful month for short sellers, existential questions may arise for some in the hedge fund industry, according to Christopher Grisanti, chief equity strategist at MAI Capital Management.
“The market was freaked out because they were unclear about these hedge funds and what their cash needs were,” Grisanti said. “That’s when the market gets concerned there would be a spillover to more widely held stocks but I don’t think that is long lasting.”

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>",Shareholders create coalition to pressure Exxon for change,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - More than 135 investors managing more than $2 trillion are forming a coalition to push  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) into making sweeping changes including refreshing its board and focusing more on energy transition, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The group, which includes pension funds, faith-based investors as well traditional money managers, came together in the two months since two activist investors called on Exxon to cut costs, invest in more profitable drilling and clean energy,
the people said.
The coalition worries that Exxon may not grasp the full extent of shareholder concern and believes the company must take more forceful action now, one of the sources said.
Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Engine No. 1, a investment firm based in San Francisco, this week formally launched a proxy fight that it announced in early December. It nominated four directors to Exxon's board and is pushing the company, valued at $195 billion, to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and invest more in clean energy.
Engine No. 1 said Exxon needs independent board members ""to ensure a clean break from a strategy and mindset that have led to years of value destruction."" Its campaign is being backed by the California State Teachers Retirement Fund. Exxon has been speaking with Engine No. 1 since December.
Additional pressure is coming from New York-based hedge fund DE Shaw which also wants to the company to preserve its dividend by cutting spending but has stayed out of the limelight.
The company has signaled some willingness to make changes and its stock price has climbed 12% this month. It announced an 87 cent per share dividend this week, keeping the payout unchanged from the fourth quarter. 

Exxon will report earnings next week.

Investing.com --  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) aren't the only hot stocks on Friday.  Novavax  Inc (NASDAQ:NVAX) jumped 65% after its Covid-19 vaccine candidate showed 89.3% effectiveness in a U.K. trial.
That compares to the 72% efficacy shown in a U.S. trial of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccine candidate. Shares of J&J fell 4.6%. J&J said its candidate showed less effectiveness in trials outside the U.S.
Still, the prospect of two more vaccines coming to market soon should be good news for markets in general, though they weren't acting like it on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 600 points as of midday.

1497,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>",Germany's financial regulator chief leaves in wake of Wirecard,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Felix Hufeld will leave the helm of Germany's financial watchdog BaFin after coming under pressure for failing to spot wrongdoing ahead of the collapse of the payments company Wirecard.
""The Wirecard scandal has revealed that Germany's financial supervision needs a reorganization,"" the finance ministry said in a statement.
The acknowledgement of problems was a fresh indictment of Germany's supervision of a company that began by processing payments for gambling and pornography before becoming a star of ""fintech"" - financial technology - and finally Germany's biggest fraud case.
The finance ministry said the decision to replace Hufeld was mutual and came ahead of the results of a ministry examination of a restructuring of the agency to be presented next week.
Calls for Hufeld's resignation came to a boil on Thursday after BaFin reported one of its employees to state prosecutors on suspicion of insider trading linked to Wirecard, shortly before the firm folded.
Hufeld said in the ministry statement that BaFin had grown in significance and relevance during his six years as president. ""Now there are other tasks to tackle,"" he said, wishing his successor the best.

BaFin declined to comment further.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials warned against illegal ""manipulative trading activity"" and said they were working closely with other regulators to monitor the situation after a wild week of trading during which an army of small investors have driven a dramatic squeeze of Wall Street hedge funds in shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other hot companies.
""The Commission will closely review actions taken by regulated entities that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade certain securities,"" the SEC said on Friday, following a statement earlier in the week it was monitoring market volatility.
Online broker Robinhood earlier in the week placed disputed trading restrictions on certain shares, drawing ire from lawmakers and scrutiny from regulators. The firm had eased restrictions on Friday.

""Our core market infrastructure has proven resilient under the weight of this week’s extraordinary trading volumes. Nevertheless, extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence,"" the SEC said on Friday.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 10:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Italy seeks to halve Monte Paschi legal claims to 5 billion euros - sources,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Valentina Za
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Treasury is working to halve 10 billion euros ($12 billion) in legal claims facing Monte dei Paschi by dismissing some and settling others, including 3.8 billion euros in requests from the bank's former top investor, sources close to the matter said.
Monte dei Paschi's (MPS) raft of legacy legal disputes following decades of mismanagement are hampering Rome's efforts to re-privatise the loss-making bank which it rescued in 2017.
Time is running out for Italy to address MPS's woes by finding a buyer. A change at the helm of UniCredit has stranded talks over a possible tie-up with Italy's No.2 bank.
The Treasury has been studying for months ways to free MPS from its legal risks and resolve a case which has come to symbolise Italy's long-running banking crisis.
To be able to cut its 64% stake in MPS, Italy still needs to find a solution for the 5 billion euros in residual risks.
Rome is now focusing on ways to sidestep the fact that the bank would be held liable with whoever took them on under a joint-liability rule in Italian law, the three sources said.
The plan currently under consideration entails a guarantee scheme based on insurance and re-insurance accords involving state export agency SACE and other private players, they said.
MPS would outsource the handling of the claims to another state-owned firm, Fintecna, given its experience in legal disputes.
CASH AND SHARES
If that plan doesn't work, the government would revert to a previous scheme where the legal risk itself would be spun off to another, unspecified entity, a source said.
Before that, Rome is working with MPS to help it to settle the claims from its former top shareholder, local foundation Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the sources said.
The Fondazione MPS has seen its wealth evaporate and its controlling stake in the bank reduced to virtually zero after backing a string of cash calls at MPS in recent years.
Two of the sources said the foundation has so far rejected offers from MPS to accept around 70 million euros in cash in return for dropping the claims.
MPS has said it believes it can fight those claims because they are based on decisions taken when the foundation held 49% of the bank's capital and named half its directors.
The two sources said the idea was now to also offer shares and not just cash. MPS holds treasury shares equivalent to 3% of its capital for a current market value of 35 million euros.
The foundation has repeatedly denied any formal talks are ongoing.
The Treasury is confident the accord with Fondazione MPS and other settlements, as well as dismissals, can broadly halve the initial figure, the sources said.

MPS' capital ratios are set to breach minimum requirements this quarter. MPS said on Thursday it would look at a 2.5 billion euro cash call if it can't seal a merger. ($1 = 0.8241 euros)

1512,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 09:41AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens Sharply Lower as GameStop, AMC Surge; Dow Down 373 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened markedly lower on Friday as battle resumed between an army of bullish retail traders determined to squeeze a selection of short positions held by Wall Street hedge funds.
GameStop (NYSE:GME), the retailer of video games and related hardware that has been the chief battleground between the two sides, surged 83% to $354.35 as Robinhood eased trading restrictions on that and other names. The brokerage synonymous with the new generation of retail traders had drawn ire from its users in restricting their ability to buy the stock on Thursday, an action that allowed shorts to cover their position under less pressure. 
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), another stock subject to an intense short squeeze, rose 54%.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 373 points, or 1.2%, at 30,230 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.0%. All three indices are on course for their worst weekly loss since October, in part due to hedge funds' need to liquidate in order to meet margin calls on short positions elsewhere.
The bulls were unfazed by a statement from the Securities and Exchanges Commission saying that it ""is closely monitoring and evaluating the extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices over the past several days.""
""Extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence,"" it added. 
An illustration of how distorted price formation has become is that GameStop's price, which hit an intraday high of $411 at the open, was more than twice the 'bull case' scenario target price outlined in a research note published only two weeks ago by GMEdd.com Research, which turned bullish on the stock as long ago as 2019. 
Other squeezed stocks also rose sharply, with Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) rising 50%, Express (NYSE:EXPR) rising 33% and Naked Brands (NASDAQ:NAKD) rising 24%. BlackBerry  (NYSE:BB) stock and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock both gained 10%.
Sentiment wasn't helped by figures showing that personal spending in the U.S. fell for a second straight month in December. The 0.2% drop was smaller than expected but November's data was revised to show a larger decline of 0.7%.
Elsewhere, it was a big day for biotech, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock fell 4.1% after announcing its single-dose vaccine candidate had only 66% efficacy in preventing the Covid-19 disease.  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose 50% after a trial of its experimental Covid-19 drug in the U.K. showed 89% efficacy. The news is particularly important because the U.K. is home to a strain of Covid-19 that spreads more quickly and may be significantly more deadly than the original strain.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) ADRs fell 0.4%, paring losses after it received partial authorization from the European Union's drug regulators for its Covid-19 vaccine. Germany had said on Thursday it won't administer the Astra jab to over-65s, due to insufficient data in its trial results."

""As of today, Citron Research will no longer be publishing what can be considered as short-selling reports. The Citron narrative is going to change and have a pivot,"" Left said in the video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPoVv7oX3mw
The decision to stop publishing short-selling research comes days after Citron abandoned its bet against GameStop after the video game retailer's value soared almost tenfold in a fortnight.
Earlier during the week, Left shorted GameStop when it traded around $40, expecting it to halve in value, but was later forced to cover Citron's position.

""When we started Citron, it was to be against the establishment, but now we've actually become the establishment,"" Left said on Friday.

The tug-of-war has generated extreme high trading volumes all week, culminating in the decision of various online brokerages to restrict trading in a handful of particularly hot stocks - notably video games and hardware retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) and movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) - on Thursday. 
The restrictions triggered intense anger among retail traders, many of whom interpreted them as evidence of a system rigged against them by high finance. The brokerages responded mainly by citing margin and capital requirements from their clearing houses. Many of this week's movements have been amplified by the use of options and other forms of leverage; the high volatility has triggered big and frequent adjustments to margin requirements from clearing houses.
The brokerage attracting the most censure was Robinhood, whose commission-free trading platform has become synonymous with the retail day-trader community. It was accused of putting the interests of its hedge fund backer and trading partner Citadel ahead of those of its customers. Citadel - which helped rescue Melvin Capital, a hedge fund squeezed out of its short position on GameStop, earlier this week -  denied any impropriety. according to reports. "

(Reuters) - Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) and partner Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd said on Friday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has extended the review period for their experimental Alzheimer's disease treatment by three months.
Biogen's shares rose 8% premarket as the FDA extension raised some hopes that the drug may still be approved, after a panel of experts to the FDA voted against the drug in November.
""Our key takeaway is that if the FDA would have wanted to reject the drug, we would have heard the decision by now,"" said Truist analyst Robyn Karnauskas.
An FDA approval would make the drug, aducanumab, the first new treatment for Alzheimer's in decades and the first that appears to be able to slow progression of the fatal, mind-wasting condition that affects millions of people.
The road to getting a regulatory nod for the drug has been rocky, with the companies scrapping two studies of the therapy in March 2019, and reversing that decision a few months later.
The expert panel to the FDA had voted ""no"" to three questions related to whether a single successful large trial of aducanumab was enough evidence of the drug's effectiveness given the clear failure of a second large study.
The FDA is not obligated to follow the recommendations of the panel, but usually does.

The agency will now decide on the marketing application for aducanumab by June 7. Biogen submitted the drug's marketing application to the FDA in July 2020.

BlackBerry and other heavily shorted stocks have soared in the past few days as traders organizing on social media platforms such as Reddit took on the hedge funds making bets against them. The stock sales represent one of the first examples of company executives cashing out on the frenzy. 
The executives sold their holdings on Jan. 20 at prices ranging from $12.63 to $13.01, nearly double what the stock had been trading at a week earlier. 
BlackBerry shares climbed as high as $28.77 in New York on Wednesday and ended trading on Thursday at $14.65.
Chief Financial Officer Steve Rai sold almost 33,000 shares, his entire position in the company, according to a filing made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January 21, in a trade valued at $428,731. 
Mark Wilson, the company's chief marketing officer, sold 78,500 shares, worth $991,455, according to a filing. 
Billy Ho, who leads divisions within Blackberry (TSX:BB), sold $259,000 of shares. 
All of the executives have sold stock periodically over the past year. The disposals at the start of the Reddit-driven rally represent the largest for the executives in the last year, according to filings. 
""The BlackBerry executives traded during an open trading window, as permitted under company policy, and all of our executives continue to have strong equity-based incentives through our long-term equity program,"" a BlackBerry spokeswoman said in an email.

BlackBerry did not make any of the executives available for comment.

The company recorded $871.2 million in quarterly sales of the COVID-19 therapy, bamlanivimab, benefiting from the U.S. government's move to stock up on the drug for emergency use. Mizuho analysts had expected the drug to bring in sales of $813 million. 
The company's COVID-19 therapy belongs to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies and has been authorized for use in the United States in patients who are at risk of serious illness from the infection.
Sales of key Lilly drugs in the quarter beat expectations as high demand helped offset pricing pressures from rebates or after-market discounts to health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers. 
Sales of diabetes drug Trulicity rose 24% to $1.50 billion, beating estimates of $1.39 billion, according to seven analysts polled by Refinitiv. 
Sales of cancer treatment Alimta also grew 23% to $652.7 million, trouncing estimates of $560 million. 
The company lowered its 2021 earnings forecast to between $7.10 and $7.75 per share from its prior forecast of between $7.25 and $7.90, citing higher investments. It, however, kept its sales and adjusted profit forecasts unchanged. 
Net earnings rose to $2.12 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $1.50 billion, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.75 per share, beating estimates of $2.35 per share. 

Overall sales rose 21.7% to $7.44 billion.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",U.S. COVID vaccine hopeful using Gates Foundation cash to prepare for human trial,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Scientists who normally focus on fixing defective genes said on Friday that up to $2.1 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will help them move their COVID-19 vaccine candidate toward 2021 human trials.
Harvard University scientist Luk Vandenberghe and University of Pennsylvania gene therapy head James Wilson said primate safety and efficacy tests have proven promising for their single-dose candidate, targeted for room-temperature storage. 
""We believe there is real potential,"" Vandenberghe said in an interview. ""That being said, we're not naive. There's 300 vaccines racing towards the door and biology is complex.""
Their candidate relies on an adeno-associated virus (AAV), deemed harmless to humans, to deliver DNA fragments from the new coronavirus, telling human cells to make a protein that provokes an immune response.
AAVs are already used in gene therapies sold by Novartis, including its $2.1 million-per-patient Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy. The Swiss company's gene therapy unit is backing the project with technical assistance and supply.
Other COVID-19 vaccines use viral vectors, too, though AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University's shot, Russia's Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-dose candidate rely on so-called adenoviruses to transport coronavirus DNA.
Gates Foundation money will support more pre-clinical tests ahead of a overseas safety trial in a still-undisclosed location where vaccines are not broadly available, Vandenberghe, who runs Mass General Brigham hospital's Grousbeck Gene Therapy Center in Boston, said. 
Though previously unused in approved vaccines, he is optimistic AAVs will be safe, since only tiny amounts are needed compared to what is required for gene therapies that have been given to many patients.
While he predicts every approved COVID-19 vaccine dose available through 2022 will see use, Vandenberghe acknowledged his group's success also hinges on finding a deep-pocketed partner with vaccine experience to bankroll large-scale production.

""We've already invested more than $10 million,"" he said. ""If indeed we want to meet the time lines we were just talking about, this needs a commercial larger vaccine player to be accelerated, like an AstraZeneca for Oxford's.""

1525,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 07:03AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Down 153 Pts; Meme Stocks Volatility Returns,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading lower Friday, with the week’s volatile trading, sparked by retail traders’ activism, set to continue.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 153 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.6%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 124 points, or 1%. 
The main U.S. equity indices are on course for their worst week since the end of October, amid heightened volatility spurred by speculative trading from retail investors. 
The week’s selloff had a break Thursday after several online brokers, including the popular site Robinhood, took steps to curb the deliberate buying of heavily-shorted names.
However, these hot stocks, such as GameStop (NYSE:GME), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), have rallied in premarket trading after Robinhood said it will allow limited buying on Friday.
The problem is if the likes of GameStop continue to soar, it may result in hefty losses at the hedge funds which have shorted these companies, forcing them to sell other securities to raise cash.
Robinhood itself has been forced to raise more than $1 billion of additional cash from investors, as the stock market’s central clearing hub demanded large sums of collateral given the extreme volatility.
Aside from the drama surrounding these so-called Meme stocks, the earnings season continues Friday, as heavy equipment maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), oil major  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), drug maker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and industrial conglomerate Honeywell (NYSE:HON) all reported before the bell.
In Washington, investors will continue to focus on the passage of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill through Congress, as some Republican lawmakers question the size of the package.
Economic data due for release Friday includes personal income and personal spending for December, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and the Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey at 10 AM ET.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, boosted by upcoming supply cuts from Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter of oil in the world, as well as falls in U.S. crude stockpiles.
Saudi Arabia is set to cut output by 1 million barrels per day in February and March in an attempt to balance a market hit by travel restrictions as the globe battles a rise in coronavirus cases, while U.S. oil inventories dropped last week by the most since July, to their lowest level since March.
U.S. Crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $52.62 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $55.59. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.5% to $1,869.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2142.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 06:55AM ET</span>",Global funds raise equity allocations to 11-month high,"By Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds recommended increasing equity allocations to the highest in a year, saying stock prices were likely to rise or stay around current levels in the next three months, while they lowered suggested bond holdings, Reuters polls showed.
Those recommendations came as the S&P 500 index slumped into negative territory for the year on Wednesday as U.S. stocks suffered their biggest one-day percentage drop in three months.
Fund managers and chief investment officers in the U.S., Europe, Britain and Japan in the Jan. 12-29 Reuters asset allocation poll recommended raising equity holdings over 2 percentage points from December to average 49.0% - the highest since February 2020.
That marks the third consecutive increase in proposed equity allocations since October when that average had dropped to over a decade-low level.
When asked about the likely path for stock prices over the next three months, nearly 90% of 26 respondents said they would either rise or remain around current levels. 
""We see some upside for the year. Markets are now pricing in the best possible world: earnings re-acceleration and economic rebound,"" said Pascal Blanqué, group chief investment officer at Amundi. 
""But for the coming quarters we see some challenges — vaccination delays, severe lockdowns hitting the economy — that could prevent an upside. A deceleration is possible, given valuations are already expensive, so, it is a situation that deserves some caution.""
U.S. Treasury yields have fallen as investors turned cautious on worries about the strength of the economic recovery and the Federal Reserve left its policy unchanged.
Underpinning those concerns, there is a high risk a resurgence in COVID-19 infections could derail the world economy, a separate Reuters poll of around 500 economists showed. [ECILT/WRAP]
UPWARD PRESSURE ON BOND YIELDS?
But the latest allocations poll suggested bond holdings - a key gauge of caution - be reduced to account for 40.1% of the model global portfolio, down from December's 41.6%, the lowest since March 2019. 
That average has plunged over 5 percentage points since October, underscoring investors' increasing risk appetite.
Nearly two thirds of 26 respondents who responded to another question said major sovereign bond yields would remain around current levels over the next three months while nine said they would rise. None expected them to fall. 
""The direction for bond yields over the next three months is a difficult call,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum. ""If the pandemic were to heighten and the vaccine programmes stall then investors could increase their weighting to safe-haven assets.
""Equally, if equities continue to rally on further euphoria from additional vaccines then they could rise fairly rapidly as investors embrace further risk in their portfolios. We might see movements either way but overall they stay at their current levels.""
Most fund managers cited the vaccines' efficacy and excessive optimism as the top risks to their recommendations and said further policy support and dips in stock prices would be opportune moments to increase exposure to risky assets. 
""We should think about 2021 as divided into two phases. First, would be the expectations of a V-shaped recovery and other underlying conditions that might be more favourable to risky assets in the short run,"" noted the investment team at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments Partners.

""Later in the medium-long run, when the world normalization is seen closer and more tangible, the more important risk to financial markets comes from rates moving higher quicker and more than expected, features that are less market friendly.""

GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings slumped on Thursday after Robinhood Markets Inc and Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) restricted trading in several social-media darling stocks that had soared this week, with trading platform Robinhood later saying it would remove some restrictions on Friday. 
GameStop dropped 44%, but the stock remains up almost 900% since Jan. 12. AMC's 57% drop reduced its gain since Jan. 21 to around 190%. Also falling heavily were Blackberry (TSX:BB), Koss and Express, which Robinhood also restricted trading in.
Wallstreetbets has ballooned in recent days to 4.8 million members. Many of those people have piled into stock heavily bet against by professional short sellers, overwhelming the professionals and forcing them over the past week to abandon their positions with heavy losses.
AMC, GameStop, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Blackberry are currently the most discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets, eclipsing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has long dominated chatter amongst its members. AMC and GameStop account for over 25% of recent comments on Wallstreetbets, with Nokia accounting for over 20%.
Discussion of GameStop has receded over the past week as a proportion of overall comments, although the sentiment of comments about the company remains overwhelmingly positive. Swaggystocks calculates sentiment by analyzing individual words used in posts and comments.

1532,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 06:07AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Game Is on Again as Brokers Lift Restrictions on GameStop & Co.,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The game is on again.
As of Friday, Robinhood – the trading app where much of the extraordinary action in heavily-shorted stocks is concentrated – is again allowing two-way flow, having stopped its clients from buying individual stocks such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) for a day on Thursday.
As a result, the so-called Meme Stocks are all sharply higher in premarket, as retail traders ramp up their buying again.
But Thursday’s events have put a sharp focus on one stock that isn’t even trading yet – Robinhood itself. The brokerage aims to go public this year, but it will first need to see how much reputational damage it can undo after forcing its clients to stop making what was, for many, their most profitable trade – squeezing GameStop.
The action was greeted with howls of outrage from its customers and drew condemnation from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, none of whom ever saw a bandwagon they didn’t want to jump on.
In a blog post on Thursday, Robinhood had explained the move as a risk management issue:
“As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment.
“These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously,” it added, with just a hint of self-righteousness. 
The core of that argument is that Robinhood didn’t have enough collateral to fund the bets its clients were making. The argument has some credibility, however, insofar as the sheer volume of trading generated in this week's frenzy far surpassed even what Robinhood might have budgeted for.  That problem appears to have been eased by a hurried capital raise of $1 billion and the drawing down of hundreds of millions of dollars more in bank credit lines. Hence the lifting of restrictions today.
But to others, the brokerage’s move was a betrayal of trust, designed to benefit the hedge funds on the other side of its clients’ trades. As a chorus of critics – including retail trading guru Dave Portnoy – pointed out, this argument might have been more convincing had Robinhood not banned all buying of GameStop, not just margin-based buying.
“You couldn’t buy anything period,” Portnoy said via Twitter. “They forced the price to crash so hedgefunds could cover their shorts.  There will need to be a full investigation into the events of today.  Phone records, surveillance, the works.”
What makes for a particularly bad look is the close working relationship Robinhood has with Citadel, one of the hedge funds that rescued Melvin Capital – a prominent GameStop short – with a $2.75 billion bailout earlier this week. 
Robinhood, which makes no money from commissions on trading, instead makes it on selling its order flow to others, including Citadel. In December,  it paid $65 million to settle SEC charges that it had hidden this relationship from customers and violated its duty of providing customers with the best execution possible.
“Robinhood provided misleading information to customers about the true costs of choosing to trade with the firm,” said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division said at the time.  “Brokerage firms cannot mislead customers about order execution quality.”
A fresh investigation and fresh charges would likely generate a heavy fine and risk even more serious reputational damage for the brokerage most closely associated with the disruption of U.S. financial markets. As one Twitter wag succinctly summed up on Thursday: ""Did Robinhood just short its own IPO?"""

Inflows in the last three months soared to a record $272 billion. U.S. small cap firms, at the centre of amateur trading, saw their second-largest inflow ever, of $29 billion.
Crowds of solo traders herd buying, pumping up and squeezing out hedge funds from their bets against ailing companies, have shaken financial markets in the past week, with analysts worrying about the systemic implications of a retail speculative bubble bursting. 
BofA analysts compared this new trend, often described as a populist market revolt, to the 2011 ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement against financial inequality.

(Reuters) - European stocks were lower on Friday and on course for their worst weekly performance since October, as concerns around the slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines mount and a retail trading frenzy gripped Wall Street this week.
The benchmark STOXX 600 index dropped 1.0%, set to erase all of January's gains and end the week down 2.4%
London's blue-chip FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX fell by similar amounts, while on Wall Street, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures shed almost 1% each [MKTS/GLOB].
The U.S. stock market, already looking overvalued after a stimulus-led rally last year, has been jolted this week by steep gains in heavily shorted stocks, including Gamestop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) after retail traders piled into them. 
Concerns around the potential economic damage from a new strain of the coronavirus in Europe and delays to vaccine rollouts have also dented sentiment in the past few days.
""We're postponing the recovery story a little bit because of the lockdown measures and challenges for European growth,"" said Joseph Little, global chief strategist at HSBC Global Asset Management, London.
""I'm still optimistic on parts of Europe which have lagged rather badly, economically and in markets. They could begin to perform as the cyclical catch-up becomes more important.""
However, economy-linked stocks of banks, insurers, miners and oil & gas companies were among the worst hit this week as economic data pointed to a stuttering European economy due to tighter restrictions. 
Official data showed Germany grew by just 0.1% in the fourth quarter as a second wave of coronavirus cases almost stopped Europe's largest economy in its tracks after a surging third-quarter recovery.
Meanwhile in France, the economy contracted much less than expected at the end of last year.
In a busy day for earnings, Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) jumped 8.1% after reporting fourth-quarter core earnings ahead of market estimates on the back of strong sales of 5G equipment.
Swedish fashion retailer H&M slipped 4.0% after its profit plummeted in the full year through November and warned that the pandemic would hit it hard in the current quarter.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) rose 1.6% after it said a strong fourth quarter helped it post better-than-expected 2020 group operating profit and that it was optimistic for 2021.

European earnings season has been largely positive. Of the 8% of STOXX 600 companies that have reported so far, 78% have topped beaten-down profit estimates, as per Refinitiv IBES data.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 04:32AM ET</span>",From broker notes to memes: how the stock market went viral,"By Colm Fulton
Stockholm (Reuters) - ""Stocks only go up"", concludes a video montage of televangelists, dancing Ghanaian pallbearers, and Donald Trump's personal pastor repeatedly saying she can hear the ""sound of victory"".
The tongue-in-cheek meme, designed to characterise bullish stock market sentiment when news of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) BioNTech’s successful COVID-19 vaccine broke, has been viewed more than 1 million times on Instagram and Twitter. 
Far more wide-reaching than broker research notes, memes have become central to a new form of financial literacy - or illiteracy, depending on your viewpoint - behind the frenzied boom in retail trading of cryptocurrencies or stocks on platforms like Robinhood.
Using images from pop culture overlaid with market commentary, they're being praised – and vilified – for making trading entertaining and game-like. 
""So many more people are getting into the stock market through Robinhood and bitcoin, so everyone is now in on the jokes about flipping your stimulus money or Fed intervention sending stocks up,"" said Lit, the moniker of the man behind Litquidity, which produced the ""sound of victory"" meme. 
He set Litquidity up four years ago, using memes to entertain young finance workers, but its Instagram following - the ""litfam"" - has doubled to around half a million since last March. 
Lit, who works in finance and prefers not to go by his real name, is now making money from his sideline, attracting sponsorship from companies eager to reach a young audience with disposable income. 
Litquidity's recent 30 under 30 list of young people in finance - playing on the more established Forbes magazine's annual ranking - was sponsored by trading apps and an eye wear brand. Lit has also posted a meme in partnership with payments app Revolut.
AUDIENCE REACH
For meme sponsors the potential audience was already huge but it has grown even further in the past few days. 
Website Reddit's wallstreetbets page, which this week picked the pockets of seasoned short sellers by encouraging a buying frenzy on GameStop (NYSE:GME), added two million followers in the last 48 hours. 
On video sharing app TikTok, where 85% of users are under 35, there have been 5 billion and 1.4 billion views for #sidehustle and #finance, respectively. 
Irish day trader Damian McVeigh said that social media content and memes helped pique his interest in finance. 
""I always thought it was dry, but internet content livens it up. There's less of a barrier because of it,"" McVeigh - a quantity surveyor by trade - said. 
This time last year McVeigh had limited interest in financial markets, but, after getting bored during lockdown, he now has a portfolio worth a quarter of his annual salary and a YouTube channel where he blogs about companies. 
Trading app eToro grew its user base by around a third in 2020, with $1.5 billion invested on the platform, a 400% increase from 2019 as stuck-at-home punters splashed their cash. 
However, critics say turning finance into entertainment can create a carnival atmosphere which promotes risk-taking by inexperienced traders. ""Memes or videos of people waving dollars around are a similar culture expression of joy as risk,"" said Dr Cesar Albarran-Torres, a media lecturer at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia. 
Albarran-Torres said internet chatter encourages uninitiated people to gamble on the stock market, adding: ""It makes money into a video game."" However, many social media users see the retail traders as worthy underdogs in a David v Goliath battle against established hedge funds who are used to getting their own way. 
Twitter personality Liz Franczak tweeted: ""the free market is when you stop reddit from trading meme options,"" in reference to trading halts on stocks popular with Reddit's wallstreetbets. 
Top behavioural economist Professor Colin Camerer told Reuters that the three million strong Reddit traders ""are all in a stadium cheering together"". 
""Social media makes it possible to coordinate these mass actions,"" Camerer said, adding that it will be interesting to see how the dynamics of this new financial phenomenon play out when some individuals in the group want to sell.
Regulation is another potential threat. 
Lit, however, distances himself from accounts which recommend buying individual stocks. He says his role as meme creator is more akin to an observer or satirist. 

""I like to caution at times when things seem very exuberant, to signal that this might not end well,"" he added.

""This transformational transaction brings together two highly complementary global businesses with a shared commitment to an Open Access philosophy, working in partnership with customers,"" LSE chief executive David Schwimmer said in a statement. 
The market for financial information has exploded with the advent of computer-driven trading, triggering a flurry of takeovers as companies seek to create one-stop shops to serve clients and get an edge over traditional rivals in supplying data, dubbed the ""new oil"".
The European Commission, which oversees competition policy in the 27-nation EU, said earlier this month its antitrust investigation found a number of concerns about the Refinitiv deal but that they would be addressed by ""remedies"", which include the sale of LSE's Borsa Italiana, which runs the Milan stock exchange and MTS bond trading platform.

1541,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 04:18AM ET</span>","U.S. to Press Taiwan, TSMC to Resolve Auto Chip Crunch","(Bloomberg) -- Biden administration officials have called an ad-hoc meeting next week with Taiwan government and industry officials, during which they’re expected to pressure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and its peers to ramp up the supply of vital chips to American automakers.
The virtual conference scheduled for Thursday U.S. time would be the most high-profile meeting between newly appointed Biden administration officials and their counterparts from Taipei. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matt Murray and Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce Richard Steffens are scheduled to confer with Taiwan Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua, people familiar with the matter said. Executives from the island’s largest chipmakers including TSMC and MediaTek Inc. will also attend a discussion centered on resolving a global shortage of auto chips, they said.
The meeting is intended to forge closer ties between the two sides, the ministry said in a statement to Bloomberg News, without elaborating on the agenda or final attendance list. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing Friday he wasn’t aware of the meeting, but reiterated that Beijing “opposes official interactions between the U.S. and China’s Taiwan region.”
Global carmakers such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. face potentially $61 billion of lost revenue for the year because they can’t secure enough of the chips that go into a plethora of vehicle parts. TSMC and other Taiwanese firms are among the world’s most sophisticated chipmakers and produce a significant portion of the semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops.
This week, TSMC vowed to reallocate capacity to support the global automotive industry. Some industry observers say the shortage stemmed from near-sighted planning and under-estimation of a post-Covid rebound in automobile demand, while others argue chipmakers are prioritizing higher-volume and more lucrative consumer electronics such as smartphones.
The quagmire reveals the risks for automakers like Ford and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) as vehicles become smarter and technologically more complex. Carmakers with more software and chip expertise are set to face a smoother ride, while those whose traditional strength in metal-bending are potentially more prone to supply hiccups.
The people familiar with the meeting details asked not to be identified talking about a private arrangement that has yet to be made public. A spokesperson for the U.S. State department declined to comment. Representatives for the U.S. Commerce Department, TSMC and MediaTek didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“We continue to engage with government officials as this remains a critical issue,” said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, the lobbyist for the Detroit-based automakers GM and Ford as well as the U.S. operations of Stellantis NV (formerly Fiat Chrysler). “We are grateful for the Biden administration’s ongoing assistance and hope it can continue as more key positions are filled.”
The meeting will take place as Biden’s administration signals strong backing for an island China claims as its own. The U.S. State Department this week urged China to engage in a dialogue with Taiwan and halt military pressure on the island, in an early nod of support for Taipei.
Disputes over Taiwan, which has been one of the biggest flash points between the U.S. and China since the Cold War, have returned to the fore as Washington steps up support for Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.

1542,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 03:49AM ET</span>",European Stocks Weaken; Activism Concerns Weigh,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Friday, with investors cutting positions given the uncertainty surrounding the populist trading movement.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.9%. 
Global stocks are set for their worst weekly slide in about three months, partly on the turmoil caused by small traders organizing over online forums, such as Reddit, to force hedge funds to reverse short positions on a series of stocks. This has resulted in these funds dumping other equity holdings in order to raise liquidity.
Popular online broker Robinhood, along with other brokerages, limited the trading ability of these retail traders for a time Thursday, but it stated that some restrictions will be lifted on Friday, raising fears that the volatility will resume.
This added to concerns about the slow rollout of vaccines in continental Europe, a region hard hit by the Covid-19 virus, which has culminated in a spat between the European Union and drugmakers over the distribution of limited supplies.
There was some good news on the subject, after biotech firm  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against the virus in its phase three clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom. 
In corporate news, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) stock rose 7.8% after the Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson reported strong fourth-quarter core earnings on the back of healthy sales of 5G equipment. 
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) stock rose 1.6% after the German carmaker beat 2020 profit expectations on the back of a strong fourth quarter, and provided optimistic guidance for the next year.
On the downside, fourth-quarter results showing a marked deterioration in loan quality pushed BBVA (MC:BBVA) stock down 2.5% and led to losses across the rest of Eurozone banks. The Stoxx 600 Banks index fell 1.6%.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock dropped 1.1% after the troubled German bank announced plans to cut a further 10,000 jobs and close hundreds of branches.
French GDP shrank much less than expected at the end of last year, falling 1.3% in the final three months of 2020, compared with a forecast for a contraction of 4%. However, German and Spanish GDP both beat expectations, while German unemployment fell surprisingly sharply in January.
Oil prices largely stabilized Friday, as traders balanced concerns over weakening demand due to Covid-related travel restrictions against upcoming supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and falls in U.S. crude inventories, which  fell last week by the most since July, to their lowest level since March.
Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter of oil in the world, is set to cut output by 1 million barrels a day in February and March in an attempt to balance a market hit by travel restrictions.
U.S. crude futures traded flat at $52.34 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $55.31. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,846.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2117.

1543,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 03:27AM ET</span>",Bootmaker Dr. Martens Surges After $1.8 Billion London IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- British bootmaker Dr. Martens Plc jumped as much as 18% as it began to trade in London after owner Permira Holdings and other shareholders raised 1.3 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) in the U.K.’s largest domestic initial public offering since September.
The shares climbed 17% to 432.10 pence at 8:08 a.m. in London from the IPO price of 370 pence. The IPO priced 350 million existing shares at the top end of an initial range, the company said in a statement Friday. It values Dr. Martens at 3.7 billion pounds, which is more than 10 times the 300 million pounds Permira paid for the bootmaker in 2014.
Dr. Martens’ is the largest IPO in London by a U.K. company since online shopping emporium THG Plc raised 1.88 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Griggs family, which sold Dr. Martens to Permira, and employees and directors of the company also held shares in the company before the IPO. About 35% of the company’s shares are available for trading.
Shareholders can sell another 53 million shares if there’s enough demand, which would increase the size of the offering to 1.49 billion pounds.
Several other IPO candidates are taking advantage of a lockdown-fueled online shopping boom. Poland’s InPost SA, which operates automated parcel lockers, soared in its Amsterdam trading debut Wednesday, while virtual greeting-card company Moonpig Group Plc and used-car platform Auto1 Group SE are taking investor orders for public offerings.
The pandemic has accelerated the shift from brick-and-mortar stores to online portals, with physical stores increasingly forced to close down due to reduced footfall. Dr. Martens’ e-commerce platform brought in nearly a fifth of its revenue in the year ending March 2020, up from just 7% in 2015.
The company had secured cornerstone investments of 250 million pounds from BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., 100 million pounds from Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG) Plc and 75 million pounds from Merian Global Investors.
The deal gathered enough investor interest to cover all the shares on offer within about an hour of opening its order book. Dr. Martens accelerated the IPO timeline, closing its offering two days earlier than originally planned.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are joint global coordinators, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, BofA Securities,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and Royal Bank of Canada will be joint bookrunners in the event the offer proceeds. Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) & Co. is the company’s financial adviser.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 03:06AM ET</span>",Analysis: A suitable suitor? Carrefour admirers must court the Elysee Palace,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic, Dominique Vidalon, Sarah White and Pamela Barbaglia
PARIS (Reuters) - So what now for  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), forbidden from wedding its wealthy Canadian admirer, just as it needs to renovate? Will fate find a more suitable suitor, perhaps closer to home?
The retailer's proposed marriage to Alimentation Couche-Tard of distant Quebec was always likely to raise the hackles of France, fiercely protective of a favoured private-sector child.
Indeed when Carrefour boss Alexandre Bompard first met Couche-Tard Chairman Alain Bouchard face to face, on Jan. 8 in Paris, he made it clear a deal would never fly without sweeteners for the French government, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting. 
With the talks still hush-hush, Bompard flagged likely requirements, the sources said: guarantees to protect jobs, keeping the group's headquarters in France, retaining a local listing and several French seats on the combined group board. 
""Carrefour knew that there was no way Paris would let it be diluted in a bigger Canadian company and its identity disappear,"" one of the people said.
The deal, worth close to $20 billion, was killed off days later by French ministers who said the food sector was of strategic national importance. They rejected the advances of a company that operates gas stations and convenience stores across North America but is virtually unknown in France.
It leaves Carrefour, France's No.2 supermarket group, without the extra firepower to galvanise a turnaround plan Bompard is halfway through delivering, at a time when shares are 30% below where they were when he took the helm in July 2017. 
However, two financial sources familiar with Carrefour said the retailer expects a European bidder could elicit a friendlier response from France, and that this remained a possibility. 
The sources cited Spain's Mercadona, Germany's Metro and Dutch player Ahold Delhaize among potential fits. 
Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital, said even a tie-up with Britain's Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) could work as long as it gave the French some of the guarantees they have sought. 
Representatives at Mercadona and Metro were not immediately available for comment, and Ahold Delhaize declined to comment. Tesco said it would not comment on speculation. 
One of the sources, speaking of Carrefour's thinking, said the prospects of such a deal were increased by political alignment among EU members, and France's support for creating European champions to better compete with U.S. online retailers.
""But with a Canadian counterpart, why bother?"" the person added. ""It was easy to just shut the door and move on.""
Guarantees on the location of purchasing centres - ensuring some protection for French food suppliers - could also make a difference, one of the sources familiar with Carrefour said.
Carrefour makes about half its sales in France, though a third comes from other European locations, including Spain. 
A merger with a French rival is seen as unlikely by industry experts because of the likelihood of operational overlap and associated job losses.
DISCOUNT PRICE TAG?
Bompard may still have a strong hand to play on Carrefour's strategic direction. The well-connected executive, known to have President Emmanuel Macron's ear, has the backing of Carrefour's top shareholders, two people familiar with their thinking said. 
They include the Moulin Family, which owns department store chain Galeries Lafayette, Brazilian businessman Abilio dos Santos Diniz, and Groupe Arnault, the family holding of France's richest man and LVMH boss Bernard Arnault.
Union representatives, fearful Carrefour could wield the axe more easily under a foreign owner, even should some guarantees be given, say they are under no illusions that another deal could be on the horizon. 
""It's been a cold shower for everyone,"" said Sylvain Mace of the CFDT union. ""Employees have understood the message, that being sold off is an option. It's not Carrefour that ended the talks.""
Yet the French government's willingness to intervene in Carrefour's plans could also weigh on any future price tag, making a deal less attractive, according to Black of Shore Capital. 
""State-protected industries tend to lag in the end because they cannot attract the best talent or capital, not to say that Carrefour is wholly in this context,"" he said.
COUCHE-TARD'S CASH 
French officials make no apologies for their approach.
""Imagine if a foreign company wanted to buy the biggest employer in Germany, or Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in the United States, what would be the reaction of the German or U.S. governments?"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Les Echos newspaper. 
The extra resources offered by Couche-Tard would nonetheless have boosted Carrefour's e-commerce roll-out, a priority as it looks to retain an edge over Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on the groceries front. Bompard said in 2018 he would spend 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) to expand the group's global digital business by 2022. 
Couche-Tard had proposed to invest 3 billion euros over a five-year period. That would likely have targeted the online business, but could also have helped fund price cuts in the competitive French market, according to two sources close to the discussions between the companies.
A tie-up could also have accelerated the roll-out of smaller convenience stores - a format Bompard aims to focus on as the Carrefour's hypermarkets, which generate half of its French revenue, struggle. 
About a quarter of the group's roughly 200 hypermarkets in France were loss-making even before the COVID-19 crisis pushed shoppers to visit neighbourhood stores more frequently, according to unions. 
In 2019 comparable sales were down 2.1% at its French hypermarkets, contrasting with a 3.1% rise in revenue across the group, which reached 80.7 billion euros. 
Carrefour reports 2020 earnings on Feb. 18. 
Christian Nehme, head of retail in France for real estate agency Savills, said the Couche-Tard deal could have helped Carrefour push more into the convenience store market dominated by rival Casino Group.

""The Canadians are specialised in in-town small supermarkets with high margins,"" he added.

(Reuters) - Steep gains in shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other stocks this week have been described as populist market revolts. But among those out ahead are some of Wall Street's largest asset managers, which can realize gains both from their share stakes and from lending out stocks to short sellers. 
Other beneficiaries include market-makers and trading systems that profit from huge volumes.
Many investors have not yet realized their profits by selling shares, and some platforms could later face disillusioned retail customers who bought into the rally too late, said Larry Harris, a former chief economist for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and now a finance professor at the USC Marshall School of Business.
But for now, big, traditional investors that already held GameStop shares have the advantage, Harris said. ""Long institutions are the big winners,"" he said.
That contrasts with the short sellers who have bet against GameStop in expectations that the share price will fall, borrowing shares in hopes they can later buy shares at a lower price to repay their loans and pocket the difference. 
Shares of GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) shot up this week as they were pushed by traders on Reddit and other social media platforms, although they fell back on Thursday.
Hedge funds betting against the stocks were forced to cover their positions, costing them billions of dollars and adding fuel to the rally.
That was good for funds like the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund. It held 2 million shares of GameStop, according to a recent disclosure, worth close to $1 billion at GameStop's peak price of $482.95 on Thursday, before closing at $193.60. The stake would have been worth around $33 million at the start of January.
Asked if the fund might sell the shares now, a Fidelity spokesman said via e-mail that to protect fund shareholders, ""We do not disclose intent for any potential buy or sell decisions.""
Big asset managers would also have benefited from lending securities to short-sellers and others. Such activity generated $7.66 billion in revenue globally in 2020 according to DataLend. Top asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) has said its securities-lending revenue hit a record in 2020. A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.
As the price of GameStop rose so has the cost of borrowing its shares, partly as higher trading volumes made the shares harder to locate, said Sam Pierson, securities lending analyst for IHS Markit. Borrowers of GameStop now pay around 30% on an annualized basis, less than earlier this week but up from around 7% in early December.
Other beneficiaries of this week's rally was private equity firm Silver Lake, which took advantage of a 301% surge in struggling movie theater chain AMC's shares on Wednesday to convert $600 million in convertible notes into AMC shares.
Brokerages and market makers such as  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) and Citadel Securities LLC also stood to gain from higher-than-average volume. Volume on U.S. exchanges on Thursday was 19.58 billion shares, compared with the 14.86 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
A Citadel spokesman did not comment when asked about the trading's business impact on the firm. Citadel ""remains focused on continuously providing liquidity to our clients across all market conditions,"" he said.
A representative for Schwab did not comment on questions about the business impact of the trading.

""The higher the volume of trading the easier it is for them to make money,"" said Georgetown University professor James Angel, who studies market structure and regulation.

Airport Authority Hong Kong said in a statement it had raised $900 million in 10 year notes and $600 million in 30 year bonds, the longest paper it has issued.
The transaction was the second aviation deal in Hong Kong this week after Cathay Pacific raised $870 million in five year convertible bonds to help the airline shore up liquidity.
Demand for the 10 year notes reached $4.4 billion and the 30-year demand was $4.1 billion, the statement said. At those levels, the deal was 4.9 times and 6.8 times oversubscribed.
Final pricing was set with a yield of 1.71% for the 10 year note and 2.64% for the longer date bond, respectively 35 and 40 basis points tighter than initial guidance given by bookrunners earlier this week.
Construction of the airport's third runway is expected to be finished in 2022 and should be fully operational by 2024, according to the airport's website.

The project is estimated to cost HK$141.5 billion ($18.3 billion).

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",Column: Micro-bubbles just reinforce cheap money - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - While everyone was watching the hullabaloo over GameStop (NYSE:GME) and the related short selling pain this week, 10-year U.S. Treasury borrowing costs reversed briefly back below 1% - underlining why stocks are at such lofty levels in the first place.
The pandemic is far from over. Central banks are going nowhere. Government spending will ramp up again sooner rather than later and a vaccine-led recovery later this year is still seen as the most likely outcome - even if delayed and messier than thought a month ago. Digital and clean energy mega-trends roll on regardless.
That's been the thinking for months behind record high stocks. And it's not really been changed much by the frenzied game of cat-and-mouse in single stocks across trading apps, message boards and Wall St screens this week.
The question is whether this behaviour is a sign of wider excess with fallout elsewhere.
There may well be ripple effects from the explosion in the bombed-out stock prices of ailing firms - ironically many of them 'losers' in the digital disruption that's driven the tech stock rally of recent years.
Hedge fund losses from coordinated short squeezes by mostly semi-amateur online traders have raised some fear of selling in other areas to recoup losses, or distress seeping elsewhere. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) warned of dangerous precedents in this targeted herd trading sparking what they call fragility events - or ""a feedback loop between liquidity, volatility and investor flows"" - in dozens of other stocks with similar short interest and options market characteristics.
But so far the broad effect has been to lift already elevated stock market volatility, buoy implied risk in equity and the cost of hedging what are already considered expensive stocks. The VIX index of S&P500 implied volatility popped fleetingly above 30% on Wednesday for the first time since just before the U.S. election.
That in itself cools investor demand - even if it arguably also keeps overall exposure in check, and hence measures of aggregate equity holdings to swollen cash liquidity well below previous bubble levels.
But it doesn't appear to change much about why equity markets are where they are. Above-average volatility levels on their own were not enough prevent the market setting records for the final four months of last year.
The growth of margin debt has been a concern, as TS Lombard's Oliver Brennan points out, but less so when measured against the ultra-low cost of borrowing. 
And despite the biggest one-day S&P500 drop since October on Wednesday, there was no obvious dash for safe havens or even outsize directional bias in otherwise frenetic options market activity.

DAMNED IF IT DOES... 
Unless investors think the Federal Reserve or other central banks see this market 'fragility' as dangerous speculative froth that urgently requires removal of the fabled monetary punchbowl, the big picture is unlikely to change.
For one, Fed chief Jerome Powell seemed less than convinced what was happening on Reddit boards and Robinhood-type apps was anything to do with the central bank, appearing to give the whole issue a bodyswerve on Wednesday.
Powell stressed - as central banks around the world have insisted for decades - that asset prices were not part of the Fed's monetary policy mandate and probably shouldn't be either. He added that the link between low borrowing costs and stock prices was weaker than most people thought.
""If you raise interest rates and thereby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity in order to address asset bubbles and things like that, will that even help? Will it actually cause more damage?"" Powell said, adding that the Fed relies on 'macroprudential' tools when it comes to financial stability.
And for that reason the Fed is always damned if it does and damned if doesn't in moments of crisis. Whatever it may recommend about stock exposure and limits - or whatever other regulators or tax authorities may opt to do to address the chaos - the central bank is unlikely to change that monetary priority in the middle of a pandemic. 
Of course, that conclusion just rattles the cage of long-standing market bears who blame central banks for boosting liquidity into every stock market wobble for decades, underwriting market risk taking and stoking one of the biggest bubbles in history even in the country's biggest downturn since World War Two.
For them, the single stock frenzy is just another symptom. 
""Extreme speculative excess is all too apparent,"" wrote Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Albert Edwards on Thursday. ""The madness has now taken a novel twist with a new warrior class of retail investor roaming the equity savannah.""
""This farce is of the Fed's creation,"" he said, adding it should ""hang its head in shame.""
Others try to read deeper meaning into organised online trading campaigns - some see a generational battle between unaffiliated millennials angry at years of Wall St excess while their generation lost out during a decade of slow growth alongside easy money and high asset prices. Others talk of a victory for the 'democratisation' of markets against a closed cartel of big banks, brokers and funds.
All that said, shifting the profits from one side of Wall St to another hardly seems to even things out - as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s reported windfall from the GameStop surge attests. 
And yet, GameStop aside, a record high stock market along with deepening inequality has many economists worried that the ""Roaring '20s"" ahead may ape the barely-masked iniquities of the 1920s - and threaten similar results.
""The pandemic has shone a spotlight on the inequalities of vulnerability that permeate western societies,"" said HSBC economic advisor Stephen King. ""From the perspective of the 'left-behind' or the 'suddenly-vulnerable', a surging stock market offers cold comfort.""
What's certain is an unlikely move from the Fed to use monetary policy to stamp out speculative excess just now would bamboozle Wall St's two biggest shorts - those against the U.S. dollar and Treasury bonds. And problems there are of a whole different order.

1551,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 02:02AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; Uncertainty over Populist Movement,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening sharply lower Friday, with investors cutting positions given the uncertainty surrounding the populist trading movement.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.9%.
Global stocks are set for their worst weekly slide in about three months, partly on the turmoil caused by small traders organising over online forums, such as Reddit, to force hedge funds to reverse short positions on a series of stocks. This has resulted in these funds dumping other equity holdings in order to raise liquidity.
Retail traders had their trading ability restricted for a time Thursday as brokers, including popular online broker Robinhood, cut off their borrowing and restricted trading in some of the companies in the spotlight, such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).
However, Robinhood has since stated that some restrictions will be lifted on Friday, raising fears that the volatility will resume as the week draws to an end.
This added to concerns about the slow rollout of vaccines in continental Europe, a region hard hit by the Covid-19 virus, which has culminated in a spat between the European Union and drugmakers over the distribution of limited supplies.
There was some good news on the subject, after biotech firm  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against the virus in its phase three clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom. 
In corporate news, Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) reported strong fourth-quarter core earnings on the back of healthy sales of 5G equipment. 
Staying in the sector, Orange (PA:ORAN) ended talks late Thursday with  Iliad  (PA:ILD) on reaching a mobile-sharing network in France.
The main economic data releases in Europe Friday will be the German unemployment figures for January and the country’s fourth-quarter GDP number. 
Earlier, French GDP shrank much less than expected at the end of last year, falling 1.3% in the final three months of 2020, compared with a forecast for a contraction of 4%.
Oil prices largely stabilised Friday, as traders balanced concerns over weakening demand due to Covid-related travel restrictions with upcoming supply cuts from Saudi Arabia as well as falls in U.S. crude stockpiles.
Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter of oil in the world, is set to cut output by 1 million barrels per day in February and March in an attempt to balance a market hit by travel restrictions as the globe battles a rise in coronavirus cases, a battle made harder by the discovery of new contagious strains.
Additionally, U.S. oil inventories dropped last week by the most since July, to their lowest level since March.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $52.28 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $55.16. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,851.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2107.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 01:21AM ET</span>",Famed GameStop bull 'Roaring Kitty' is a Massachusetts financial advisor,"By Chris Prentice and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A YouTube streamer who helped drive a surge in the shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) is a 34-year-old financial advisor from Massachusetts and until recently worked for insurance giant MassMutual, public records and social media posts show.
Keith Patrick Gill is the person behind the Roaring Kitty YouTube streams which, along with a string of posts by Reddit user DeepF***ingValue, helped attract a flood of retail cash into GameStop, burning hedge funds who had bet against the company and roiling the broader market.
In his social media messages and videos, Gill repeatedly made the bull case for the beleaguered bricks-and-mortar retailer and shared images of his trading account profit on the stock, sparking a following of likeminded GameStop enthusiasts.
The saga has drawn the scrutiny of Congressional lawmakers, the White House, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is being probed by the New York Attorney General.
Reuters identified Gill as Roaring Kitty through a now dissolved New Hampshire-based company created by Gill, which shares the same name and email as his Roaring Kitty YouTube account, according to public records. The Daily Mail earlier on Thursday also identified Gill as both Roaring Kitty and DeepF***ingValue. 
Gill did not respond to multiple calls and messages seeking comment. MassMutual said in a statement on Thursday that Gill was no longer working for the company. It did not immediately respond to other questions posed by Reuters.
On his YouTube stream, Gill says he shares his approach to investing to help set viewers on the right path to build their own investment process. ""I don't provide personal investment advice or stock recommendations during the stream,"" he adds.
On Thursday evening, Kevin Gill - Gill's brother according to an online school profile and public records - appeared to verify that Roaring Kitty and DeepF***ingValue are one and the same, pointing to the Daily Mail story in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post and adding: ""Um yeah. So my brother is kinda famous now.""
Calls and an email to GameStop late Thursday were not answered. The company has so far not commented on the episode.
A married father, according to his YouTube videos, Gill is a Chartered Financial Analyst who had until recently created content for ""In Good Company,"" an initiative by MassMutual to ""explore different ways to make financial education more accessible,"" its website says.
Through frequent posts on Reddit's WallStreetBets thread, Gill became the Pied Piper of GameStop, sharing screenshots of his portfolio which appeared to inspire thousands of amateur retail investors to follow him into the ailing retailer too.
He began sharing his bets with the group in September 2019, posting a portfolio screenshot indicating he had invested $53,000 in the company and had already netted a $46,000 profit. Reuters was unable to confirm this.
In YouTube videos, he expanded upon his investment thesis, arguing the company was undervalued, and was well-positioned to rapidly grow its fledgling online business.
By Wednesday, Gill was up over 4000% on stock and options investments in the company, with his GME position plus cash worth nearly $48 million, according to his Reddit posts. Reuters could not independently verify his profits.
FEVER PITCH
As trading in the shares reached fever pitch this week, his portfolio updates appeared to encourage other investors to stay in the stock. 
“Your steady hand convinced many of us to not only buy, but hold. Your example literally changed the lives of thousands of ordinary normal people,” wrote one user on Wednesday.
Some lawyers have said the unusual role Gill and other Reddit users played in talking up GME could draw regulatory scrutiny. But they stressed that it is not clear whether he had done anything wrong. 
""Ultimately the issue is going to be whether people were putting out materially false or misleading information for the purpose of inducing others to buy stock,"" said Jacob Frenkel, Securities Enforcement Practice Chair for law firm Dickinson Wright and a former SEC enforcement attorney. 
Some said that if Gill simply invested in and advocated for his position because he believed in the company, that he had nothing to fear. 
""If he is what he says he is, he's not breaking the law,"" said Scott Silver, a securities lawyer and managing partner of Silver Law Group. ""There's absolutely nothing wrong to tell others to buy a stock if it's honest and in good faith.""
The SEC, which oversees the stock market, said this week it is monitoring the market volatility but did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Gill on Thursday evening.
After online brokerages restricted trading in GME on Thursday, Gill posted that he had lost $14.8 million that day alone, but was still up $33 million overall.

That post was met with thousands of replies, with many simply repeating: ""IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN.”

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 01:00AM ET</span>",Hyundai wrestles with the risks of embracing Apple,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Stephen Nellis
SEOUL/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Executives in Hyundai Motor Co Group are divided over a potential tie-up with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), with some raising concerns about becoming a contract manufacturer for the U.S. tech giant, dimming the outlook for a deal. 
Hyundai said earlier this month it was in preliminary talks with Apple, but gave no details. Local media said the firms were discussing an electric car and battery tie-up. 
Hyundai declined to comment for this story. Apple declined to comment.
Apple has never acknowledged talks with the automaker about building vehicles, and it was unclear whether any such talks are still active. The iPhone maker typically insists on strict secrecy from its potential partners and suppliers about future plans or unreleased products.
In an earnings call on Tuesday in which it reported its best quarterly profit in over three years, Hyundai did not give any updates on talks with Apple or indicate whether they remain active.
""We are agonizing over how to do it, whether it is good to do it or not,"" said a Hyundai executive aware of the internal discussions on the tie-up with Apple. ""We are not a company which manufactures cars for others. It is not like working with Apple would always produce great results.""
Few details are known about the talks between the two companies. But people close to the discussions say the options considered included Hyundai or Kia acting as a manufacturer for vehicles designed by Apple and sold under its powerful, ubiquitous brand. 
Hyundai is traditionally known for its reluctance to work with outsiders, making engines, transmissions and even its own steel in-house under its vertically integrated supply chain as South Korea's second-largest conglomerate. Although shares in Kia and Hyundai have surged because of the talks, there is considerable opposition to becoming an Apple contract manufacturer, which could hold up any deal with the American giant, these people said.
Apple and Hyundai first started talks over a car partnership in 2018, when Apple's effort, known as ""Project Titan,"" was headed by Alexander Hitzinger, who is now a Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) executive, said a person familiar with the matter. But progress was hampered by the South Korean automaker's reluctance to work with outsiders, the person said.
These talks have not been previously reported.
""It is really difficult (for Hyundai) to open up,"" this person said, adding that the South Korean company would likely to have to replace some executives to avoid a culture clash under any partnership with Apple. 
""Apple is the boss. They do their marketing, they do their products, they do their brand. Hyundai is also the boss. That does not really work,"" the person said.
The South Korean car manufacturer, however, has excess capacity. Contract manufacturing would help it secure production volume.
NOT LIKE FOXCONN
Another person familiar with the matter said Apple would prefer to source major components of its own design - frames, bodies, drive trains, and other parts - from a variety of places and rely on Hyundai or Kia for a final assembly site. 
""They would want this to be in the United States,"" the second person said.
While the talks are at an early stage, Hyundai Motor Group has ""tentatively decided"" that it would want Kia to partner with Apple, not Hyundai Motor, a Hyundai insider said. 
""The Group is concerned that the Hyundai brand would become just Apple's contract manufacturer, which would not help Hyundai in its effort to build a more premium image with its Genesis brand,"" the insider said. Kia is also moving faster in terms of electric cars, and it has available production capacity at its Georgia factory in the United States.
Another executive at Hyundai said: ""Tech firms like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple want us to be like (contract phone maker) Foxconn.
""A cooperation may initially help raise the brand image of Hyundai or Kia. But in the mid- or longer-term, we will just provide shells for the cars, and Apple would do the brains."" 
Nevertheless, there are broad areas where the two companies could benefit, including access to Hyundai’s electric car platform and its suppliers, such as battery makers, as well as access to Apple's autonomous vehicle stack and software, said Park Chul-wan, a South Korean battery expert and a professor at Seojeong University.

""Hyundai would be more than just a Foxconn,"" he said.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 11:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: SEC scrutiny delays Roblox stock market listing,"By Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Roblox Corp has postponed plans to go public because of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's scrutiny of how the video game platform recognizes revenue in its finances, according to a memo the company sent to employees on Thursday. 
The delay is a setback for one of the most eagerly-anticipated U.S. public market debuts of 2021. The company had said in a regulatory filing earlier this month that it was aiming to list shares on the New York Stock Exchange in February. 
Roblox's valuation skyrocketed to $29.5 billion in a fundraising round earlier this month, more than seven times the $4 billion the company was valued at 11 months earlier, amid a surge in the popularity of video games during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The SEC has reservations over the way in which Roblox recognizes revenue from the sale of its currency, Robux, on its platform, according to the memo seen by Reuters.
Players use Robux in the game to buy a mix of durable goods which last for a period of time and consumable goods which are used immediately. Roblox had looked to treat all the revenue the same and amortize it over the duration of its paying user accounts, which is around two years.
The SEC wants Roblox to be more specific and recognize revenue on consumable products as they are consumed, while the durable services will still be recognized over the life of the Roblox user, the memo said. 
""By adopting that accounting position, our revenue will actually be a bit higher, while bookings, DAUs (daily active users), hours of engagement, and cash flow will not change,"" founder and chief executive David Baszucki wrote in the memo to Roblox staff, who he referred to as ""Robloxians.""
""It will, however, take us some time to update this change in our financial statements,"" he said. 
A Roblox spokesman declined to comment. 
This is not the first delay to the listing plans. Roblox told employees in December it had put off the listing until 2021 as it worked with advisers to improve the process to benefit employees and investors. The company ended up switching gears and said it would look to go public through a direct listing instead of an initial public offering (IPO).
Roblox's revenue - based on its earlier definition of the metric - jumped 68% to $588.7 million for the first nine months of 2020. The company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $203.2 million compared with $46.3 million a year earlier.

Roblox, which is among the world's most popular gaming sites for children and offers a host of games across mobile devices and games consoles, said its daily active user base soared 82% to 31.1 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30 from the same period a year ago.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The clash between retail traders and Wall Street professionals that sparked roller coaster rides in the shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) may pose a risk to dozens of other stocks and potentially create a headache for the broader market, analysts said.
Market watchers identified dozens of stocks potentially vulnerable to extreme volatility after a buying spree from an army of retail traders in recent days prompted hedge funds to unwind their bets against GameStop and other companies, fueling surges in their share prices in a phenomenon known as a ""short squeeze.""
""Unfortunately, it's definitely not a one-off thing,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ""The type of activity that drove that higher, I believe, has caused people to try to duplicate that in other names.""
J.P. Morgan earlier this week named 45 stocks that may be susceptible to short squeezes and similar ""fragility events,"" including real estate company  Macerich Co  (NYSE:MAC), restaurant chain Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE) Inc and clothing subscription service  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) Inc.
Like GameStop, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and others that have recently become targets of retail traders in recent days, all the stocks have high short interest ratios.
That means a large percentage of investors have borrowed the stock to sell it in anticipation that they will be able to buy it back at a lower price and profit on the trade. But if the stock rises sharply, those investors may be forced to buy back the stock at a loss.
""The unfortunate events in GameStop this week may be building a dangerous precedent for markets whereby retail investors act en masse to leverage their buying powers to spark fragility events,"" analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a note.
Using derivatives and coordinating buying on websites such as the Reddit forum wallstreetbets, retail investors have had an outsize impact on markets in recent months. Hedge funds Melvin Capital Management and Citron Capital closed out short positions in GameStop earlier this week after buying pressure pushed up the company's shares. 
GameStop shares were recently down 25% on Thursday as retail brokerages Robinhood Markets Inc and Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) Inc, restricted purchases of the stock, along with several others that have catapulted in recent days, including AMC Entertainment Group Inc and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd.. Even so, the video game retailer's shares have gained more than 500% since last Thursday.
Barring wider trading restrictions, similar patterns could play out over several weeks as short sellers unwind their bets, said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. 
Some firms run strategies that involve holding both long and short positions on a stock, he said, and as a result, certain stocks could see a surge and then a sharp drop as those firms adjust their positions. That process could put pressure on stocks more broadly and contribute to market volatility.

1557,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 09:58PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Rise, Follow U.S. Lead After Volatile Day","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks trended higher Friday morning, following the lead of U.S. markets that on Thursday reversed some heavy losses from a day earlier with online trading platforms taking steps to limit unprecedented and speculative volatility in a handful of stocks.
All U.S. benchmarks finished the Thursday trading session in positive territory and Asia followed suit in the last day of a volatile week.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was flat by 9:00 PM ET (2:00 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.59%. In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.49%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (HK:2833) was up 0.33% while up north in mainland China the Shanghai Composite was up 0.16%. The Southern Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Etf Feeder A started the morning trading session up 1.02%.
“There are a lot of reasons to continue to think we may see gains and I’m not negative on the stock market, I would just say that it’s rich in some areas right now,” Michael Cuggino, a portfolio manager at Pacific Heights Asset Management LLC, told Bloomberg TV.
U.S. markets ended the day with gains Thursday, reversing sharp losses a day earlier. The larger online trading platforms Robinhood and Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) put caps on trading of shares that have seen unprecedented levels of volatility in recent days after being named in some Reddit discussion forums and attracting huge numbers of retail investors.
The platforms restricted shares in several stocks, including GameStop (NYSE: NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE: NYSE:BB), which have risen by hundreds of percentage points in recent days. Share prices in both these companies fell more than 40% by the close Thursday, although GameStop went through a wild ride that saw it more than triple in value at one point.
For most investors, however, a more significant concern going forward continues to be the impact of COVID-19 as new variants spread globally and countries extend lockdowns, although both the U.S. and India, two of the countries most affected by the pandemic, have seen something of a slowdown in new cases this week.
In the broader economy, the pandemic caused the worst economic performance in the U.S. since World War Two. A preliminary estimate from the U.S. Commerce Department released Thursday suggested that U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annualized 4% in the fourth quarter of 2020, roughly in line with forecasts, but, for all of 2020, U.S. GDP fell 3.5%.
With that performance in mind, investors are now looking at the progress in a $1.9 trillion aid plan that President Joe Biden has proposed, although it is unclear how, when or if the package will move forward."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia's retail investors, emboldened by the meteoric rise of U.S. videogame retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), are taking on short sellers and making their brokers nervous enough to cut off margin lending.
In South Korea, small investors known as ""ants"" have borrowed so much money to dabble in stocks that at least half a dozen brokerages have stopped offering them leverage. 
GameStop's global impact is the latest manifestation of a day-trading mania driven by amateur investors that is boosting the price of assets ranging from cryptocurrencies to new stock market listings.
""Not afraid, not flinching,"" said Ji-Han Kim, who works at a food delivery chain in Seoul and whose stock portfolio includes Chinese drone-maker Ehang, which he says has made him a 412% return, and chip giant Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF).
""I see it as a bubble that doesn't burst for a while.""
However, this euphoria is not universal and Korea Financial Investment Association data shows six South Korean brokerages stopped margin lending this month, after loan values hit a record 21.6 trillion won ($19.3 billion) this week.
""Any more lending to ants would go against the capital requirement ratio for brokerages,"" said Kwak Sang-jun, a stockbroker at Shinhan Investment Corp in Seoul.
""No-one expected the rally would be this explosive, and trading demand from retail investors would grow this explosive.""
The retail phenomenon is widespread across Asia, where small-time traders have long played an outsized role, especially in markets such as South Korea and China. But investors are becoming younger, much more leveraged and influential.
In Thailand, where they are known as ""moths"", such investors piled into local cannabis-related stocks on Thursday in anticipation of regulatory changes by the government there.
In Hong Kong, retail investors borrowed more than $50 billion to buy shares in Chinese video sharing app Kuaishou Technology's float.
And in Australia and Japan, heavily shorted stocks are surging as small investors try and emulate the squeeze that has driven GameStop shares up 17-fold in little more than two weeks.
GAMESTOP NOT OVER
GameStop has become the poster-stock for apparently coordinated small-investor buying, marshalled over online forums such as Reddit, and aimed at inflicting pain on big hedge funds who had bet it would struggle and its stock would fall.
It was the most-traded stock at brokers Stockal and Vested Finance in India and a tiny Australian nickel explorer with a similar ticker, GME Resources, rose as much as 50% on Thursday in Sydney.
Such trades lit up market forums such as chat app Telegram, Kakao Talk in South Korea and 2 channel in Japan, as prices reacted to the retail army, though with much less of the fury of Reddit forums and much more enthusiasm for locking in gains.
""People are calling me and saying: I'm FOMO, I think I'm missing something,"" said Chris Brankin, CEO at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Singapore, a platform for local investors to buy U.S. stocks.
Along with fellow retail darling AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), GameStop has topped volumes over last few days for Saxo Capital Markets, said its Asia-Pacific CEO Adam Reynolds, adding new account volumes are ""insane"", with 80% of new clients under 40.
""Because they're getting better and because they're getting more confidence, it's sometimes the institutional (investors) who are getting a bit overrun,"" Reynolds said.
Retail investors made up 67% of average daily trading volume on South Korea's main KOSPI market last year and a ""buy everything"" market has lifted it 113% since March.
SHORT SHRIFT 
Asian markets were jittery on Thursday and painful for short sellers, as some heavily shorted companies jumped.
In Australia, funeral operator InvoCare, salmon farmer Tassal and poultry producer Inghams, all of which have short interest levels higher than 8% according to regulatory data, leapt to multi month highs. 
Japan's most shorted stock, telecom equipment maker Anritsu Corp, touched a two-decade high.
In China, where investors are more familiar with the swings and roundabouts of a market in which fickle retail buyers command price moves, traders were admiring of the role adopted by U.S. retail investors but said that such stock volatility would trigger action by Chinese regulators.
""Retail investors in the U.S. are marvellous,"" read one well-liked post on a chat app run by Hithink RoyalFlush.
For Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun, who bid$4.6 million for a charity lunch with Warren Buffet in 2019, the GameStop party is not over.
""I'll be buying $1 mil of $GME tonight,"" he said on Twitter.
""Watch out, Asians are coming!""

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 09:45PM ET</span>",U.S. judge allows extradition of two men accused of aiding Ghosn escape,"By Nate Raymond and David Shepardson
BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday rejected a last-ditch effort by two men to avoid being extradited to Japan to face charges they helped former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee the country.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston cleared the way for U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, to be handed over to Japan, after the U.S. State Department approved their extradition.
The Taylors' lawyers had argued they could not be prosecuted in Japan for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that, if extradited, they faced the prospect relentless interrogations and torture.
Ghosn in a court filing sought to support their claim, arguing he faced prolonged detention, mental torture and intimidation in Japan and the Taylors would face ""similar or worse conditions.""
But Talwani said that ""although the prison conditions in Japan may be deplorable,"" that was not enough to bar extradition and that authorities had established their alleged actions were an ""extraditable offense.""
Lawyers for the Taylors quickly moved to appeal. They declined to comment, as did Nissan. Ghosn and the Japanese embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.
The Taylors were arrested in May at Japan's request. Talwani put their extradition on hold on Oct. 29 so she could hear their challenge to the State Department's decision.
Prosecutors say the Taylors helped Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn has denied wrongdoing.

Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a private security specialist, and his son received $1.3 million for their services.

Average daily trading turnover jumped to 99 billion baht ($3.3 billion) this month through Wednesday, set for a monthly record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Transactions by individuals this month made up about 46% of total trading, an increase from 43% in 2020, stock exchange data showed.
More Thais have been opening new trading accounts. While January data have yet to come out, the 88,720 new sign-ups in the October-December period marked a 310% jump from a year earlier, and a 23% surge from the previous quarter, according to the stock exchange. The rising retail participation, part of a global trend during the pandemic, has contributed to a 45% rally in Thailand’s benchmark SET Index from its March low.
“Interesting data shows there have been a lot more new trader faces, especially among the young generation,” said Soraphol Tulayasathien, the Stock Exchange of Thailand’s senior executive vice president. There is still potential for the number of new individual traders to increase, he said.
The entry of first-time stock buyers in Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy has helped offset the exit of foreign investors, who sold a net $177 million of shares this year after offloading $8.3 billion in 2020.
Individual investors bought a net 16 billion baht of Thai stocks this year after purchasing net 217 billion baht in 2020, according to the exchange’s data.
Commissions from individual investors, who pay higher fees, are now exceeding those from funds for Thailand’s top brokerages such as KGI Securities (Thailand) Pcl and Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Thailand) Pcl.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 08:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: AMC Entertainment explores new capital raise amid stock surge - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc is exploring raising more capital, including through yet another possible stock sale, to weather the COVID-19 pandemic and take advantage of this week's rally in its shares, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The world's largest movie theater chain, with about 1,000 cinemas worldwide, suffered unprecedented turmoil after the pandemic last year forced it to temporarily close many venues while attendance dropped at those that remained open. AMC staved off bankruptcy through a debt restructuring deal last summer with its creditors and private equity firm Silver Lake, and a series of other financial transactions in recent months.
AMC said on Monday it had raised $917 million since mid-December through equity and debt issues. ""This means that any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table,"" Chief Executive Adam Aron said in a statement accompanying disclosure of the additional funds. 
On Wednesday, AMC said it raised an additional $304.8 million by selling shares this week, cashing in on an unprecedented social media-driven rally powered by amateur traders taking on hedge funds that had shorted its shares.
On Thursday, it said Silver Lake and other creditors decided to convert debt holdings to equity in a transaction expected to reduce AMC's obligations by $600 million.
AMC is considering attempting to raise even more money to capitalize further on the frenzy in its shares, the sources said. While its shares dropped about 57% on Thursday, erasing most of the week's gains, they are still up more than 300% since the beginning of January.
AMC said on Monday its ""financial runway has been extended deep into 2021."" Still, it could use proceeds from a new capital raise to further trim its $5.5 billion debt pile as of the end of September, according to the sources.
The cinema chain is considering a share sale while its stock remains high to reap hundreds of millions of dollars, which would give it additional cushion to navigate the pandemic, the sources said. Negotiating more debt-for-equity swaps is also under consideration to reduce the money it owes creditors, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
AMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company has not made any final decisions on near-term financial transactions, and its calculations could change depending on how its stock performs in upcoming trading sessions, the sources said.
AMC is consulting with its creditors and taking other steps as traditionally unpopular stocks have soared in frenzies fueled by social media.  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) has been at the center of the volatile trading.

The trading is upending markets and presenting unanticipated opportunities for weakened companies to shore up balance sheets to brace for additional challenges wrought by the pandemic.

(Reuters) -  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday, as its customers shopped online during Christmas and New Year holidays, driving a recovery in payment volumes from the coronavirus-induced slump.
A surge in online shopping helped the world's biggest payment processor counter a hit to cross-border volumes from a global slowdown in travel and entertainment. 
U.S. holiday sales jumped 8.3% last year to record their best growth in at least 19 years, as consumers used their stimulus checks to splurge on gifts, the National Retail Federation (NRF) said earlier this month.
Visa said total spending rose 5% on a constant dollar basis from a year earlier, after dropping 10% in the previous quarter.
""U.S. holiday spending was quite different this year, but had a similar overall growth to the last 3 years of holiday season,"" Chief Executive Officer Alfred Kelly Jr said.
Holiday retail spending growth broadly accelerated in Canada, UK, Brazil and Australia, he added. 
Visa's shares gained 1.2% as the company said the number of processed transactions rose 4% and that it approved a new $8 billion share buyback program. 
Cross-border volume slumped 21% from a year earlier, but improved from the prior quarter when they crashed 47%. 
Kelly cited travel between the U.S. to several countries in Latin America remained strong for the improvement, with the UAE also attracting holiday-makers from Europe, Russia and other Gulf countries. 
Visa joined peers Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) in hoping for a uptick in travel as vaccines roll-out.
Kelly warned, however, that it might take years for business travel to recover, and trips may never recover to pre-pandemic levels.
Visa reported a net income of 1.42 per Class A share for the first quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.28 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1563,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",No Reprieve for Stocks in Malaysia as Virus Ravages Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Things have gone from bad to worse for Malaysian stocks in the new year as the nation’s struggle to stem a surge in Covid infections deepens concerns about its economic revival.
While optimism over vaccine rollouts and a post-pandemic recovery powered global equities to fresh records this month, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index, which lagged behind several Asian peers last year, is among the world’s worst performers in 2021.
Malaysia’s economic growth this year will likely be at the lower end of its forecast range of 6.5% to 7.5% due to renewed movement restrictions aimed at curbing new virus cases, Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz said in an interview last week. The country has widened its lockdowns, which last until Feb. 4, to all but one state to contain the outbreak that has stretched the health system to the breaking point.
“Renewed acceleration in cases risks an uneven recovery that may cause more companies and individuals to pass the critical tipping point financially,” said Muzhafar Mukhtar, head of equities - Malaysia, at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “These economic lockdowns cause cumulative financial damage, and time is needed to repair household/corporate balance sheets.”
Stocks tied to the local economy -- including those in financial, consumer discretionary and industrial sectors -- have dragged down Malaysia’s benchmark by about 3% since the start of the year, with the gauge set for its fifth weekly drop in six. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, in comparison, is up 3.5% since Jan. 1.
Malayan Banking Bhd. and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. have been the biggest drags on the KLCI Index, with each tumbling more than 6% this year.
“Ongoing political uncertainty locally continues to pose a risk to crisis-handling and policy-making,” said Mukhtar. “All these factors mean corporate earnings generally still have an unusual level of uncertainty around them, at least in the near term.”
READ: How the Pandemic Is Keeping Malaysia’s Politics Messy: QuickTake
Malaysian equities are also getting little support from the local glove producers, Asia’s hottest pandemic trade in 2020. Companies including Hartalega Holdings Bhd. and Top Glove Corp. have seen their appeal fade amid vaccine rollouts and concerns about environmental, social and governance policies.
The country’s renewed movement control order -- the nation’s strictest form of lockdown -- will have some ramifications on the recovery momentum, Chief Statistician Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement Wednesday.
“If Malaysia can quickly address the pandemic with its current MCO, then the market can start to perform,” said Alan Richardson, a portfolio manager at Samsung (KS:005930) Asset Management in Hong Kong.

Investing.com – GameStop, AMC, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and a slew of other so-called meme stocks backed by retail investors jumped in after-hours trade Thursday, after online trading platform Robinhood said it would lift some trading restrictions on the stocks.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) rose 31% to $259 in after-hours trade after closing down 43%. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rose 21% to $10.56 after falling 56% on the day. Nokia ended the day down 13.25%, Naked Brand Group Ltd (NASDAQ:NAKD) rose 6% in after-hours trade, while Express (NYSE:EXPR) was up 11% and Blackberry (TSX:BB) climbed 8%.
“Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed,” Robinhood said in a statement.
The battle between the short-sellers and the Redditors has intensified in recent days and captivated attention worldwide. But it's not just the ""little guy"" or retail investor that has been riding the wave of momentum.
GameStop disclosed in a filing with regulators on Thursday that MUST Asset Management, a large shareholder in the company, has sold its entire stake in the company.
The move comes just a day ahead of what will be another wild session of trading. Short options - bets against the price of a stock - are widely expected to expire, forcing another squeeze on the short-sellers that could see them potentially lose billions of dollars.
Earlier in the day, Robinhood and other online brokerages restricted trading in the cohort of ""meme stocks,"" and hiked margins requirements, citing increased volatility.
The move drew ire from retail investors, who filed at least two federal suits demanding it reinstate trading of shares including GameStop, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd., Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, Bloomberg reported.
Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have also chimed in on action, questioning why brokerages had imposed trading restrictions. 


Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz also backed calls for a probe into Robinhood's decision to block retail investors.


As it stands, the Redditors have already drawn proverbial blood against Melvin Capital, with the latter reportedly closing out its short position on GameStop for huge losses earlier this week.
The stage has been set for another wild day of trading on Friday. The Redditors appear determined to ""hold the line,"" a mantra littered throughout Reddit forum ""wallstreetbets,"" seemingly symbolizing a battle cry to fellow holders to avoid selling their positions and caving into pressure.
For all the hoopla surrounding the short-squeeze, there is however the risk that the ""little guy"" could end up losing a lot more than the wealthier and experienced purveyors of Wall Street."

Investing.com -  The Dow cut its gains into the close but still ended higher Thursday, driven by mostly bullish quarterly earnings and a rise in cyclicals on expectations the economy is set to rebound strongly. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.99%, or 300 points, but had been over 600 points higher. The S&P 500 was up 0.91%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.50%.

Fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 4% annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. For 2020, however, GDP decreased by 3.5% from the prior year, following a slump in the first and second quarters.
Still, economists continue bet the worst of the pandemic will be in the rear view after the first quarter of the year.

Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reported better-than-expected results but fell sharply amid late-selling before the close.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), however, missed on the bottom line, but beat on the top weighed down by lower margin as the company sought to make its electric vehicles more affordable.  Its shares fell 3% but long-term holders will continue to back the stock,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said.
""Given the run in the name, an earnings ""miss"", no specific 2021 guidance and potential supply constraints, we could see the stock take a breather. But, to long-term believers, there is likely little to deter their thinking,"" Credit Suisse said as it lifted its price target on Tesla to $725 from $700.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Thursday, bouncing from sharp losses in the prior session, thanks to a broad rally as earnings season got off to a strong start and fears lessened around hedge funds selling long positions to cover shorts.
Heavyweights, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, were among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500, a day after the three major U.S. indexes suffered their biggest daily percentage drop in three months. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported holiday-quarter sales and profit that beat Wall Street expectations. However, shares of the iPhone maker fell after climbing about 7% to start the year.
With quarterly earnings season in full swing, market participants have looked to whether companies could justify high valuations, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio on the benchmark S&P index near 20-year highs at almost 22.7.
""By and large the surprises have been positive, even more so than typical and by and large companies are showing positive operating leverage where they are able to grow earnings a little bit faster than they are able to grow revenue,"" said Ellen Hazen, portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management in Wellesley, Massachusetts. 
""It is still early days where we are only a third of the way through the S&P but the surprises look more positive than usual and that bodes well as an outlook for the economy and for the markets.""
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 300.75 points, or 0.99%, to 30,603.92, the S&P 500 gained 36.49 points, or 0.97%, to 3,787.26 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.56 points, or 0.5%, to 13,337.16. 
Shares in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc tumbled after a meteoric rise in recent sessions in a social media-driven trading frenzy that shook stock markets. Trading platforms, including Robinhood and Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR), restricted trading in several stocks that soared this week, easing concerns about a ripple effect to the broader market.
""Trading platforms are not going to want to stick their necks out and be on the frontline of what they may see as a reckless war, in part, against the elite and the system of Wall Street that's being democratized by information and the social media,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm the Patriarch Organization.
Of the 159 companies in the S&P 500 that reported earnings through Thursday morning, 83% posted results that topped analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, well above the 76% beat rate over the past four quarters. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell in choppy trading despite soundly beating quarterly revenue estimates, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) lost ground after posting disappointing fourth-quarter results and failing to provide a clear target for 2021 vehicle deliveries. 
But Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) jumped after it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue, as broadband demand continued to offset pandemic-related weakness in its theme park and filmed entertainment businesses.
A Commerce Department report showed fourth-quarter gross domestic product increased at a 4% annualized rate, in line with expectations, as the virus and lack of another spending package curtailed consumer spending, while a separate report showed 847,000 more people filed jobless claims last week, lower than the 875,000 estimate.

The Stuttgart-based maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks warned, however, that current shortages in semiconductors and COVID-19 disruptions would probably affect the first quarter.
Thanks to cost savings and a faster-than-expected recovery in the auto sector, group earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for 2020 came to 6.60 billion euros ($8 billion), above consensus for 5.25 billion euros, the carmaker said, citing preliminary figures. That is up 52% from 4.329 billion euros for 2019.
""Given the development of successful cost discipline continued in the fourth quarter and expected good underlying demand, Daimler also anticipates a positive business development in 2021,"" the company said.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), by contrast, said last week that 2020 profit almost halved due to the pandemic, while BMW said it exceeded expectations by some metrics.
Daimler, like its competitors, has faced a bottleneck in the semiconductors after chip manufacturers earlier in the coronavirus crisis shifted production away from the hard-hit auto sector to serve other areas, like consumer electronics. 
The auto recovery has left companies like Daimler in short supply of the essential components, causing them to halt or slow production.
Daimler will publish complete fourth-quarter figures and more detailed 2021 guidance on Feb. 18.

1572,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 03:50PM ET</span>","Robinhood Anger, Spending Data, Eli Lilly: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks roared back on Thursday, with the Dow jumping triple digits, as the controversy over a group of retail traders who forced professional short-sellers into retreat continued.
In a bit of positive economic news fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 4% annual rate, the Commerce Department said. 
Even though output fell 3.5% last year from 2019, economists believe the worst of the pandemic could be over by the end of the first half of this year.
Short-squeeze targets GameStop, AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) and other stocks fell on Thursday, a pause in an extraordinary run up over the last few days. Brokerage firms like Robinhood and Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) put on trading restrictions and raised margins, angering customers.
Will the Redditors be able to fight back Friday? Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Reprieve for Redditors as Robinhood Loosens Restrictions?
The short-squeeze stocks rallied in after-market hours as Robinhood said it would limited buys of the cohort of securities and may make adjustments as needed on Friday. 
Robinhood earlier in the day had come under scrutiny for imposed trading restrictions on the securities. It wasn’t the only broker to shut down trading in short squeeze stocks  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and others, but Robinhood Markets is taking a lot of the heat.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling out Robinhood’s trading restrictions, saying it unfairly froze out retail investors, aka the 2.8 million “little guys” from the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, while professional traders were allowed to trade as normal. It was a rare showing of bi-partisanship. Hearings are being planned on the matter in both the House and the Senate, CNBC reported late Thursday.
Meanwhile, Robinhood faces lawsuits filed by customers who claim it has failed in its mission to democratize Wall Street. It’s not hurting Robinhood’s ability to get new business. It’s in the top 10 apps on Apple’s iOS, with 13 million users.. And later on Thursday, Robinhood said it would allow some trading again in the stocks on Friday. 
2. Income and spending data
President Joe Biden wants Congress to pass his $1.9 trillion stimulus spending bill, including checks of $1400 to individuals who meet income limits to help boost the economy. The White House continues to press lawmakers on the package, which is moving somewhat more slowly than hoped.
On Friday, government data on personal income and personal spending come out and might help confirm the idea that households need a boost to revive the economy. Personal income is expected to rise 0.1% from December, while personal spending is seen falling 0.4% in the same time. The data come out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
3. Eli Lilly earnings
Earlier this week, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)said its drug cocktail to treat Covid-19 was extremely effective with high-risk patients, adding more optimism about the ability of health professionals to treat infections while vaccines continue to roll out.
Lilly is expected to report earnings per share of $2.37 on revenue of $7.3 billion."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street was contemplating big wins from the Reddit-fueled retail frenzy in stocks such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) on Thursday, even though many hedge funds in its ranks were nursing losses.
Shares in GameStop, whose motto is ""power to the players"", and other heavily shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Koss Corp and Express Inc soared this week, as traders on Reddit and other social media platforms snapped them up.
These trades forced hedge funds 'shorting' the stocks to cover their positions, costing them billions of dollars and further fuelling a rally which caught many by surprise.
But the tide started to turn on Thursday as some top Wall Street firms disclosed how they had benefited from the feeding frenzy, while others came up with new trades to make a profit.
Silver Lake took advantage of a 301% surge in struggling movie theater chain AMC's shares on Wednesday to convert $600 million in convertible notes into its shares. 
While this left Silver Lake with a $284 million gain on paper, it was not immediately clear how quickly the private equity firm could move to cash out on these shares. AMC's stock plunged by more than 60% on Thursday. 
Silver Lake did not respond to a request for comment.
More Wall Street firms could seek to cash out on the stocks that traded up. The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), has a 13% GameStop stake that is now worth more than $2 billion, compared with $174 million at the end of December. 
BlackRock did not respond to a request for comment.
TUNING MODELS
Market makers such a brokerages and trading platforms are also set to benefit from the surge in trading volumes. 
Trading apps such as Robinhood, brokerages such as  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) and stock options providers such as Citadel Securities LLC have all seen business soar as amateur traders and Wall Street investors drive up trading.
And as the Reddit-fueled rally ran out of steam on Thursday, some hedge funds that still had cash to invest were scouring the market for stocks to short. 
Investors 'short' stocks by selling borrowed shares in a company, betting that the price will fall and that the shares can be bought back at a lower level and deliver a profit. 
Some were also buying corporate credit so they are in pole position to take companies over in the event of a bankruptcy or a debt restructuring. 
One popular trade is to use the profit made from shorting a stock to finance the purchase of the company's debt. 
Others were looking to profit from the volatility by trading on pricing anomalies between a company's shares and its debt.
""If you can get your hands on the securities, it is very compelling to go long on the credit and short the equity,"" one market insider said. 

""Investors are licking their chops and re-calibrating their models,"" the insider added, with reference to the complex computer models which sophisticated institutional investors and hedge funds use to drive their trading.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 01:55PM ET</span>",GameStop surge leaves U.S.-based mutual funds and ETFs behind,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of exchange-traded funds appear to be among the largest institutional winners from the more than 360% rally in shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) so far this week as the video game retailer remains at the center of a showdown between retail investors and short-selling hedge funds. 
The $189 million Wedbush ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF jumped more than 16.1% Wednesday, pushing it up approximately 25% since the start of the week. The $758 million SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF soared 12%, powering it to a 21.9% gain for the week-to-date. 
The relatively small number of winners among funds from the outsized rally in GameStop reflects the company's relatively small ownership base among mutual funds, leaving the prime vehicle for Americans' retirement savings mostly unaffected by GameStop's rally. 
Overall, just 367 mutual funds had a long position in GameStop as of their most recent reporting period, according to Lipper data, while 2,151 funds reported a long position in competitor  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY). Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the most widely held stocks on Wall Street, is owned by 5,641 mutual funds.
The small mutual fund ownership base is one reason why GameStop shares notched one of the most high-profile surges in Wall Street memory, analysts said. [L1N2K221Y] 
""If there's a large institutional investor base held within mutual funds the stock is likely to be less volatile as these are often core long-term positions. Stocks that are held more by retail investors could see hot money move in or out relatively quickly,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA. 
Few large funds that own shares in GameStop have a big enough position in the company to sway their overall performance. 
The Fidelity Intrinsic Opportunities fund, for instance, owns 9.75% of GameStop's outstanding shares, according to Lipper data. Yet that position accounts for just 0.64% of the fund's assets. The fund is up 5.6% for the year-to-date, approximately 1.5 percentage points less than the benchmark Russell 2000 index. 
The BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Advantage Small Cap Core fund holds 0.03% of its assets in GameStop, according to Lipper. 
Overall, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, owned about 9.2 million shares in GameStop as of Dec. 31, 2020, spread over several funds. If BlackRock has not since sold any of those shares, its stake's value is up $2.4 billion since the start of the year.

Investing.com -  The Dow jumped Thursday, led by a rally in big tech on bullish quarterly earnings and expectations the economy will rebound strongly in the months ahead.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.94%, or 589 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.09%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.75%.
Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reported better-than-expected results, lifting investor sentiment on growth stocks.
Apple fell 1% despite raking in a record quarter of revenue and earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, led by a revival in iPhone demand as consumers flocked to grab the tech giant's latest slate of phones launched late last year.
""[W]e believe the path to Apple hitting $3 trillion in market cap is now firmly on track over the next year with a supercycle iPhone release in its back pocket and massive services business worth $1 trillion+ catalyzing shares over the coming quarters,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note.
Facebook also beat analysts estimates on both the top and bottom lines, though its gloomy guidance on the ad-targeting landscape for 2021 kept a lid on the advance in the social media giant's shares.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), however, missed on the bottom line, but beat on the top weighed down by lower margin as the company sought to make its electric vehicles more affordable.  Its shares fell 2% but long-term holders will continue to back the stock,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said.
""Given the run in the name, an earnings ""miss"", no specific 2021 guidance and potential supply constraints, we could see the stock take a breather. But, to long-term believers, there is likely little to deter their thinking,"" Credit Suisse said as it lifted its price target on Tesla to $725 from $700.
Cyclical stocks – those that tend to move in tandem with the economy – also played a roll in the boarder market melt up on bets the economy will likely rebound in the months ahead following the biggest largest annual contraction since 1946.
Fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 4% annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. For 2020, however, GDP decreased by 3.5% from the prior year, following a slump in the first and second quarters.
Still, economists continue bet the worst of the pandemic will be in the rear view after the first quarter of the year.
""In terms for the GDP outlook, Q1 growth will be suppressed by the Nov/Dec weakness which has created very negative momentum at the turn of the year. However, if activity inflect in February as we expect, it will create very strong momentum for Q2,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
In other news, the battle of Wall Street versus retail continues as the violent swings were seen in cohort of stocks retail-favored stocks like Gamestop, Nokia Corp ADR (NYSE:NOK), and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB). GameStop rallied over $500 a share in premarket action but was soon nursing hefty losses after trading brokerages restricting trading.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) fell 23% to $265, though had been as low as $112.25. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was down 48% to $10.08 though had been as low as $6.51.

American’s stock has joined the ranks of GameStop (NYSE:GME), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and AMC whose shares have seen dramatic jumps as retail investors have piled into heavily shorted stocks, igniting a battle between small-time traders and major Wall Street institutions that has shaken U.S. and European stock markets.
American Airlines was named on Reddit’s WallStreetBets thread Thursday. That’s the forum where chats among bullish individual traders have fueled rallies, pitting them against professional traders who bet that those shares will drop. American is the most heavily-shorted airline stock, according to data from research firm S3.
The exaggerated price moves of shorted stocks are drawing more calls for regulatory scrutiny.
Gerber Kawasaki chief operating officer Danilo Kawasaki:
“I’m not a big fan of short sellers, but you know, they go out, they do their research, and then they get taken out by a gang of , you know, retail investors trying to make a quick buck. So you know, I think regulators need to step in.”
Shares of U.S. airlines have gained ground since November but have come under renewed pressure earlier this week. The pack of retail traders, some of them former bankers working for themselves, has become an increasingly powerful force. UBS data shows they accounted for a fifth of equity orders last year."

(Reuters) - Social media chatrooms are beginning to resemble the squawk boxes on old-fashioned trading floors, as a new generation of retail traders continues to gain influence over the stock market.
While attention has focused on the Wallstreetbets Reddit page that helped send shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc soaring, thousands of ""amateur"" investors have also been congregating on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Discord, Clubhouse, Slack and other platforms to trade tips away from the public eye, posts shared with and seen by Reuters show.
For example, Rapper 21 Savage's manager, Stone Mound Meezy, started a Clubhouse room on Wednesday to celebrate earning $40,000 in GameStop options. It quickly filled with more than 1,200 participants who encouraged newbies to jump into other investments, including Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) and cryptocurrencies.
""If I make $100K because of this goofy *ss room ... OOOOH WEEEEE,"" Meezy wrote after investing in Nokia (NYSE:NOK) at their suggestions and seeing he was in the money. 
In another Clubhouse room, venture capitalist Mark Monroe was urging 2,500 members to stay away from ""meme stocks"" that he believed could crash by the end of the week.
At the same time, on Instagram, 23-year-old Albert Sampouw, a.k.a @kevin.trades, and his partner, Mihir Sukthankar, invited their combined 160,000 followers to join a Slack group after posting a screenshot of a 563% gain on an AMC investment.
The pair post watch lists and stock opinions on their page for free, but charge up to $2,000 to join a community of 8,000 members on Slack called Traders Circle X, where they post alerts on when to buy a particular stock.
""I don't want to call it advice because we're not professional advisors,"" 19-year-old Sukthankar said. ""But the free content that we're putting out, a lot of people in the trading community find value in.""
GENERATIONAL SHIFT 
The idea of using social media for investing is far from new. Popular platforms from the 2000's include Bogleheads, Yahoo Finance and StockTwits.
The recent phenomenon takes the medium further because of a generational shift where people feel more comfortable touting investments online, as well as trading apps like Robinhood geared towards first-time investors, experts said.
In addition, the new influencers see themselves as rebels and educators leading disenfranchised communities to economic freedom, rather than greedy tipsters looking for a quick buck.
""It's a collaboration, and that's where the magic happens,"" said Jannick Malling, co-founder of Public, a trading app that combines brokerage services and social media.
The surge of video retailer GameStop started when Ryan Cohen, the founder of popular pet-products site Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), faced off against hedge-fund managers who had shorted the stock. The broader Reddit group decided to support GameStop and a few other stocks, battling what they characterized as a corrupt system run by wealthy ""professional"" investors.
Hedge funds have had to backtrack short positions in recent days as GameStop's price has soared ever higher.
As institutional players and regulators start to talk about the need to investigate the role of social media in the stock price leaps, deeper battle lines have been drawn.
It is Reddit against The Man, supporters say.
    Supporters like entrepreneur Mark Cuban have touted the Wallstreetbets success as a counterweight to high-speed trading firms that have technological advantages against individuals.
    ""I LOVE LOVE what is going on,"" he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday night.
    The retail victory could be fleeting. If stocks promoted on Reddit fall in a serious way, plenty of amateur investors could get badly burned. For now, they are enjoying their moment. 
In his Clubhouse room on Wednesday, Meezy said multiple times that he was not an expert. When offering the ticker to Nokia, he accidentally suggested the code for Nikola.
Followers laughed off the mistake and stayed bullish.

""It's only day three of the retail extravaganza,"" one said.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 12:20PM ET</span>","American Airlines, Southwest post record losses and signal need for more aid","By Tracy Rucinski and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co posted their biggest-ever annual losses on Thursday and indicated a need for additional government aid as the industry continues to reel from the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. airlines expect demand to improve this year as vaccines become more widely distributed but have warned that the strength of any rebound will depend on the pace of vaccine rollouts and the easing of travel restrictions.
JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), which also posted a quarterly loss on Thursday, said a recovery will be directly linked to a decline in COVID-19 case counts.
Still, the shares of those three airlines surged in early trading, boosted by a retail trading frenzy that pushed stock of American - which is the most heavily shorted airline stock - up as much as 32% after the carrier was mentioned on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum.
American posted an $8.9 billion annual loss, its biggest on record, though its adjusted quarterly net loss of $3.86 per share was better than analysts' expectations for a loss of $4.11 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Total operating revenue fell to $4.03 billion from $11.31 billion but topped analysts' expectations of $3.88 billion. 
Southwest reported an annual loss of $3.1 billion, its first annual loss since 1972, and said it was facing stalled demand in January and February, driven by high levels of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.
So far the U.S. vaccine rollout has been patchy and a string of European countries is discouraging travel and implementing more travel curbs in an attempt to contain the spread of new infections.
The United States on Tuesday began requiring negative COVID-19 tests for people entering the country from abroad, including U.S. citizens, a move that airlines said triggered a decline in bookings, even as they continue to view testing as a necessary strategy to reopen travel over the longer term.
The U.S. government has discussed mandatory COVID-19 testing for travelers on domestic flights, but American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said such testing would be difficult.
MORE AID
In December, U.S. airlines received a $15 billion government aid package for payroll costs through March, the second such program since the coronavirus began pummeling demand last year.
A U.S. aviation union leader urged Congress on Thursday to extend the program for a third time, a move American's Parker told investors the company would support.
A $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief proposal unveiled by President Joe Biden this month has $20 billion in new assistance for public transit systems, but no new money for airline payrolls.
U.S. airlines continued to burn through millions of dollars of cash every day in the fourth quarter as costs outstripped revenues, despite strong cost-cutting efforts in place for this year. 
American and Southwest each ended 2020 with $14.3 billion in available liquidity. American is significantly more leveraged than its peers but said liquidity would improve to $15 billion by the end of March, reassuring investors.
Southwest has taken advantage of the crisis to add new routes, a strategy it plans to continue this year. 
American, with a larger international profile, said it was exiting 19 international routes in 2021.
Both carriers are large operators of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX, which was approved to fly commercially again in November after a 20-month safety ban.

American resumed passenger flights late last year and Southwest plans to fly the jets again on March 11.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",Facebook oversight board overrules company on most cases in first test,"By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Deciding its first-ever cases,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s oversight board ruled on Thursday that the social media company was wrong to remove four of five pieces of content the board reviewed, including posts Facebook took down for violating rules on hate speech and harmful COVID-19 misinformation. 
The first rulings will be scrutinized to see how independent the board appears from the world's largest social media platform and how it may rule in the future, particularly ahead of its high-profile decision on whether Facebook was right to suspend former U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Facebook blocked Trump's access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by the former president's supporters. The board said the Trump case would be opened for public comment on Friday and that he had not yet provided a statement to the board.
Facebook said it would abide by the board's decisions. The group, which was created by Facebook in response to criticism of the way it treats problematic content, also called for the company to be clearer about its rules on what is allowed on its platforms.
Here is the full list of the board's rulings:
DECISIONS OVERTURNED: 
* A post from a user in Myanmar with photos of a deceased child that included commentary on a perceived inconsistency between Muslims' reactions to killings in France and to China's treatment of Uighur Muslims.
* An alleged quote from Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels that Facebook removed for violating its policy on ""dangerous individuals and organizations.""
* A post in a group claiming certain drugs could cure COVID-19, which criticized the French government's response to the pandemic. This case was submitted by Facebook, rather than a user.
* Instagram photos showing female nipples that the user in Brazil said aimed to raise awareness of breast cancer symptoms. Facebook had also said this removal was an error and restored the post.
DECISION UPHELD: 
* A post that purported to show historical photos of churches in Baku, Azerbaijan, with a caption that Facebook said indicated ""disdain"" for Azerbaijani people and support for Armenia.
See a factbox on the decisions. 
Facebook now has seven days to restore the pieces of content that the board ruled should not have been taken down. The board said it would shortly announce one more decision from its first batch, as well as the next round of cases. 
The board also issued nine nonbinding policy recommendations - for example that Facebook should tell users the specific rule they have violated and better define their rules on issues like dangerous groups and health misinformation. Facebook doesn't have to act on these, but it does have to publicly respond within 30 days.
""We can see that there are some policy problems at Facebook,"" said board member Katherine Chen in an interview. ""We want their policy to be clear - especially those policies involved in human rights and freedom of speech. They have to be precise, accessible, clearly defined,"" she added.
In a blog post responding to the decisions, Facebook said it would publish updated COVID-19 misinformation policies. However, it said it would not change its approach to removing misinformation during the global pandemic. 
Facebook has long faced criticism for high-profile content moderation issues. 
The board said on Thursday that it had received 150,000 appeals since it started accepting cases in October. It will rule on a limited number of controversial decisions. 
The board has 20 members including former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tawakkol Karman.
Some Facebook critics and civil rights groups slammed the board's rulings. A group dubbed The Real Facebook Oversight Board said the decisions showed ""deep inconsistencies and troubling precedent for human rights."" 
Eric Naing, a spokesman for Muslim Advocates, also a member of the group, said that ""instead of taking meaningful action to curb dangerous hate speech on the platform, Facebook punted responsibility"" and that the board's ruling had reinstated ""a dangerous, anti-Muslim post in Myanmar.""
The group hears cases from users who have exhausted the company's appeals process on content removed from Facebook's platforms, not content that has been left up. The board's limited remit has been the subject of criticism. Facebook itself can ask the board to review a wider range of content problems. 

Facebook has pledged $130 million to fund the board for at least six years.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>",GameStop stock retreats as Reddit rally runs into trading restrictions,"By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Shriya Ramakrishnan
(Reuters) - GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares sank early on Thursday as trading platforms including Robinhood and Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) restricted trading in the video game retailer along with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and other stocks that soared this week in a social media-driven trading frenzy that shook stock markets.
GameStop, the video game chain whose 1,700% rally has been at the heart of the slugfest in the past week, lost half its value in early trading. The stock had rallied initially, then retreated, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) joined the growing list of stocks making stellar gains as small-time traders and major Wall Street institutions broadened their battle. 
On Reddit thread WallStreetBets, where calls to buy stocks have helped drive the extraordinary moves, some of its more than 4 million members reported trading platform Robinhood was now preventing investors from buying GameStop and other volatile stocks.
Robinhood cited ""recent volatility"" in a statement on its website. (https:// It said restricted stocks also included BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Koss and Express. Interactive Brokers, another online trading platform, also said it was restricting trading in those stocks. ""We do not believe this situation will subside until the exchanges and regulators halt or put certain symbols into liquidation only,"" Interactive Brokers said.
On Twitter, many observers decried the decision to remove certain stocks, arguing the retail trading platforms were trying to protect Wall Street interests at the expense of Main Street.
""Robin Hood: a parable about stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Robinhood: an app about protecting the rich from being short squeezed by the poor,” Tweeted Jake Chervinsky, a lawyer for fintech company Compound.
The universe of social-media driven stocks expanded, however. Shares in American Airlines soared 16%. 
""GameStop 2.0! I do think that some of it is related to short-sellers and those that are looking at some of these short-term opportunities to push stocks around,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
The 'Reddit crowd,' with its use of call options and coordinated buying, has had a direct impact on the overall stock market. A basket of stocks traded mostly by hedge funds has fallen 2.5% so far this year, while a basket tracking retail favorites jumped 13.5%, data from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) showed.
GameStop briefly became the biggest stock on the Russell 2000 index of small caps, according to Zerohedge.
The dramatic jumps in the stock price of companies including GameStop, BlackBerry Ltd and AMC drew more calls for regulatory scrutiny.
""In terms of short interest being monitored, the U.S. markets are probably the most transparent, but there's always room for improvement,"" former SEC chairman Jay Clayton told CNBC.
Silver industry shares also caught traders' attention. Canada's  First Majestic Silver  (NYSE:AG) was halted briefly in New York after shares rose more than 30%. The company said it was not aware of any material or undisclosed information. Miner Fortuna Silver Mines (NYSE:FSM) rose 20% while London-listed  Fresnillo  Plc (LON:FRES) jumped as much as 10%.
Heavily shorted stocks were also active in Australia and Europe.

SHORT SQUEEZE
On Wednesday, the short squeeze - where a rising stock price forces traders to abandon loss-making ""short"" bets that it will decline - fueled a 2% slide in New York's S&P 500 as investors sold other assets to cover their losses. U.S. equity markets rebounded more than 1% in early Thursday trading. (N)
Short-sellers are sitting on estimated losses of $71 billion from their positions in U.S. companies this year, data from analytics firm Ortex showed. As of Wednesday, there were loss-making short positions on more than 5,000 U.S. firms.
In one Reddit discussion, thousands of participants responded ""We love this stock"" to a post that called for more buying of GameStop and cast retail traders as Iron Man against a hedge fund Thanos in a nod to superhero movie ""Avengers: Endgame.""
The war began last week when hedge fund short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Capital bet against GameStop and was met with a barrage of retail traders betting the other way. He said on Wednesday he had abandoned the bet.
Long derided by market professionals as ""dumb money,"" the pack of traders, some of them former bankers working for themselves, has become an increasingly powerful force worth 20% of equity orders last year, data from Swiss bank UBS showed.
Graphics: Hedge funds scrambling to exit shorts, cut losses - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/xlbvgyyybvq/Pasted%20image%201611834123278.png
The constant march upward of stock markets over the past decade, fueled by a constant flow of newly-created money from major central banks, has also made it less risky to bet on shares rising.
The U.S. Federal Reserve kept those taps firmly open at its latest meeting on Wednesday.
This week's turmoil caught the attention of the White House, with President Joe Biden's economic team - including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on her first full day on the job on Wednesday - ""monitoring the situation.""
Massachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on NYSE to suspend trading in GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period.
""The prospect of intervention here is clearly high, but this will just galvanize the (WallStreetBets) community as it just brings home the feeling of inequality in financial markets,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone in Melbourne.

""It's fine to prop up zombie companies through Fed actions but if retail follows a path that greatly distorts asset prices by targeting short sellers, then this gets shut down.""

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 11:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: KKR seeks $15 billion for flagship North America buyout fund, sources say","By Chibuike Oguh
NEW YORK (Reuters) - KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc aims to attract at least $15 billion for its flagship North America private equity fund, which would make it the second largest amount raised for a fund managed by the U.S. firm, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Buyout firms are seeking to tap cheap and plentiful financing for acquisitions amid rising corporate valuations, as economies start recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Several investors have committed to KKR's new fund, North America XIII, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter was confidential, adding that the target included money KKR employees would contribute.
It will be the largest pool of capital KKR has attracted since its KKR 2006 Fund raised $17.6 billion. 
A spokeswoman for New York-based KKR, which now has $234 billion in assets under management, declined to comment.
KKR Americas XII Fund raised $13.9 billion in 2017 and delivered 20% growth by June 2020, according to the website of Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, one of the investors.
This means the fund ranks in the top quartile of all private equity funds of that vintage based on its financial performance, according to Cambridge Associates. 
KKR North America Fund XI raised $9 billion in 2013 and delivered 100% growth by June 2020, the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund website said.
North America XIII is the first fund in the region to be raised since KKR promoted Pete Stavros and Nate Taylor to co-heads of the private equity business in the Americas.
Stavros previously led KKR's investments in the industrial and healthcare sectors, while Taylor oversaw investments in the retail, consumer and technology sectors. 
KKR said it expected its assets under management to reach $311 billion after completing the $4.4 billion acquisition of annuities and life insurance provider Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd in the first quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>",More than half of world's airline pilots no longer flying: survey,"(Reuters) - More than half of the world's airline pilots are no longer flying for a living amid the plunge in demand during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, and those that are still flying feel less valued by their employers.
A poll of nearly 2,600 pilots by UK-based GOOSE Recruitment and industry publication FlightGlobal, released on Thursday, found only 43% were doing the job they had trained for, with 30% unemployed, 17% furloughed and 10% in non-flying roles.
Many pilots that are still flying have faced deteriorating working conditions. Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd, for example, instituted permanent pay cuts of up to 58%, and Turkish Airways and Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd have temporarily lowering salaries.
""We can see the effect the pandemic has had on employed pilots too,"" GOOSE Recruitment chief executive officer and founder Mark Charman said in a statement. ""Large numbers are feeling insecure about their jobs, an increased number are planning to look for new roles this year as well as many feeling less valued by their employers.""
For the unemployed pilots in the survey, 84% said it was due to the pandemic. Before COVID-19 hit, there had been widespread pilot shortages that had driven up demand for aviators and led to improving pay and conditions.
Now, 82% of unemployed pilots would take a pay cut for a new opportunity, the survey found.
For those that have kept their jobs, pilots in Europe reported being the most stressed by COVID-19, with respondents citing the risk of catching the virus, disjointed rules and the possibility of being placed in quarantine during a rotation as among their concerns.
Forty percent of pilots said their mental health had been affected by the pandemic, with the figure higher among younger pilots.

""The amount of stress and anxiety the pandemic has caused me has permanently scarred my outlook on life,"" one surveyed pilot said.

Orcel left UBS in 2018 to become the chief executive of Santander. But the Spanish bank withdrew its proposal after disagreements over Orcel's pay. Before that, it had promised to pay up to 35 million euros of Orcel's deferred compensation.
Orcel is now seeking 112 million euros in a lawsuit against Santander which he is expected to resolve before taking the helm at UniCredit.
Italy's second biggest bank on Wednesday said it would appoint Orcel, 57, as its next chief executive in April.
UBS chairman Axel Weber, speaking to Bloomberg Television, said UBS's rules stated clearly that deferred pay would be lost if staff left the bank.
""We have a very clear policy which can be summarised in two words, it's 'leave, lose'"".
""If executives take another turn in their career and join another organisation, it's their decision,"" he said when asked if UBS would show any flexibility on Orcel's deferred compensation.
""It has no implications for us so we're not in any part of the discussions on this, we have a clear policy which we have communicated throughout,"" he added.
A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday Orcel was open to negotiating a settlement with Santander and would be ready to almost halve his claims to 60 million euros.

Investing.com -- The battle between retail traders and Wall Street hedge funds swung back in favor of the latter at the opening of trade on Wednesday, as various online brokerages made it harder to buy the heavily-shorted stocks that have been squeezed hardest in recent sessions.
Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) said it would raise its margin requirements to 100% of long exposures and 300% for short exposures until further notice. It also put options trading in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Express (NYSE:EXPR), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS) into liquidation, citing “the extraordinary volatility in the markets.”
Meanwhile, Robinhood – the brokerage where much of the gung-ho attack on short-sellers has been concentrated, said it will stop its clients buying all of the above stocks, as well as Naked Brand Group (NASDAQ:NAKD) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK).
Such moves eased the pressure on hedge funds to liquidate other positions to cover their shorts. By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 253 points, or 0.8% at 30,557 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock was again the most active stock in early trading, despite the limitations. It rose as much as 35% before retracing to be up a mere 23%. It's still up nine-fold from its levels of a week ago, and Thursday's spike briefly made it the biggest stock in the Russell 2000 (NYSE:IWM) midcaps index. Other names still being squeezed included American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock, which rose 14% after it reported it swung to a loss of $2.18 billion in the fourth quarter and said it was still burning $30 million a day. 
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock slipped 5.4% after it reported its first-ever full year of profit, with some disappointed by the forecast for this year's growth in deliveries. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock also fell amid some disappointment with its outlook for the coming year, but pared overnight losses to be down only 1.3%.
There was little evident reaction to the - widely expected - news that the U.S. economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, gross domestic product expanding at an annualized rate of only 4%, from a rate of over 33% in the previous three months.

The company also said it would pay frontline workers about $80 million in additional discretionary bonuses, taking its total COVID-19 financial commitment to employees and communities to nearly $1.3 billion.
Demand for home improvement goods has surged since the start of the pandemic as homeowners, with limited options for travel or leisure activities, spend more of their discretionary income on minor remodeling and repair work. 
Spring is the busiest time of the year for retailers such as Lowe's and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) as people catch up on gardening and other home improvement jobs after frigid winter months.

Lowe's said it has hired more than 90,000 workers for permanent roles over the past year.

(Reuters) - Shares in  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) surged as much as 60% in premarket trading after it was mentioned on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum and it posted a slimmer-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday.
American joined rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in calling 2021 a year of recovery for an industry that has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.
""As we look to the year ahead, 2021 will be a year of recovery. While we don’t know exactly when passenger demand will return, as vaccine distribution takes hold and travel restrictions are lifted, we will be ready,"" American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said. 
U.S. airline shares had gained ground since November's vaccine breakthroughs but came under renewed pressure earlier this week amid concern over new coronavirus variants and tighter restrictions.
American reported a net loss of $2.18 billion, or $3.81 per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $414 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier. 
On an adjusted basis, the company reported a loss of $3.86 per share. Analysts on average expected the company to lose $4.11 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Total operating revenue fell to $4.03 billion from $11.31 billion but topped analysts' expectations of $3.88 billion.
The carrier reported an annual loss of $8.9 billion, its biggest on record.
Shares pared gains but were trading up 30% premarket even as the heavily-leveraged airline reported large losses and faces an uncertain industry outlook. Investors said the gains are likely fueled by a short squeeze. American is the most heavily-shorted airline stock, according to data from S3. 
""The numbers clearly weren't something that would cause the stock to rise like that,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""Troubled balance sheets and high short stock positions have become the immediate target of these squeezes and they fit right into that category.""
Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen, said the company could use the share spike to shed some debt.
""It's hard to say when the market will look at the company's fundamentals, but we believe American could take this opportunity to de-lever the balance sheet with an equity offering,"" she added.
Airlines are hoping that sentiment will improve this year as COVID-19 vaccines are more widely distributed. However, new strains of the virus have triggered tighter rules for international travel in countries including the United States.

American Airlines ended the fourth quarter with about $14.3 billion in available liquidity.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and revenue on Thursday as a second round of pandemic lockdowns in parts of Europe hurt its business and countered the hamburger chain's sales growth in the U.S. market. 
Several European countries announced tough restrictions as the health crisis spiraled out of control late last year, adding to the woes of the restaurant industry, which was already reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 for much of the year.
McDonald's said the restrictions were affecting markets abroad, particularly those with fewer drive-thru locations, and that it was expecting some of them to remain as long as the pandemic's vice-like grip on the world continued. 
Comparable sales for the restaurant chain's international operated markets segment fell 7.4% in the fourth quarter, largely due to weakness in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, where the health crisis has been more intense. 
Analysts had forecast a drop of 5.03% for the segment, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Comparable sales in the United States, however, rose 5.5%, an improvement over the prior quarter and better than the estimate of a 5.15% increase, as the company leaned on its drive-thrus and celebrity collaboration, including the launch of the crowd-favorite Travis Scott Meal, to drive its business.
Overall, global comparable sales fell 1.3% for the quarter, ended Dec. 31, better than the anticipated 1.46% decline and an improvement over the previous quarter, when global sales dropped 2.2% year over year.
Total revenue fell 2.1% to $5.31 billion, missing the estimate of $5.37 billion.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.70 per share, missing the average analyst estimate by 8 cents.

Shares of the world's largest fast-food chain rose slightly in trading before the opening bell.

LONDON (Reuters) - Short-sellers are sitting on estimated losses of $70.87 billion from their short positions in U.S. companies so far this year, data from financial data analytics firm Ortex showed on Thursday.
The hefty losses come as shares of highly-shorted GameStop (NYSE:GME) jumped more than 1,000% in the past week without a clear business reason, forcing short-sellers to buy back into the stock to cover potential losses -- defined as a short-squeeze -- while retail investors then piled in to benefit from the surge.
Chasing shorted companies became a trend among retail traders, rippling across U.S. markets and Europe. Ortex data showed that as of Wednesday, there were loss-making short positions on more than 5,000 U.S. firms.
Its data also showed that estimated losses from shorting GameStop at $1.03 billion year-to-date, while those shorting Bed, Bath & Beyond were looking at a $600 million loss.
Ortex said the figures are based on the change in trading prices between the start of January to Wednesday's close, and the number of short positions. The company sources short interest data from submissions by agent lenders, prime brokers, and broker-dealers.

The market ""smells a bit of blood"", but it was unclear how far the squeeze has to go, said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of currency strategy at TD Securities. ""It does feel like markets are trying to find a bit of a floor here,"" he said.

The pan-European STOXX benchmark was down 0.5% at 400.9 points, after hitting its lowest point since December. London, Paris and Frankfurt were flat to lower.
""The initial optimism of early this year is starting to dissipate because of the prospects of tighter pandemic restrictions for longer, and concerns over 'vaccine nationalism',"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
The European Union, locked in a public spat with vaccine producer AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), wants a shortfall in the company's supplies to the bloc topped up from production in Britain.
""We could see much more choppiness and much more volatility. We have a bit of a perfect storm heading into the month end, which is weighing on equity markets, but I don't think at the moment we are in a place where it's going to come crashing off,"" Hewson said.
Asian shares slid on Thursday while the safe-haven dollar rallied as Wall Street's sell-off and delays in coronavirus vaccines provided an excuse to book profits on recent gains.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 08:15AM ET</span>",Wall Street expects Tesla's deliveries to rise by at least 50% in 2021,"(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts on Thursday estimated Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will hand over at least 50% more vehicles in 2021, a day after the electric carmaker disappointed investors by holding back on providing clear delivery targets.
At least seven analysts think Tesla will deliver between 750,000 to 850,000 vehicles in 2021. 
The company delivered 499,550 vehicles during 2020, above estimates of 481,261 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data - but 450 units shy of Chief Executive Elon Musk's target. 
Musk had raised hopes of being able to deliver more vehicles this year during the company's third quarter's earnings call.
Back then an analyst posed a question on whether Tesla could deliver 840,000 to 1 million vehicles in 2021. Musk said the target was ""in that vicinity,"" while another Tesla executive said the company would provide a forecast next quarter. 
However, on a post-earnings call with analysts on Wednesday, Musk did not provide a concrete delivery goal, leaving analysts and investors in the dark about the company's own expectations of growth.
""Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. In some years we may grow faster, which we expect to be the case in 2021,"" Tesla said in a statement. 
J.P.Morgan analysts felt the vague outlook seemed softer than what Musk had suggested earlier. The brokerage raised its expectations only slightly and now expects Tesla to deliver 765,000 vehicles in 2021, up from 715,000.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said Tesla's expansion of facilities underpinned the brokerage's 853,000 estimate, which was also directionally consistent with Tesla's view of next year's deliveries materially exceeding its 50% multi-year target. 
""We wonder if Tesla is simply setting a lower bar, so as to better manage expectations,"" Credit Suisse said in a note. 

Tesla shares, which have skyrocketed 743% in 2020, were down 4.5% at $825.50 in trading before the bell.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 08:10AM ET</span>",Walmart plans big push to challenge Amazon on advertising,"By Melissa Fares and Sheila Dang
NEW YORK/ DALLAS (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc plans to expand its advertising business, adding space for ads at its U.S. stores and sharing its vast trove of shopper data with brands, the world's largest retailer said on Thursday, looking to challenge rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a media powerhouse.
The efforts are key to Walmart’s aggressive plan to grow its advertising business by more than 10 times within the next five years, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Reuters previously reported Walmart’s annual advertising revenues were expected to be nearly $1 billion in 2020.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, with nearly 5,000 stores nationwide, has set a goal to become one of the top 10 advertising platforms in the United States within the next five years, a “slightly conservative,” goal, the source said.
Walmart has expanded its advertising business after years of stuttering progress, even as a deal to buy a 7.5% stake in video-sharing app TikTok remains in limbo. 
Walmart refocused its strategy starting in early 2019, cutting ties with its external advertising partner and taking the business in-house as Walmart Media Group. Now, it will be named Walmart Connect, the company said.
“This is about us really digging in and pivoting the business from one which was really focused on search and display with our biggest suppliers,” Walmart’s chief customer officer Janey Whiteside told Reuters. “We want to continue to do that, leverage our physical properties, and find ways to help advertisers make better use of their dollars.”
Walmart said it will build a new advertising platform in partnership with ad technology company Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) Inc. It will allow brands to use Walmart’s ample shopper data to make ads more effective, even on websites and apps Walmart does not own.
Brands will be able to target ads to audiences using Walmart’s data on shopping behavior across categories and brands. Advertisers can then monitor sales inside Walmart stores in real-time and adjust ad campaigns as needed, Whiteside said.
Accurately measuring whether an ad led to a purchase has been a long-term technological challenge. Walmart is betting that allowing brands to use its data on ads across streaming video or smart TVs will draw in more ad dollars.
The retailer said it will take advantage of its brick-and-mortar stores to compete with online retailer Amazon, and will sell ads on over 170,000 screens inside more than 4,500 U.S. stores, including on TVs and screens of self-checkout kiosks.

“We have this unparalleled source of data that we can bring to bear,” Whiteside said. “Who else can actually tell you if a customer saw something online and then a week later, physically bought it in the store?”

With the global EV business, dominated by the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, growing at an explosive pace, a flurry of EV makers are rushing to tap the red-hot initial public offering (IPO) market. 
Other prominent players in the sector such as Fisker Inc and Nikola Corp also went public through mergers with so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) last year.
Faraday and Property Solutions said on Thursday the deal, supported by a private investment of $775 million, is expected to fetch Faraday Future $1 billion in gross proceeds.
Chinese automaker Geely is set to be an anchor investor in the private placement, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Faraday plans to set up a new base in China and enlist Geely for contract manufacturing services. 
Significant Chinese involvement could be an early policy test for U.S. President Joe Biden's new administration, given escalating concerns in Washington over national security implications of China's technological ascendance.
SPACs have emerged as a popular way for firms seeking to go public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty about valuation than traditional IPOs.
SPACs such as Property Solutions are shell companies that raise money through an IPO to take another company public within two years. Last July, Property Solutions raised around $200 million in its own IPO. 
Faraday Future was founded in 2014 by former chief executive officer, Jia Yueting, who filed for bankruptcy in October 2019 and planned to turn over his stake to repay around $2 billion in personal debts. Yueting is now serving as the chief product and ecosystem officer at the company. https://reut.rs/3oxvk9y

1611,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Mixed; Q4 GDP and McDonald's Earnings Due,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading in a mixed fashion Thursday, following the previous session’s sharp selloff as the earnings season continues.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 58 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 57 points, or 0.4%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.1%, or 634 points, lower Wednesday, while the S&P 500 ended down 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.5% - all recording their steepest one-day drops since October. 
These indices are all over 2% lower so far this week, and are on course for their worst week since the end of October. 
Prompting this selloff was the need for hedge funds to liquidate positions to generate funds after their short positions in stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME), Blackberry (TSX:BB) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) ran headfirst into a wave of buying from retail traders. 
This resulted in the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), for a long time some of the darlings of the investment community, trading sharply in the red after the close despite reporting generally positive earnings.
Volatility is likely to continue Thursday, even though the online discussion group that has been central in promoting the heavily-shorted stocks was restricted on Reddit for a time.
The earnings season continues apace, with the battered travel sector in focus: American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) are all due to report. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is also expected to release results Thursday, which are expected to show uplift from pandemic-driven demand for take-out fast food.
The Federal Reserve kept its monetary policy unchanged Wednesday at its first meeting under the Biden administration, but Chairman Jerome Powell was at pains to point out that “we’re a long way from a full recovery.”
This puts the initial release of the fourth quarter U.S. GDP figure as well as the weekly jobless claims number into focus, both due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, amid worries over weakening demand due to travel restrictions, particularly in China.
China, the largest importer of crude in the world, is facing a rise in coronavirus cases as it heads into the Lunar New Year holiday, usually its busiest period of the year for travel.
The Chinese Ministry of Transport has forecast the number of trips that will be taken will be up 15% from last year, when the virus was raging, but down 40% from 2019.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $52.75 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $55.41. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,842.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2111.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",Qualcomm loses fight against EU antitrust regulators' data demand,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) on Thursday lost its fight against a data demand from EU antitrust regulators after Europe's top court reaffirmed the regulators' right to see it, in a case that has already landed the company a 242-million-euro ($292.60 million) fine.
The ruling by the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) will strengthen the European Commission's hand in other antitrust investigations.
Qualcomm's run-ins with the Commission have seen it receive total fines of 1.2 billion euros in two cases in the last three years for using its market power to thwart rivals including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). 
Its grievances with the EU competition enforcer date from 2017 when it was told to provide more information in a case in which it was accused of predatory pricing between 2009 and 2011 to squash British phone software maker Icera, subsequently bought by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp.
Qualcomm said the request exceeded the investigation's scope. It took its case to the General Court, Europe's second-highest, but lost its challenge in 2019. It then appealed to the CJEU.
The Court backed the EU antitrust watchdog.
""Having regard to the broad powers of investigation conferred on the Commission by Regulation No 1/2003, it is for the Commission to decide whether a particular item of information is necessary to enable it to bring to light an infringement of the competition rules,"" judges said. 
Qualcomm is the subject of a third case in which EU enforcers are investigating whether it engaged in anti-competitive behaviour by leveraging its market position in 5G modem chips in the radio frequency chip market.
The case is C-466/19 P Qualcomm and Qualcomm Europe v Commission.

1618,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 06:07AM ET</span>",StockBeat: GameStop Frenzy and the Great Stonks Revolt of 2021,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- This is a historic moment in stock markets. As such, historians will recognize what is happening right now better than those trained in the math-based disciplines that are more normally required for success in financial markets.
They will not be enjoying it much.
The victories chalked up by exuberant retail traders against short-selling hedge funds are recognizable from any number of revolts and revolutions through the ages. All of them have their signature moment when the downtrodden and disadvantaged suddenly become aware of the power they have when they come together and organize.   
This week's winners in GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) were also seen storming the Bastille in 1789, dumping tea in Boston harbor in 1773 and chasing European monarchs from their palaces in 1848. 
This is a social and a cultural moment as much as a financial one. Take this example, one of countless such, from the Twitter account WallStreetBets Intern: “A reminder to everyone holding. #WSB $GME $AMC $BB Not a single Wall Street executive got punished for the 2008 financial crash. F*** em.”
Or this one from another Twitter account with the handle AOC’s Stonk Daddy (the revolt is nothing if not bipartisan):
“I’ve never seen a better opportunity to f*** over the people I hate so passionately Every protest, every direct action I’ve been to. Pales in comparison.”
It’s very obviously a desire for revenge above all else. Grievances can be specific, such as those from those who have been on the wrong end of sharp practises from short-sellers, high-frequency traders, or just Main Street brokerages. Or they can be general, directed against the Wall Street establishment (which, unsurprisingly, includes a Securities and Exchanges Commission that is only just waking up to the mob outside its doors).
“EAT. THE. RICH.” “F*** the Suits” and so on, and so on. This is a moment fueled by anger.
We know from history what happens next. More often than not, the mob, intoxicated by its own success, goes on to commit excesses that stiffen the resolve of its opponents, who are almost always better resourced and - when the chips are down - just as desperate.  The ruling caste regains its nerve, the solidarity of the rebels cracks under pressure, and the status quo is restored by a vicious repression. The narrative is the same from antiquity (the Jewish Revolt of 70 AD) through the middle ages (Paris 1358, London 1389) through the age of Empire (Scotland 1746, the Volga in 1775, Prussia 1849, India 1857) and to the modern day. The list is literally endless.  
Even the more successful uprisings generally turn sour as the victors turn against each other. The unity of the mob - the source of its strength - is strictly time-limited. Any answer to the question “when do I sell GME/AMC/BB?” will produce losers, who will turn their rage away from the establishment to the sell-outs and turncoats. 
None of this is to denigrate the origins and the realities behind the grievances driving this moment. It is not our job to gloss over the inequalities created by the last boom and bust cycle, or the injustice implicit in today’s market structure. It is just to say that moments like this generally end with heads on pikestaffs, or bodies strapped to cannon muzzles. Make sure that yours isn’t one of them."

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, earned a return on investment of 1.07 trillion Norwegian crowns ($122.7 billion) in 2020, the second highest in its 25-year history, it said on Thursday.
""Despite the pandemic having put its mark on 2020, it has been yet another good year for the fund,"" Central Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen said in a statement. The fund is managed by a unit of the central bank.
""However, the high return also reminds us that the market value of the fund might vary a lot going forward,"" he said.
The return on investment was 10.9% last year, 0.27 percentage points higher than the return on the fund's benchmark index. 
The fund's results were boosted by U.S. tech stocks, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) contributing the most to its absolute return, presentation material showed.
""Technology companies had the highest return in 2020, with a return of 41.9%,"" fund CEO Nicolai Tangen said in a statement.
""This is mainly due to the pandemic resulting in a massive increase in the demand for products for online working, education, trade and entertainment.""
On a country basis, the United States contributed the most, by far, to the fund's return, with more than 500 billion crowns, followed by China with more than 100 billion crowns, presentation material showed. 
Investments in Britain lost the fund 70 billion crowns.
Founded in 1996, the Norwegian fund holds stakes in around 9,200 companies globally, owning 1.5% of all listed stocks. It also invests in bonds and unlisted real estate.
The fund holds the equivalent of $240,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child.
At the end of the year, 72.8% of the fund's investments were in stocks, 24.7% in bonds and 2.5% in unlisted real estate, it said.

The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 1.9%, turning negative for the year, while major regional bourses like Germany's DAX and France CAC 40 slid further into the red and UK's FTSE 100 held on to slim gains for the year. 
Investors looked past strong earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) overnight as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve's pledge to stick to loose monetary policy as worries about slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and more curbs in Europe weighed on the mood. 
European stocks that were highly bid in the wake of an online retail trading frenzy, like Ambu, Evotec and Unibail, reversed some of the previous session's strong gains. 
""With valuations at levels already pricing in much of the recovery from a pandemic that is far from over, these corrections are always possible,"" Ian Williams (NYSE:WMB), economics and strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt said in a note. 
Meanwhile, Germany is preparing entry restrictions for travellers from Britain, Brazil and South Africa and its health minister expects the current shortage of coronavirus vaccines to continue well into April.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 04:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Regulators press Deutsche Bank CEO to drop investment bank role - sources,"By Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Regulators are pressing  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) CEO Christian Sewing to relinquish day-to-day oversight of its sprawling investment bank, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
European Central Bank officials have held conversations with Deutsche Bank managers, including Sewing, in which they said the CEO should delegate direct control of the division to another board member, according to the sources, who were involved in or briefed on the discussions. 
It was unclear when regulators last voiced their concerns directly, but the two people said over the past week that the bank was well aware of their position, with one adding that contact with Deutsche was ""constant"".
They said regulators fear Sewing has too much on his plate, leaving the investment bank open to operational hazards. While they want Sewing to hand over day-to-say oversight to another manager, he would retain ultimate responsibility as group CEO under their proposals, the sources said.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Sewing's role or any conversations with the ECB on the CEO giving up direct control of the investment banking division.
Germany's biggest bank is one of the few major banks in the world to assign day-to-day oversight of investment banking to its chief executive. At most banks, other board members oversee the division. 
The investment bank is the German lender's profit driver, but also the centre of risk for a bank that is deemed one of the most critical to the functioning of the global financial system. 
Such regulatory concerns come as Deutsche Bank is carrying out an internal investigation, which three separate sources familiar with the matter said was into the suspected mis-selling of risky investment bank products to customers in Spain and elsewhere. 
The alleged wrongdoing happened as recently as last year, and stretched back to at least 2018, one of those sources said, which would put it under Sewing's watch.
In response to queries about the probe into possible mis-selling of high-risk products, the bank reiterated its previous statement. ""We initiated an investigation in relation to our engagement with a limited number of clients,"" it said, declining to comment further because the probe is ongoing.
INVESTMENT BANKING BOOMS
One of the two people with knowledge of the conversations with regulators said Deutsche Bank's internal probe, revealed this month, had hardened the regulators' resolve to tackle Sewing's overarching day-to-day duties. But the ECB has long viewed the arrangement with scepticism, while Deutsche Bank has resisted changing, according to both sources.
In situations like these the ECB, the euro zone banking supervisor and Deutsche's chief regulator, primarily relies on the power of persuasion to get its way. 
Such power can be significant, however, because a good working relationship with the powerful central bank is critical for running the bank. ECB supervisors make decisions on capital requirements, dispatch auditors to lenders and have sway over bonus and dividend payouts. 
At Deutsche, a New York-based banker, who does not sit on the management board, is in charge of the investment bank and reports to Sewing. But Sewing is responsible for briefing the board on the division's activities and also gets involved in hiring decisions and client meetings.
Sewing, who joined Deutsche in his teens, took control of the investment bank in 2019, a year into his tenure as CEO, in a management reshuffle and overhaul of global operations. 
Regulators made their concerns known at the time and were assured that the setup would be temporary in order to put a new management structure in place but Deutsche has since taken no action, the sources said.
Several months later, in September 2019, the bank said in a public statement that speculation that Sewing would relinquish his investment bank role was false. 
When Sewing took the helm of the investment bank, it was viewed as Deutsche's problem child following declines in revenue and scandals involving the sale of mortgage securities and the laundering of money from Russia. Deutsche managers said they would focus more on old-fashioned retail and corporate banking.
It hasn't worked out that way. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created so much volatility in markets that businesses like bond trading made the investment bank the group's biggest profit engine by far. 
As a result, Deutsche may have eked out a small profit for 2020, its first since 2014, according to a consensus forecast of analysts ahead of a Feb. 4 earnings report.

""A very good part, a substantial part of the outperformance which we have seen in 2020 is deemed sustainable,"" Sewing told investors last month.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Thursday, as investors reacted to the sudden selloff on Wall Street overnight.
At 4:05 AM ET (0905 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.7% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.9% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 1.4%. 
The mood in European markets has also been affected by the slow rollout of Covid-19 vaccines as well as the mobility restrictions to combat the virus.
Both the U.K. and Germany are preparing entry restrictions for travelers from certain parts of the world, while Germany’s health minister expects the current shortage of coronavirus vaccines to continue well into April.
Britain has begun a vaccination program aimed at delivering shots to 15 million people in priority groups by the middle of February, but similar programs in large parts of the European Union have made less progress. The issue has been exacerbated by drug giants AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) both announcing delivery hold-ups in recent weeks.
The sharp selloff on Wall Street overnight has dominated sentiment, as hedge funds liquidated positions to raise funds after suffering losses on short positions in other stocks, amid highly speculative retail buying. The European stocks caught up in short squeezes in recent days showed signs of normalizing on Thursday, with Varta, Evotec and CD Projekt all coming off their highs. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock, which had risen 30% so far this week, was also down by 2.7%.
Europe's earnings season continues, with mixed results.
 Diageo  (LON:DGE) stock jumped 3.4% after the world's largest spirits maker reported a surprise rise in underlying net sales growth in the first half of the year, helped by strong U.S. demand. Fevertree Drinks (LON:FEVR) stock also rose 3.0% as the same factors lifted demand for its mixers.

""We do not intend to speculate on this, but we will continue to supply the vaccine as envisaged by the agreements with the European Commission,"" the CEO of Pfizer in Italy, Paivi Kerkola, said in an interview with daily la Repubblica. 
Kerkola said that the group's supply of vaccine to Italy would be back to ""regular"" this week. 
On Tuesday, Italy asked the European Commission to take action against Pfizer over cuts to its COVID-19 vaccine deliveries, a day after Rome had sent a formal warning letter to the U.S drug company calling on it to respect its contractual commitments after a slowdown in deliveries. 
Last week Pfizer said it was temporarily slowing supplies to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output.
Kerkola said she believed that the group would be able to supply about 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of the year and that increases in production volume would be seen from mid-February.

Asked about the difference in vaccine prices Pfizer applied to different countries, the executive said prices remained confidential but the company used a ""fair access"" principle, with higher-income countries spending more and lower-income countries less.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Wednesday 2.1%, or 634 points, lower. The S&P 500 ended down 2.6% while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.5%, amid extreme market volatility.
There have been concerns within the market about heightened speculative trading amid concerted buying by retail investors in a handful of heavily shorted stocks.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said late Wednesday it was ""aware of and actively monitoring"" ongoing market volatility in options and equities markets, while Reddit briefly restricted access to its popular WallStreetBets chatroom.
Back in Europe, worries about the impact of the pandemic continue to reverberate around the continent. 
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson indicated on Wednesday that the Covid-19 lockdown in England would last into March, after the U.K.'s death toll from the virus surpassed 100,000, the first European state to reach that figure. 
Britain has begun a vaccination program aimed at delivering shots to 15 million people in priority groups by the middle of February, but similar programs in large parts of the European Union have made less progress. The issue has been exacerbated by drug giants AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) both announcing delivery hold-ups in recent weeks.
In Europe, earnings come from the likes of  Diageo  (LON:DGE), easyJet (LON:EZJ), STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) and  Bankia  (MC:BKIA), but a lot of focus will be on the numbers from the U.S. tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) which emerged after the Wall Street close Wednesday.

Toyota said on Thursday its group-wide global sales fell 11.3% to 9.528 million vehicles in 2020. That compared with a 15.2 percent drop at Volkswagen to 9.305 million vehicles.
Automakers have suffered as coronavirus lockdowns have stopped people from visiting car showrooms and forced manufacturing plants to reduce or halt production. 
Toyota, however, has weathered the pandemic better in part because its home market Japan, and the Asian region in general, have been less affected by the outbreak than Europe and the United States.
""Our focus is not on what our ranking may be, but on serving our customers"" a Toyota spokeswoman said.

As demand for cars rebounds, particularly in China, Toyota, Volkswagen and other manufacturers are scrambling to tap growing demand for electric cars. Toyota said that the ratio of electric vehicle it sold last year grew to 23% of total sales from 20% in 2019.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 01:25AM ET</span>","Analysis: Short sellers face derision, death threats and unexplained pizza","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Making money by betting a company's shares will sink in value has become more challenging in recent weeks as markets rocketed higher and a growing wave of investors became ready to take on short sellers at almost any cost - even threatening their lives.
Short sellers - contrarian investors who bet against rising stocks, such as Jim Chanos' Kynikos Associates, Carson Block's Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Research and Andrew Left's Citron Capital - have been called accurate forecasters of stock market returns by academics and market manipulators by critics.
This week, they've stepped into the limelight as bets against stocks including  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) crumbled in the face of huge demand from retail investors and algorithmic traders. 
The rhetoric has escalated, with warnings online to ""watch out"" and even death threats, said people familiar with the matter, who asked to remain anonymous for their personal safety. Managers have asked authorities to investigate, the people said.
The most prominent battle this month has raged over the fortunes of video retailer GameStop, with prominent hedge funds betting its stock would fall while waves of retail investors sent the stock up more 1,774%.
Left, whose Citron Research is widely credited with inventing the practice of publicly posting research that supports short bets and who has been at the center of the GameStop drama, said he was being trolled online. In addition, he said, one night pizza he hadn't ordered showed up at his door and someone had created a fake Tinder account in his name.
Short-sellers borrow stock in the hopes of buying shares back later at a lower cost to repay the loan and pocketing the difference.
""Short selling is inherently difficult and made more difficult because of low interest rates and government stimulus which have sent stocks roaring higher recently,"" said Ben Axler, whose Spruce Point Capital specializes in forensic research that uncovers companies' vulnerabilities and often bets their stock price will fall.
But 2021 has seen a new dimension, short sellers agreed, with platforms like Reddit and Robinhood becoming powerful communication and trading tools for retail investors, making it imperative for short sellers to expand their vision past investment banks' research and established sites like Seeking Alpha and Twitter.
Data from Harvard College Consulting Group, which surveyed more than 230 investors under the age of 24 this month, show that ""31% of young investors are looking to make 'quick cash' and 30% of young investors use Reddit.""
Now the cost to short has also surged, because with only a small GameStop ownership base among mutual funds there are fewer investors available to lend shares, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. 
Shares of GameStop carry a fee of 30.58% to short. That makes them more than 100 times more expensive to short than shares of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which has the largest short position, as measured in dollars, of any U.S. company, according to S3 Partners data.
The relentless surge upwards by stocks, including AMC Entertainment and  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY), has created an expectation among investors of continuing gains. 
Citron's Left acknowledged that the wilder trading this year has had a real impact. 
""I could take on a single 5-year-old,"" Left told Reuters this week, but ""faced with 1,000 5-year-olds, they could take me out,"" he added. As GameStop's stock galloped higher he exited his short positions. ""I have respect for the market,"" he said.
This short-squeeze illustrates tough lessons. 
""Our job is to explain that companies are not what they are saying they are and what investors thought they were, and there is definitely a market for that at a time more people aren't doing a lot of diligence on their investments,"" said Sahm Adrangi, whose hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital often publishes research and makes short bets.
But ""anything you get wrong will be amplified and you have to be very, very careful,"" he added.
Spruce Point's Axler said, ""The bar for short sellers keeps getting higher."" Still, he expects short sellers will find their footing.

""We'll have our time in the sun,"" especially when interest rates start to rise again and government stimulus wears off, Axler said.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 11:25PM ET</span>","China wants to work with foreign peers on anti-trust issues, central bank vice governor says","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's regulators want to step up exchanges with international counterparts and strengthen co-operation on anti-trust issues, data treatment and consumer protection, China's central bank vice governor said in a Financial Times opinion piece.
Pan Gongsheng said authorities wanted to ensure fintech regulation was effective, measured and would guard against cross-border regulatory arbitrage and contagion.
Fintech was still finance in essence, so the principle of ""same business, same rules"" should apply, he added in the piece published on Wednesday. 
""We need regulation that emphasises the substance not the form of a company. The aim is to align business rules and standards with regulation to fend off arbitrage,"" he wrote.
His comments come as China tightens scrutiny of its tech giants, particularly those that have expanded into financial services, by drafting new anti-monopoly rules and guidelines and reversing a once laissez-faire approach.
The new approach saw the abrupt suspension of Ant Group's $37 billion IPO in November, dealing a major blow to the fintech arm founded by billionaire Jack Ma.
Authorities have also rolled out a slew of other financial regulations, including more stringent antitrust requirements on non-bank payment firms, and tighter data collection rules for personal credit scoring business.
Pan said China had ""put in place a prudent yet inclusive regulatory environment for fintech development"" in the sector's early days, but that regulatory gaps still needed to be addressed and financial risks mitigated.
A practice by some big companies to use profits from their other businesses to unfairly grab fintech market share was a global issue, he added, citing the European Union's penalties on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and U.S. antitrust cases against  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as examples.
""When we insist on good supervision, equal access and fair competition, fintech will develop in a way that balances capital expansion, innovation and public interests, and develops technology for good,"" he said.
""It's not an easy task. We need to try hard and work together.""
China's top banking and insurance regulator also said on Wednesday it would step up supervision of banks and insurers with internet platforms in 2021.

It would also push large banks to provide risk management tools and models to smaller banks, a service sector that used to rely on country's leading fintech players.

By Chibuike Oguh and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc shares surged more than 7% on Tuesday after the resignation of CEO Leon Black, which investors viewed as bolstering the private equity firm's fundraising efforts.
Black said on Monday he was stepping down after an investigation into his ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
The independent review, conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, found Black was not involved in Epstein's criminal activities. But it concluded Black paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017, a decision that Black said he regretted.
Apollo executives said in October that some investors had paused their commitments to the buyout firm's funds as they awaited the review's findings. Apollo said on Monday that despite the controversy, its assets under management grew by $22 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $455 billion.
Analysts said on Tuesday the conclusion of the review and Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan taking over from Black as CEO could prompt some investors to proceed with commitments to Apollo's funds that they had previously suspended.
""The news does clear much uncertainty,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note. ""We view the update collectively as a net positive for investors, but potentially not yet enough closure to fully step in.""
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote that Rowan's work building Apollo's insurance business has been ""the main growth engine for the firm."" The analysts added that changes to its governance structure, including nixing special voting rights for founders, would be positive for the stock price. 
Margaret Brown, a board member at the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), said she still wanted the roughly $400 billion pension plan, the largest in the United States, to consider halting future investments to Apollo.
""I will raise the issue in closed session with the board and hope to have a discussion in open session as well,"" said Brown.
A majority of CalPERS' board would have to approve such a decision.
""We expect and demand the companies and executives we do business with to act ethically and with prudent judgment at all times,"" CalPERS said in a prepared statement.
CalPERS declined to comment on whether they will authorize new investment in Apollo's funds. 

Despite Tuesday's rise, Apollo shares are down 10% over the last 12 months. By comparison, shares of peers Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc are up 5% and 29%, respectively.

The company said it did not think it was appropriate to subject Hong Kong-based crew members to extended periods of isolation, preventing them from seeing their families after finishing a trip. 
""While we don't know what the rule will state, when it will precisely take effect, or how long it will last, we do not want unknowns to prevent us from taking action on what we understand may likely occur,"" FedEx System Chief Pilot Robin Sebasco said in the memo seen by Reuters, which was first reported by the South China Morning Post on Thursday.
FedEx did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The memo said the company would cover hotel costs and out-of-pocket expenses for pilots and their families in San Francisco, while continuing to pay their housing allowances in Hong Kong.
However, a Hong Kong-based FedEx pilot said on condition of anonymity that there were flaws in the plan. Many pilots have children in school in Hong Kong, he said, and regardless, it will be difficult for families to live in hotel rooms for weeks or months at a time.
Hong Kong's biggest airline, Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd, on Monday warned passenger capacity could fall by 60%, cargo capacity by 25% and cash burn would rise if the new quarantine arrangements were put in place.
Cathay, in an internal memo seen by Reuters, requested volunteers among its crew who could fly for three weeks, followed by 14 days of quarantine and 14 days free of duty, adding that it would be a temporary measure and that not all of its flights would require such an operation.

Many foreign airlines are already double-crewing their flights into Hong Kong or stopping in cities like Bangkok or Tokyo to allow for quick turnarounds and avoid testing and quarantine requirements.

In response, moderators briefly made the WallStreetBets Reddit forum, which has fueled the frenzy of retail trading, private.
U.S. shares tumbled, with S&P 500 slumping the most since October.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept its policy decision unchanged, and indicated continuous massive support for the U.S. economy, after wrapping up its first policy meeting of 2021 on Wednesday. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the economy still faces a long road towards full recovery from the impact of COVID-19, and that the recovery is still short of inflation and job goals. He added that “the whole focus on exit is premature.”
“The focus is firmly on the fiscal side of the equation now,” BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder said in a note.
Stimulus checks and extended unemployment insurance have been important to the U.S. recovery and are “far more targeted and effective in combating a crisis ... than ‘blunt’ monetary policy tools,” the note added.
Treasuries steadied, with 10-year yields trading just over 1%. Some investors remained positive, however.
“Markets were vulnerable to a setback given some of the positioning and sentiment data that we monitor but we still believe we’re going into a strong economic and profit recovery … that’s going to drive markets higher from this setback,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer told Bloomberg.
The U.S. releases a slew of data, including fourth-quarter GDP, initial jobless claims and new home sales, later in the day. Data on personal income, spending and pending home sales will be released on Friday.
On the COVID-19 front, the U.K. announced new regulations to curb the spread of the virus while Germany cut its 2021 economic growth forecast.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler said on Wednesday it will plead guilty to charges it conspired with company executives to make illegal, lavish gifts to United Auto Workers (UAW) leaders and undermined workers' confidence in collective bargaining. 
The Italian-American automaker, which is now part of Stellantis NV, said it reached an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the Labor Management Relations Act and pay a $30 million fine. Fiat Chrysler also agreed to three years of probation and oversight by an independent compliance monitor to ensure it follows federal labor laws.
The Justice Department said Fiat Chrysler conspired to make more than $3.5 million in illegal payments to then-UAW officers from 2009 through 2016.

Jacobelli, who has left the company, pleaded guilty and his prison sentence was reduced earlier this month to four years for his ""significant cooperation"" with the investigation.
Timothy Waters (NYSE:WAT), head of the FBI's Michigan office, said Fiat Chrysler ""provided money and other items of value in an attempt to create an atmosphere more favorable for negotiating with the UAW.""
U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider in Detroit declined to say at a news briefing what role, if any, the late Fiat Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchionne may have played in the conspiracy, saying the U.S. government ""does not indict or charge deceased people.""
Last month, the UAW agreed to independent oversight to resolve the corruption investigation that ensnared two former UAW presidents.
The UAW paid back over $15 million for improperly billing Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler for employing members who did not work at the training centers operated by the union and the companies.
Schneider said Ford remains under investigation. Ford said on Wednesday, ""as always, we would cooperate with any inquiries.""
Schneider's office charged 15 former UAW officials as part of its investigation, and former presidents Gary Jones and Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB) both pleaded guilty to embezzling union funds.
Several UAW officers, including the two former UAW presidents, admitted embezzling millions of dollars in total for personal benefit, using funds to purchase expensive liquor and cigars and to pay for golf outings and related equipment, and expensive hotel stays.
The UAW represents about 400,000 U.S. workers, including workers at Detroit's Big Three automakers and in other fields. At its peak in 1979, the union had a membership of some 1.5 million.
The investigation led rival automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) to sue Fiat Chrysler last year, accusing company executives of bribing UAW officials to secure labor agreements that put GM at a disadvantage. 
A federal judge in July dismissed GM's lawsuit that Fiat Chrysler called ""meritless.""
GM, which asked a federal appeals court to reinstate the lawsuit, said on Wednesday Fiat Chrysler ""finally admits - after years of denials - that it engaged in a longstanding pattern of corruption.""

""You must be invited to visit this community,"" its page, where participants discuss stock trading, showed earlier when access was attempted. It became public once more later in the evening.
The page also said that it was facing technical difficulties due to an ""unprecedented"" scale of newfound interest in the server.
Separately, Discord Inc, a messaging platform for online gamers, said it had removed the WallStreetBets server from its platform for violating its guidelines on hate speech and spreading misinformation.
""We decided to remove the server and its owner from Discord for continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated warnings,"" a Discord spokesman said.
Discord said it had issued multiple warnings to the server admin before banning it.
Online discussions about stocks on social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are seen by many traders and analysts as fueling massive share price moves that cannot be explained by fundamental news or traditional valuation metrics.
Hedge funds took heavy losses on short positions in GameStop on Wednesday, and regulators and financial professionals called for more scrutiny of trading fueled by anonymous social media posts.
GameStop shares went down 19% in extended trade after markets closed.

1644,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 07:07PM ET</span>",Costly short squeeze makes Reddit required reading on Wall Street,"By April Joyner and Shreyashi Sanyal
(Reuters) - Dennis Dick, a professional stock trader in Las Vegas, reads the site Seeking Alpha before work and keeps up to the minute throughout the trading day by watching Twitter, but last weekend he also joined a group on the popular online discussion board Reddit ""because I need to know what's going on.""
""I joined it to be able to read it,"" he said. The app is popular with retail investors who ""might be talking about a stock I own, and it could move. There could be a trading opportunity there as well,"" said Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading.
Retail investors have long discussed stocks on Reddit and other social media forums, but in recent months Wall Street has had to pay attention to what they are saying. Long dismissed as ""dumb money,"" retail traders in recent months have put enough money into the market to make stocks move in ways that defy fundamental analysis. 
The most stunning recent example is a nearly 700% rise over the past week in shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), without any fundamental change in business for the video game retailer that Wall Street had long given up for dead in the age of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and online downloads. The sharp upswing in GameStop shares has mowed down sophisticated traders who had taken short positions on the stock, betting against it. The surge was fueled in large part by a series of posts talking up the stock on popular forums on Reddit.
Wall Street is paying attention. 
""It adds a new element to the profession,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""It's ignorant of professional traders to not at minimum be aware of the added dynamic to what we all do on a daily basis.""
Authors on Reddit, which hosts more than 100,000 discussion groups, or ""subreddits,"" are mostly anonymous. Founded in 2005, Reddit has recently drawn the interest of amateur traders who post about their strategies and opinions on stocks. The wallstreetbets subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets, which has 2.9 million members, has seen huge spikes of late in volumes of chats around individual stocks. 
The largest shareholders in privately held Reddit are media tycoons the Newhouse family's Advance group, which also owns Condé Nast. Reddit's co-founder Steve Huffman serves as chief executive, while another co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, stepped down from the board last year. Reddit did not respond to a request for comment. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Elon Musk gave Reddit even more prominence as a trading forum on Tuesday as he tweeted ""Gamestonk!!"", along with a link to the wallstreetbets subreddit. ""Stonks"" is a tongue-in-cheek term for stocks widely used on social media. 
Homebound Americans, some flush with cash from stimulus checks and forced savings, have been chasing higher on the stock market at a time of zero interest rates. Their trades are becoming a force to reckon with. 
Before, much discussion on forums such as Reddit used to involve penny stocks and micro-caps that institutions would shun, professional traders said. Now they are noticing discussions moving into mainstream companies with large institutional holdings – and moving markets. 
Wedbush's James said he started paying closer attention to Reddit over the past month and now looks at trading-related subreddits daily. Over the past week, he has looked at it a few times a day. 
Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, said the volume of retail trades was significant and it was important to be aware. 
""I'm not taking advice from 'WallStreet1,'"" Saluzzi said, referring to anonymous posters on Reddit. ""But if something is going on - they're active in the morning, and that creates momentum. Momentum is an investing strategy.""
Bright Trading's Dick said he reads the headlines in the wallstreetbets subreddit each morning and scans the forum about five to 10 times a day. He said paying attention to overnight and early morning conversations are critical. 

""It's almost exhausting as a trader to pay attention to so many different sources that can move stocks,"" Dick said. ""And the Reddit one is right at the top of my list right now.""

The spike in coronavirus cases from late last year has led to lower traffic at stores and fresh capacity restrictions for shopping centers in key regions such as California, denting retailers' sales during the crucial holiday shopping season.
Levi said 17% of its stores globally were still closed, with a new wave of lockdowns in Europe shuttering 40% of the company's footprint there. 
The San Francisco-based company said it expects those stores to remain closed for the rest of the current quarter, resulting in a 10 cents to 12 cents hit to its earnings per share.
Including that impact, Levi forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 20 cents to 24 cents, below expectations of 33 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
The company said it expects quarterly revenue to be down by a high-teens percentage in constant currency, more than estimates of an 11.9% drop.
However, the company could return to pre-pandemic revenue levels by the end of 2021 if conditions do not worsen, Chief Financial Officer Harmit Singh said. 
Levi also beat estimates for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 29 as online sales soared. 
Total revenue in the quarter fell about 12% to $1.39 billion but beat expectations of $1.34 billion. 
Levi earned 20 cents per share on an adjusted basis, beating estimates of 15 cents per share.

The company also reinstated its quarterly dividend at 4 cents per share.

""Telecommunications equipment made by untrusted vendors, including Huawei, is a threat to the security of the U.S. and our allies,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in a daily briefing. 
""We'll ensure that the American telecommunications network...do not use equipment from untrusted vendors and we'll work with allies to secure their telecommunications networks and make investments to expand production of telecommunications equipment by trusted U.S. and allied companies,"" she added.
Huawei declined to comment and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Questions have swirled about how Democratic President Joe Biden, who took office earlier this month, will handle Huawei. The company has been accused by Washington of being capable of spying on customers, as well as intellectual property theft and sanctions violations. Huawei has denied wrongdoing. 
Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, placed the company on a trade blacklist and led a global campaign to convince allies to exclude it from their networks.
The remarks come after Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, Biden's nominee to head the U.S. Commerce Department, raised red flags among China hardliners in Washington on Tuesday by refusing to commit to keeping Huawei on the U.S. economic blacklist overseen by the agency.
Republican Congressman Michael McCaul, a China hardliner with no role in the confirmation proceedings, called on the Senate on Wednesday to put a freeze on the Raimondo process until the Biden administration gives a clear answer on whether it plans to keep Huawei on the blacklist.
""We need a Commerce Department with strong national security credentials and a Secretary with a clear understanding of the (Chinese) threat,"" he said in a statement. ""Until they make their intentions clear on whether they will keep Huawei on the Entity List, I urge my Senate colleagues to hold Ms. Raimondo’s confirmation.""

1649,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 05:09PM ET</span>",China’s Crackdown Will Shake Up World’s Largest Fintech Market,"(Bloomberg) -- In a four-year campaign to root out risks to China’s financial system, regulators have set upon their biggest target yet: the world’s largest financial technology sector.
All three financial watchdogs have made it their primary goal this year to curb the “reckless” push of technology firms into finance, taking aim at a sector where loose oversight fueled breakneck growth for companies such as Ant Group Co. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s Wechat Pay. They have the green-light from President Xi Jinping, who in November called on regulators to “dare to” master their supervisory role.
The coordinated onslaught guarantees a shakeup among the country’s more than 7,000 micro lenders. But regulators have made it clear they intend to stretch well beyond, into every corner of internet finance from payments to credit scoring, wealth management to partnerships with banks and more. Fintech is the latest sector marked for an overhaul since 2017, when China’s leaders pledged to clean up threats to its $53 trillion financial industry, tackling property loans, opaque wealth management products and fraud-riddled peer-to-peer lending.“Everything points to a toughening regulatory stance, which will surely bring more curbs down the road,” said Zhang Xiaoxi, a Beijing-based analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. “Chinese regulators wouldn’t be comfortable with any financial activities staying outside their purview.”
No punches were pulled in November when authorities squashed the initial public offering of billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant, stunning investors from Shanghai to New York. The world’s most-valuable fintech has become a symbol of the no-holds-barred campaign underway, with Ant executives considering a plan that would make the firm more like a bank, subject to tighter oversight and higher capital requirements.
Authorities have told Ant it needs to get closer to its roots as a provider of payment services, while at the same time putting online transactions under oversight.
China’s central bank last week warned that any firm with more than 50% of the market in online payments or any two with more than two thirds could face antitrust probes and in a worst-case scenario be broken up. Ant’s Alipay and Wechat Pay are the biggest players in mobile payments, though the regulator has yet to clarify how it will judge market share.
Years of a head-to-head rivalry between Ant and Tencent dented profitability of the businesses and transaction growth has fallen to less than 10%, from more than 60% two years ago. Still, the data and user stickiness from payments has enabled the firms to diversify into other financial segments, which are now being put under supervision one after another.
Analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). predict new rules could include a cap on how much financial groups can partner with online lending platforms, and funding and capital requirements. Chen Shujin, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc., said regulators could also further crack down on their distribution of mutual funds and other wealth management products, standardize calculations on interest rates and force data sharing with the central bank’s credit-scoring system.
The People’s Bank of China said in January that it needs to move fast to fill the gaps in oversight, including banning over-hyped marketing of financial products online and encouragement of excessive borrowing. Guo Wuping, head of consumer protection at the banking regulator, has said easy access to online credit led many low-income and young people to be mired in debt.
Concerns about surging consumer debt have long unnerved authorities seeking to sustain the nation’s economic rise. Over the past decade, the speed with which Chinese households accumulated leverage surpassed every other major economy, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Consumer loans climbed to a record 49 trillion yuan ($7.6 trillion) in November, stoked by a housing boom and ready access to credit. But the official data doesn’t capture all the risk as loans offered on fintech platforms are mostly uncounted.
Ant has been at the forefront of the boom, providing small, unsecured loans to about 500 million people. Out of the about 1.7 trillion yuan in consumer loans it has underwritten, only about 2% were kept on its balance sheet with the rest with the rest funded by third parties or packaged as securities and sold on.
Its success spurred a crowd of imitators both large and small.
Rival units of Tencent, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and nearly 7,200 other micro-loan operations are scattered across China, nearly twice the 4,000 traditional banks and even surpassing the number of peer-to-peer lending platforms at the peak.
If what happened to the peer-to-peer lending industry is an indicator, the future for the vast majority of those fintech firms is bleak. In just two years, China purged the entire industry, which in its heyday had upwards of $150 billion in loans outstanding and more than 50 million users.
Once hailed as an innovative way to match yield-chasing savers with cash-strapped borrowers, P2Ps proliferated, helping fund everything from honeymoons and property purchase to companies’ working capital. Frauds and defaults became rampant, in some case leading to suicide and street protests.
Jack Ma, who never dabbled in peer-to-peer, attempted to draw a line between the sector and his empire during a speech at the Bund Summit in Shanghai in October. “We can’t dismiss internet technology’s contribution to financial innovation simply because of what happened to P2Ps,” he said.
Once the sector came in for special scrutiny, even the biggest players such as Lufax and Dianrong.com weren’t spared, with the banking regulator saying in November that none of the platforms had survived the clampdown.
Officials have had a more measured approach to choking off shadow banking -- often loans masquerading as investment products. A lifeline for many small enterprises and property developers shunned by traditional lenders, the sector swelled to $10 trillion at its peak, driving up leverage and interconnectedness across the economy.
A subsequent crackdown shrunk assets managed by a hodge podge of institutions from banks to insurers and trusts by $1 trillion between 2017 and 2019, forcing a record surge in bad loans. The government eased some curbs last year to stabilize the economy after the coronavirus pandemic struck, halting its contraction.
Seen as necessary to ensuring financial and social stability in the world’s second-largest economy, the latest regulatory charge isn’t without risks. Easy access to credit has helped fuel consumer spending, boosting the economy and building wealth. The sweep against fintech firms also comes as officials are trying to make the economy more self-sustaining and they will need consumption and business investing to pull off the shift.
For now, financial stability remains the overarching concern.
“Fintech has not changed the nature of finance as a risky industry,” Deputy Governor Pan Gongsheng said in an op-ed in the Financial Times on Wednesday. “China is trying to strike a balance between encouraging fintech development and preventing financial risks via prudent regulation.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks suffered their biggest one-day percentage drop in three months on Wednesday, adding to losses after the latest Fed statement as major indexes were also pressured by a slump in Boeing (NYSE:BA) and a selling of long positions by hedge funds.
Shares of videogame retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc each more than doubled on Wednesday, continuing a torrid run higher over the past week, as amateur investors again piled into the stocks, forcing short-sellers such as Citron and Melvin to abandon their losing bets.
""It's a dangerous game to play from both sides of the spectrum, whether you're long or short,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""You get close enough to the fire you're going to get burned.""
After briefly paring losses, declines accelerated in the wake of the policy statement from the Federal Reserve. The central bank kept overnight interest rate near zero and made no change to its monthly bond purchases, as was widely expected, and pledged to keep that support intact until a full economic rebound is in place.
""Given the continued concerns around COVID and disappointingly slow rollout of the vaccine, the US economy is likely to lose momentum in the first quarter of the year,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors in London.
""Yet with fiscal stimulus having taken over from monetary policy as the only game in town, it was always doubtful the Fed would announce any new actions this month.""

Each of the three major U.S. indexes saw their biggest daily percentage decline since Oct. 28. The declines also pushed the benchmark S&P index into negative territory for the year. 
 Boeing Co  fell 3.97% and was among the top drags on the Dow after the planemaker took a hefty $6.5 billion charge on its all-new 777X jetliner due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the aftermath of a two-year safety crisis over its 737 MAX.
In a week packed with quarterly earnings from mega-cap companies,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) initially rose after its results as the software maker continues to benefit from remote working and learning trends globally but erased most of those gains as part of the broader market slump and ended up 0.25%.
Microsoft's results did set a positive tone, however, for other technology-related companies including Apple Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which reported quarterly numbers after the closing bell.
Facebook shares edged up 0.68% while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2.10% after the close as the social media giant and electric automaker reported results. Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) also dipped in extended trade after its results. [nL1N2K22EX]
These heavyweight majors have recently come back into favor after blowout results from streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), and as investors dumped economy-linked banks, energy and small-cap stocks.
But concerns about heightened stock market valuations, rising coronavirus cases and uneven distribution of vaccine rollouts have heightened investor worry about a pullback and increase in volatility in the near-term.
The CBOE Market Volatility index, often used as a gauge for investor anxiety, closed at a high of 37.21, its highest since Oct 30. 
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc was a bright spot on the day, as shares rose 4.05% after the drugstore chain named the outgoing chief operating officer of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Roz Brewer, as its CEO.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 23.42 billion shares, well above the 14.31 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.36-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 158 new highs and 22 new lows.

As of this week, it had 2.9 million participants, who call themselves ""degenerates."" On the other side are funds like Citron and Melvin, which had to exit their short positions in GameStop after heavy losses. Covering the short positions by selling other long positions could have contributed to Wednesday's drop in the broad market. 
In a statement late Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it was ""aware of and actively monitoring"" ongoing market volatility in options and equities markets.
The five shares soared again on Wednesday, pushing the SPDR® S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) up 11% to a 52-week high.
GameStop surged 126%, AMC rose 293%, BlackBerry rose 34%, Express rose 200% and Koss jumped 560%.
Massive trading volume in these stocks caused disruptions on online platforms such as TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and Schwab. Some brokers have put trading restrictions on the shares, and the exchanges have halted some of them for trading multiple times because of volatility.

(Reuters) - AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc said on Wednesday it had raised $304.8 million by selling shares during an unprecedented social media-driven rally in its stock, though the U.S. movie theater firm could have raised about four times more by waiting one more day.
AMC was forced to raise capital to stay afloat after its ticket sales plunged 80% in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. It staved off bankruptcy last year thanks to a debt restructuring deal with its lenders and private equity firm Silver Lake. 
Shares of Leawood, Kansas-based AMC rose a cumulative 41% on Monday and Tuesday, as amateur investors, many of them organized online in forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBest, decided to take on hedge funds shorting the stock. 
AMC disclosed on Wednesday that it had sold $304.8 million worth of stock on Monday and Tuesday, at an average price of $4.81 per share. 
The company's shares, however, jumped as much as 310% on Wednesday as the speculative frenzy intensified. They closed at $19.90 a share, about 301% higher on the day. Had AMC sold the same number of shares at that price, it would have raised $1.26 billion.
Although AMC could decide to sell more stock in the coming days, the money it left on the table shows how the speculative rally of the last few days in heavily shorted shares, particularly those of video retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), presents both an opportunity and a challenge for companies.
An AMC spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

AMC, which also operates Britain's Odeon cinemas, said on Monday it had already raised enough money to rule out a potential bankruptcy. Through a combination of debt and equity issuance, it has raised $917 million since the middle of December to help cushion the blow from the pandemic.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Wednesday reported mixed fourth-quarter as earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates on weaker margins. The company said, however, it expected a faster pace of growth for 2021.  
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 5% in after-hours trade following the report.
Tesla announced earnings per share of 80 cents on revenue of $10.74 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.04 cents on revenue of  $10.47 billion.
""After Tesla’s unprecedented run in 2020, investors are showing great faith in the company’s ability to consistently beat expectations. If that happens, it will justify a strong bull case for Tesla, but that has been built into the stock price,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar. ""What investors are really looking for is another big target for car deliveries in 2021, that will show that demand for EV is accelerating globally and Tesla has the manufacturing capability to fulfil it even during the pandemic.""
Margin growth fell short of estimates even as vehicle average selling prices declined 11% compared with the same period last year. 
Automotive margin grew to 24.1% from 27.7% in Q3, missing consensus of 27.2%. 
Total deliveries were up 71% to 179,757, driven by a sharp increase in model 3/Y deliveries.  
Model 3/Y deliveries rose 88% to 163,660 and Model S/X deliveries fell 10% to 16,097 for the quarter from a year earlier.
Looking ahead, Tesla said that over a multi-year horizon it expected to achieve faster than 50% average annual growth in vehicle delivers, though expected even faster growth in 2021.

Investing.com -  The Dow fell Wednesday, shrugging off the Federal Reserve's accommodative remarks on monetary policy as investors digested mostly downbeat corporate earnings.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.05%, or 634 points. The S&P 500 was down 2.61% while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.50%.
The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate in a range of 0% to 0.25% and maintained its $120 billion monthly pace of bond purchases. ""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,"" Powell said.
The central bank reiterated that the path of the economy will ""depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations,""  though acknowledged that ""the ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity.""
Major Dow component Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 4% following a wider than expected quarterly loss of $15.25 per share. The loss was largely driven by an $8.3 billion hit relating the ground of the 737 Max and a delay in the 777-X program.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) slumped more than 6% as the coffee chain reported U.S. same-store sales fell 5% in its fiscal first quarter owing to the impact of further restrictions to curb the spread of the virus.
Chipmakers were also under pressure, down more than 2%, paced by weakness in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) despite posting better-than-expected earnings of 52 cents per share.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), however, bucked the trend, ended slightly higher after reporting earnings of $2.04 a share that markedly beat analyst estimates thanks to growth in its cloud business Azure.
The slew of earnings come ahead of quarterly reports from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) due after the markets close on Wednesday.
Heading into Tesla's report, analysts have earmarked guidance on deliveries as key to further support the electric vehicle's growth story.
""A positive guide on 2021 deliveries, combined with commentary that will reinforce the growth narrative, could serve as a positive catalyst for the stock, even despite its robust valuation,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note.
Energy was the only sector in the green as oil prices turned positive as data showed weekly U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly dropped.  
Investor attention was also captivated by an ongoing short-squeeze on Wall Street, led by a cohort of mainly retail traders, coalescing on Reddit forums, who appear to bidding on stocks with short-interest that exceeds the float.
Melvin Capital and Citron Research, both of whom were sellers of GameStop (NYSE:GME), were forced to close positions on the video game retailer's shares with huge losses following a more than 700% rally in the stock.  
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) short sellers were also caught up in squeeze as the stock rallied 300%"

Investing.com -- Amid a short squeeze in certain retail stocks, the broader market tumbled on Wednesday on weak earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 700 points at their worst in the afternoon and the S&P 500 shed more than 2.8%.
The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate in a range of 0% to 0.25% and maintained its monthly pace of bond purchases, saying the recovery will depend “significantly” on the course of the coronavirus, including progress on vaccinations.
It’s a major week for earnings, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) later in the afternoon Wednesday.  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA)fell 4% after a bigger than expected quarterly loss, and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) fell 6% on falling same store sales.                                                                             
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1.  Airlines earnings
On Thursday,  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Company (NYSE:LUV) report earnings. Travel did increase in the final months of the year but it’s going to take several quarters for airlines and other travel companies to make up their losses from the pandemic shutdowns.
American is expected to report a loss of $4.11 a share on revenue of $3.89 billion. Southwest is expected to report a loss of $1.67 a share on revenue of $2.12 billion.
2. Fast food giant profits
The pandemic was good for take-out fast food, and that should be good news for McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD). The burger and fries giant is expected to post profit of $1.78 a share on revenue of $5.36 billion.
3. The short squeeze game
It’s been the story of the week and promises to keep on giving. A huge battle between professional and retail traders continues to play out in the shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC), BlackBerry Ltd (NYSE:BB)  Express Inc  (NYSE:EXPR), and Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS) -- the five most popular stocks on Investing.com.
All five have notched eye-popping gains in the last few days, and massive trading volume in their shares has caused disruptions on online platforms such as TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and Schwab. Some brokers have put trading restrictions on the shares, and the exchanges have halted some of them for trading multiple times because of volatility. 
The craziness lifted the retail ETF, SPDR® S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT), to a new 52-week high on Wednesday.

This translated into distributable earnings per share of $1.13, outperforming analysts' average estimate of 89 cents, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.Blackstone's stock was up 3% at $66.78 in afternoon trading in New York on Wednesday. 
""They are entering 2021 with substantial momentum especially in insurance,"" said JMP analyst Devin Ryan. 
""There may be market volatility in the near term and short-term risks to performance, but they're well positioned to navigate it given that we just went to through a real life stress-test.""During the quarter, Blackstone completed the $14.6 billion sale of BioMed Realty Trust, America's largest private owner of medical office buildings, and the divestment of its 36% shareholding in UK insurer and annuity provider Rothesay Life. A sharp rise in investment income helped Blackstone report net income of $748.9 million under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), up 55% from the previous year. 
Blackstone said its private equity portfolio appreciated 10.6% in the quarter, compared with an 11.7% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index over the same period. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose 4.3% and 5.5%, respectively. 
On Tuesday, Blackstone agreed to acquire most of the life insurance business of U.S. insurer Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) for $2.8 billion. The deal is expected to increase Blackstone's assets under management by $28 billion.Blackstone said it expects to do more deals with insurance firms given prevailing low interest rates. ""What's driving what you're seeing us do and a number of firms in our industry is theextremely low level of interest rates out there, which is creating the need for greater returns for insurance company assets,"" Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said in conference call with analysts on Wednesday.Blackstone's total assets under management rose to $618.6 billion, from $584.4 billion in the previous quarter, driven by strong fundraising. It ended the quarter with $147.7 billion of unspent capital. 

Blackstone said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 96 cents per share.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 03:21PM ET</span>","Lurching from crisis to crisis, Boeing delays 777X with demand hobbled","By Eric M. Johnson and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co took a hefty $6.5 billion charge on its all-new 777X jetliner as it posted a record annual loss on Wednesday due to the coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath of a two-year safety crisis over its 737 MAX. 
The results cap a tumultuous year for the world's largest aerospace company during which the pandemic erased demand for the industry's largest jetliners just as Boeing fights to emerge from the nearly two-year grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX after fatal crashes. 
Boeing said it now expects the 777X, a larger version of the 777 mini-jumbo, to enter service by late 2023, three years later than initially planned, with a longer and costlier certification process after scrutiny over the 737 MAX. 
Boeing is making ""prudent design modifications"" to the 777X, including hardware changes to the actuator control electronics, in response to regulator expectations, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun told analysts. 
""2020 was a historically challenging year for our world,"" he said. 
Boeing shares fell 3% against a slightly lower Dow Jones Industrial Average.
INVENTORY 
Calhoun said Boeing has sufficient liquidity to manage the downturn but sounded a note of caution on the smoothness of vaccine distribution and an early summer rebound in air travel.
The historic slump in air travel and expanded inspections over production defects has halted deliveries of some 80 787s to airlines so far, cutting off a key source of cash and raising the prospect of a reach-forward loss as Boeing works to clear an inventory of about 450 737 MAX jets. 
Boeing said it expects to resume handing over 787s to customers later this quarter, with none in January and few in February, though analysts say deliveries are not expected to recover to 2019 levels until at least 2024.
The company reaffirmed plans to hit a sharply-reduced production rate of 5 787s per month in March, when it will consolidate production at its South Carolina factory, a decision first reported by Reuters.
Boeing, which has delivered some 40 737 MAXs from its stored inventory, is also sticking with plans to reach a production rate of 31 737 jets per month by the beginning of 2022, though at least one analyst expects that to slip to early 2023.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) lifted its own 22-month 737 MAX flight ban on Wednesday, as did Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), following a move by U.S. counterparts in November and Brazil and Canada afterward. 
China, which was first to ban the plane after the second crash in March 2019 and which represents a quarter of MAX sales, has not said when it will act.
Even so, Boeing said on Wednesday it expects to win remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals in the first half of 2021. 
Demand from China also been curbed by years of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, though industry sources have expressed cautious hope for a revived deal now U.S. President Joe Biden is in office, following a pattern of government-brokered Chinese jet orders coinciding with transfers of power or diplomatic resets.
Calhoun earlier told CNBC he was ""optimistic"" about new big plane orders from China, although industry sources have cautioned that demand remains thin despite Chinese traffic rebounding more quickly than elsewhere.
Boeing unveiled $8.3 billion in operating charges on Wednesday, including a $468 million charge for abnormal 737 production costs, $275 million over KC-46 aerial refueling tanker production issues, and $744 million linked to its 737 MAX settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over a fraud conspiracy charge.
The company's net loss rose to $8.44 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.01 billion a year earlier, taking its full-year loss to a record $11.94 billion.

Revenue fell 15% to $15.30 billion in the quarter.

1671,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 02:27PM ET</span>","Biden Says Climate Policies Will Add U.S. Jobs, Improve Health","(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden depicted his climate policies as an employment plan for the U.S., arguing that fighting warming global temperatures and carbon pollution by improving infrastructure and transportation technology will add millions of jobs.
“Today is climate day at the White House which means that today is jobs day the White House,” Biden said Wednesday.
In the short-term, however, the president took a series of actions regarded as adversarial by the fossil fuels industry, among them halting the issuance of new oil and natural gas drilling leases on federal lands. His administration seeks to leverage federal regulations and purchasing power to fight climate change.
“In my view we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis,” he said before signing directives mandating the federal government to incorporate climate change considerations in everything from federal purchases to national security.
The actions he took on Wednesday, he said, will “supercharge our administration’s ambitious plan to confront the existential threat of climate change.”
Shifting to cleaner methods of transportation and power generation while reinforcing U.S. property and infrastructure against extreme weather from the changing climate would add millions of “good paying union jobs,” he said.
The sweeping actions represent Biden’s opening foray to respond to a crisis his administration has described as on par with the coronavirus pandemic and systemic racial inequality. The president will host a global climate summit on April 22 -- which is Earth Day -- and has ordered a review of fossil-fuel subsidies and emissions targets.
“This is a case where conscience and convenience cross paths,” he said. “When I think of climate change, I think of answers to it, I think of jobs.”
The pause on new leases was a flashpoint during the presidential campaign, with former President Donald Trump attacking Biden regularly on the stump for a move that Republicans argue could kill jobs in states where fracking and oil drilling are key industries. About 22% of total U.S. crude supplies and 12% of U.S. natural gas came from federal lands and waters in 2019, according to the Energy Information Administration.
But Biden sought to court progressive supporters by promising to make a push to combat climate change a key part of his agenda. The White House has said the economic effects of acting on climate can be mitigated if tax subsidies for oil and gas companies are redirected to new, greener industries. But that effort -- like many of Biden’s climate proposals -- is likely to face opposition in Congress, where Democrats hold only narrow advantages in both chambers.
“We’re not going to ban fracking,” Biden said.
Biden’s order directs federal agencies to purchase zero-emission power and automobiles, such as electric vehicles, as a way to “leverage the federal government’s footprint and buying power to lead by example,” according to a White House fact sheet. The U.S. maintains a fleet of 645,000 vehicles and operates nearly 10,000 buildings, according to the General Services Administration.
The Biden Administration is also planning to create new government commissions focused on climate, job creation and environmental justice. Biden will establish a climate-focused civilian conservation corps along the lines of the program created by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression.
And Biden is committing to conserve 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030 and revitalize communities that have borne the brunt of pollution. It is unclear what form those protections might take but conservation could involve designating areas as wilderness, refuges or national monuments -- and walling off industrial development or even hiking and other recreational activity. And the goal could even encompass private land, as Biden directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture to consider ways to encourage climate-friendly agricultural practices that help store carbon.
Environmental groups applauded the moves, saying they would restore forests and wetlands while reducing carbon output.
“Pausing new oil and gas leasing will improve the health of our communities, our climate and our wild places,” said Athan Manuel, director of Public Lands Protection at the Sierra Club.
But critics, including energy companies and lawmakers from Western states that could be impacted by the leasing freeze, warned the actions would result in job losses.
Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon, a Republican, said the president’s moves “will divide and alienate the very working-class American communities with whom the Biden administration has pledged to unite.”
“It is clear President Biden has caved in to a loud segment of the Democratic Party that is pushing to require all policies and decisions to meet a litmus test of climate change, regardless of consequence,” Gordon said in an emailed statement. “There are bipartisan solutions available that support the people working in oil and gas on federal lands as well as reduce carbon emissions.”
Biden’s move is already being challenged in court. The Western Energy Alliance said it had filed a lawsuit in a Wyoming-based U.S. district court arguing that a leasing halt is an “arbitrary and capricious” move that violates federal laws, including a statutory requirement to hold quarterly sales of onshore leases.

Investing.com -  The Dow fell Wednesday, as sea of red swept through Wall Street on mostly weaker quarterly earnings, while an unchanged Fed decision did little to alter market direction. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.30%, or 403 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.59%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.13%.
The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate in a range of 0% to 0.25% and maintained its $120 billion monthly pace of bond purchases. The central bank reiterated that the path of the economy will ""depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations,""  though acknowledged that ""the ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity.""
Major Dow component Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 4% following a wider than expected quarterly loss of $15.25 per share. The loss was largely driven by an $8.3 billion hit relating the ground of the 737 Max and a delay in the 777-X program.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) slumped more than 6% as the coffee chain reported U.S. same-store sales fell 5% in its fiscal first quarter owing to the impact of further restrictions to curb the spread of the virus.
Chipmakers were also under pressure, down more than 2%, paced by weakness in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) despite posting better-than-expected earnings of 52 cents per share.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), however, bucked the trend, rising more than 1% after reporting earnings of $2.04 a share that markedly beat analyst estimates thanks to growth in its cloud business Azure.
The slew of earnings come ahead of quarterly reports from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) due after the markets close on Wednesday.
Heading into Tesla's report, analysts have earmarked guidance on deliveries as key to further support the electric vehicle's growth story.
""A positive guide on 2021 deliveries, combined with commentary that will reinforce the growth narrative, could serve as a positive catalyst for the stock, even despite its robust valuation,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note.
Energy was the only sector in the green as oil prices turned positive as data showed weekly U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly dropped.  
Investor attention was also captivated by an ongoing short-squeeze on Wall Street, led by a cohort of mainly retail traders, coalescing on Reddit forums, who appear to bidding on stocks with short-interest that exceeds the float.
Melvin Capital and Citron Research, both of whom were sellers of GameStop (NYSE:GME), were forced to close positions on the video game retailer's shares with huge losses following a more than 700% rally in the stock.  
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) short sellers were also caught up in squeeze as the stock rallied more than 200%"

“Our team is of course -- our economic team including Secretary Yellen and others -- are monitoring the situation,” Psaki told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. She called the unusual trades in the video-game retailer “a good reminder, though, that the stock market isn’t the only measure of the health of our economy.”
A retail-investor frenzy over the company has caused GameStop’s shares to soar in recent weeks, squeezing hedge funds with large short positions in the company.
Shares in the video-game retailer more than doubled as of 1 p.m. in New York, triggering at least two volatility halts as it at one notched its biggest-ever intraday advance. GameStop has surged eightfold in the past week, adding almost $20 billion to its market value.

GameStop’s meteoric rise has captivated Wall Street, as an army of small traders spurred on by Reddit message board posts have pushed the company’s stock price to unheard-of levels. Shares in the company began the year at just $19. Hedge funds who held short positions in GameStop, such as Melvin Capital, have closed out of them as the rally continued, suffering billions of dollars in losses.
While some commentators have cast the frenzy as a populist uprising against Wall Street institutions, others see a dangerous play that could eventually leave investors exposed to major losses. Some wondered if it was the result of purposeful market manipulation.

Investor Michael Burry, who previously championed GameStop in 2019, called the current phenomenon “unnatural, insane, and dangerous.”

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",Private sector body unveils multi-billion ambitions for carbon offsets,"By Susanna Twidale
LONDON (Reuters) - A private sector task force on Wednesday unveiled plans to turn the small voluntary carbon offset market into a global standard that could direct billions of dollars from companies aiming to meet net zero targets into projects to cut emissions.
Multinational companies, such as e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) have set net zero emission goals but will need to buy or generate carbon credits to offset the emissions they cannot cut from their operations.
“The question for us is how do we get the cash out of the hands of those companies that are making net zero commitments... into the hands of people that can actually reduce or remove carbon from the environment,” Bill Winters CEO of Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) and chair of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets told Reuters.
He was speaking as the body on Wednesday launched its blueprint for scaling up the market at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum. 
Currently offsets, generated through emission reductions such as planting trees or switching to less polluting fuels, trade in a voluntary market, often on a project-by-project basis.
This could be scaled up to a market worth $5-$50 billion by 2030, depending on the prices achieved, by creating more transparent, liquid and standardised contracts, the report said.
""To have a pricing benchmark will add real legitimacy to the market,"" Winters said. 
The task force plans to launch a governance body to set the contract standards that Winters said could comprise representatives from non-governmental organisations, large emitters and investors.
Standardised spot and futures contracts, meeting the core carbon standards set, should be traded on exchanges with the market hopefully launched within a year, Winters said.
Greenpeace earlier on Wednesday said the plans could hand oil majors and airlines an excuse to pollute for longer and jeopardise international climate goals.

The task force has more than 50 members including buyers and sellers of carbon credits, standard setters and financial institutions.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",U.S. private prison revenue under pressure from new Biden rules,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW) and the GEO Group, two of the largest U.S. private prison companies, could lose as much as a quarter of their revenue, about $1 billion a year between them, under new limits on the sector from President Joe Biden.
Shares in GEO Group and CoreCivic took a hit on Tuesday after Biden signed an executive order to roll back the U.S. government's use of private prisons, a part of what he called an initiative to tackle systemic racism.
Tuesday's action left both stocks near their lowest levels in more than a decade. Both had recovered some of those losses on Wednesday morning, but remained near decade lows.
Biden's current order applies to the Justice Department's federal contracts with private prisons, which would include facilities used by the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service, though the order did not specifically name those agencies. 
At GEO Group, U.S. Marshals and Bureau of Prisons accounted for 23% of total revenue in 2019, or about $570 million.
In 2019, CoreCivic earned 5% of its total revenue from its federal contracts with the Bureau of Prisons and 17% from the U.S. Marshals, or a total of about $440 million. 
The largest customer in 2019 of both companies was U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)), accounting for 29% of CoreCivic's business and 22% of GEO Group's. The order does not apply to the Department of Homeland Security and therefore not to ICE facilities.
In response to requests for comments, both CoreCivic and GEO Group said the executive order would not mean big changes for their businesses.
""The (Bureau of Prisons) has experienced a steady decline in inmate populations over the past several years, so (Tuesday's) announcement was no surprise,"" said a CoreCivic representative.
A representative from GEO Group said the Bureau of Prisons had already announced steps over the past four months to not renew expiring contracts because of declining federal prison populations, in part due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
""Given the steps the BOP had already announced, yesterday's executive order merely represents a political statement,"" he said. 
Shares of GEO and CoreCivic had already been walloped in the past year as COVID-19 restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border and capacity restrictions for health reasons kept facilities they operate for ICE well below capacity.
Both stocks have fallen more than 80% since the early days of Donald Trump's presidency, when his hardline immigration policies filled ICE facilities with detained immigrants.
""(The new order is) not a positive for GEO Group or CoreCivic, but it also doesn't blow up the business model,"" said Joe Gomes, senior research analyst at Noble (OTC:NEBLQ) Capital Markets. 
Although the use of private prisons increased under Trump, activist and investor pressure had prompted some big Wall Street institutions to pull their support from the industry well before Biden's order.
In 2019, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and SunTrust - which had underwritten bonds or syndicated loans for CoreCivic and GEO Group - said they would stop financing private prison operations.
Neither prison company has raised money in public markets since 2019 and Biden's new order could increase credit risks, making it harder for either company to refinance debt.
GEO Group has a $250 million debt note due in January 2022, and CoreCivic has a $250 million note due in October 2022.

Both companies carry speculative-grade - or junk - ratings from Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and S&P, in part because their revenue is so susceptible to changes in government policy and public scrutiny of companies profiting from detention.

Investing.com -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) shares jumped 171% on Wednesday to a new 52-week high despite several trading halts and broker-imposed restrictions.
The shares reached above $14 and are up more than 600% this year. AMC is now positive over one year despite being one of the year's worst performing stocks.
The largest movie chain operator has been caught up in the same retail-driven short squeeze that has pushed shares of GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) into the stratosphere. StreetInsider said Wednesday that TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), the online broker, had put restrictions on trading in AMC and GME. The shares were also halted for trading on the stock exchange several times on Wednesday.
Earlier this week, AMC's CEO Adam Aron said bankruptcy was off the table because the company was able to raise $917 million in cash from stock sales and debt deals since mid-December. Like other movie chains, AMC has struggled with pandemic-related business shutdowns and is trying to ride out the bad times, hoping moviegoers return to the theaters soon. "

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>",GameStop fever sweeps Europe's most shorted stocks,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - Drugmaker Evotec led sweeping price swings in some of Europe's most shorted stocks on Wednesday in an echo of the retail trading fever that has gripped the United States.
The U.S. market moves have put piled pressure on professional short sellers, who sell shares on the expectation that they will fall and can be bought back more cheaply later.
Positions held by New York-based hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which has a 6.2% short on Evotec, have come under particular scrutiny and shares in the drugmaker rose by 30% at one point during the trading day in Frankfurt.
The fund led by Gabriel Plotkin is likely to have lost millions of dollars on video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) after a seven-fold rise in its shares.
Other heavily shorted stocks such as British publisher Pearson, cinema chain Cineworld and commercial property firm Unibail-Rodamco (AS:URW) also saw their shares spike, without any clear reason and no link to Melvin. 
Battery maker Varta and Polish video game firm CD Projekt, two Melvin shorts in Europe, also rose strongly on Wednesday, further extending this week's gains.
The moves echo the frenzy surrounding GameStop where buying by amateur investors has sent the stock sky-rocketing, leaving short sellers scrambling to cover their positions.
""This is one of the extremes we're seeing these days on markets which are flooded by a huge mass of liquidity and where unprofessional investors are ready to jump­ in the deep end,"" Banor SIM head of equities Angelo Meda said.
""Usually it doesn't last long but we don't really know. I don't rule out we could see other crazy things over the next few days,"" Milan-based Meda added. 
Evotec shares pared most of their initial gains but remained highly volatile and by 1517 GMT the stock was up 4.4% on the day, having already jumped 10% on Tuesday.
A spokesman said Melvin had closed out its GameStop position. Melvin declined to comment on its European positions.
""Melvin Capital has repositioned our portfolio over the past few days. We have closed out our position in GME (GameStop),"" the spokesman said in a statement.
Varta, in which Melvin has a 4.35% bearish bet, was up 5% and CD Projekt added 6%. These stocks rose 14% and 20% respectively in the previous two sessions.
Pearson gained 11%, Cineworld 9.5% and Unibail 10%.
""The need of some funds to cover the shorts combined with the increasing weight of quantitative strategies, has created a snowball effect,"" Michele Pedroni, senior portfolio manager at Decalia in Geneva, said.
IHS Markit data shows Cineworld, Pearson, Evotec and Unibail are among the top 12 most shorted stocks in Europe, with more than 12% of their outstanding shares currently on loan.
Among other top-twelve top shorts are medical device maker Ambu, whose shares also joined the rally, while oil company Premier Oil, the most shorted stock in Europe with 21% out of loan, escaped the trading frenzy.
