(Reuters) -General Dynamics Corp on Wednesday had a mixed quarter as the defense giant missed analyst revenue estimates but beat their fourth-quarter profit estimates, helped by strong growth in its aerospace unit, even as supply chain bottlenecks and labor chain shortages lingered.
Shares were down 1% in pre-market trading on Wednesday. 
U.S. President Joe Biden has not signaled he plans to slash the 2023 budget for General Dynamics (NYSE:GD)' biggest customer, the Pentagon, despite progressive Democrats calling for a reduction in military spending and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Demand for business aviation stayed strong in the last three months of 2021, helped by easing travel restrictions, higher vaccination rates and the lure of private flights.
In the quarter the company delivered 39 Gulfstream business jets versus 40 a year ago. In October, the company said it planed to deliver 40 in the fourth quarter.
Sales in General Dynamics' aerospace unit which makes Gulfstream jets rose to $2.56 billion from $2.44 billion a year earlier, while overall revenue fell to $10.29 billion from $10.48 billion.
Net earnings fell to $952 million, or $3.39 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1 billion, or $3.49 per share, a year earlier. 
Analysts, on average, expected the company to post a quarterly profit per share of $3.37, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The company beat its own October annual earnings per share guidance of $11.50 by $0.05.
The results come a day after  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp beat analyst estimates for quarterly profit, encouraged by easing restrictions around the globe.

The newly released iPhone 13 helped Apple out-sell Chinese rivals Vivo and Oppo after Huawei Technologies Co. plummeted down the rankings, Counterpoint Research said in a report Wednesday. Apple’s sales in the country surged 32% even while the overall domestic market shrank 9%, hurt by chip shortages and an economic slowdown that have constrained both production and consumer demand.
The shuffle marks a shift in market dynamics after U.S. curbs on technology exports crippled Huawei’s smartphone business, briefly the world’s largest. The Chinese networking giant was forced to spin off mobile arm Honor in 2020, which ranked fifth in the quarter after Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp. Apple’s Chinese market share hit a record 23% in the final three months of 2021, Counterpoint estimated.
“Apple’s stellar performance was driven by a mix of its pricing strategy and gain from Huawei’s premium base,” research analyst Mengmeng Zhang said in the report, which estimates sales of phones to end-users rather than shipments.
Globally, smartphone demand may remain depressed as inflationary pressures, an economic downturn and a slowing replacement cycle dampen sales, while a persistent chip shortage curtails output. Apple is said to have told its component suppliers that demand for the iPhone 13 lineup has weakened, signaling that some consumers have decided against trying to get the hard-to-find item.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had secured undertakings from the U.S. tech giant to inform customers upfront about auto-renewals for Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass subscriptions. That would help gamers avoid paying for services they no longer use.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also agreed to provide clear and timely information on price hikes, and help inactive Xbox customers end their subscriptions if required and claim a pro-rata refund, the CMA said.
""Other companies offering memberships and subscriptions that auto-renew should take note, and review their practices to ensure they comply with consumer protection law,"" Michael Grenfell, executive director of enforcement at the CMA, said in a statement.
Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company earlier this month agreed to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $69 billion.
The CMA has recently clashed with Big Tech firms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) over its acquisition of Giphy, and has criticised Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for what it considers as using their market power to create largely self-contained ecosystems.

(Reuters) - Soaring menu prices could be slowing U.S. customer visits to McDonald's, which reports fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, as Americans face rampant inflation and restaurants struggle with staffing shortages amid the spread of the Omicron variant.
U.S. restaurant prices broadly rose 6% over the past 12 months – driven by wage increases and higher costs for everything from meat to kitchen equipment – leading analysts to caution that weary customers may begin to trim fast-food spending. 
Franchisees can set their own prices, which vary by region, with a Big Mac, soft drink and large fries costing nearly $10 in New York City.
McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), among the first major restaurant chains to report fourth quarter results, is expected to report a 6.9% increase in U.S. comparable sales growth, down slightly from estimates of 7% two weeks ago. It reported 9.6% growth in the third quarter.
The chain's U.S. menu prices have increased 2.7% over the last three months, according to Gordon Haskett analysts. Some McDonald's franchisees now say more expensive sandwiches are hurting foot traffic and sales, according to independent analyst Mark Kalinowski's survey of operators, published Monday.
""Is there an inflection point at which customers start deciding it's not worth paying $9.50 for a burrito, it's not worth paying $7 for a hamburger?"" said Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop. 
Weekly visits to many fast-food restaurants have been falling in recent weeks, according to Placer.ai, which tracks cell phone location data. McDonald's visits started dropping in mid-December and fell 12.6% in the week ended Jan. 10 versus 2019 levels, the analytics firm said. 
And fast-food menu prices could increase another 6% to 8% in 2022, according to Wedbush Securities.
To be sure, consumers have had pent-up spending power after saving money at the start of the pandemic and later getting cash injections from government rescue aid. Several chains including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) and Popeyes' parent company Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc have so far reported little resistence to higher menu prices. 
""We haven't seen much pushback yet on the price taken in 2021,"" Restaurant Brands CEO Jose Cil said during an investor conference on Monday. ""The key is not to get too far ahead of the consumer.""
Restaurants face multiple pressures including COVID-related staffing shortages, limited seating and reduced hours on top of bad winter weather and normally slow January sales.

McDonald's is expected to use its new digital rewards program to grab market share from smaller rivals, including Restaurant Brands' Burger King. 
McDonald's huge scale lets it ""defray the costs of really heavy investments in technology across an enormous sales base and swallow those costs better than a lot of smaller peers,"" Dunlop said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Budget airline Wizz Air warned its fourth-quarter loss would likely top the 213.6 million euros ($241.2 million) third-quarter hit reported on Wednesday, before an expected recovery takes off fuelled by demand from Britain. 
The Hungary-based carrier said the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant had hit sales in the latter part of its fiscal third quarter, and it expected to be impacted by ongoing travel uncertainty in January, February and part of March.
European airlines have been on a rollercoaster ride over the last year as governments dropped, and then sometimes reimposed, restrictions that increased both the cost and hassle of travel in a bid to contain waves of the pandemic. 
CEO Jozsef Varadi told Reuters Wizz Air had cut costs and acquired new landing slots, meaning it was in a stronger position to compete with the likes of Ryanair and easyJet (LON:EZJ) once the long-expected recovery comes. 
He said the airline had seen demand jump in Britain after the government announced an easing to restrictions on Monday. As a group it expects to operate 50% more capacity in August and September than the pre-pandemic 2019 summer. 
""We are expecting a very strong recovery path of demand in the next few months,"" he said. 
Ryanair said earlier this month its confidence levels had undergone a ""sea change"" in recent weeks, as the perceived threat from Omicron eases and public attitudes to travel improve. EasyJet reports on Thursday.
Varadi noted, however, that input costs were rising, with fuel, wages and regulatory changes all adding pressure, meaning that fare prices would need to go up in the short term.
While Ryanair said it expected fares to rise due to lower available capacity, after airlines failed or shrank, Varadi said he expected there to be overcapacity in the next three to six months as rivals return to the market. 
He said the question for 2022 would be which airline had the most efficient cost base to offer competitive prices while juggling higher input costs. Wizz Air had liquidity of 1.4 billion euros at the end of December. 

 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said the update was in line with expectations but noted that solid passenger numbers came with weak pricing. Wizz Air's shares were up 2.5% in early trade.

(Reuters) -Gopuff, the SoftBank Group Corp -backed delivery startup that was valued at about $15 billion last year, has tapped banks to lead preparations for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO), people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
U.S.-based Gopuff, which operates in 1,000 cities in the United States and Europe, is working with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on its planned stock market float, which is expected later this year, the sources said. It also plans to tap other underwriters, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the sources added.
The sources cautioned that the timing, valuation and size of the IPO were subject to market conditions. All sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential.
Gopuff, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment.
The sources said that GoPuff is expecting to be valued at a significant premium to its $15 billion valuation from a fundraise in July https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/gopuff-valued-15-billion-after-raising-funds-global-investors-2021-07-30. Gopuff was valued at just $4 billion in an October 2020 fundraising.
The company also issued a convertible note in December to raise $1.5 billion from existing investor Guggenheim Investments and other debt holders, the sources said. The note will convert to equity at either the IPO price or at a maximum valuation of $40 billion, the sources added.
Gopuff is pushing ahead with its IPO preparations and is expected to be among the biggest flotations this year, despite market conditions that are less than ideal for stock market launches.
Volatility has caused a number of IPOs to be postponed while other companies have been forced to rethink their plans. IPO bankers, however, say the pipeline for deals is still healthy.
Founded in 2013 by college students Rafael Ilishayev and Yakir Gola, Gopuff has grown into one of the largest on-demand delivery startups. It business was aided by widespread lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic that forced people to rely on online delivery platforms.
Headquartered in Philadelphia, Gopuff delivers items like food, alcohol and medicines at a $1.95 flat delivery charge, and competes with other delivery platforms like Instacart and Rappi, both of whom are also expected to go public this year.
Gopuff has 600 mini-warehouses. By owning the inventory and end-to-end supply chain, Gopuff aims to make its business more profitable. Earlier this month, it launched its first private-label brand.
Gopuff has raised more than $3.5 billion in equity funding to date, counting Accel, Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Fidelity Management and singer Selena Gomez among its prominent backers.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Hygiene products group Essity reported a bigger-than-expected drop in fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday and said it planned to further hike prices in the face of record high costs for raw material, energy and distribution.
Operating profit at the world's second-biggest maker of consumer tissue fell 34% from a year earlier to 2.75 billion Swedish crowns ($297 million) despite an 11% rise in sales. Five analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average forecast a 3.33 billion crown profit.
The Swedish group, which sells consumer tissue such as toilet paper and napkins under a large number of brands including Lotus, Tempo and Vinda, announced plans to raise prices in all product categories and markets this year to compensate for the substantially higher costs.
""We do not expect a decrease in the historically high costs for raw material, energy and distribution in the near term,"" Chief Executive Officer Magnus Groth said in a statement.
""Price increases are therefore essential.""
The timing and size of the planned price increases would be managed locally, according to the company, which is also the global leader in hygiene products for businesses with the Tork brand and in incontinence products with TENA.
Its shares were down 3% in morning trade.
Groth told analysts and journalists in a conference call he expected most raw material costs to start to stabilizing in the current quarter, while energy would keep rising significantly compared with the fourth quarter. 
Essity, a rival to Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), proposed a dividend of 7 crowns per share for 2021, up 4% from the year before.

Kimberly-Clark is due to report earnings later on Wednesday.

Investing.com -- Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 2.3% in Wednesday’s premarket trade following a report by Counterpoint Research that the company is now the biggest seller of smartphones in China, the world’s largest market for the devices.
Apple commanded a 23% share in China in the December quarter, its highest ever, the report said. The last time the iPhone-maker was the biggest vendor in the country in a quarter was during the fourth quarter of 2015.
Apple surpassed Vivo to be China’s top original equipment manufacturer. Realme was the fastest-growing brand. Four out of five smartphones sold in China in the three months to December were 5G capable.
According to Counterpoint, smartphone sales in China declined 9% year-on-year for the third consecutive quarter in December quarter. Full-year smartphone sales fell 2% for the fourth consecutive time with component shortages being one of the reasons behind decline.
Senior Analyst Ivan Lam also pointed out that China’s average smartphone replacement cycle is becoming longer.
“Smartphone designs within brands have also become more homogeneous, especially in hardware, failing to motivate consumers to upgrade. Lastly, China has been experiencing a complex economic environment where exports are driving the growth and domestic spending remains lackluster,” Lam said.
Leadership in the Chinese smartphone market has been changing rapidly with Oppo topping the charts in the first quarter of 2021 with the next two quarters going to Vivo, which was then toppled by Apple.  
On a full-year basis, Vivo’s 22% share was the highest in the Chinese market in 2021, followed by Oppo (21%), Apple (16%) and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACY)."
14,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 06:45AM ET</span>",Wall Street Zeroes In On Just How the Fed Might Drain Liquidity,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street analysts have been busy war-gaming just how quickly the Federal Reserve might start shrinking its balance sheet. Now attention is also turning to exactly which parts of the financial system it could suck the most liquidity from as it reverses its pandemic-era stimulus.
That matters because it could determine how disruptive the so-called quantitative tightening process is to financial markets as well as how long it might go on for. If and when the Fed starts to shrink its balance sheet -- whether by simply not replacing maturing securities  or outright asset sales -- there will be an increase in the amount of Treasuries in search of a home. Most of these are likely to be hoovered up by banks or money-market funds, which in turn will need to reduce the amount of cash they have parked in different ways at the Fed in order to purchase them.
If it’s mainly the banks, that could result in a significant drawdown in the amount of reserves that lenders hold with the U.S. monetary authority. Conversely, if it’s money funds, then there will likely be a drop in how much is squirreled away with the Fed’s overnight repurchase agreement facility. Of course, it will likely be a combination of the two, but whether one or the other takes the brunt will be important and is currently being debated by analysts.
It’s also a question that Fed officials, who are meeting this week to decide on their next moves, may struggle to answer, as it depends on how various market players react to the central bank’s policy steps.
A big shift in bank reserves is potentially the more problematic outcome and could curtail how long QT lasts -- and how small the Fed balance sheet ultimately gets. If the biggest impact is on the banks, then there is a risk of repeating some of the reserve issues that took place in late 2019 following the last round of quantitative tightening, according to Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities in New York. 
Back then, a drop in reserves below the system’s comfortable level helped fuel a disruptive spike in rates on repurchase agreements, a keystone of short-term funding markets. The Federal Reserve has since then implemented additional tools to help reduce potential problems in this area, but a decline in reserves could nevertheless create risks and forestall how much the central bank chooses to shrink its balance sheet. 
If bank deposits decline faster than expected, there could also be a mismatch in lenders’ securities portfolios, which might spark more widespread de-risking and result in institutions selling securities at a time when the Fed is also stepping away from the markets. 
A reduction in the balance of the so-called RRP, which currently stands near $1.6 trillion, would likely be more benign, and the unwinding process could continue for a while, according to Misra.  
Just where the liquidity drains from then is a key question, and one on which interest-rate strategists are divided:

PARIS (Reuters) - French luxury group LVMH is expected to post strong fourth quarter sales on Thursday, following a slate of solid earnings from rivals that showed steadfast demand for high-end fashion and accessories from pandemic-weary consumers.
The group's powerhouse labels Louis Vuitton and Dior are expected to drive a 16 percent rise in sales at constant exchange rates over the all-important holiday spending period, according to consensus estimates.
The group's fashion and leather goods division - which accounts for half of revenues - is set to extend its dominance of the sector, with an estimated market share of 21% compared to 16% before the pandemic, according to UBS forecasts.
The division's profit margin is seen at around 40%, one of the highest in the industry. 
The world's largest luxury group has brands spanning Hennessy cognac to cosmetics retailer Sephora. It has strengthened its position during the pandemic in areas such as jewellery, with its purchase of Tiffany, whose importance for the overall group is expected to grow as LVMH invests in marketing to take on rivals like Richemont's Cartier. 
The group's earnings release comes after others in the sector including Prada (OTC:PRDSY), Richemont, Burberry and Tod's, pointed to unabated appetite for high end goods through the end of last year. 

The luxury industry bounced back strongly from the health crisis last year, even if international travel, a key growth driver in pre-pandemic times, has not fully resumed, with brands doubling up on efforts to reach consumers locally and through digital channels. 
Sales over the last three months of the year at LVMH are expected to come in at around 18 billion euros, or 17% above their pre-pandemic level in 2019.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) navigated pandemic-related supply chain issues better than rivals at the end of 2021, likely helping the iPhone maker surpass Wall Street revenue growth targets of 6%, some analysts estimate.
Apple, which is set to post quarterly earnings on Thursday, was buoyed by strong iPhone 13 sales globally, sales in China and continued growth in Mac shipments, several analysts told Reuters. 
The market is closely watching earnings at Apple, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other tech companies to see if they quell the sell-off that has wiped out nearly $3 trillion in value from the Nasdaq 100. Investors are dumping tech stocks on fears that the Fed will hike interest rates fairly aggressively and erode the value of their future earnings. Some are concerned that the surge of pandemic at-home tech buying will not last as conditions improve.
""We expect Apple to reach its highest market share in China since Apple entered the market in 2008,"" said analyst Nicole Peng of Canalys. 
Investment firm Wedbush Securities forecasts record iPhone sales of more than 40 million units during the holiday period from Black Friday to Christmas.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates total holiday quarter iPhone shipments at 83 million, representing a 4% increase from the previous year.
Wall Street analysts expect Apple to post about $118.7 billion in revenue, representing 6.48% year-over-year growth, and quarterly earnings per share of $1.89, according to Eikon data as of Tuesday.
Apple posted a rare revenue miss in the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 25, which Chief Executive Tim Cook https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-results-hit-by-supply-chain-woes-cook-says-holiday-quarter-impact-will-be-2021-10-28 attributed to pandemic-related supply constraints and manufacturing disruptions that together cost the company an estimated $6 billion in sales.
Cook at the time forecast an even bigger drag in the holiday quarter, but analysts expect strong growth compared to competitors in the just-ended quarter, which began days after Apple started shipping the iPhone 13.
""Since Apple has many customized components going into the iPhones, Macs, Apple Watch and others and the scale (volume and price) at which it procures, Apple has been able to lock-in suppliers’ capacities to timely produce those parts with lesser delays,"" said Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research.
Shah added that Apple is seeing the highest demand for iPhones since the 2015 ""supercycle.""
Smaller rivals are struggling to keep up with production, leading to Apple market share gains in regions such as China, said Angelo Zino of CFRA Research in a research note.
Apple has said it expects iPads to be its only product with lower sales compared with a year ago due to supply constraints. Analysts say Apple likely prioritized iPhone units for components.
Preliminary holiday quarter data from IDC indicates almost 9% growth in Mac shipments, compared with a 1% rise in the PC market as a whole.
Analysts played down concerns about the impacts of the Omicron variant surge, saying closings of some retail stores did not likely have a big impact on Apple's online-heavy business. Analysts also are watching for signs that rising Omicron cases in China could impact Apple's production.

Apple, the first company worth $3 trillion https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/apple-gets-closer-3-trillion-market-value-2022-01-03, has been losing value along with the broader stock market. Apple stock has fallen 10% this month and the S&P 500 index has dropped 9%.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display (NYSE:LPL) Co Ltd on Wednesday reported a 30% drop in quarterly operating profit as a one-off cost related to profit-sharing plan and lower TV panel prices offset solid shipments of smaller screens for computers, laptops and smartphones. 
The Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier posted an operating profit of 476 billion won ($397.64 million) for the October-December quarter, down from 678 billion a year earlier.
It missed an average analyst forecast of 588 billion won compiled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. LG Display said that excepting a year-end one-off cost involving sharing profits with executives and employees, its result was in line with market expectations. 
Revenue rose 18% to 8.8 trillion won. 
During the quarter, prices of 55-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) panels for TV sets fell 37% from the previous quarter, market data from TrendForce's WitsView showed. 
However, only 27% of its sales came from television panels during the quarter, analysts noted. 
Solid shipments of high-end LCD panels for notebooks and monitors, whose prices declined by less than LCD TV panel prices in 2021, as well as higher-margin OLED panels for smartphones and TVs, should support LG's results this year, analysts said. 
LG Display said its shipments of advanced organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels jumped more than 70% in 2021 and the display maker reached break-even in its OLED business. 
""The stay-at-home demand for notebooks, tablets and other devices is expected to gradually fall as COVID-19 lengthens and distancing rules ease,"" said Kwon Jae-young, vice president and head of medium-small display marketing division. 
""However, back-to-office and corporate demand from gradually improving economies is expected to increase, so overall demand for such devices in 2022 is expected to remain similar to 2021."" 

LG Display shares ended down 0.7% versus the wider market's 0.4% fall.

19,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 06:16AM ET</span>",Analysis-Will the games stop? SEC mulls crackdown on trading apps,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year after the ""meme stock"" rally humbled hedge funds and roiled Wall Street, U.S. regulators are studying ways to crack down on psychological prompts used by Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Inc and other commission-free brokers to promote frequent stock trading on smartphone apps. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started scrutinizing commission-free brokers like Robinhood, Webull Financial LLC and SoFi Inc last year after retail investors drove GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other ""meme stocks"" sky high in Jan. 2021. 
The furious rally pushed GameStop shares up more than 1,500% at one point and created a ""short squeeze"" that burned hedge funds that had bet against shares of the video game retailer. Shares of movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and other companies also soared.
At the height of the frenzy, several brokers restricted trading in the meme stocks, infuriating investors. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and other executives were hauled https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-usa-congress/long-tense-with-cat-photo-for-relief-how-the-gamestop-hearing-unfolded-idUSKBN2AI1C4 before U.S. Congress to testify.
The SEC has found that many brokers, as well as roboadvisors, increasingly use analytics driven by artificial intelligence, video game-like features and other behavioral prompts to encourage stock trading or to sell certain products.
Trading contests, points and rewards are just some of these techniques. There are also lively sounds and bright colors, notifications, social networking tools, and curated lists of trading and investment ideas, among other practices. 
""The SEC has been very concerned that many younger investors, many of them too young to legally drink alcohol, are instead getting intoxicated by digital engagement in the market,"" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer, adding the industry is likely to push back hard.
""It is likely to have a war on its hands.""
Commission-free brokers say they are democratizing investing, making it easy and fun for anyone to trade. In a blog post on Tuesday evening, Robinhood said it had added resources to help customers learn investment basics.
Critics say commission-free brokers try to maximize retail trading volumes because they earn lucrative fees for routing orders to wholesale market-makers. This could be a conflict of interest; studies show retail investors generally lose money when they churn their portfolio.
""Americans are bombarded every day by behavioral prompts ... the brokerage apps and the roboadvisors are doing that as well,"" SEC chair Gary Gensler told CNBC last week. ""Their motivation is to make more revenues.""
On Wednesday, Gensler said in a statement that he was looking forward to the staff's recommendations on digital engagement practices, without elaborating.
In an August consultation https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-markets-regulator-wants-public-feedback-firms-digital-engagement-practices-2021-08-27, the SEC suggested that digital prompts may sometimes constitute an investment recommendation that falls under Regulation Best Interest. That 2019 rule requires a broker-dealer making a recommendation to act in the best interest of the retail customer and identify conflicts of interest. 
If the SEC went that route, firms that use digital engagement tools would probably have to make extensive new disclosures. That compliance burden would complicate their business and could make them more vulnerable to lawsuits.
""It could conceivably be a game-changer,"" said Fischer.
NOVEL TERRITORY?
At the time of the meme stock rally, there were more than 100 million retail users/accounts combined open at six of the top online brokerages, Reuters reported last year. 
A survey by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which has also stepped up scrutiny of game-like trading features, found that of investors who opened an investment account in 2020, 66% were new to investing. 
Industry groups, including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), say digital engagement practices can be beneficial for investors, for example when they are used to steer them to save more money or invest long term. 
In an October response to the SEC's consultation, SIFMA also said it believes that in the vast majority of interactions, the use of digital engagement practices would not constitute a recommendation, based on ""well-established"" guidance.
Some experts who support regulation concede the SEC is veering into novel territory, noting there is limited research into how digital engagement practices directly affect investor decision-making. 
Financial institutions have the best data on the issue but little incentive to share it widely, said Edwin Hu, a research fellow at New York University and a former SEC official. 
""One key question is whether user interface design can be considered investment advice and to what extent interface design affects investment decisions at all. This is a very difficult empirical and legal question the SEC faces,"" said Hu.
Studies on the gambling and gaming industries suggest that noises, bright colors and other sensory details that aim to replicate real-world stimulation ""steer users to act,"" said James Fielder, a professor at Colorado State University. 
""If...you build these experiences into trading as if it is a game, but with real money on the line, then it's a big deal."" 

Some experts worry digital engagement practices are growing so sophisticated that they may generally increase trading without obvious individual prompts. That could mean the Regulation Best Interest approach may be insufficient, the SEC's internal investor advocate, Rick Fleming, has warned. 
""If Reg BI proves to be inadequate to protect investors, I believe the Commission should go back to the drawing board so that its critical investor protections no longer rise and fall on whether the broker-dealer made a specific recommendation."" he added.

Investing.com -- Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) was up 1.7% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after the company won an antitrust appeal in more than a decade-long case in Europe.
The European Union’s General Court in Luxembourg on Wednesday struck down much of a 2009 finding by EU’s regulator that Intel’s trade practices prevented rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) from competing. Intel was accused of abusing its dominant position by issuing loyalty rebates and payments to thwart competition.
The ruling nullifies the $1.2 billion fine issued by the EU’s antitrust regulator. It comes at a time when many tech giants, several of them American, find themselves in the crosshairs of the European regulators, with charges ranging from being anti-competitive to invading privacy to compromising user data.  
The Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed lawyers as saying that the ruling could put a greater burden on the European Commission in pursuing some antitrust cases. The Commission has been attempting to expand its reach through new regulations and a reinterpretation of its existing powers, WSJ said.
Intel is due to report its fourth-quarter numbers after the close of trade. Profit per share is expected to be 90 cents on likely revenue of $18.33 billion. Fourth-quarter revenue in 2020 was $20 billion and adjusted EPS was $1.1."

LONDON (Reuters) -Asset manager Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, part of German insurer Allianz, said on Wednesday it had set up a new unit focused on 'impact' investing in private markets, as part of a sustainable investing drive.
AllianzGI, which manages around 647 billion euros ($730.27 billion) in assets, will look to invest in private companies helping solve environmental or social issues in a measurable way, it said in a statement.
Interest in companies performing better on such measures has surged in recent years as more investors expect such investments to reduce risk and drive stronger returns, particularly as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. 
Impact investing, meanwhile, takes that a step further by tracking the impact of the investments on people and the planet, not just the company's returns.
The new team of 12 will be overseen by Matt Christensen, Global Head of Sustainable and Impact Investing, AllianzGI added.
""Investors want to see a positive change for the planet while generating a return, and impact investing offers a solution to these twin goals,"" Christensen said.
AllianzGI said it was also creating a new ""Impact Measurement & Management"" team, led by Diane Mak to help select the investments and assess their impact.
""The future growth trajectory of impact investing depends on asset managers demonstrating how the impact can be measured and reported,"" Christensen said.
The COVID-19 pandemic drew attention to deepening social inequality which brought impact investing to an ""inflection point,"" the head of Singapore's Temasek Holdings said last year.
Last week, Swedish private equity firm Summa Equity said it raised $2.6 billion for Europe's biggest-ever impact fund.
The Texas-based private equity firm TPG, which went public earlier this month with a more than $10 billion valuation, also has an impact investing arm, and raised a $5.4 billion for its first climate-focused impact fund.[nL4N2P32MJ]
The fund, called TPG Rise, recently led a $170 million funding round in Israeli cleantech company UBQ Materials, which turns household waste into bio-based plastic for use in industries such as construction and carmaking.
AllianzGI's announcement comes as Tibetan activists demand that the group drop its sponsorship of the Beijing Winter Olympics over allegations of human rights abuses in China.

Allianz said it had been in contact with activists and that it was committed to supporting the values of the Olympics.

Investing.com – Texas Instruments stock (NASDAQ:TXN) traded 4.6% higher in premarket Wednesday as the company projected a 14% revenue growth at the top end in the current quarter, a strong forecast given supply constraints and lack of raw materials have meant a rough few months for semiconductor makers.
On the lower side, revenue would still grow around 5%.
""TI's first quarter outlook is for revenue in the range of $4.50 billion to $4.90 billion and earnings per share between $2.01 and $2.29. We expect our 2022 annual operating tax rate to be about 14%,"" TI's Chairman, President and CEO Rich Templeton said in a statement.
The company had clocked $4.29 billion revenue in the first quarter of last financial year.
TI’s forecast came after the maker of analog and embedded processing chips beat estimates in the fourth quarter. The company has widest reach in the industry, making its results a bellwether for electronics demand.
Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 19% to $4.83 billion, driven by strong demand in industrial and automotive markets. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 41%, automotive 21% and personal electronics 24% with each of the other segments contributing in single digit.
“We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive,” Dave Pahl, TI’s vice president and head of investor relations, told analysts in a conference call.
Customers in these two segments are turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end-products smarter and more efficient, which will drive faster growth in chip demand to these segments, he said. The company said it will boost its chip-making capacity to cater to the segments.
Fourth-quarter net income of $2.27 per share beat expectations of $1.95.

The company is trying to split increases in the cost of copper and other materials with its customers, CEO Jun Seki said. 
""Delays in negotiations to increase product prices were a reason for the profit drop,"" Chairman and founder Shigenobu Nagamori said at a briefing.
Both executives said they continued to work closely together, dismissing recent media reports that the company founder regretted hiring the former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co executive in 2020 to succeed him. 
Nidec posted an operating profit of 44.3 billion yen ($388.90 million) for the three months to Dec. 31, down from 46.4 billion a year earlier. The result fell short of an average 49.9 billion yen profit estimated by five analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
However, the company stuck to its full-year forecast for operating profit of 190 billion yen. The prediction is lower than an average forecast of 193.5 billion yen based on estimates from 22 analysts, Refinitiv data shows.
Nidec is known for building motors for computer hard drives and smartphones, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones, but has said it wants to capture around a third of an expanding market for energy-saving electric car motors known as e-axles. 
Monthly sales of those motors built at plants in China more than doubled to almost 25,000 units in December compared with a year earlier, according to Nidec. They now account for a fifth of sales second only to sales of motors used in appliances and industrial machines.
Nidec will invest 300 billion yen over the next three business years to further bolster EV motor production, Nagamori said. The company was also considering the possibility of making its owns semiconductors to ensure component supplies as it expands its automotive business.

The company plans to begin mass production at a new plant in Europe from next business year that is a joint venture with Stellantis, which was formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY).

(Reuters) - Grupo Aeromexico SAB de CV is nearing the finish line of its restructuring with a proposed plan to reduce debt by more than $1 billion, but must first overcome opposition from junior creditors who say existing shareholder Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), among others, is benefiting from the deal at their expense. 
The Mexican airline, after nearly two years in bankruptcy, will make its case for the plan in a New York bankruptcy court on Jan. 27.
Aeromexico, which in June 2020 filed for Chapter 11 protection in the United States with $2 billion in debt, says it has secured the votes needed from its creditor classes to move forward with the deal despite lingering objections from some groups.
The plan, which Aeromexico says will result in a total enterprise value of $5.4 billion and preserve 13,000 jobs, would give its largest creditor, Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), the largest stake https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/aeromexico-shareholders-back-capital-increase-restructuring-plan-2022-01-17 in the company. But the committee representing general unsecured creditors, some of whom could see just pennies on the dollar, says the plan unfairly benefits insiders.
The committee, which includes a pilots union, Falko Regional Aircraft Limited, Nordic Aviation Capital and the trustee to a group of noteholders, argues that the deal must be held to higher standards than a typical Chapter 11 settlement because insiders are involved. 
It said the voting results only show one class of general unsecured creditors in support of the plan because the company used a “loophole” to value certain claims lower than what the creditors say they are worth. Aeromexico, however, said creditors could have challenged that arrangement before the voting procedures were approved but failed to do so.
The plan improperly gives insiders a chunk of the reorganized entity’s equity, the committee said. That value, the committee asserts, is coming “primarily out of the recoveries” of junior creditors.
The insiders that the committee takes issue with are Delta, which was Aeromexico’s majority shareholder and is slated to emerge from the deal with a 20% stake https://www.reuters.com/article/aeromexico-bankruptcy/delta-to-receive-20-of-new-shares-of-aeromexico-under-restructuring-plan-idUSKBN2I720W, and four Mexican individual shareholders who are also board members.
The committee argued in court papers that neither Delta nor the four individuals have provided adequate contributions to the restructuring in exchange for that equity.
“We have supported Aeromexico throughout the chapter 11 process and our proposed participation in the plan of reorganization would help Delta optimize our long-term relationship with Aeromexico, provide substantial benefits to our customers and secure many jobs for our people,"" a Delta spokesperson said.
The committee said it would support a plan that includes some distribution to insiders as long as it offers fair recoveries to unsecured creditors.
Representatives for Aeromexico and the committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Another group of unsecured creditors, including Invictus Global Management, also filed papers urging the judge overseeing the bankruptcy to reject the plan. They also argue that the Aeromexico plan was “dominated by conflicted insiders.”

Though Invictus opposes the plan, the judge recently ruled that it could not use $47.3 million in claims it purchased last summer to vote against the plan because the prior holders of the claims had already committed to supporting the deal. Invictus is appealing that ruling.
Aeromexico was one of three major Latin American airlines to file for bankruptcy in the United States in 2020, alongside Colombia's Avianca SA and Chile's LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) Group SA.

Investing.com -- Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded 3% higher in premarket Wednesday after its Cloud business powered ahead in the second quarter to emerge as its biggest business and the world’s second-most valuable company held out hope of the momentum continuing.
Total revenue rose 20% year-on-year in the second quarter to near $52 billion, propelled by 26% growth in the company’s Intelligent Cloud business that topped $18 billion in sales. This is the first time quarterly revenue at the software giant has crossed $50 billion.
Microsoft forecast Intelligent Cloud revenue of $18.75 billion-$19 billion for the current quarter, driven by “strong growth"" in its Azure platform as more clients shift their operations to digital and need its Cloud to aid that pivot.
CEO Satya Nadella has now placed the company’s Cloud business in a formidable second behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) plays catch-up.
Jefferies analyst Brent Thill told Reuters that the company’s guidance of a sequential rise in Azure revenue is a strong assurance.
Other businesses grew in strong double digits too, although the company’s third-quarter projections for them pointed out to growth slowing sequentially.
Productivity and business processes grew 19% to $16 billion, and the company said it will, at best, hit $15.85 billion revenue. Within the vertical, LinkedIn revenue was up 37% while Office 365 Commercial revenue rose 19%. The company closed December with over 56 million Microsoft 365 subscribers.
Windows OEM revenue rose 25% as the world’s most popular operating system rode the surge in demand for PCs and laptops. Xbox content and services revenue increased 10%. Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs jumped 32%. The company is projecting third-quarter revenue in the More Personal Computing business to come in between $14.15 billion and $14.45 billion. The vertical booked $17.5 billion revenue in the second quarter.

(Reuters) -Microsoft Corp on Tuesday forecast revenue for the current quarter broadly ahead of Wall Street targets, driven in part by its Intelligent Cloud unit. 
The outlook soothed concerns about growth sparked by results for the December quarter, which initially dragged on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s shares in after-hours trade. But the shares reversed course following the outlook, trading 3% above the closing price.
Investors were seeking assurances that the enterprise cloud business is still growing strongly and got it from Microsoft.
""So the quarter itself was, ho hum. Good, but not as great as we've seen past quarters,"" said Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies. ""But then the guidance for the third quarter really turned the tape around and saved the Nasdaq, if you will.""
Thill said Microsoft's guidance that Azure revenue would be up sequentially was strong assurance that cloud demand was solid. 
Microsoft forecast Intelligent Cloud revenue of $18.75 billion-$19 billion for its fiscal third quarter, driven by ""strong growth"" in its Azure platform. That compared with a Wall Street consensus of $18.15 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Thill said the strong momentum for cloud computing benefiting Microsoft will likely also be reflected in upcoming results for rivals Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
Microsoft delivered strong outlooks in other areas, too.
The More Computing unit expects revenue of $14.15 billion-$14.45 billion for the third quarter, ahead of the Wall Street target of $13.88 billion, and Productivity and Business Processes of $15.6 billion-$15.85 billion compared with the consensus target of $15.72 billion.
Full-year operating margins are forecast to be up slightly from the previous year.
Microsoft's total second-quarter revenue beat expectations but Azure revenue growth of 46% was only in line with analyst expectations as compiled by Visible Alpha. The Azure growth showed a steady drop from fiscal 2020 when growth was in the 60% range. 
Microsoft has become one of the most valuable companies in the world https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-set-hand-crown-worlds-most-valuable-company-microsoft-2021-10-29 by betting heavily on corporate software and services, especially its cloud services and the movement to the web of its Outlook email and calendar software, known as Office 365, which benefited from the switch to working and learning from home during the pandemic. Demand for cloud services from Microsoft and rivals Amazon.com and Alphabet also benefited from the pandemic-fueled shift online. 
Revenue from Microsoft's biggest segment, which offers cloud services and includes Azure, its flagship cloud offering, rose 26%, while the business that houses its Office 365 services increased 19% in the quarter. 
Net income rose to $18.77 billion, or $2.48 per share, from $15.46 billion, or $2.03 per share, a year earlier.
The company said revenue rose to $51.73 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $43.08 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $50.88 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Investors are also focused on Microsoft's proposed $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-buy-activision-blizzard-deal-687-billion-2022-01-18, announced on Jan. 18, a huge expansion for its gaming division. It also broadens the company's efforts in the so-called metaverse, or the merging of online and offline worlds, which will have corporate and consumer applications.

Microsoft said the Activision Blizzard deal would help boost Xbox content and services revenue. Growth has fallen sharply from a high in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 when Xbox content and services grew 65%. In the past quarter, revenue rose 10%, while in the year-ago quarter it rose 40%. 
""They have a ton of great content and franchises. And that's where that revenue would eventually come in when the deal lands, for sure,"" said Brett Iversen, general manager, investor relations at Microsoft, referring to the Activision deal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department said Tuesday a global survey of semiconductor chip producers and users shows a shortage will persist, sparked primarily by wafer production capacity constraints.
The voluntary survey of 150 companies last fall in the supply chain confirmed ""there is a significant, persistent mismatch in supply and demand for chips, and respondents did not see the problem going away in the next six months.""
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters that the department ""in a few instances didn't really get what we needed and we're going to go company by company and do personal engagement and get what we need.""
Raimondo said in November that she had spoken to ""all of the CEOs in the supply chain - including Samsung (KS:005930), TSMC, SK - and all of the CEOs have pledged to me that they will be submitting robust and complete data flows to us.""
Some companies in Asia and governments had earlier expressed concern about the data request. Raimondo reiterated that the department could invoke its legal authority to get responses.
Taiwan's Economy Ministry, responding to the survey, reiterated that Taiwanese companies are working hard to produce chips and coordinating with ""important international business partners"" to strengthen supply chains.
""The Ministry of Economic Affairs and our country's chip makers attach great importance to cooperation with like-minded partners, and will continue to work together to build a safe, trustworthy and resilient supply chain, which should be able to gradually alleviate market growth demand in the next few years.""
TSMC, Asia's most valuable listed firm and globally the largest contract chipmaker, declined to comment.
The U.S. could compel foreign semiconductor firms with U.S. operations to answer detailed questions about the chips market.
Raimondo declined on Tuesday to say who did or did not comply. The department also said it was sharing its findings with foreign governments. 
The department said it had seen some unusually high prices among some chips used by automakers and medical device manufacturers.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut said strong demand for chocolate, in particular from chefs and caterers, lifted its sales in the three months to Nov. 30, allowing it to confirm its mid-term forecasts.
Global demand for chocolate confectionery recovered last year, and Barry Callebaut is benefiting from big food groups outsourcing chocolate production and smaller customers such as restaurants and bakeries also turning to it for upmarket chocolate supplies.
Sales volumes rose 8.9% to 610,048 tonnes in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021/22, ahead of underlying chocolate market growth of around 3.1%, the world's biggest chocolate maker said in a statement.
Sales revenue increased by 14% to 2.032 billion Swiss francs ($2.22 billion), the Zurich-based group said, adding the stronger rise was related to the inflationary environment as it raised prices to pass on higher costs to customers, which include Nestle and Hershey. 
""Excellent start into the new year,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said, highlighting 5% price increases and impressive growth in the gourmet division, boosted by restaurants.
Shares in the group, down 2% so far this year, were indicated to open 2.4% higher on the Swiss market.
Volumes in the group's chocolate business grew 9.6%, while its gourmet unit saw a stronger recovery from the pandemic, with volumes rising 33.8%, the chocolate maker said.
The group also confirmed its mid-term forecast of 5%-7% average volume growth and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) above volume growth over the three years to its fiscal 2022/23. 

Last week, Swiss peer Lindt & Spruengli reported a 13.3% rise in organic sales for 2021.

Stimulus measures from central banks and vaccinations lifted investor sentiment last year, helping asset managers such as Brewin after clients pulled out their money in masses during the initial stages of the pandemic when uncertainty loomed large.
The company's total income rose 8.9% to 104.4 million pounds ($140.96 million) in the three months to Dec. 31, with total funds at 59 billion pounds at the end of the quarter.
Brewin Dolphin, which was founded in 1762, said discretionary inflows during the period hit a billion pounds, with about 65% of it coming from new clients.
Record inflows last year had helped the company to post a nearly 17% rise in profit for the 12 months to Sept. 30, and the London-listed shares jumped 21% in 2021 after having lost about 18% of their value in 2020.
""The consistently strong fund inflows momentum we have seen since the second quarter last year, is testimony that our advice-focused strategy ... are supporting sustained growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Robin Beer said in a statement.

Some previous market tantrums over a looming tightening in policy made central bankers think twice about taking away hefty monetary support. Yet, for the Federal Reserve, concluding a two-day meeting later on Wednesday, things are now different.
With inflation raging at 40-year highs, the Fed is unlikely to backtrack on its intent to raise interest rates and will almost certainly flag a March rate hike later on Wednesday.
Yet, the almost 9% slide in the S&P 500 this month and the flattening of the U.S. yield curve are not good indicators of sentiment towards the economic outlook, and may temper the case for more hawkish stance from the Fed. 
The fine line between taking action to contain inflation but not tightening policy too fast that it brings the recovery to a quick end, is exactly the line Fed chief Jerome Powell has to walk. Markets will be watching his every step. 
Meanwhile, odds are split on whether or not the Bank of Canada will hike rates for the first time since 2018 when it meets later in the day. The bank may need to take Omicron's wrath into account while deciding whether to start a tightening campaign geared at taming red-hot inflation.
With central banks in the spotlight, Asian stock markets steadied after three sessions of losses. U.S. and European stock futures were higher. 
Geopolitical tensions were likely to remain in focus after U.S. President Joe Biden said he would consider personal sanctions on President Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine, as Western leaders stepped up military preparations and made plans to shield Europe from a potential energy supply shock.

39,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 01:50AM ET</span>","Analysis-Investors worry about hawkish Fed hurting growth, even theorize over next recession","By Davide Barbuscia
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Laser-focused on how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be in tightening policy, some U.S. investors and strategists are starting to worry about what may seem a distant threat: a sharp economic slowdown or even the next recession. 
Investors have been unnerved in recent days about the potential for a more hawkish Fed than previously expected. Some are concerned an aggressive interest-rate-hiking cycle, combined with a reversal of the U.S. central bank's bond-buying program, could cause too sharp a slowdown.
A hawkish stance by the Fed, which concludes its latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, has pushed up short-term rates, flattening the closely followed yield curve on U.S. Treasuries. 
""I am intently focused on the yield curve,"" said Matthew Nest, global head of active fixed income at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. ""The only way the Fed can bring down inflation is to slow demand, ... and in doing so it risks causing a recession or a sharp slowdown in growth. This dynamic is causing the yield curve to flatten and increasing strain in risk markets more broadly.""
The yield curve between 2-year and 10-year notes flattened to less than 75 basis points on Tuesday, the smallest gap since Dec. 28. 
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields retrenched this week as stocks tumbled, which was partly seen as a flight to safety but gave a measure of the delicate tightrope the Fed faces as it plans to start draining pandemic stimulus liquidity from the markets to fight surging inflation.
""The markets seem to be pricing concern about a localized, relatively short-term inflationary problem that results in Fed action that is ultimately damaging to the economy,"" said Michael de Pass, global head of U.S. government bond trading at Citadel Securities.
David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said last week in a research note that Fed tightening could lead to a correction in financial markets, though he said if this were to result in a U.S. recession it would be ""shallow and short-lived.""
The fears may seem distant as the economy has been regaining speed. According to a Reuters survey of economists, growth in 2021 could come in at 5.6%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.4% in 2020.
Gary Black, manager of the Future Fund Active ETF, said while just four to six weeks ago people ""were worrying about too much growth,"" they are now ""worried that they're nearing the R word,"" pointing to the move in the small-cap Russell 2000 index, which fell more than 20% from its record closing high on Nov. 8, before it reversed to move higher.
""That's the schizophrenic nature of this market,"" said Black.
Tobias Adrian, director of the International Monetary Fund’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said while there was some talk in the market about recession due to the yield curve's flattening, it was not expected. 
""We are expecting growth continues, slowing in coming years but positive,"" Adrian said. The IMF on Tuesday lowered its economic forecasts for the United States, China and the global economy.
NORMALIZATION?
Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest money manager, warned last week of the risk of a possible curve inversion in case of a fast pace of monetary policy adjustment by the Fed to curb inflation.
The last time the yield curve went negative, which historically has been an indicator that a recession will follow in one to two years, was in 2019. The coronavirus-driven U.S. recession lasted only two months, ending with a low point in April 2020.
Still, some investors said the rally in U.S. Treasuries over the past few days was a normalization after yields spiked too quickly since the beginning of the year, and that economic data do not point to an impending risk of recession.
""The market got ahead of itself and started pricing in a very aggressive Fed, and the curve flattened out a lot sooner than it would in prior cycles,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).

For Guneet Dhingra, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), the curve flattening has been exacerbated by demand from pension funds on the back end of the curve.
""I don't worry about the recession fear, based on the recent curve flattening. I do think it's more a function of technicals than fundamentals,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A year since a Reddit-driven retail trading frenzy rocked the markets and created the 'meme stock https://www.reuters.com/business/why-did-sec-release-report-gamestop-2021-10-18' phenomenon, leading U.S. lawmaker Nancy Pelosi's investments have become a meme in their own right.
Google searches for 'Pelosi stock trades' hit a record high earlier this month as users on social media platforms including Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Reddit, Youtube and TikTok scrutinize her investments, believing the U.S. Speaker of the House may have an edge on Wall Street.
Discussion of Pelosi's trades is a recurring theme on social media including 'wallstreetbets', the Reddit forum where retail investors banded together a year ago to coordinate frenzied buying https://www.reuters.com/business/flush-reddit-rally-gamestop-plots-store-revival-2021-07-22 of video games retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other companies, which eventually became known as meme stocks.
Trade disclosures filed by Pelosi, a multi-millionaire, are shared widely across social media soon after they appear on the House website. Companies she disclosed trades in last year include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Like other Congressional lawmakers, Pelosi is legally required to file disclosures of her stock trades. Her reports have garnered growing attention amid a massive uptick in retail trading - as well as recent calls to ban lawmakers from trading at all, a debate Pelosi has been pulled into in recent weeks.
On Monday, 27 House members signed a letter calling for a floor vote on recent proposals to prohibit Congress members from owning stocks ""in light of recent misconduct."" 
That was the latest push to ban stock trading by lawmakers after Pelosi in December defended their rights to trade. In a reversal, Pelosi last week signaled her willingness to potentially advance legislation that could ban stock trading by lawmakers. Last year, Pelosi filed transaction reports showing her husband, financier Paul Pelosi, made trades valued at as much as $5 million at a time in 'Big Tech' companies now facing an antitrust bill in Congress. Those companies are also among the most widely held across Wall Street, making investing in them relatively common. 
A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days. 
Transaction reports are typically filed days after the actual purchases and sales, making it potentially difficult for traders aiming to mimic lawmakers' specific trades.
""It's nonsense, it's very hard to replicate what other people are doing and gain some edge,"" said Sahak Manuelian, Managing Director of Trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
That has not stopped users on TikTok from focusing on her disclosures, with one video clip https://www.tiktok.com/@realmeetkevin/video/7047663843400600878?lang=en about her husband's recent options purchases in companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Roblox earning 45,000 likes.

Still, a recent analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that Congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.

Pelosi's performance ranked sixth-best in 2021, with Republican Congressman Austin Scott leading the way, according to the analysis.
The Justice Department ended investigations of stock trades by at least three senators ahead of the 2020 market slump, caused by the coronavirus pandemic, without filing charges.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 12:25AM ET</span>","Investors seek refuge in China as Fed, inflation roil other markets","By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Foreign investors are piling into China at the start of 2022, seeing it as a haven from the inflation, growth and pandemic problems plaguing most other markets.
Despite seeing returns last year eroded by Beijing's regulatory and policy purge, global fund managers are pumping money into mainland equities and bonds, betting China's stability pledges, monetary and fiscal easing and subdued inflation could shield them against volatility in other markets.
That's in stark contrast to conditions elsewhere. Major central banks are preparing to withdraw the excess stimulus measures of the past couple of years, and the Federal Reserve is hastening monetary tightening to tame runaway inflation, potentially undermining stock values and earnings.
For David Dali, head of portfolio strategy at Matthews Asia, China is the ""single favourite country"" in 2022 among the roughly 30 investible emerging equity markets. 
""We believe Chinese valuations are some of the least risky and most attractive of all major markets,"" Dali said. 
He cited factors including lesser regulatory headwinds, government readiness to stimulate the economy, and a political mandate to maintain stability in a year widely expected to confirm President Xi Jinping's unprecedented third term.
Fidelity International also sees China stocks as attractive from a global perspective.
""China's policy shift is very clear. And recent data offers signs that the economy has stabilised,"" Fidelity's Shanghai-based fund manager Zhou Wenqun said. 
Evidence of that bullishness is in foreign net inflows into Chinese stocks via the Stock Connect scheme, which hit a record-high daily average of $413 million during the first three weeks of 2022, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Flows were strong in 2021, with a record $67 billion invested through the Connect channel in onshore equities. But the mainland blue-chip index lost 5.2%, in contrast to a near 27% rise in the U.S. S&P 500 and double-digit gains in most European indices.
Bond investors, too, are drawn toward China, against the backdrop of a widening Sino-U.S. monetary policy divergence.
Bond markets typically perform badly in a rate hike cycle, but in China, ""we see that the monetary policy easing cycle is only at the start,"" said Paula Chan, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, who expects more rate cuts. 
China's ""inflation concern is not as alarming as in other countries"", and its bonds are a good hedge, she said. 
Robust foreign inflows have helped push the Chinese yuan to its highest level against the dollar in nearly four years this week, despite a slew of cuts in key interest rates to support the economy. 
In contrast, foreign money inflows into emerging markets outside China has ""come to an abrupt standstill"", the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said. 
In December, emerging markets (EM) outside China suffered an outflow of $9.6 billion, compared with an inflow of $10.1 billion for China. Chinese equities saw an inflow of $12.5 billion, contributing to most of the EM inflows.
For non-China EM，""we believe that the outlook is worsened by the Omicron variant and expectations of a stronger dollar and higher U.S. interest rates,"" IIF said, in its latest capital flows tracker report. ""Markets see China rebounding more quickly than other EMs.""

Foreign buying at the start of the year was concentrated in banking, materials and capital goods sectors, according to Morgan Stanley, which noted top stocks included China Merchants Bank, NARI Technology and Ping An Insurance Group.
UBS Securities said both foreign investors and domestic mutual funds had allocated to what they deem are hot themes, such as new energy and manufacturing.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning steadying after U.S. counterparts ended another volatile session. However, investors are on edge ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.46% by 9:06 PM ET (2:06 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.28%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.76%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.34% and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.88%.
Australian markets are closed for a holiday.
The S&P 500 closed near its lowest level since October 2021 on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq 100 underperformed.
The focus is squarely on the Fed’s policy decision, due to be handed down later in the day. The decision will be scrutinized for clues on an interest rate hike and asset tapering timetable, but it is widely expected that the former will begin in March 2022.
While the Fed could spur more selling if it takes a hawkish tone, Chairman Jerome Powell will likely say policy is data-dependent and supply chains are improving while indicating that inflation could be peaking, Optimal Capital portfolio strategist Frances Stacy told Bloomberg.
“I think what that’s going to do is potentially reassure markets that the Fed put is ready, willing and able... that could cause some serious enthusiasm and a short squeeze,” she added.
Other investors took a different view.
“A moderately hawkish Powell would be dovish in market terms. If he says that the Fed is committed to getting inflation on track and is still hopeful that a couple of hikes combined with some quantitative tightening will be enough, that is dovish by market pricing,"" Standard Chartered PLC global head of G-10 FX research Steven Englander said in a note.
However, global shares are already down over 7% in 2022 to date, and the prospect of central banks withdrawing stimulus, with the economic recovery from COVID-19 starting to slow down, could mean more market volatility.
The risk of a “growth shock” to equities is increasing, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its global economic expansion forecast for 2022 due to weaker prospects for the U.S. and China along with persistent inflation, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists warned.
However, Citigroup Inc. strategist Ed Acton took a more positive tone.
“For the Fed, the current risk-asset drawdown certainly makes their job more difficult, but we don’t see the level of financial conditions tightening as commensurate with a dovish message. Instead, the Fed may seek to underline the current inflation risks as a ‘constraint’ on monetary policy going forward,” he said in a note.
The Bank of Canada also hands down its policy decision later in the day, with the South African Reserve Bank following a day later."

45,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 08:51PM ET</span>",Analysis-A metaverse with Chinese characteristics is a clean and compliant metaverse,"By Eduardo Baptista
BEIJING (Reuters) - How will China's metaverse evolve? Look to the letter ""c"". Clean, censored, compliant and crypto-less is the view from experts.
The descriptions point to the long shadow thrown by Chinese authorities who have already intimated they will have a heavy regulatory hand in how it will develop - a shadow some China metaverse advocates fear will stunt its growth.
From Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $69 billion plan to buy Activision to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) changing its name to Meta Platforms Inc, much of the tech world is leaping to build what many expect will be the next generation of the internet: immersive virtual worlds that replicate many aspects of real life.
Experts say China's metaverse efforts lag countries such as the United States and South Korea, citing less investment by domestic tech giants. Industry-leading products like Meta's Oculus virtual reality (VR) headsets are banned in China and the slow development of attractive domestically made VR headsets has meant China has yet to see a VR platform or metaverse gain significant popularity. 
But interest has begun to surge. In the past year, more than 1,000 companies including heavyweights such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd have applied for around 10,000 metaverse-related trademarks, according to business tracking firm Tianyancha.
Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) broke new ground in December with the launch of ""XiRang"", described as China's first metaverse platform though it has been widely panned for not offering a high-level immersive experience. Baidu says its app is a work in progress.
Start-ups too are seeing more investment. In the three months to end-November, more than 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) was invested in metaverse-related ventures, far more than the 2.1 billion yuan of investment that China's VR and related industries attracted for all of 2020, according to Sino Global, a crypto venture capital firm focused on China.
""Investors and venture capital managers who hadn't talked to me in years were suddenly messaging - asking if I want to go for a meal and talk. They all want to talk metaverse,"" said Beijing-based Pan Bohang whose startup plans to launch a VR social gaming platform.
A REGULATED REALM
Experts say the infancy of China's metaverse allows Beijing plenty of room to co-opt its development, particularly since the current metaverse buzz has coincided with an unprecedented regulatory crackdown on tech and other industries.
""Traditional Chinese internet businesses developed first and were then regulated. Industries like the metaverse will be regulated as they are built,"" said Du Zhengping, head of the state-backed China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Communications Association's metaverse industry committee which was formed in October.
But China's authoritarian approach is at odds with how the metaverse is developing in other parts of the world where users are attracted to new ways of expressing themselves, and it will stifle growth, says Eloi Gerard, a VR entrepreneur who worked in China for 10 years before recently moving to Los Angeles.
""The metaverse is already a place where you have religious groups, LGBT movements, gathering all around the world and using the virtual world to share ideas, this is what people are doing on VRChat right now…it is crazy progressive and liberal,"" he said, referring to a popular San Francisco-based VR platform.
""The idea of the metaverse is that one moves between virtual worlds...this goes immediately against the idea of one party, one voice, one vision.""
Experts also note that gaming - considered the gateway technology to the metaverse - is tightly regulated in China.
Games must be approved by the government and while battle games are allowed, strong violent content such as the depiction of blood and dead bodies is banned, as is anything that can be construed as obscene. As part of their recent regulatory crackdown, authorities have also sought to rein in gaming by minors as well as excessive adulation of celebrities and money.
Gaming giants such as Tencent and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc have been quick to state publicly that they will comply with any rules while developing metaverse offerings.
THE GOVERNMENT'S REACH 
The long arm of the government looks set to be duly felt in other ways too. An influential app, Xuexi Qiangguo, which is required reading for many Communist Party cadres, published an article in November that said the metaverse should be used to improve the quality of mandatory ideological education classes for school children.
At a January meeting of Beijing's municipal political advisory body which discussed the metaverse's development, proposals included a registration system for metaverse communities aimed at preventing them from influencing wider public opinion and causing economic or financial shocks, according to a state media report.
And while crypto currencies have become a defining feature of many Western metaverse worlds - they are notably absent in China's metaverse as they have been banned by Beijing. Instead,the manifold forms of Chinese digital payment already in use, like the central government's digital yuan, will likely take their place.
Despite the many probable restrictions, some entrepreneurs say China's metaverse will flourish simply because of Chinese consumers' willingness to try new forms of online entertainment.

Nikk Mitchell, whose company is in talks about metaverse projects based on Chinese stories that will play up elements such as Chinese calligraphy and traditional costumes, is one such believer, noting progress in domestic VR glasses and content.
When Chinese consumers are ready to give this metaverse-related tech another shot, ""then there will be mass adoption at a level that I don’t think will happen in the West nearly as quick,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S auto safety regulators on Tuesday said they have sought additional information from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in its probe into 580,000 vehicles over the automaker's decision to allow games to be played by passengers on the front center touchscreen.
In December, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a preliminary evaluation into 2017-2022 Tesla Model 3, S, X, and Y vehicles over the vehicle's ""Passenger Play"" feature the agency said ""may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash.""
NHTSA wants records of any crash reports tied to the feature and for Tesla to furnish a chronology of events and studies supporting its risk assessment ""in employment of front seat non-driving related tasks from in-vehicle based devices even if the task is intended only for front seat passenger.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment
NHTSA said in December it has ""confirmed that this capability has been available since December 2020 in Tesla 'Passenger Play'-equipped vehicles."" Before then, the game feature ""was enabled only when the vehicle was in park.""
On Dec. 23, Tesla told NHTSA it would stop allowing video games to be played on vehicle screens while its cars are moving, the agency said.
Tesla informed NHTSA a software update will lock the ""Passenger Play"" feature and make it unusable when the vehicle is in motion, NHTSA said.
NHTSA asked Tesla to answer questions by March 4 including providing ""trip counts in which game use occurred while the shift indicator was in drive"" and include usage where vehicle sensors did not detect an occupant in the front passenger seat. It also wants data where ""gameplay was concurrent with any driver intervention measures or active safety measures.""
The agency in August opened a safety investigation into 765,000 Tesla vehicles over its driver-assistance system Autopilot after a series of crashes involving the system and parked emergency vehicles.
A preliminary evaluation is a first step before NHTSA decides whether to upgrade a probe to an engineering analysis, which must happen before the agency can demand a recall.

On Nov. 29, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz recalled 227 U.S. vehicles because the vehicle infotainment systems ""might allow activation of the television and internet display while driving, causing a distraction for the driver.""
In 2013, NHTSA issued guidelines to encourage automakers ""to factor safety and driver distraction-prevention into their designs and adoption of infotainment devices in vehicles.""

The 2023 hiring push would double the current number of engineers working in Latin America's largest country with a focus on ""local talents"" that could create products not only for Brazil, but for the world.
The job offers will be focused on the southeastern states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, the country's tech hubs, but with the possibility of remote work. 

Answering questions from Reuters via e-mail, Ribeiro-Neto also highlighted that the planned hires are part of a global expansion plan prioritizing Google's main markets outside the United States.
""With such a relevant market, we believe it is important to have more and more Brazilians at the forefront of the development of our technologies,"" he said, adding that Brazil is among the top five countries for the use of products such as Android, Chrome, YouTube and Maps.

The company, which also beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates, is boosting capacity as chipmakers try to plug the gap between demand and supply caused by the pandemic-fueled supply delays and a shift to working and learning from home.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) now plans to bank on opportunities and place ""additional strategic emphasis"" on the industrial and automotive segments, which roughly account for 41% and 21% of the company's annual revenue.
""It's very easily seen in the automotive market that there's content growth. We can see the cars today just have more semi content in them per vehicle than what we drove 5 years ago and 10 years ago. And it's very clear that that's going to continue,"" TI's head of investor relations David Pahl said in a call with analysts. 
Customers in these two segments are turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end-products smarter and more efficient, which will drive faster growth in chip demand to these segments, he added.
The company in November announced plans to set up 300 millimeter wafer fabrication plants in Sherman, Texas, which will complement its two other units in the city and a third it bought in Utah.
Texas Instruments forecast first-quarter revenue between $4.5 billion and $4.9 billion, compared to analysts' expectations of $4.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company makes analog and embedded processing chips that are used in products that cater to a broad market, lowering its reliance on a single customer segment.

Fourth-quarter revenue rose 19% to $4.83 billion, topping estimates of $4.43 billion.
Net income of $2.27 per share also beat expectations of $1.94.

(Reuters) - NBCUniversal is lowering its TV ratings expectations for the Beijing Winter Games by as much as half depending on the time of day and the platform, the company said on Tuesday, as it prepares to broadcast its second Olympic Games in a pandemic.
Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp-owned NBCU and other media companies are also wrestling with a ratings measurement system they say fails to capture consumers’ shift to streaming. 
""If somebody said, are you reducing your estimates for digital consumption I’d say no; they will explode exponentially,"" said Mark Marshall, NBCUniversal’s president of advertising and client partnerships. “The issue we’re having right now as an industry is that changes in consumption are not being captured by measurement. Until we do, there’s going to be a leak in our ability to capture audiences.”
NBC’s broadcast of the Tokyo Games, which were delayed for a year because of the pandemic, drew the smallest audience for the Summer Games since NBC began broadcasting them in 1988. 
Advertisers and media companies rely on Nielsen to provide the “common currency” for measuring TV ratings, the backbone of the industry's business model. Ratings enable advertisers to track viewers and help networks set the price for ad slots. 
But Nielsen has been under fire in recent years from NBCU and its other TV industry clients, many of which say it has an outdated approach. Nielsen measures TV audiences through a sample set of panelists who use special devices in their homes.
This month NBCUniversal announced it was partnering with TV measurement firm iSpot.tv in a multi-year deal to measure its audience in new ways, including traditional linear, streaming and time-shifted viewing.
NBC will stream every Beijing event live on Peacock’s premium tier, in addition to airing coverage across the NBC broadcast network, USA Network and CNBC cable networks, NBCOlympics.com website and NBC Sports app.

NBCU guarantees a particular audience size to clients who spend upwards of $2 million to $4 million on Olympics advertisements, the company said Tuesday. 
That detail, as well as the fact that NBCU is reducing its TV ratings expectations for the Olympics, was first reported by Insider.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gyrated in afternoon trading to close lower with interest rate sensitive tech stocks weighing most heavily as uncertainties surrounding an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve and rising geopolitical tensions contributed to the market's churn.
In a pattern similar to Monday, U.S. stocks whipsawed between steep losses and modest gains. Equities ended well off session lows, where the S&P 500 flirted once again with confirming a correction.
All three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower. 
If the bellwether index closed 10% or more below its record high reached on Jan 3, it would have confirmed it entered a correction on that date. It ended the session 9.2% below that level. 
""We’re floating along this arbitrary 10% line, and investors are asking. 'Is it time to protect my capital by selling or is it time to buy the dip?',"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT in Atlanta. ""And between yesterday with downward and upward movement you have this battle between the two.""
The CBOE Market Volatility index closed at its highest level since Jan. 29, 2021.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 66.77 points, or 0.19%, to 34,297.73, the S&P 500 lost 53.68 points, or 1.22%, to 4,356.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 315.83 points, or 2.28%, to 13,539.30.
The members of the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) convened on Tuesday for their two-day monetary policy meeting. Market participants on Wednesday will scrutinize the statement at the meeting's conclusion, along with Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent Q&A session, for clarity regarding the central bank's timeline for hiking key interest rates to combat inflation.
""Certainly, the economic data of late shows some weakening,"" Martin added. ""You would think there might be a more dovish message from the Fed.""
Geopolitical tensions are adding to investor uncertainty, with NATO putting forces on standby and the United States putting troops on heightened alert in response to a buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine border.
Those tensions prompted a rise in crude oil prices on concerns over tightening supply, which in turn gave energy companies a solid boost.
Energy was the top gainer among the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, with tech shares suffering the largest percentage decline.
The fourth-quarter reporting season is in full-stride, with 79 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 81% have delivered better-than-expected results, according to Refinitiv. But there have been notable misses, such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). 
Analysts now see aggregate S&P 500 earnings growth of 24.1% for the October-December period, per Refinitiv. 
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co fell 6.0% after the industrial conglomerate, weighed down by global supply disruptions, reported a decline quarterly revenue.
 IBM  (NYSE:IBM) advanced 5.7% after the IT giant beat quarterly Wall Street estimates on strength in its cloud and consulting businesses.
 American Express  (NYSE:AXP) exceeded fourth-quarter profit estimates, sending the consumer credit company's stock up 8.9%, while Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) gained 2.9% after reporting it expects a jump of as much as 46% in 2022 vaccine sales.
Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) dropped about 5% in extended trade after the software maker reported its quarterly results.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 134 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.13 billion shares, compared with the 11.23 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 07:10PM ET</span>","GM's $7 billion investment intensifies EV battle with Ford, Tesla","By Paul Lienert and David Shepardson
(Reuters) -General Motors Co said Tuesday it will invest $7 billion in Michigan, much of that aimed at dramatically boosting production of full-size electric pickups, intensifying a battle with rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co for EV supremacy in North America.
Both U.S. automakers, however, will have to contend with current leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which will soon open a second U.S. plant in Austin, Texas, and is on pace to sell more than 1 million electric vehicles globally in 2022.
GM said its Detroit-Hamtramck and Orion Township plants will be able to build more than 600,000 electric trucks a year by late 2024, with three other plants in Tennessee, Ontario and Mexico boosting the company's total North America EV production capacity to more than a million units by late 2025.
In January, Ford said it will have the annual capacity to build 600,000 electric vehicles, including 150,000 F-150 Lightning pickups, within 24 months, when it aims to become ""the clear No. 2 electric vehicle maker in North America"" behind Tesla.
Last year, Ford said it would invest more than $11 billion in new electric truck and battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, along with Korean partner SK Innovation.
At a press briefing Tuesday, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said Detroit-based GM is ""committed to make our home state the epicenter of the electric vehicle industry."" 
GM's investment includes $2.6 billion with Korean partner LG Energy Solution in a new battery cell plant in Lansing that will supply Orion Township and other GM assembly plants when it opens in late 2024.
United Auto Workers leaders on Tuesday applauded the Michigan investments and said the union ""stands ready to welcome new members"" at the GM-LG battery plant and sister facilities in Ohio and Tennessee.
GM also is spending $4 billion to overhaul and expand the Orion plant, which will build different variants of the new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra electric pickups, President Mark Reuss said in a media briefing.
Reuters previously reported many of the details of the new investment in Michigan.
Reuss declined to provide details on incentives provided by Michigan to secure the GM investments, which include more than $500 million in two Lansing plants that currently build combustion-engine vehicles. Michigan officials said the state contributed $824 million in incentives, in part to support 4,000 new GM jobs. 
Reuss also declined to say how much longer GM plans to build the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV at Orion. A GM press release said production of the two electric vehicles ""will continue during the plant's conversion.""
The Lansing battery cell plant will be the third U.S. plant built by Ultium Cells, the GM-LG joint venture, which is also constructing similar facilities in Lordstown, Ohio, and Spring Hill. A fourth North American battery plant is planned. 

GM said last June it would boost electric and autonomous vehicle spending to $35 billion through 2025, a 30% jump over its prior forecast.
Separately, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she is proposing a combined $2,500 rebate for the purchase of an electric vehicle and  charging equipment. GM and Tesla have both exceeded the threshold for qualifying for a federal EV tax credit of $7,500 but Congress is considering lifting the cap and expanding federal credits for up to $12,500.

BOSTON(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Macellum Advisors, which wants Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) to consider putting itself up for sale, is now pressing the U.S. retailer for at least one board seat and a public statement that the company is reviewing strategic alternatives, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters.
Macellum, which owns roughly 5% of Kohl's stock, sent the letter hours after Acacia Research Corp, backed by activist investor Starboard Value, on Monday confirmed an offer to buy the company for $64 a share, valuing Kohl's at roughly $9 billion.
In addition to Acacia's bid, Sycamore Partners is also preparing an all-cash offer for Kohl's at $65 per share, sources said on Sunday.
Kohl's shares surged 36% on Monday to close at $63.71.
""The best risk-adjusted path forward for shareholders right now is a credible and open process to evaluate a full sale of the company at an attractive premium,"" Macellum's managing partner Jonathan Duskin wrote. ""Investors want an organized sales process.""
He wants Kohl's to provide at least one unconditional board seat for a Macellum representative and to have that person lead a new committee that will oversee the review process, the letter said.
""We do not have faith in the current board to run this process on its own, nor do we believe the Board is capable of objectively evaluating possible bids,"" Duskin wrote.
A representative for Kohl's declined to address the Macellum letter directly on Tuesday and referred back to a statement from Monday which said the company will not make further public comment on expressions of interest unless ""it is in the best interests of the shareholders."" 
Kohl's is exploring its options, including a possible sale, with advice from investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), two sources familiar with the matter said.
The people with knowledge of the matter declined to be identified because they were not permitted to discuss it publicly.
Pressure has been building on Kohl's since last week when Macellum said it planned to nominate directors to the board and wanted the company to consider a sale, and when Reuters reported that Acacia Research was preparing a bid for the company.

Duskin is ratcheting up that pressure less than a year after he and others reached a settlement that saw the company add three new directors.
He said in the letter reviewed by Reuters that he may take legal action or run another proxy contest if Kohl's board ""chills"" a sale process.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) said on Tuesday that it will give around 97% of its employees special compensation awards, most of which will be delivered in restricted stock units, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. 
The total value of the awards is around $1 billion, reflecting the 47% increase in Bank of America's stock price last year, bank Chief Executive Brian Moynihan wrote in the note to employees.
""For this year, the estimated value of these awards is multiple times higher than the prior cash awards,"" Moynihan wrote. This is the fifth year the bank has issued the compensation awards.
The awards will go out to eligible bank employees earning annual total compensation of $500,000 or less. Employees will receive between 65 and 600 restricted units of Bank of America stock, based on compensation, which will begin to vest next year.
Restricted stock units are stock-based compensation that are transferable only when certain conditions are met.
Separately, some part-time employees and others who work in certain international locations will receive cash awards of $750, or the local currency equivalent, according to the memo.
This is the first year the bank issued the stock awards to employees making under $100,000, and it follows the bank's commitment last year to raise its hourly minimum wage for employees to $25 by 2025. 

The stock awards come amid bonus season at the big banks, some of which have rewarded employees handsomely in a bid to retain talent amid cutthroat competition. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) increased its annual bonus pool for top-performing investment bankers by 40% to 50%, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) increased it by 30% to 40%, Reuters reported earlier in January.

(Reuters) -Allegations that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google deceived users with unclear smartphone location tracking settings should be weighed by a jury, an Arizona judge ruled on Tuesday, refusing to toss out a lawsuit brought by the state's attorney general. 
Google had sought summary judgment to get the case against it thrown out at an early stage. It had argued that the state had failed to show that its consumer fraud law could apply and noted that the company's disclosures about privacy settings has been clarified since the case was brought nearly two years ago.
The decision comes a day after attorneys general in Washington state, Indiana, Texas and the District of Columbia sued Google on similar grounds as the Arizona case.
Under Judge Timothy Thomason's ruling in Arizona, the state can proceed with claims that Google may have engaged in deceptive practices in failing to disclose its location tracking capabilities to phone buyers and app users. But he rejected a third argument that Google deceives users by taking location data to help sell ads.
Google in a blog post https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/how-google-puts-you-control-your-location-data on Tuesday applauded the dismissal of what it called the state's central argument.
""We will continue to focus on providing simple, easy-to-understand privacy settings to our users, and will not be distracted from this work by meritless lawsuits that mischaracterize our efforts,"" the blog said.
Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich called the ruling a ""great win for Arizona consumers."" 
The action revolves around the fact that users of smartphones running Google's Android operating system who disable a Location History feature to limit tracking still had their location saved to their Google account through another setting, Web App and Activity. 
Prosecutors and Google have sparred over whether users realized they needed to disable both settings to keep Google from following their physical movements. 

Arizona prosecutors also had sought an early judgment in their favor, but the judge last year rejected its bid.
The Federal Court in Australia in April found in a similar case that Google had misled consumers. Penalties are yet to be determined.

The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, but closed above session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2%, or 66 points, after falling about 800-points intraday. The Nasdaq was down 2.3%.
The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting Tuesday. While the Fed is expected to keep its benchmark rate on hold, investors are waiting with bated breath to discover whether the recent pricing in of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy is warranted.

 American Express  reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings of $2.18 per share on $12.15 billion in revenue, well above Wall Street estimates for $1.87 and $11.5 billion, respectively.
Energy, however, was the standout performer rising more than 3%, underpinned by fears about potential supply disruptions as geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East continue to rise.
The gains in the cyclical stocks like energy and financials contrasted with losses in growth sectors like tech, which could continue its trend lower amid a rising interest rate environment.
But there could be respite ahead for higher quality tech names boasting strong earnings and robust balance sheets.
“Rising interest rates might impact a company that doesn't have earnings, but for companies like Microsoft or like Apple and some of the really high-quality growth names, one and a half percent and 2% on the 10-year yield doesn't really matter,” said Tyner.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was down more than 2% ahead of its quarterly results due after the closing bell. Its cloud business, Azure, is expected to have bolstered results in fourth quarter.
""We expect another strong result [...] led by ongoing Azure momentum and M365 tailwinds,” Deutsche Bank said in a note.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) rose more than 5% after delivering a beat on both the top and bottom lines, though some of the growth driven by sales to Kyndryl.
In other earnings news, General Electric (NYSE:GE) fell 6% after reporting revenue that missed Wall Street estimates as supply chain disruptions weighed on performance.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), meanwhile, reported mixed quarterly results as revenue fell short of analysts’ estimates, but the company projected its covid vaccine would generate $3 billion to $3.5 billion in sales in 2022. Its shares were up more than 2%."

(Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on economic and consumer policy sent a letter on Tuesday to major U.S. meat processing companies, seeking information on rising prices and profits.
The companies included  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), JBS Foods, National Beef and Seaboard. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the chairman of the panel, asked for information about price increases on beef, pork and chicken products, the panel said on Tuesday.
""While some companies may claim that the high prices feeding these outsized profits are explained by higher input costs, earnings data tell a different story,"" Krishnamoorthi said on Tuesday.
""I am deeply concerned that meat processing conglomerates may have engaged in predatory business practices, at the expense of consumers, during the pandemic"", he added.
Krishnamoorthi has asked for information and documents from each company by Feb. 8, explaining their decision to increase prices of their products despite rising profits. He also asked for an explanation on what the companies planned to do to lower prices in the coming year.
He said that net profit margins for the four biggest meatpacking companies have shot up over 300% since the start of the coronavirus outbreak and accused the firms of increasing their profits ""at the expense of the American families"".
The North American Meat Institute, an industry group that represents meatpackers, said labor shortages, supply chain challenges, and consumer demand were driving price increases for consumers.
""Rather than addressing these challenges, the Subcommittee is seeking confidential business information about pricing"", the association added. 

White House economics advisers said https://reut.rs/3nZLXwd last month that the biggest meat-processing companies have tripled their net profit margins since the COVID-19 pandemic started.
The White House, hammered by Republicans over rising inflation, is scrambling to combat rising prices by clearing supply chain logjams and tackling what it views as uncompetitive practices by big companies, which are reporting big profit gains as consumers suffer.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) said on Tuesday it wanted to meet with U.S. officials to discuss its potential entry into Mexican pay TV, arguing that the move would boost coverage, penetration and connectivity in the market.
Executives at the telecom firm were speaking a day after Reuters reported U.S. officials had raised concerns to Mexico about the implications for competition if the Mexican regulators allowed America Movil to enter its domestic pay TV market.
America Movil's entrance into the sector would be a ""win-win for everyone,"" the company's general counsel Alejandro Cantu told a news conference, arguing that whoever believed it would violate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement trade pact ""does not have the complete information."" 
Controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim Helu, America Movil dominates the telecommunications market in Mexico, and its emergence on the pay TV scene could hit rivals, including U.S. companies operating in Mexico.
America Movil's board chairman, Carlos Slim Domit, told the news conference the company would be happy to meet U.S. officials to discuss its business plans, including on pay TV.
""We think there's an opportunity to sit down with them and talk about all this,"" Slim Domit said.
He added the company was looking to arrange a meeting with the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which had raised the concerns about the company entering Mexican pay TV.
Company officials said that moving into the sector in Mexico would imply an additional investment of 8 billion pesos ($387 million) to expand its fiber optic network. 
A decision on pay TV is expected soon and if approved, America Movil's entry would have major implications for the likes of U.S. peer AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), which operates in Mexico, and Mexico's dominant broadcaster, Grupo Televisa.

America Movil currently has a 70% market share for mobile internet services in Mexico and more than 62% of mobile phone services, according to the Mexican telecom regulator.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street ended the day lower on Tuesday after another tumultuous day of trading while oil jumped more than 2% as geopolitical tensions and Wednesday's Federal Reserve update occupied investor focus.
All three major U.S. stock indices experienced a repeat of Monday's bumpy trading. They were unable to completely shake off steep losses earlier in the day and erased Monday's modest gains with new losses.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.19%, the S&P 500 lost 1.22% to 4,356.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.28%.
Tuesday's decline came after three straight weeks of losses as the S&P flirted with correction territory. If the bellwether index closed 10% or more below its record high reached on Jan 3, it would have confirmed it entered a correction on that date. It ended the session 9.2% below that level.
World stocks are on course for their biggest monthly drop since the COVID-19 pandemic hit markets in March 2020. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was down 0.99%.
Investors are awaiting Wednesday afternoon, when the Fed will update its policy plan, likely fleshing out timing on expected rate hikes and dwindling of its massive balance sheet. At the same time, growing tensions as Russian troops amassed on Ukraine's border added to a risk-averse environment for investors.
Safe havens including the dollar and gold both posted gains as investors shied away from risk.
Concerns about potential conflict in eastern Europe also drove oil prices higher, as concerns supplies could become tight drove the commodity up over 2%. Brent futures rose $1.93, or 2.2%, to settle at $88.20 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.29, or 2.8%, to settle at $85.60.
""Geopolitical risks sent crude prices higher as a tight oil market that is already battling low inventories seems vulnerable to shortages in the coming months,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""Energy traders don't know how the situation over the Ukraine-Russia border will unfold or if Iran will be able to reach a nuclear deal, but the odds are something won't go right and that will likely lead to some supply shortages for the oil market,"" Moya added.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is expected to give guidance about the trajectory of monetary policy tightening, with investors expecting, if the economy stays on its current track, the first post-pandemic U.S. rate hike in March and the Fed to begin shrinking its balance sheet later in the year.
""At this time, it seems likely that runoff will begin no later than June,"" said Scott Ruesterholz, a portfolio manager at Insight Investment. ""While Omicron (coronavirus variant) is likely to weigh on January data, expectations are that its impact will be short-lived, and with inflation so elevated and the jobs market quite healthy, there appears to be a very high hurdle for the Fed not to raise rates.""
In the bond market, investors largely held tight with a Fed decision a day away. The U.S. 10-year yield rose about five basis points to 1.7814%..

The U.S. dollar reached a two-week high earlier Wednesday against other currencies as investors flocked to the safe haven. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.06%.
Spot gold prices rose 0.25% to $1,847.61 an ounce.

63,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 04:46PM ET</span>",Run Higher in Stocks Not Over Yet as Fed Hikes Will Take Time to Play Out,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The broader stock market has been hit over the head by a brick, tailor-made by a Federal Reserve in emergency mode for far too long, but as the central bank goes on the offensive against inflation, calls to ditch stocks are premature.
“We do not favor materially reducing portfolio exposure to risk assets,” Wells Fargo said ahead of the Federal Reserve decision due Wednesday.
At the culmination of its two-day meeting, the Fed is widely expected to signal that the liftoff for rates will get underway in March, and stress the need to remove emergency policy measures.
The Fed’s hope is that less pedal to the easing metal will curb demand and tame inflation enough until supply-chain issues -- the key suspect pushing prices higher -- will ease later this year.
Showing up late to the inflation party, and then being forced to play catch up is a risky game. Tighten too much and too fast at a time when economic growth is expected to deaccelerate raises the risk of undoing the recovery made so far.
In a sign that shows just how far the Fed is behind the inflation curve, bets on aggressive Fed action continue to gather steam.
“We see a risk that the [Federal Open Market Committee] will want to take some tightening action at every meeting until the inflation picture changes,” Goldman economist David Mericle told clients.
Against the backdrop of rising Fed hike bets, sentiment on risk assets has soured, pushing the S&P 500 to flirt with correction territory as investors brace for regime change from the Fed.
The Fed put, a source of comfort for investors that when things go bump in markets, the central bank will step in to cushion the fallout, is fast fading and a new normal of lower liquidity in markets, higher rates, and tighter financial conditions is being priced in.
But history suggests that those calling for the endgame for equities are too early as the Fed rate hikes tend to take some time to filter through before eventually putting the final lid on stocks.
“Based on the last seven interest-rate cycles, equities have tended to peak at the end of the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycles, not at the beginning,” {{Wells Fargo said.}}
While the pain felt in stocks recently is grabbing the spotlight, correction are part and parcel of the market, particularly when returns have been running above trend for so long.
“We're giving back a third of the return from last year,” John Luke Tyner, Portfolio Manager at Aptus Capital Advisors said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday. ""Over the last three years the S&P 500 is up about 100% ... looking at at this from a 30,000 foot view this recent drop is not that big of a deal.”"

Investing.com -- Stocks continued their tumultuous trading on Tuesday, falling and then recovering as they did in the previous session while the Federal Reserve started its two-day policy meeting.
A number of earnings reports beat expectations, including  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and 3M, but that had a muted effect on stocks. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reports after the closing bell and Tesla and Intel report on Wednesday.
Tech stocks have had a particularly bad run, with the Nasdaq falling into correction territory this year. Rising rates – investors expect four Fed rate hikes this year – diminish the value of future earnings for growth stocks.
Two years of stimulus from the Fed has put a fire under the tech sector, lifting shares of big companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to record highs and record market valuations, but with the Fed starting to remove that stimulus the prospects seemed to dim.
Nasdaq has had its worst start to a year since 1980, Reuters reported. 
Another factor weighing on stocks is the tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the Ukraine situation. Investors are fleeing risk assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies and seeking safe haven investments such as gold.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Tesla earnings
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s fourth-quarter revenue is seen at a record $16.88 billion with profit per share coming in at $2.25, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.

(Reuters) - YouTube is exploring features for its video creators to capitalize on non-fungible tokens, its chief executive officer said on Tuesday, becoming the latest tech company to tap into a digital collectibles craze that has exploded in the past year.
""We're always focused on expanding the YouTube ecosystem to help creators capitalize on emerging technologies, including things like NFTs, while continuing to strengthen and enhance the experiences creators and fans have on YouTube,"" wrote YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki in a letter on the company's 2022 priorities.
NFTs are a type of digital asset which exist on the record-keeping technology blockchain. They have seen a surge in popularity over the last year, with people buying artwork and video highlights from sports games as NFTs.
Sales of NFTs reached some $25 billion in 2021, according to data from market tracker DappRadar, although there were signs of growth slowing toward the end of the year.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co Chief Executive Jim Farley won applause from Wall Street by increasing the production target for the automaker's electric F-150 to 150,000 a year, more than three times the original number.
Now, Farley wants investors and commercial vehicle customers to pay more attention to the software and services Ford wants to sell with those trucks, as well as to the company's electric Transit vans and its portfolio of combustion engine commercial vehicles.
At an event in Sonoma, California, this week, Farley and other Ford executives are rolling out more details of their Ford Pro commercial vehicle strategy - and setting ambitious goals.
""This is a first move by Ford to really start to scale and commit serious resources to digital software and services-based revenue,"" Farley told Reuters. 
Ford Pro is a standalone unit created last May https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/ford-boosts-ev-spending-aims-have-40-volume-all-electric-by-2030-2021-05-26 to focus exclusively on commercial and government customers.
Ford has set a goal to increase Ford Pro's annual revenue to $45 billion by 2025, up 67% from 2019. Farley said Ford Pro is paving the way for Ford to expand digital service offerings to retail customers.
The U.S. and European commercial vehicle markets are fragmented, Farley said. Ford can use its position as the leading commercial vehicle brand in the United States and Europe to be a leader in pulling the pieces together as commercial fleets go electric. 
""We are the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of this industry,"" he said.
Ford Pro, which will house the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker's commercial vehicle operations, is now ramping up a commercial electric vehicle charging business using software and workers who came on board when Ford bought charging startup Electriphi https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-buy-ev-charging-management-platform-electriphi-2021-06-17 in June 2021. 
Ford Pro also has a partnership with Silicon Valley enterprise software power Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) to develop software to digitize billing and other paperwork for contractors and other businesses that deploy people to jobs where the vehicle also serves as office space.
Ford Pro Chief Executive Ted Cannis said in an interview the unit has 125,000 active accounts, and a 40% share of the U.S. commercial van and pickup markets. Startups such as Rivian Automotive Inc and established rivals such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and its new BrightDrop van unit https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gms-commercial-ev-unit-expand-vehicle-lineup-add-verizon-customer-2021-09-28 are aiming for big customers such as FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) or Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as golden tickets to vehicle-based service businesses.
With Ford's stable of small and medium-sized business customers, ""I've got 125,000 golden tickets,"" Cannis said.
TREPIDATION OVER EVs
Ford has tried before to expand higher-margin service businesses to augment its traditional manufacturing business, which do well to crack 10% pretax margins in good years. In the early 2000s, Ford acquired a repair services chain and auto salvage yards in an attempt to capture revenue from a larger chunk of the life cycle of a vehicle. Those diversifications were abandoned.
Ford's new service strategy will have to overcome efforts by rivals that are also racing to sell electric vans and trucks to commercial vehicle fleets. Individual pieces of Ford Pro's service business, such as fleet charging, will face competition from companies such as ChargePoint that already offer such services.
Rhett Ricart, whose Ohio-based Ricart Automotive Group is a major Ford commercial vehicle dealer, said Ford executives have ""done their homework"" on Ford Pro. Now, he said, the automaker must deliver electric vehicles that do not leave business customers stranded.
""Those vehicles have got to be flawless. People will have trepidation. They know what they've got with internal combustion engines. They know where to get gasoline,"" Ricart said. 
Farley and Ford executives said connected vehicle technology - including telematics systems that give Ford a pipeline to receive data from its vehicles - give the company a firmer foundation for recurring revenue, subscription services as well as increased repair business driven by software that tells fleet owners when it is time for vehicle maintenance.

Ford can analyze how many miles vehicles in a fleet drive, and where they are parked, to design hardware and software that allow for recharging at a central depot, or at a worker's home, or both, said Muffi Ghadiali, former CEO of Electriphi and now head of the Ford Pro electric vehicle charging business. 
""Because of telematics we can give them a very precise plan based on how the fleets operate,"" he said.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 03:41PM ET</span>",Airbus to create own airline to rent out whale plane,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus plans to charter out its whale-shaped Beluga transport planes - whose main job until now has been to ferry aircraft parts between its plants in Europe - to help other industries haul urgently-needed outsized machinery by air.
Airbus said the move to rent out spare capacity on its existing Beluga ST and new Beluga XL transporters would lead to the creation of a commercial-cargo airline subsidiary from 2023.
Weeks after ending output of the world's largest passenger jet, the A380, Airbus is planning a new role for what could be the West's largest commercial freighter by volume, the Beluga.
It is a rare example of aerospace 'in-sourcing' tasks from other industries after years of farming out work externally, and if successful could pave the way for other services.
The 100% unit will work a commercial basis, Airbus said.
""It will get its revenues from its sales, and it will bear all its investments and operating costs,"" a spokesman said.
Analysts say demand for outsized cargoes that can be transported without dismantling them has been rising, partly on the back of weakened supply chains. Logistics managers turn to oversized airplanes when there is no time to use sea lanes.
""Within the past few years, even before COVID-19, we were n approached by several companies asking if our Beluga aircraft were available to perform some charter flights,"" said Business Development Manager Reza Fazlollahi.
Until recently, Airbus had trouble meeting such demand because the aerospace industry was running at peak capacity.
But analysts say lower output of large passenger jets and an industry-wide slump during the pandemic have meant older Belugas have more time left on the clock than first expected.
""The Beluga ST are only at 50% of their life. They have been designed for 30,000 flight cycles and currently have an average of 15,000,"" said Philippe Sabo, head of Airbus Transport International. A flight cycle is one take-off and landing.

Airbus cut average output by 40% when the pandemic hit and plans to restore and slightly increase output of singe-aisle jets by summer 2023. But wide-body output is expected to remain around half levels foreseen when Beluga XL was launched in 2014.
Airbus said there was no connection between the project to commercialise the Beluga fleet and planned production, however.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said on Tuesday they started a clinical trial to test a new version of their vaccine specifically designed to target the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which has eluded some of the protection provided by the original two-dose vaccine regimen.
Banking on volunteers in the United States, the companies plan to test the immune response generated by the Omicron-based vaccine both as a three-shot regimen in unvaccinated people and as a booster shot for people who already received two doses of their original vaccine.
They are also testing a fourth dose of the current vaccine against a fourth dose of the Omicron-based vaccine in people who received a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine three to six months earlier.
The companies plan to study the safety and tolerability of the shots in the more than 1,400 people who will be enrolled in the trial.
""While current research and real-world data show that boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalization with Omicron, we recognize the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time and to potentially help address Omicron and new variants in the future,""  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s head of vaccine research and development, Kathrin Jansen, said in a statement.
Depending on the amount of clinical trial data required by regulators, it may not be possible to realize a current plan to launch an Omicron-targeting vaccine by the end of March, BioNTech said.
Pfizer has said that two doses of the original vaccine may not be sufficient to protect against infection from Omicron, and that protection against hospitalizations and deaths may be waning.
Still, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a third dose of an mRNA vaccine like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has provided 90% protection against hospitalization due to COVID-19.
Some countries have already started offering additional booster doses, but a recent study from Israel showed that while a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine boosted antibodies, the level was not high enough to prevent Omicron infection. 
DATA 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday that international regulators want data from clinical studies like the one being done by Pfizer and BioNTech before approval of a new vaccine. 
EMA said these studies should show that the new vaccines elicit more neutralising antibodies in the blood than current vaccines and might also protect against new variants of concern.
BioNTech declined to comment on what type of data it was asked to file with regulators.
It said an analysis of antibodies elicited by its Omicron-targeted booster should help answer whether shots will be needed that address more than one variant at a time. It hopes to show the antibodies neutralise a spectrum of variants.

Still, some scientists question whether any change is currently needed.
""The goal of this vaccine is to protect against serious illness,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania. ""To date, these vaccines do that, including protection against Omicron.""

BOSTON (Reuters) -ValueAct Capital has called on 7-Eleven's owner Seven & i Holdings to listen to shareholder concerns and to consider strategic alternatives, including a possible sale.
U.S.-based investment firm ValueAct has written to the Japanese company's board to say it must quickly pursue ""bold, structural reform"", calling it ""strategically unfocused"" and saying it is ""vastly underperforming its potential"".
There has been growing frustration among investors in the 7-Eleven convenience store chain's owner about its lagging share price, with some shareholders pushing it to break up.
Seven & i should ""consider alternative ownership structures for its business units as well as the whole company to achieve the focus necessary to improve competitiveness and performance of the businesses, especially 7-Eleven,"" ValueAct's letter said. 
ValueAct, which owns a 4.4% stake in Seven & i, said it is making two requests of the board and was making the letter public, a rare step for the investment firm.
To put extra pressure on the board, ValueAct said it also wants to hear a public response to its requests after the next regularly scheduled board meeting, which is in early February.
It said it wants one or more outside directors from Seven & i to contact portfolio managers at 30 of the company's biggest investors to ""listen directly to their views.""
And it called for the creation of a ""Strategic Review Committee"", made up of only outside directors to consider whether the ""sale or spin-off of divisions or a business combination with a third party would deliver superior value and strategic benefits to the company and its stakeholders.""
Such a public statement is a highly unusual step for ValueAct, which has spent decades building a reputation for working collaboratively with management instead of dictating terms publicly as many activist investors have done.
It is one of a small number of U.S. firms that have invested more heavily in Japanese companies and have quietly tried to work with management and the boards to make some changes.
Its holding in Seven & i follows investments in Nintendo Olympus Corp and JSR Corp.
While ValueAct had engaged with Seven & i privately it said the response ""has been unsatisfactory"", adding that it has ""lost confidence in management's ability to set the strategic course without direct and public input from independent shareholders.""
ValueAct is the biggest actively managed institutional shareholder in Seven & i. Fund managers T. Rowe Price and Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM) and pension fund California Public Employees Retirement System hold smaller stakes.

In its letter, ValueAct also said that it may make shareholder proposals at the company's annual meeting.
This week the Financial Times reported that three investors, who have previously told the company that sweeping reform is necessary, may also submit proposals at the meeting expected to take place in May or June.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Dow staged another intraday turnaround Tuesday, with energy and financials leading the way ahead of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy update due Wednesday.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, but had been down more than 1% intraday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%, or 206 points, erasing an 800-point decline. The Nasdaq was also off its lows, down about 0.8%.
The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting Tuesday. While the Fed is expected to keep its benchmark rate on hold, investors are waiting with bated breath to discover whether the recent pricing in of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy is warranted.
Investors will be watching ""If Fed chairman Jerome Powell continues to address the risk of inflation as heightened and any sort of communication about ending the taper early,"" John Luke Tyner, Portfolio Manager at Aptus Capital Advisors said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday. If the Fed hints ""at any plan of how they'll use the balance sheet to reduce accommodation that is going to be huge.""
In anticipation of a hawkish tone on policy from the Fed, U.S. bonds yields were on the rise, with U.S. 10-year yield briefly flirting with 1.8%, boosting rate-sensitive sectors like banks.
Zions (NASDAQ:ZION), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) led the move higher in financials, with latter receiving an added boost after delivering quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
American Express reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings of $2.18 per share on $12.15 billion in revenue, well above Wall Street estimates for $1.87 and $11.5 billion, respectively.
Energy, however, was the standout performer rising more than 3%, underpinned by fears about potential supply disruptions as geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East continue to rise.
The gains in the cyclical stocks like energy and financials contrasted with losses in growth sectors like tech, which could continue its trend lower amid a rising interest rate environment.
But there could be respite ahead for higher quality tech names boasting strong earnings and robust balance sheets.
“Rising interest rates might impact a company that doesn't have earnings, but for companies like Microsoft or like Apple and some of the really high-quality growth names, one and a half percent and 2% on the 10-year yield doesn't really matter,” said Tyner.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was down less than 1% ahead of its quarterly results due after the closing bell. Its cloud business, Azure, is expected to have bolstered results in fourth quarter.
""We expect another strong result [...] led by ongoing Azure momentum and M365 tailwinds,” Deutsche Bank said in a note.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) rose nearly 6% after delivering a beat on both the top and bottom lines, though some of the growth driven by sales to Kyndryl.
In other earnings news,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) fell more than 4% after reporting revenue that missed Wall Street estimates as supply chain disruptions weighed on performance.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), meanwhile, reported mixed quarterly results as revenue fell short of analysts’ estimates, but the company projected its covid vaccine would generate $3 billion to $3.5 billion in sales in 2022. Its shares were up more than 3%."

78,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 02:06PM ET</span>",Ex-banker tells Swiss court that strip club visits were business-related,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) - A former top Swiss banker charged with making millions of dollars through fraudulent deals said on Tuesday that a near 200,000 Swiss francs ($217,675) expenses bill for strip club visits was largely business-related.
Pierin Vincenz, once a 'banker of the year', also told a Zurich court that a 700 franc dinner with a woman he met on dating app Tinder was justified because he was considering her for a real estate job and a trip to Australia was made to examine the country's ATMs.
Most of the charges facing Vincenz in Switzerland's highest profile corporate crimes trial in decades relate to allegations of illegal trades while he was chief executive of unlisted cooperative lender Raiffeisen Switzerland.
But the opening day of his trial, which was moved from a courthouse to Zurich's Volkshaus theatre due to the intense interest in the case, centred on the 65-year-old's alleged misuse of the corporate expense account.
Prosecutors said Vincenz, who denies all charges, filed more than half a million Swiss francs in improper expenses which amounted to misappropriation and disloyal management.
They said the bills included nearly 4,000 francs for the repair of a hotel room at the five-star Zurich Park Hyatt, which was damaged during a ""massive row"" between Vincenz and a strip club dancer he was dating at the time. 
He is also alleged to have billed Raiffeisen nearly 27,000 francs for a private jet during a cooking club trip to Mallorca.
The case primarily centres around conflicts of interest on deals between a number of firms in which Vincenz and another defendant were involved. Both men are also accused of forgery.
Five other defendants are accused of anti-competitive behaviour and acting as accessories on the corporate deals, through which prosecutors allege they made millions. 
All seven defendants deny the allegations.
BUSINESS IN BARS
Speaking before judges after they had dismissed requests from lawyers for the defendants to postpone hearings or have charges revised, Vincenz said some of the bills, including for an attorney consulted after the hotel room fight, had been expensed by mistake, but were mainly bona fide business costs.
""With regard to (visits) to bars and nightclubs, I fully stand by that these were justified by business,"" said Vincenz, sporting a white open-necked shirt and a dark suit, his light grey hair tightly cropped.
""There are individual invoices that appeared on the tab with regard to business trips, which (should have been) private, but on the whole these were justified by my business activity.""
While most cabaret visits had followed business dinners or events, some were made spontaneously on his own in the interest of meeting entrepreneurs and business managers, Vincenz said, adding that he had been tasked by Raiffeisen with developing the bank's presence and public profile.
""Do I understand your claim correctly that, when you went alone to a cabaret, there were invariably business people present and every invitation was made in Raifeissen's business interest?"" one judge asked him.
In his last statement before the court hearing adjourned on Tuesday, Vincenz said: ""I didn't have the feeling I had done anything criminal here.""
Prosecutors are seeking nearly 70 million Swiss francs ($77 million) in total in assets from the seven defendants, as well as pursuing financial penalties and prison sentences ranging from two to six years for all but one of them.
'SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS' 
In 2018, the country's financial watchdog FINMA found ""serious shortcomings"" at Raiffeisen, including interest conflicts and inadequate supervision in a probe related to fraud allegations against Vincenz.
FINMA discontinued https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2017/12/20171221-mm-pv its proceedings against Vincenz in late 2017 after he resigned from all executive management positions at Swiss financial institutions and promised not to take such roles in the future.
Swiss prosecutors opened an investigation, however, and Vincenz was held in custody https://www.reuters.com/article/swiss-vincenz-idINL8N1TF0XV for three and a half months in 2018.

Raiffeisen declined comment on the case beyond noting that it was a private plaintiff in the criminal proceedings. It is not facing any charges and has said that it has improved corporate governance since FINMA's probe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday issued approvals for additional altimeters that allow about 90% of the U.S. commercial aviation fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where 5G wireless is deployed.
The FAA said it had cleared seven additional altimeters, bringing the total approved to 20. As of last week, it had cleared about 78% of commercial planes. 
AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) agreed on Jan. 18 to delay switching on new telecom towers near key airports even as they turned on the new 5G C-Band service.
Radio altimeters are used to give data on height above ground for bad-weather landings and the 5G technology could cause interference. 
The issue is disrupting some landing in poor weather at smaller airports.  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) said Monday the ""rollout of this new 5G band is still creating disruptions for regional air travel.""
Verizon agreed to temporarily not turn on about 500 towers near airports, sources told Reuters, or less than 10% of their planned deployment, while the carriers and the administration work on a permanent solution.
Some U.S. airlines are concerned about Verizon's plans to turn on additional towers around Feb. 1 and want to know if those new towers could impact any current operations. Verizon did not immediately comment.

Separately, the FAA on Tuesday published an airworthiness directive on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 and 747-8 airplanes that interference may affect multiple airplane systems using radio altimeter data. The directive does not prevent any operations at nearly all large U.S. airports. The FAA has approved alternative means of compliance for the airplanes.
Airplane models with cleared altimeters include all Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787 MD-10/-11; Airbus A300, A310, A319, A220, A320, A321, A330, A340, A350, A380; Embraer 120, 170, and 190 regional jets; All CL-600/CRJ regional jets; DHC-8 and ATR turboprops.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 01:45PM ET</span>","Canadian farmers face cattle feed shortage due to drought, transport strains","By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canadian farmers say they are just days away from running out of feed for cattle, due to severe drought last summer damaging crops needed to fatten them over winter and transportation bottlenecks. 
The drought devastated Prairie pastures and has now forced feedlots in Alberta, the main cattle-producing province, to buy more U.S. corn. Moving it north of the border is difficult and costly, however.
 Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd, the main corn shipper to Western Canada, has struggled to keep up with demand during frigid weather. COVID-19 vaccine mandates for cross-border truckers threaten to further disrupt the supply chain.
The feed shortage could depress profits for feedlots, the farms that raise cattle to slaughter weight, but it may not raise retail beef prices as feedlots have incentive to sell their cattle to packers as quickly as possible, increasing meat supply, said Brian Perillat, senior analyst at CanFax. 
Jacob Bueckert, owner of a 20,000-head feedlot near Warner, Alberta, estimates that he has five days' supply of feed on hand, when he normally has 14-30 days' worth.
""We don't have any buffer. It's scary,"" he said, adding that he is frustrated by delayed rail shipments. 
""Excuses aren't going to feed the cattle.""
Many feedlot owners are getting by with contributions from neighbors who have enough feed, Bueckert said. But it is not easy to find surplus grain - feedlots are fuller than usual after the drought led ranchers to sell more cattle to feedlots last fall, he said. 
If packing plants are full anyway, some feedlots may ration their scarce supplies over a longer period of time and delay the cattle from reaching slaughter weight, but this adds expense, said Janice Tranberg, chief executive of the Alberta Cattle Feeders' Association. She estimates that three-quarters of the province's feedlots, which fatten 1.5 million head, face shortages.
Canada is the world's eighth-biggest beef and veal exporter. In the United States, the No. 3 beef exporter, cattle are geographically dispersed and feed supplies are more readily available. Still, the number of cattle placed in U.S. feedlots rose 6% in December from a year ago after drought dried up pastures.
U.S. corn shipments to Canada totaled 1.085 million tonnes from Sept. 1 through Jan. 13, nearly six times the five-year average, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Some 2.1 million tonnes have been sold but not yet shipped.
Canadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that she raised the feed shortage on Saturday with Canadian Pacific.
In a statement, CP said it is committed to supplying feed to feedlots despite the challenges, but it did not say if the railway will take additional steps.

CP moved 8,100 carloads of U.S. corn into Alberta last year, more than 13 times the previous year's volume, a company executive said last week. Shipments of distillers' dried grains, another feed product, jumped 300%.
Hog farmers fear their feed constraints may also worsen with some truck shipments of U.S. soybean meal already cancelled, said Cam Dahl, general manager of farmer group Manitoba Pork. He attributed the cancellations to vaccine mandates reducing the pool of drivers.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The chief executive of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s fund unit DWS, Asoka Woehrmann, has received threatening letters in recent months, including one in December with red crosshairs, white powder and a racial slur, DWS said on Tuesday. 
Other members of the firm's supervisory board - including chairman Karl von Rohr, who is on the management board of Deutsche Bank - have also received written threats, according to a DWS spokesperson.
Frankfurt police said they were investigating the matter based on the suspicion that crimes were committed.
Woehrmann is a German citizen who was born in Sri Lanka.
The anonymous letter received in December was a single page with a large red crosshairs in the centre. Under it was the statement, ""You get what you deserve,"" and a racial insult. 
Reuters reviewed the letter. It was not able to learn the specific contents of the letters to the other individuals, but DWS described them as threatening.
DWS declined to speculate about a motive but the threats came at a time when DWS has been under fire amid accusations from a former employee that the company overstated how it used sustainable investing criteria to manage investments.
DWS has denied the allegations, which are under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as Germany's financial regulator BaFin. DWS this week won a wrongful dismissal lawsuit by the employee. 
News of the investigations in August hit DWS's share price, which has not recovered to date. 
The DWS spokesperson said that after Woehrmann received the letter in December, police and firefighters wearing protective suits went to DWS headquarters in Frankfurt to investigate, and the white substance turned out to be baking powder.
Woehrmann received an initial letter in November. It said, ""Gravedigger of DWS ... You will pay, the bomb is ticking ... Resign finally!"" according to a copy reviewed by Reuters.

Frankfurt's fire department confirmed that it deployed a team of four on Dec. 7 to DWS headquarters to analyse a substance, but did not elaborate.
The business magazine WirtschaftsWoche first reported the existence of the letters but not all elements of their content, such as the reported racial slur.

In a rare reversal, Wall Street recovered from a steep sell-off on Monday to close higher on the day with the help of retail punters and options-related flows and with volumes the highest in almost a year.
Retail investors piled a net $1.36 billion into U.S. stocks, the most since Jan. 18, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research data, suggesting market dips continued to attract retail buyers, a similar magnitude of purchases flagged by JP Morgan. 
But the presence of a short ETF (exchange traded fund) - the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ - among the top five products with the most net inflows on that day suggested a degree of caution.
""Every time the market rallies from now on, you're going to see some selling into it,"" said Keith Temperton, a sales trader at Forte Securities.
""You might see a turnaround rally like yesterday, but you've got a lot of options protections being taken off. That takes the market off the lows but next time we have a selloff no one wants to cover their protection."" 
Indeed, sellers returned in force on Tuesday. The S&P 500 index was down around 1.9% in early afternoon trading, while the Nasdaq Composite was off nearly 2.9%.
JP Morgan strategists said a 5% reversal in major U.S. stock indexes was not uncommon and weaker markets would typically follow the next day.
""Intraday reversals of this magnitude seems to suggest more volatility rather than a directional change,"" they said.
Daily trading turnover on the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ, designed to deliver three times the inverse of the daily performance of the Nasdaq 100, hit a record for the second straight trading session on Monday at 125.7 million units. 
Over the past week the fund attracted more than $120 million in net retail inflows, the most in at least five years.
BEARISH SENTIMENT
Markets have had a rocky start to 2022 with nearly $3 trillion in market value of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 wiped out, as investors dumped tech stocks on the view that the less severe Omicron coronavirus variant will allow the Fed to hike rates fairly aggressively, which will compress valuations.
Investors expect the Fed to signal on Wednesday it plans to raise rates in March, tightening policy for the first time since it slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near-zero soon after the onset of the pandemic nearly two years ago.
The S&P 500 index was briefly down more than 10% so far this year on Monday, before rebounding to end with a year-to-date loss of nearly 8%. [.N]
Citi data on investor positioning show that bearish sentiment was spilling beyond the usual tech counters. U.S. stock short futures positioning on the S&P 500 index is now at $34 billion, almost 1.5 times that of long bets.
A report from BofA Global Research showed the bank's retail clients were buyers of U.S. equities for the third straight week through last Friday, while institutional clients and hedge funds were sellers.

January has typically been the strongest month for U.S. equity inflows, led by retail clients, BofA's analysts noted.

84,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 01:17PM ET</span>",U.S. indoor vertical farm Plenty gets big injection of cash and Walmart deal,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
(Reuters) - Retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Tuesday it is investing in indoor vertical farm Plenty as part of a $400 million funding round and will be buying leafy greens from them for its stores in California.
The investment in the South San Francisco startup that grows leafy greens under banks of lights is one of the biggest in the indoor farming business, and the distribution deal from Walmart is a sign of mass market appeal from an industry that has not delivered on early expectations. High costs have been a challenge for the industry.
Martin Mundo, the Walmart executive in charge of buying all produce for U.S. stores, declined to say how much Walmart was investing, only adding that it will have a board seat when the deal is closed. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, Walmart said.
Plenty, which secured SoftBank Group Corp’s Vision Fund 1 investment in 2017, recently said Arama Kukutai replaced the previous CEO and co-founder, Matt Barnard, who will remain as executive chairman of the board. 
Kukutai, who is also an early investor in Plenty, told Reuters that Plenty has been able to increase yield in its leafy green growing rooms by 700% in two years. He said raising yields was key to profit.
“Their path to yield is absolutely critical,” said Mundo about why Walmart chose Plenty over nearly a dozen other indoor farms it visited as it sees this as an environmentally sustainable way of farming. The fact that Plenty also has a path to growing strawberries and cherry tomatoes at scale, and not just leafy greens, was another advantage, he said.
In late 2020 Plenty raised funds from berry brand Driscoll’s and signed a joint development agreement to grow Driscoll’s strawberries.
Mundo said once Plenty’s new farm in Compton, California comes on line later this year, it will serve leafy greens to all of the Walmart stores in the state. 
Plenty isn’t alone in raising big funds in recent months. In May New York-based indoor vertical farming startup Bowery Farming raised $300 million in a round https://www.reuters.com/article/agriculture-indoor-farming-funding-idAFL2N2NA0LM that put the company valuation at $2.3 billion. Plenty declined to say how it was valued in this latest round of funding.
Still, others have struggled. AeroFarms said in October https://www.aerofarms.com/2021/10/14/terminate-business-combination its deal to list on the stock market through a blank check company was terminated. 
Michael Rose, a partner at Better Food Ventures which invests in food technology, said he has seen at least two companies forced to take a lower valuation to raise funds. But he added that was normal in industries with emerging technologies. 

“What we've seen during the pandemic is they're selling everything they can produce,” Rose said about the indoor farms. While they have been able to charge a premium for those salads for now, as they grow and compete on a bigger scale they will face pricing pressure, he said. 
“We're still early ... We're talking years down the road.”

(Reuters) -3M Co said on Tuesday demand for its N95 respirators had picked up due to a surge in Omicron-related COVID-19 cases, while reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit as more people purchased its air filters and Scotch-branded products.
In December, the United States reported record high COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rates caused by the more transmissible Omicron variant that spurred demand for 3M's respirators.
However, the company, which is the biggest maker of N95 respirators in the United States, anticipates that the demand will wane in 2022. It reported a 4% fall in its respirator sales for 2021.
The Dow Industrial Average component reported upbeat fourth-quarter profit and revenue on the back of strong demand for its home improvement and personal safety products.
The company's iconic Post-it-branded products also saw a surge in sales despite workplace reopenings being pushed back due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases.
The Saint Paul, Minnesota-based company continues to navigate supply chain disruptions, raw material and logistics cost inflation and a semiconductor shortage.
""We think macro-related headwinds plus the spread of Omicron somewhat increases near-term growth/earnings volatility for the company,"" Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz said.
3M further pushed its prices high to combat the costs and inflationary pressures. ""Our selling price actions continue to gain traction as we went through the quarter,"" Chief Financial Officer Monish Patolawala said on a call with analysts.
3M's transportation & electronics and safety & industrial units saw 1.5% and 2.2% declines in sales.
Net income attributable to 3M fell to $1.34 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.41 billion, or $2.41 per share, a year earlier. 

Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.02 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Net sales edged 0.3% higher to $8.61 billion, beating estimates of $8.55 billion.

The U.S. chipmaker has told partners that it does not expect the deal to close, the report said, adding that SoftBank is stepping up preparations for an initial public offering (IPO) of Arm.
Nvidia shares dropped 4.8%, leading losses among chipmakers in a broadly weaker market.
An Nvidia spokesperson said the company continues to believe the acquisition ""provides an opportunity to accelerate Arm and boost competition and innovation."" Arm and SoftBank did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
The deal has faced several regulatory hurdles, with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission suing to block it in December. The buyout is also under the scrutiny of British and EU regulators amid concerns that it could push up prices and reduce choice and innovation.
Earlier in the day, a European Commission filing showed that EU antitrust regulators have resumed their investigation of the deal and set a new deadline of May 25 for their decision. 
Jonathan Kanter, the new head of the U.S. Justice Department Antitrust Division, has said he would seek to stop mergers that pose anticompetitive concerns rather than striking deals for concessions that would allow the transaction to close.

Arm's CEO said in July last year the company had contemplated an IPO but that would hurt its ability to expand and invest.
""I do think it is safe to say that Nvidia would likely have invested more (possibly much more) than hypothetical public investors in Arm might be willing to stand,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.

89,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 12:51PM ET</span>",U.S. FTC to sue to block Lockheed Martin's $4.4 billion Aerojet deal,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday it voted unanimously to sue to block arms maker  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s proposed $4.4 billion purchase of rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD) Inc over antitrust concerns.
Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet said the company will review the FTC's planned challenge, adding: ""With the filing of the suit, we may elect to defend the lawsuit or terminate the merger agreement."" Lockheed is the No. 1 U.S. defense contractor by sales.
The deal, if it were allowed to go forward, could enable Lockheed to use its control of Aerojet to hurt other defense contractors while creating more consolidation in the industry, the FTC said. The agency did not immediately release its complaint.
If the deal ends up in court, it would be the first litigated defense merger challenge in decades, the agency said.
Aerojet's shares were down 18% at $36.86 in midday trading on Tuesday. Lockheed's offer valued Aerojet at $51 per share but the shares had been trading below the offer because of investor concerns over the FTC's antitrust review. 
The FTC, made up of two Democrats and two Republicans, voted 4-0 to challenge the deal.
""Without competitive pressure, Lockheed can jack up the price the U.S. government has to pay, while delivering lower quality and less innovation. We cannot afford to allow further concentration in markets critical to our national security and defense,"" FTC Bureau of Competition Director Holly Vedova said in a statement.
If the deal fails because of opposition from antitrust enforcers, Lockheed would not pay a termination fee, according to a Lockheed spokesman. 
The FTC said it would file a complaint in federal court in Washington to seek a preliminary injunction halting the deal. Mergers that are halted at this stage are generally terminated. If a court rules in favor of the merging companies, the FTC generally drops its parallel administrative complaint.
The deal has drawn criticism because it would give Lockheed a dominant position over solid fuel rocket motors - a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry. Missile maker Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) has been an outspoken opponent of the proposed deal.
The deal has attracted opposition in the U.S. Congress including from Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who applauded the FTC's action in a statement on Tuesday. 
""After decades of mergers, the defense industry is left with a few giant firms that aim to buy up key suppliers and stomp out competition. I support the FTC taking aggressive action to oppose further corporate concentration in the defense industry that could threaten U.S. national security.""
Lockheed has said it accounted for 33% of Aerojet's sales and the deal would reduce ""fee-on-fee"" costs for the Pentagon and the U.S. taxpayer. 

Rocket motors like those made by Aerojet are used in everything from the homeland defensive missile system to Stinger missiles. 
Aerojet develops and manufactures liquid and solid rocket propulsion, air-breathing hypersonic engines and electric power and propulsion for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Its customers include the Pentagon, NASA, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) and the United Launch Alliance.

The letter was addressed to NBCUniversal Chief Executive Jeff Shell (LON:RDSa) and NBC Olympics President Gary Zenkel. It was made public on Tuesday by Republican leaders of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee Republican leaders.
The United States and other governments have announced a diplomatic boycott of the games, citing the Chinese government's treatment of the Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups, which the United States has deemed genocide. China denies the allegations of human rights abuses.
NBCUniversal, which paid $7.65 billion for the rights to air the Olympics through 2032, said last week https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/nbcuniversal-says-will-cover-geopolitical-issues-during-beijing-olympics-2022-01-19 its broadcast coverage would include ""geopolitical"" issues, but the stories of athletes would remain the centerpiece of its coverage. 

Human rights groups had pressured the media company to cover China's alleged abuses during its broadcast. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China also addressed a letter to NBCUniversal in December urging it discuss China's crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong during the event.
Asked for comment, NBCU pointed to a presentation last week when it said its Olympics coverage ""will provide perspective on China’s place in the world.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) -General Electric Co on Tuesday reported a decline in quarterly revenue amid persistent global supply chain disruptions, sending its shares lower.
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate's shares also suffered because of a confusion caused by its new reporting format, which the company moved to after selling its jet-leasing business and folding its capital business into its corporate operations.
Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones, said the difference in numbers under the old and new formats has left the trading community confused.
""Today's weakness is the result of a less-than-clean quarterly report,"" Windau said.
GE's shares were down 7% at $90.03 in mid-day trade. 
Tuesday's earnings report added to investor worries about supply shortages and inflationary pressure.
GE said it was grappling with supply-chain issues across all of its businesses, but the problem remained most acute at its healthcare unit.
They are driving up its transportation and raw materials costs, adversely impacting its onshore wind business.
In response, the company is raising prices and trying to keep a lid on costs. It is scouting for new suppliers, sourcing alternative parts and redesigning product configurations.
But Chief Executive Larry Culp said a resolution remains elusive.
""I don't see the brink of a resolution just yet,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""We will see a little bit more inflation pressure in 2022.""
Culp said while GE is doing a better job in adjusting its prices, the company is finding it harder to pass along the increased costs in longer-cycle businesses such as power and renewables.
As a result, he said the company will not be able to fully offset higher costs with price increases.
GE is not alone. Companies of all sizes are grappling with inflationary pressures as the COVID-19 pandemic has caused bottlenecks in supply chains, driving up costs for everything from labor to raw materials.
Shares of GE's rival Siemens Energy have been tumbling since the German company's wind power division Siemens Gamesa cut its financial outlook for the third time in nine months on supply chain issues and a surge in costs for vital materials such as steel.
GE's onshore wind business is also taking a hit from lingering uncertainty over whether U.S. production tax credits for onshore wind investments will be extended over the long term.
Windau of Edward Jones has lowered estimates for GE's 2022 earnings as he expects its renewable energy business to be more pressured this year.
Culp said the company has work to do in fixing the business.
EARNINGS OUTLOOK
GE, which has announced it will split into three public companies, expects to return to revenue growth this year on the back of a more than 20% increase in aviation revenue.
It also forecast higher profit and free cash flow for 2022. But it expects to burn cash in the first quarter, which tends to be the company's weakest quarter.
The 2022 earnings estimates are based on GE's new reporting format. 
GE expects adjusted profit in the range of $2.80 per share to $3.50 per share in 2022, compared with $1.71 per share last year. Full-year free cash flow is estimated at $5.5 billion-$6.5 billion, up from $2.6 billion in 2021.
In its new format, the group will no longer report GE Capital, its financial services division, as a standalone business segment.

The company generated $20.3 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, down 3% from a year ago and below the $21.5 billion estimated by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. 
Under the old format, GE's adjusted earnings for the quarter came in at 92 cents per share, beating the consensus estimate of 85 cents a share.

(Reuters) -Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday forecast as much as $3.5 billion in sales of its COVID-19 vaccine in 2022, a 46% jump for the shot that has fared poorly compared to rivals, and said it would take a more aggressive stance on deals for its medical device unit.
J&J (NYSE:JNJ)'s 2022 revenue forecast for the vaccine was above Wall Street estimates, which had been lowered due to safety concerns as well as low uptake in the United States. 
New Chief Executive Officer Joaquin Duato said his priority now was to be ""more on the acquisitive side"" for the medical devices unit, its second-largest business by revenue. 
""While our past history always suggest smaller deals ... we don't have an artificial ceiling as far as deal size,"" he said on a call with analysts.
The company reported sales of $2.39 billion for the COVID shot in 2021, missing its own target of $2.5 billion in a year marked by manufacturing stumbles, safety concerns and uneven demand for a vaccine once touted as a promising tool for inoculating populations in hard-to-reach areas.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) by comparison is forecasting $29 billion in 2022 sales of the COVID-19 vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), while  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc is projecting $18.5 billion in vaccine sales this year.
""I think we've known for quite some time that J&J's vaccine didn't have as good data as, say Pfizer. There aren't really any expectations for vaccine contribution over the long term,"" said Edwards Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans. 
J&J, the world's largest healthcare conglomerate, is planning to separate its consumer health unit to focus on its large pharmaceuticals and COVID-battered medical devices businesses.
Since the pharmaceuticals unit has been growing above-market levels for some time, ""focusing on the device business and getting that in a better spot makes a lot of sense, especially as they spin off consumer health,"" said Evans.
J&J expects to appoint executives and announce a new name and headquarters for the business that sells mouthwash, bandages and non-prescription medicines sometime in the first half to middle of 2022, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said.
Overall, fourth-quarter sales of $24.80 billion missed analysts' expectations $25.29 billion, according to Refinitiv data, as big revenue drivers such as cancer drug Imbruvica and Crohn's disease treatment Stelara came up short.
Sales of $6.86 billion for the medical devices segment missed estimates of $6.98 billion, as the surge in COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant drove hospitals to once again delay non-urgent surgical procedures such as hip and knee replacements. 

Imbruvica, which J&J shares with  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV), had sales of $1.06 billion, below estimates of $1.17 billion. Stelara sales of $2.33 billion missed estimates of $2.45 billion.

(Reuters) -American Express Co's quarterly profit beat market estimates as consumers seeking respite from the pandemic swiped its credit card to dine out and holiday, helping the company allay fears of any big impact from the Omicron variant. 
The credit-card giant's shares surged 9% on Tuesday after it reported record levels of spending in the fourth quarter as the economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and a strong jobs market encouraged customers to splurge on pre-pandemic habits.
The results mirrored remarks from the biggest U.S. banks https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/big-us-banks-say-spending-patterns-show-consumers-are-good-shape-2022-01-20, which have said that consumers - who have cash in the bank - are again eager to spend and also to borrow.
Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said in an interview he expected the trend to continue in 2022 as the new coronavirus variant only had a modest impact on travel spending, despite thousands of flight cancellations. 
""When you think about the Delta variant in 2021, and now as you see Omicron in early 2022, each of those impacts has been a little milder than the one before, and we believe shorter in duration,"" Campbell said.
Banking on those expectations, AmEx forecast 2022 net revenue growth of between 18% and 20% and earnings per share of $9.25 to $9.65. 
CRYPTO PLANS
Company executives said on a conference call that AmEx would probably not launch a cryptocurrency card, but would consider using the digital asset as a possible redemption option in the future.

According to Reuters, Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said the company is now seeing companies examine how their offices will look in future, when people use a mix of home and on-site locations.
""I don't think we are going to go back to offices like we did before. But we are going to need multiple places to work and people are going to need video in those offices because a lot of us are going to be at home, calling in.""
That optimism led the company to raise its current-year revenue growth outlook to 2% to 5% in constant currency with adjusted operating income coming in between $850 million and $900 million.
Just last October, it had confirmed its outlook of flat sales growth, plus or minus 5%.
The company’s third quarter was set up for tough comparisons given the pandemic drove sales of those devices to record highs in the same period last year.
Sales of keyboards and combos were up 29%, its ninth consecutive quarter of double digit growth. PC webcam sales fell 12% but the company still managed to grow its market share. Logitech said it is focused on persuading more customers to buy its external webcams that it claims provide a better experience.
Some categories such as mobile speakers, audio and wearables and smart home declined as the company reviews those businesses, including shutting some of them.
Adjusted operating margin took a hit of 4.6 points to 40.6% owing to higher freight costs. Sales fell 35% year-on-year to $1.6 billion while profit per share was $1.55 down 37%.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin on Tuesday said his office will investigate broker-dealers offering target-date funds, concerned about changes that created large tax bills for small-dollar investors.
In a press release Galvin said his securities division sent letters seeking information from companies including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK),, T. Rowe Price Group, a unit of Vanguard Group and others.
Representatives for the companies did not immediately comment.
Target-date mutual funds have become an increasing popular vehicle for retirement savings, typically set up to reduced the amount of risk among assets held by investors as they age. U.S. target-date funds held nearly $1.6 trillion as of 2020, up from $1.4 trillion in 2019 and $1.1 trillion in 2018, according to the Investment Company Institute, largely in retirement plans like 401(k)s.
According to the press release Galvin ""is particularly concerned by reports of inadequately disclosed fund changes that shifted financial burdens to small-dollar investors, resulting in large tax bills for those who held the funds in non-retirement accounts.""

101,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 11:25AM ET</span>",GRAPHIC - How a Russian-Ukraine conflict might hit global markets,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - A potential invasion of Ukraine by neighbouring Russia would be felt across a number of markets, from wheat and energy prices and the region's sovereign dollar bonds to safe-haven assets and stock markets.
Below are five charts showing where a potential escalation of tensions could be felt across global markets: 
1/SAFE HAVENS
Inflation at multi-decade highs and impending interest rate rises have made for a bad month for bond markets, with U.S. 10-year rates still hovering close to the key 2% level and German 10-year yields rising above 0% for the first time since 2019.
But an outright Russia-Ukraine conflict could change that.
A major risk event usually sees investors rushing back to bonds, generally seen as the safest assets, and this time may not be different, even if a Russian invasion of Ukraine risks further fanning oil prices -- and therefore inflation. 
In forex markets, the euro/Swiss franc exchange rate is seen as the biggest indicator of geopolitical risk in the euro zone as the Swiss currency has long been viewed by investors a safe haven. It hit its strongest levels since May 2015 on Monday though some of that was due to a widespread selloff on Wall Street.
Gold, also seen as a shelter in times of conflict or economic strife, is clinging to two-month peaks.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdvzyklegpw/One.PNG 
2/ GRAINS AND WHEAT
Any interruption to the flow of grain out of the Black Sea region is likely to have a major impact on prices and add further fuel to food inflation at a time when affordability is a major concern across the globe following the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Four major exporters - Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan and Romania - ship grain from ports in the Black Sea which could face disruptions from any military action or sanctions. 
Ukraine is projected to be the world's third largest exporter of corn in the 2021/22 season and fourth largest exporter of wheat, according to International Grains Council data. Russia is the world's top wheat exporter.
""Geopolitical risks have risen in recent months in the Black Sea region, which could influence wheat prices ahead,"" said Dominic Schnider, strategist at UBS. 
GRAPHIC - Soaring food prices fuel inflation pressures
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpomagzlpd/Soaring%20food%20prices%20fuel%20inflation%20pressures.PNG 
3/ NATURAL GAS AND OIL
Energy markets are likely to be hit if tensions turn into conflict. Europe relies on Russia for around 35% of its natural gas, mostly coming through pipelines which cross Belarus and Poland to Germany, Nord Stream 1 which goes directly to Germany, and others through Ukraine.
In 2020 volumes of gas from Russia to Europe fell after lockdowns suppressed demand and did not recover fully last year when consumption surged, helping to send prices to record highs.
As part of possible sanctions should Russia invade Ukraine, Germany has said it could halt the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. The pipeline is projected to increase gas imports to Europe but also underlines its energy dependence on Moscow.
SEB commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said markets would expect natural gas exports from Russia to Western Europe to be significantly reduced through both Ukraine and Belarus in the event of sanctions and for gas prices to revisit Q4 levels. 
Oil markets could also be affected through curbs or disruption. Ukraine moves Russian oil to Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Ukraine's transit of Russian crude for export to the bloc was 11.9 million metric tonnes in 2021, down from 12.3 million metric tonnes in 2020, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Platts said in a note.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said the tensions risked a ""material spike"" in oil prices and noted that a rise to $150 a barrel would reduce global GDP growth to just 0.9% annualised in the first half of the year, while more than doubling inflation to 7.2%.

4/COMPANY EXPOSURE
Listed western firms could also feel the consequences from a Russian invasion, though for energy firms any blow to revenues or profits might be somewhat offset by a potential oil price jump. 
Britain's BP (NYSE:BP) owns a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, which makes up a third of its production, and also has a number of joint ventures with Russia's largest oil producer. 
Shell (LON:RDSa) meanwhile holds a 27.5% stake in Russia's first LNG plant, Sakhalin 2, accounting for a third of the country's total LNG exports, and has a number of joint ventures with state energy giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP). 
U.S. energy firm Exxon (NYSE:XOM) operates through a subsidiary the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, in which India's state-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp also holds a stake. Norway's Equinor is also active in the country.
In the financial sector, the risk is concentrated in Europe, according to calculations by JPMorgan. 
Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International derived 39% of its estimated net profit last year from its Russian subsidiary, Hungary's OTP and UniCredit around 7% from theirs, while Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) was seen as generating 6% of group net profits through its Rosbank retail operations. Dutch financial company ING also has a footprint in Russia though that accounts for less than 1% of net profit, JPMorgan numbers showed.
Looking at loan exposure to Russia, French and Austrian banks have the largest among Western lenders at $24.2 billion and $17.2 billion, respectively. They are followed by U.S. lenders at $16 billion, Japanese at $9.6 billion and German banks at $8.8 billion, data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows.
Other sectors also have exposure. Germany's Metro AG's 93 Russian stores generate just under 10% of its sales and 17% of its core profit while Danish brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) owns Baltika, Russia's largest brewer with market share of almost 40%. 
GRAPHIC - Banks with Russia exposure
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxoqlobpx/Russia%20%20banks.JPG 
5/ REGIONAL DOLLAR BONDS AND CURRENCIES
Russian and Ukrainian assets will be at the forefront of any markets fallout from potential military action. 
Both countries' dollar bonds have underperformed their peers in recent months as investors trimmed exposure amid escalating tensions between Washington and its allies and Moscow. 
Ukraine's fixed income markets are chiefly the remit of emerging market investors, while Russia's overall standing on capital markets has shrunk in recent years amid sanctions and geopolitical tensions, somewhat cushioning any threat of contagion through those channels. 
However, Russia's rouble and Ukraine's hryvnia have also suffered, making them the worst performing emerging markets currencies so far this year. 
The situation on the Ukraine-Russian border presents ""substantial uncertainties"" for foreign currency markets, said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING.
""The events of late 2014 remind us of the liquidity gaps and U.S. dollar hoarding that led to a substantial drop in the rouble at that time,"" said Turner.

""It makes sense to think in terms of at least having ready an Omicron specific boost,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's top medical adviser and a member of the White House COVID-19 Response Team, told MSNBC.
""We may not need it... but I think it's prudent to at least prepare for the possibility that this may be a persistent variant that we may have to face - even if it's at a very low level,"" he added.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) and its partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said they have started clinical trials for a version of their vaccine targeting the highly-transmissible variant that has eluded their current two-dose protection and led to breakthrough infections. 

While much of the nation is still grappling with high Omicron infections even as cases subside in some states, Fauci said eventually enough community immunity will hopefully build up to prevent massive surges such as the four to five waves driven by variants so far.
""I don't think we're going to be seeing that indefinitely,"" he said, adding that COVID was unlikely to be eradicated.

103,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 11:21AM ET</span>","ADM posts record Q4 profit on rising biofuel demand, projects strong 2022","By Karl Plume
(Reuters) -Global grain trader Archer-Daniels-Midland Co reported a record fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday and said it would continue to cash in on strong demand for crops and biofuel in 2022.
Chicago-based ADM's earnings jumped nearly 14% in the quarter as rising biofuel demand and strong ethanol margins doubled operating profit at its carbohydrate solutions division.
High energy and grain costs, however, clipped earnings at the corn-processing unit, as well as its core ag services and oilseeds segment, where operating profit fell from the same quarter a year earlier.
Shares were down about 2.2% in midmorning trading.
ADM's results offered a look into how the world's biggest grain traders are weathering shifts in food and fuel demand triggered by the pandemic and soaring inflation.
ADM and rival agribusinesses have benefited from rising demand for food and renewable fuel as economies reopen.
""As we look forward in 2022, we see a positive demand environment across our portfolio,"" said CEO Juan Luciano.
U.S. demand for ethanol is likely to return to pre-COVID levels this year and ADM's dry mills that churn out the corn-based biofuel have resumed production after pandemic-related closures in 2020, company executives said.
Surging prices for the grain and oilseeds ADM buys, sells, processes and ships around the globe have presented a challenge.
Adverse crop weather in South America and the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, a major global grain supplier, may keep crop prices elevated ""well into probably 2023,"" Luciano said.

ADM's net earnings rose to $782 million, or $1.38 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $687 million, or $1.22 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, earnings of $1.50 a share, a record for the quarter, topped the consensus analyst estimate of $1.37, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc plans this year to let shareholders attend the company's annual meeting for the first time in three years, amid signs the Omicron wave may have peaked in the United States.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate said ""we are planning for an in-person meeting"" on April 30, while also webcasting the event for a seventh straight year.
The plan was announced even as many large corporate gatherings remain online or are delayed as the highly infectious Omicron variant spreads around the world.
But new coronavirus cases are dropping within the United States, and the top U.S. infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci told MSNBC on Monday he believed https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa/u-s-covid-peak-may-be-over-but-not-the-pain-as-deaths-rise-idUSL1N2U41O9 ""in the next few weeks we will see, as a country, that it is all turning around.""
Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend, whose centerpiece is the meeting, normally draws about 40,000 shareholders to Omaha for shopping, dining, a 5-kilometer run and other events. Buffett calls it ""Woodstock for Capitalists.""
The meeting normally features Buffett, 91, and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 98, answering several hours of shareholder questions.
Berkshire's 2020 meeting featured Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel answering questions in Omaha, while the 2021 meeting https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-touts-us-economys-unexpected-strength-berkshire-rebounds-2021-05-01 moved to Los Angeles so Munger, who lives in the area, could join Buffett on stage. Shareholders stayed home from both.
""I really hope, and I think the odds are very, very good, that we get to hold this next year in Omaha and I hope that we get a record turnout,"" Buffett said at the 2021 meeting.

Berkshire said it will release more details on the meeting with its annual shareholder report on Feb. 26.
Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965. Berkshire owns several dozen businesses including Geico car insurance and the BNSF railroad, and stocks including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).

Investing.com —  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) shares are down around 4% Tuesday, and Piper Sandler analyst Richard Repetto said in a client note that the pullback offers an attractive entry point to the crypto space.
The analyst, quoted by TheFly, said Coinbase is potentially the ""on ramp"" for all things crypto in the future. 
Coinbase's shares have already suffered a 27% year-to-date decline, in line with the fall in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, Repetto believes the stock's correlation to bitcoin will decouple over time as Coinbase's revenue diversifies. 
The analyst currently has an overweight rating and a $440 price target on the stock. 
Elsewhere, Mizuho lowered its Coinbase price target to $220 from $300 as part of an overall lowering of price targets on payment stocks."

Investing.com –  American Express  stock (NYSE:AXP) soared 8% Tuesday after the credit card issuer followed its fourth quarter beat with a bullish outlook for revenue and profit.
A spending surge helped revenue top $12 billion in the quarter, rising 30%. It also made the company set more aggressive targets.
AmEx now expects its 2022 revenue to rise 18% to 20%, nearly double of the +10% growth target it has set as its “2024+ Aspiration."" Profit per share is seen coming in between $9.25 and $9.65 in the current financial year.
“Longer term, as the economy reaches a steady state, our aspiration is to achieve revenue growth in excess of 10 percent and EPS growth in the mid-teens,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Squeri said in a statement.
Net profit rose 20%, to $1.7 billion, with more expensive marketing eating into the revenue. Consolidated expenses were $9.8 billion, up 29% as the lender tried to bring in more customers while watching customers use more of its travel-related benefits. Increased compensation also kept operating expenses elevated.
Consolidated provisions for credit losses were $53 million, compared with a benefit of $111 million a year ago, reflecting lower reserve releases compared with a year ago. Credit metrics remain near historic lows, the company said.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Logitech International is seeing offices starting to re-equip for staff returning from working at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said on Tuesday as the company raised its full-year outlook.
The tech company has been a big beneficiary of people exiled from their workplaces during the pandemic stocking up on its computer mice, keyboards and webcams.
It is now seeing companies examining how their offices will look in future, when people use a hybrid of home and on-site locations, Darrell said after Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) reported smaller-than-forecast declines in third-quarter sales and operating income. 
""I do think it is the big thaw,"" Darrell told Reuters. ""It's as if we have had the big freeze and ...we are starting to see people making decisions on what the offices are going to be like when we get back into them.
""I don't think we are going to go back to offices like we did before. But we are going to need multiple places to work and people are going to need video in those offices because a lot of us are going to be at home, calling in.""
Logitech posted a 2% drop in sales partly due to tough comparisons from a year earlier. The company was also wrestling with a shortage of semiconductor chips which has hit carmakers and tech firms.
Still, Logitech hiked its sales and profit outlook, sending its shares 8.1% higher on the Swiss exchange.
The Swiss-U.S. company, which posted a 74% sales increase last year, said it now expects full-year sales to rise between 2% and 5%, when measured in constant currencies.
Logitech, the first company to manufacture and sell computer mice in the 1980s, had previously forecast flat sales growth, plus or minus 5%.
It said it expected full year non-GAAP operating income between $850 million and $900 million, up from its previous view of $800 million to $850 million.
Sales fell to $1.63 billion in the three months ending Dec. 2021, while its non-GAAP operating income fell 37% to $302 million.
Darrell said the company was benefiting from long-term trends, like the growth in esports and video calling

The results beat expectations by a wide margin, said Bank Vontobel analyst Michael Foeth.
""This important quarter has proven Logitech's ability to sustain revenue growth at very high levels, with strong execution capabilities and discipline in a challenging and dynamic market environment,"" the analyst said.

Global crude prices have risen by more than 50% to above $86 per barrel over the past 12 months, prompting producers to spend more on exploration and drilling after years of prioritizing shareholder returns.
Still, oil companies are expected to maintain attractive shareholder returns, with Hess (NYSE:HES) CEO John Hess saying earlier this month it would announce ""meaningful"" dividend growth this year and accelerate buyback plans.
Hess expects to spend $2.6 billion on exploration and production in 2022, of which about 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken, compared with $1.9 billion last year.
The company's net production is forecast to average between 330,000 and 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2022, excluding Libya, compared with the 295,000 boepd expected in 2021.
Shares of the company, which gained 50% in 2021, fell 3.2% to $85.93 on Tuesday. The S&P Energy Index was down 2%.
The forecast for increased production comes as markets worry about supply amid geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies struggled to meet targets for higher output in recent months.
Oil and gas producers are expected to increase budgets by 13% this year, according to Cowen & Co.

Hess will spend about $1 billion to further develop Guyana, home to one of the world's largest oil discoveries this century and considered a growth engine for the company. About $1.15 billion will be spent on production, including for three rigs in North Dakota's Bakken basin.
The company is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 10:27AM ET</span>","After rocky start to year, Unilever axes 1,500 managers","By Richa Naidu and Pushkala Aripaka
LONDON (Reuters) -Unilever will cut about 1,500 management jobs and reshape its business to focus on five main product areas as it tries to boost growth after a failed acquisition and with an activist investor to appease.
The maker of Dove soap and Magnum ice cream, which employs about 149,000 people worldwide, said on Tuesday it would focus on beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice cream.
The move, which Unilever (NYSE:UL) said had been in the works for a year, echoes the reshaping by rival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) (P&G) three years ago https://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-strategy-idUKKCN1ND37M - which at the time also had activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners as a shareholder. 
""Moving to five category-focused business groups will enable us to be more responsive to consumer and channel trends, with crystal-clear accountability for delivery,"" Unilever CEO Alan Jope said.
Unilever, whose shares have fallen by about a quarter from their record high in 2019, last week effectively abandoned https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-says-it-will-not-increase-50-bln-pound-offer-gsk-consumer-business-2022-01-19 plans to buy GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK) consumer healthcare business for 50 billion pounds ($67 billion). 
Its proposal, rejected by GSK, was widely criticised by investors as being a costly and risky distraction from dealing with pressing challenges to the business, such as surging inflation in emerging markets and weakness in healthy foods. 
Days later, reports https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-shares-gain-after-activist-investor-peltz-builds-stake-2022-01-24 emerged that Peltz's Trian Partners had built a stake in Unilever, though Trian has not confirmed this. 
At P&G, Trian sought to improve the Tide detergent maker's shrinking market share, low organic sales growth, aging brands, bureaucracy and excessive structural costs, among other things. Peltz also pushed for P&G's decision to restructure its business into fewer units - similar to Unilever's new plan.
Since Trian first invested in P&G, the company's stock price nearly doubled, and bankers and lawyers who have worked with Peltz expect he may bring the playbook https://www.reuters.com/article/trian-unilever-playbook/focus-trian-expected-to-revive-its-pg-playbook-with-unilever-idINL1N2U427M that worked at P&G to Unilever.
However, there may be no quick fix. 
""Unilever operates in different product categories so it is unclear if this same strategy is enough to get growth back and over what time scale. Typically this takes years rather than months,"" Tineke Frikkee, fund manager at Unilever investor Waverton Investment Management, said. 
POOR PERFORMANCE
Unilever, which is expected next month report a decline in full-year net income, has struggled through the pandemic https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-margins-spotlight-inflation-surges-2021-10-20 with rising raw material, labour and transport costs. Its exposure to certain foods and emerging markets - where inflation is rising sharply - has also put it at a disadvantage versus rivals P&G and Nestle.
As Unilever continues to lag, investors have grown frustrated. On Thursday, British fund manager Terry Smith criticised the company in a letter to his Fundsmith LLP investors, calling the lost GSK deal a ""near death experience"" and urging management to focus on strengthening performance.
""Unilever management's response to its poor performance has been to utter meaningless platitudes to which it has now attempted to add major M&A activity,"" Smith wrote.
GlobalData analyst Ramsey Baghdadi said Unilever should focus on strengthening its current product ranges and reaching new customers, instead of diversifying into other sectors such as healthcare - as seen in the GSK bid.

Unilever, which traces its roots to a small soap business in 1880s Britain, said it did not expect factory workers to be impacted by its restructuring. There will be 15% fewer senior management roles and 5% fewer junior management roles, however.
""While today’s news may not be directly connected to the company’s failed GSK offer, the timing is unfortunate,"" Sean Moran, restructuring specialist at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, said. ""When confidence in a business is low, drastic decisions must often be made.""

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co forecast on Tuesday its vehicle production would rebound in the first half of this year as a global chip shortage is expected to ease gradually from the second quarter.
""The normalization of auto chip supply and demand is expected in the third quarter, when the capacity of semiconductor companies is expected to rise,"" Executive Vice President Seo Gang Hyun said on Hyundai's conference call.
The shortage will continue in the first quarter due to the spread of the Omicron variant, Seo said, adding it was the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic in Southeast Asia and resulting chip sourcing troubles that pushed Hyundai's sales to less than the targeted 4 million vehicles in 2021.
Southeast Asia is central to the supply of basic chips that drive the world's cars, smartphones and home devices, with Malaysia's chip assembly industry accounting for more than a tenth of a global trade worth over $200 billion. COVID-related lockdowns in the region have disrupted several industries since last year.
Hyundai said it expects a 20% sales jump in its biggest market, North America, in 2022.
Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Corp, together among the world's top 10 automakers by sales, have forecast a 12.1% jump in their combined global sales for 2022, after their sales fell almost 4% short of a target of 6.92 million vehicles last year due to the chip shortages.
Hyundai posted a nearly 50% drop in its profit for the quarter ended December, significantly short of analysts' estimate, mainly due to the payment of corporate taxes. 
It reported a net profit of 547 billion won ($456 million), versus 1.1 trillion won a year earlier. That compared with an average analyst forecast of 1.5 trillion won compiled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. 
HIGHER PRICES, OMICRON
Analysts warn that soaring raw material prices, component shortages and logistical bottlenecks caused by the pandemic are likely to further drive up costs in the current quarter.
""It is still difficult to forecast how the chip shortage will pan out ... also there will be other uncertainties involving the spread of the Omicron variant and potential issues related to Ukraine tensions,"" said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities. 
Japanese automakers  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and  Honda  Motor Co Ltd have said they plan to curb their production this month due to rising COVID cases and part supply issues.
As supply chain and distribution disruptions continue, delaying deliveries and production, analysts expect Hyundai to raise vehicle prices to mitigate the impact.
Major automakers and dealers, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Honda Motor Company (NYSE:HMC), have already raised car prices https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/inflation-risk-or-profit-engine-high-car-prices-are-both-2021-08-10 over the past year.

Shares in Hyundai Motor fell 1.5% as of 0616 GMT, versus the benchmark KOSPI's 2.7% fall.

(Reuters) -Raytheon Technologies Corp on Tuesday forecast full-year sales below Wall Street estimates, even as demand for the company's aerospace products and services benefited from a surge in air travel during the holiday season.
Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) forecast full-year sales for 2022 to be in the range of $68.5 billion to $69.5 billion, below the average Refinitiv-IBES estimate of $70.09 billion.
Its shares were down about 2% in morning trading in New York
Raytheon reported adjusted quarterly profit that beat market estimates. Sales fell 10% in its key missile and defense business, where demand remained strong but higher prices, labor shortages and supply chain constraints reduced its ability to make deliveries. 
The U.S. government's decision ahead of the holidays to open its borders to vaccinated individuals from abroad helped the wide-body aerojet aftermarket recover, driving demand for Raytheon's aircraft cabin interiors and engines.
""We're expecting continued commercial aero recovery, particularly on the backs of the international border reopenings and widebody aircraft returning to the air,"" Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Neil Mitchill told Reuters in an interview.
Easing coronavirus restrictions also translated into higher demand for Raytheon's Collins Aerospace systems as well as its space and missile units, even as manufacturers across various sectors were hit by pandemic-induced logistical problems. 
Raytheon, whose Pratt and Whitney unit supplies aircraft engines to companies like Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), said fourth-quarter revenue rose to $17.04 billion from $16.42 billion a year earlier.
Raytheon's missile business was given a boost when competitor  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) disclosed the Federal Trade Commission's opposition to its planned purchase of rocket motor maker Aerojet Rocketdyne. Raytheon has been a vocal opponent of the deal. 
Aerojet develops and manufactures liquid and solid rocket propulsion, air-breathing hypersonic engines, and electric power and propulsion for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Its customers include the Pentagon, NASA, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), and the United Launch Alliance.

Ratheon's net income rose five-fold to $686 million, or 46 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, Raytheon posted a profit of $1.08 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.02.

Investing.com — Shares of  Affirm Holdings  Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) are down more than 1% Tuesday after Mizuho Securities lowered its price target.
Analyst Dan Dolev cut the target on Affirm to $100 from $140, maintaining a buy rating. 
However, despite trimming its target, the firm provided some positive commentary on the company, with Dolev telling investors the company's ""proprietary survey shows healthy appetite and a promising start to the AFRM checkout option on Amazon.""
Affirm's buy now pay later payment solution has been available on Amazon since the end of November.
The analyst added that the survey ""suggests that a significant portion of AFRM's users may have already tried checking out with AFRM on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), potentially leading to notable upside to AFRM's volumes.""
Dolev noted the survey showed that most respondents ""expressed willingness to check out on Amazon using AFRM again. A substantial majority noted they are either likely (29%) or very likely (41%) to check out on AMZN using Affirm again.""

Investing.com – MoneyGram stock (NASDAQ:MGI) rose 3% Tuesday on a Reuters report that several private equity firms had made competing offers to acquire the company.
The report named Madison Dearborn Partners, Siris Capital Group and Advent International as firms interested in the money transfer company.
Madison Dearborn and Advent made separate offers last year, according to Reuters. MoneyGram set a Jan. 24 deadline to receive binding acquisition offers, the report said. 
Four years back, American authorities turned down a proposed deal by China’s Ant Financial to acquire MoneyGram on grounds of national security.
MoneyGram has become an acquisition target as intense competition from digital rivals and fintech platforms has weighed on its business. The company has undertaken steps to capture a share of the growing digital payments as well as crypto-based markets.
Earlier this month, it bought a 4% stake in cryptocurrency trading company Coinme. Last October, it announced a blockchain partnership that relies on fintech firm Circle's USD Coin, one of the world's fastest-growing dollar digital currencies."
116,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 09:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Twitter sees record number of govt demands to remove content, Japan and Russia lead pack","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) said governments around the world made requests to remove content from a record number of user accounts between January and June last year, in data to be released by the social media company on Tuesday.
The platform said governments made 43,387 legal demands for the removal of content from 196,878 accounts in the six-month period, according to data in its latest transparency report seen by Reuters.
Twitter said this was the largest number of accounts ever targeted with government removal requests in a reporting period since the company started releasing transparency reports in 2012. It was also the largest number of government removal requests in a reporting period. 
Ninety-five percent of these legal demands came from five countries, with the most coming from Japan, followed by Russia, Turkey, India, and South Korea, it said. The site is blocked in several countries including China and North Korea.
Twitter said it either ""withheld"" access to content in certain countries or required account holders to remove some or all of the reported content in response to 54% of the global legal demands in this period. 
""We're facing unprecedented challenges as governments around the world increasingly attempt to intervene and remove content,"" Twitter's vice president of global public policy and philanthropy Sinead McSweeney said in a statement. ""This threat to privacy and freedom of expression is a deeply worrying trend that requires our full attention.""
Major social media companies face ongoing scrutiny from global governments and regulators over the material they allow on their platforms. In the past year, Twitter has faced high-profile tussles with governments from India to Nigeria over content moderation and regulation.
Twitter has also, along with companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), faced criticism in the United States and other countries over how it combats issues like misinformation and violent rhetoric on its platform.
The number of accounts specified in the legal requests was up almost 50% from 131,933 accounts from the previous six months, according to the data. The number of government removal requests increased 14% from 38,524 in the last reporting period and was up about 2.8% year-over-year, Twitter said. 

The company said this summer it had seen a surge in government demands worldwide in 2020 to take down content posted by journalists and news outlets, but it said the number of such accounts subject to these requests decreased 14% in the latest reporting period. 
The report also said requests from governments for Twitter to preserve account information were down by about 4% from the previous reporting period. It said the United States accounted for about 57% of these requests and the U.S. was also the single largest source of government information requests.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 09:45AM ET</span>",Trian expected to revive its P&G playbook with Unilever,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Two and a half years ago Nelson Peltz, the billionaire activist investor who often presents himself as a partner with constructive advice for companies, told an audience of pension and hedge funds that no one had a monopoly on good ideas.
Sitting only a few feet away, nodding in agreement, was Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co Chief Executive David Taylor, who ended one of the industry's most acrimonious corporate battles by inviting Peltz onto P&G's board in 2018.
For nearly four years until Peltz' retirement from the P&G board in August, the men traded ideas about how to woo new customers to buy Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. Since Trian first invested with P&G, the company's stock price nearly doubled.
Now Peltz' Trian Fund Management has built a stake in P&G rival Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc, the purveyor of Dove and Lifebuoy soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr bouillon, according to several sources. Trian has declined to confirm the stake and declined to comment for this story.
A half a dozen bankers and lawyers who have worked with Peltz for roughly a decade and watched him operate at a number of large companies expect he may soon bring the playbook that worked at Cincinnati-based P&G to Unilever's London-based CEO Alan Jope.
""It is not that Nelson Peltz has a deep grounding in soap, but he knows his way around complex companies,"" said an advisor who knows how Trian works but is not permitted to discuss the private firm publicly. ""His team can work backwards from an income statement to understand what levers need to be pulled to make a company better.""
Unilever declined to comment.
At P&G, Trian criticized aging brands, a ""suffocating bureaucracy,"" short term thinking and sluggish shareholder returns. Many of the same problems https://www.reuters.com/business/unilevers-soap-opera-ma-job-cuts-grumpy-investors-2022-01-25 exist at Unilever, where the share price has been roughly flat for years. The company last week suffered a stinging rejection https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-offers-50-bln-pounds-gsk-unit-report-2022-01-15 when GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) refused to sell it its consumer health unit, bankers said.
Unilever has already taken some steps to cut costs by consolidating its headquarters in London and getting rid of some slower growing businesses like its Lipton tea brand. Unilever, which employs about 149,000 people worldwide, on Tuesday said it plans to cut about 1,500 management jobs https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-cut-1500-management-jobs-strategic-overhaul-2022-01-25 in a restructuring to create five product-focused divisions - a revamp that echoes P&G's reshaping three years ago https://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-strategy-idUKKCN1ND37M. 
But bankers and analysts said there is more work ahead at Unilever, such as winning in the digital marketplace and solving for an insular culture in which many top executives, including the CEO, have worked for decades. Unilever's sluggish sales that have been largely blamed on the pandemic, coupled with a drop in operating profits for the full 2021 year, leave room for improvement, bankers said.
The half dozen people who have known how Trian operates said the firm has shaped itself into an operational activist that sticks around for many years to see the job through. It has previously taken stakes in Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP) as well as  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), where it has been an investor since 2015.
Trian likes to present itself as an additional resource to the board and often signals that it does not want to replace others. But once inside the boardroom, two of the insiders also said that Trian's voice often takes over and crowds out others.
Trian's army of analysts work relentlessly on producing binders of information and data to help the board and management think through new ways of doing things, the people said.

While investors and bankers said Trian may use a model for what it wants done at a company, they also said there is little fear of corporate secrets leaking because the principals, and even the entire firm, tend to sign non-disclosure agreements to ensure confidentiality.
The firm's team works largely out of the limelight and its three founders rarely make public demands to fire the chief executive as some other activists do, bankers and analysts said. Trian's most recent public investments have been in mutual fund companies Invesco and JanusHenderson.

The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential matter, cautioned that no deal is certain.
Spokespeople for MoneyGram, Madison Dearborn, Siris and Advent did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
MoneyGram has become an acquisition target as intense competition from digital rivals such as Remitly Global Inc and Revolut has weighed on its ability to capitalize on the growing market for payments and remittances.

MoneyGram, which according to its website has served 150 million people in the last five years, has been focusing on digital payments as an area of growth. In October, it announced a blockchain partnership that relies on financial technology firm Circle's USD Coin, one of the world's fastest-growing dollar digital currencies. Earlier this month, it unveiled another partnership with Japanese financial technology firm Digital Wallet Corp to facilitate international money transfers.
A $1.2 billion deal for China's Ant Financial to acquire MoneyGram was blocked by the United States in January 2018 on national security concerns. MoneyGram shares took a hit as a result, but have since recovered. They have surged 43% in the last 12 months, compared with a 2% rise in the Nasdaq Composite index.

Over the weekend,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s comic book adventure became the sixth-highest grossing movie in history with $1.69 billion at the global box office (not adjusted for inflation). It passed ""Jurassic World"" ($1.67 billion) and ""The Lion King"" ($1.66 billion) to secure that spot. 
Now in its sixth weekend of release, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" returned to the No. 1 slot in North America, adding $14.1 million between Friday and Sunday, along with $27.7 million overseas. The superhero epic, starring Tom Holland as Marvel's neighborhood web-slinger, opened in December and has generated $721 million at the domestic box office and $970.1 million internationally. 
Outside of the United States, where ""No Way Home"" ranks as the fourth-biggest movie ever, Spidey's latest adventure has done especially well in the U.K. -- Holland's birthplace -- amassing $116 million to date.

Sales in the December quarter rose 0.3%, to $8.6 billion, even as two of its largest businesses – safety and industrial and transportation and electronics declined.
The company makes a wide variety of products that find use in automotive, aerospace, home care, health and food safety among many others. The quarter was a challenging one for the company as it struggled to ensure raw material availability. A waning pandemic also weakened demand for its products. Sales of its disposable respirators fell 25% year-on-year.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Tuesday announced its second try at enabling advertisers to buy ads based on users' browsing interests without having to rely on what it has described as privacy-invasive tracking cookies.
Google wants to block tracking cookies in its Chrome web browser by the end of next year, which would prevent advertising companies from logging the websites someone is visiting. Advertisers, website owners and privacy groups have all raised alarms over the planned transition, and complaints have led antitrust authorities in the United States, United Kingdom and elsewhere to watch Google's plans closely.
Online ad buyers and sellers are weighing successors to the cookies. Options include tracking users by asking for their email addresses to access websites or adopting new technologies that Google, Mozilla and other browser makers could build into their software. 
Google's initial solution, known as Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLoC, aimed to constantly group people into big baskets designed by algorithms based on websites users visited in the last week. Advertisers could show ads to a preferred basket, but they would not know the individuals in it or what interest they shared in common. 
But in tests last year, some advertisers found FLoC less effective than cookies for choosing users to target and the system carried the risk of exposing an individual's browsing history, Google product director Vinay Goel told Reuters.
Companies in the $250 billion global online display advertising industry fear the loss of cookies will make them more reliant on buying ads from Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) because of their big user databases.

The new browser system, which is called Topics, groups each user in up to 15 baskets out of about 350 human-designed choices such as ""fitness"" and ""travel"" based on three weeks of browsing. Advertisers will see up to three baskets per user as they decide whether to show that individual an ad.
Goel said browsing is tracked only on websites that enable Topics, and users can dissociate from a topic or turn off the technology altogether. Testing will begin within months, he said.

The recommendation by the CADE superintendent's office still needs to be endorsed by the watchdog's court.
In a statement on Tuesday, CADE said the recommended divestment involves self-service retail units. CADE has 240 days, extendable for another 90 days, to rule on the deal.
Carrefour Brasil, the local unit of the French retail giant, announced last March the acquisition of Grupo BIG for roughly 7.5 billion reais ($1.36 billion) from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and investment firm Advent International.
Carrefour already has a major presence in Brazil, where its subsidiary Carrefour Brasil is the country's biggest retailer by most measures and runs the Atacadão supermarket stores.

The acquisition will make it the uncontested market leader in the country, since BIG is considered Brazil's third-biggest food retailer, behind rival Grupo Pão de Açúcar.

Leonardo shares fell as much as 8% earlier on Tuesday, extending losses from the previous session, with traders attributing the drop to an investigation into the Kuwait deal.
Kuwait has referred two senior army officers to the public prosecutor over suspected corruption related to the deal to buy Eurofighter Typhoon jets, the state anti-corruption body said on Monday. 
Leonardo said its contract with Kuwait ""has always been based on the principles of maximum transparency as well as full fairness"" and that every transaction is subject to rigorous checks.
Kuwait signed a 8 billion euro ($9.04 billion) contract with Leonardo in 2016 for a total of 28 aircraft, the first two of which were delivered last month.

Leonardo said on Tuesday that ""others will follow as per plan"".

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Ericsson beat quarterly core earnings forecasts on Tuesday, sending its shares up 8% as global demand for telecoms equipment for 5G networks offset more market share losses in mainland China. 
The Swedish company has been losing business in China since Sweden banned China's Huawei from its 5G rollout. China now accounts for a low single digit proportion of group revenue, down from more than 11% before the Swedish ban, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) said. 
However, that has been offset by robust demand elsewhere.
""We have seen North America continue to grow very strongly and we grew there by 16% in the quarter in constant currency,"" Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander said.
While a resurgent Nokia (NYSE:NOK) has been increasing competition in several markets, Ericsson was also able to grow in Europe and Latin America in its fiscal fourth quarter.
China had an early start in rolling out 5G networks - which promises faster speeds and development of technologies such as remote surgery - but other countries are catching up. Ericsson has so far signed 170 5G contracts. 
""We think we are still relatively early in the 5G rollout if you look on the globe, so we will continue to see good demand for 5G going forward,"" CEO Börje Ekholm told a conference call.
The company's quarterly adjusted operating earnings rose to 11.9 billion Swedish crowns ($1.28 billion) from 11 billion a year ago, beating analysts' mean forecast of 10.30 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings rose to 12.3 billion crowns.
While Ericsson's total quarterly revenue rose 2% to 71.3 billion crowns, beating estimates of 68.33 billion crowns, sales in mainland China declined by 1.8 billion crowns.
Mainland China will likely see a drop in revenue for at least one more quarter, Mellander said.

Investing.com –  General Electric  stock (NYSE:GE) fell 2.6% in Tuesday’s premarket trade as fourth-quarter revenue fell short of estimates, let down by its power and renewable energy business.
Total quarterly revenue of over $20 billion was 3% lower year-on-year. Revenue in the power division fell 13% as the company shipped fewer units of its equipment due to reduced demand from gas power stations. Demand for equipment from coal-fired units also continued to suffer as more companies exited that segment.  Overall orders were down 23% and revenue was down 13%
In the renewable energy business, clients delayed investments due to uncertainty over the future of tax credits, leading to a 23% drop in orders. Revenue fell 6%.
Supply shortages led to a 4% decline in revenue from healthcare. Orders were up though by 6%.
The aviation business, the company's largest, shone as expanded airline scheduled bolstered demand for its engines and related services. Orders were up 22% while revenue rose 4%.
The company is now projecting its 2022 revenue to grow by just under 10%. It sees adjusted EPS for the year at $3.15 at the midpoint of its guidance range.
Profit per share for the December quarter was 92 cents, higher than estimated.
The 2022 estimates are based on the company's new reporting format, which it moved to after selling off its jet-leasing business and folding the remainder of its capital business into corporate operations.
GE plans to spin off its healthcare business in early 2023 and its renewable energy and power company in early 2024, leaving the remaining company focused on aviation. It plans to keep around 20% in the healthcare business.  "

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse warned on Tuesday that it would post a fourth-quarter loss as the scandal-hit lender flagged fresh legal costs and said business in its trading and wealth management divisions had slowed.
Switzerland's second-largest lender announced plans in November to rein in its investment bankers and plough money into looking after the fortunes of the world's rich as it tries to curb a freewheeling culture that has cost it billions.
It said the investment bank would make a loss in the final quarter of the year, while the wealth management business had seen an overall drop in assets. 
On top of previously announced charges,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) will make a fresh 500 million Swiss franc legal provision to settle legacy cases related to the investment bank, putting it on track for an overall quarterly loss of around 1.6 billion Swiss francs ($1.75 billion). 
""The cleaning up of legacy burdens from investment banking is threatening to become a never-ending story,"" analysts at Zuercher Kantonalbank said in a note, adding they saw no reason to invest in the bank's shares, which were around 0.5% lower by 0900 GMT. 
Credit Suisse has been trying to turn the page on a slew of negative headlines and reform its risk management culture, an effort set back by the abrupt departure of the chairman brought in just nine months earlier to lead that transformation.
It said the investment bank had been affected by a slowdown in transaction-based revenue.
""Combined with the reduction in our overall risk appetite, including our decision to substantially exit our prime services business, this has resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 2021 in the Investment Bank division,"" the lender said.
It said its core wealth management businesses would also be hit by a slowdown in transactions, resulting in ""modestly negative"" net new assets for those businesses.
""While we already expected lower transaction and trading revenues, the declines are likely larger than estimated. In addition, we might also have been somewhat optimistic on costs,"" Vontobel analysts wrote. 
Credit Suisse pointed to a slowdown in Asia and a reversion to more normal trading conditions after the bumper activity that prevailed for much of 2020 and 2021.
Major U.S. banks also flagged last week that the huge uptick in trading volumes during the pandemic was starting to moderate as expectations for a series of U.S. interest rate hikes and a rise in consumer spending tempered investment rates.
Investors and analysts are waiting to see how the bank's troubles, including two major scandals in March 2021, will impact Credit Suisse's client relationships.
On Tuesday, it said its asset management business, hit at the time by the collapse of $10 billion in funds linked to insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill, had seen inflows in the last quarter of 2021, helping ""more than offset"" the outflows from wealth management.

For the first nine months of 2021, Credit Suisse reported a net profit of 435 million francs, down nearly 86% year on year. On a pre-tax basis, income stood at 1.064 billion francs.

(Reuters) -U.S. weapons maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by a strong performance at its ships and helicopters unit and venture capital gains, and reiterated its sales guidance for 2022.
But the company also said it had been informed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that its planed purchase of Aerojet Rocketdyne would raise antitrust concerns, leaving Lockheed either to abandon the transaction or fight a federal lawsuit in order to close the deal.
The $4.4 billion deal announced in late 2020 is Lockheed's first large acquisition under new Chief Executive Jim Taiclet. It would reshape the competitive landscape for solid rocket fuel missiles which are used with jets and drones.
Lockheed reported net operating earnings were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, or $7.47 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.98 billion, or $7.12 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Full-year earnings per share were $22.76, beating analyst estimates of $22.44.
Net sales were $17.7 billion during the fourth quarter, just beating analyst estimates of $17.67 billion. 
Last October, the Bethesda, Maryland-based company lowered its 2022 full-year revenue outlook to $66 billion - sending its shares tumbling - citing challenges with its supply chain. Lockheed reaffirmed that 2022 revenue guidance on Tuesday.
U.S. President Joe Biden has not signaled he plans to slash the 2023 budget for Lockheed's biggest customer, the Pentagon, despite progressive Democrats calling for a reduction in military spending and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The company said it now expects full-year 2022 earnings per share to be about $26.70, ahead of analysts' expectation of $26.36 per share, according to data from Refinitiv.
Lockheed's biggest unit, which makes F-35 fighter jets for the United States and its allies, delivered 142 of the stealthy planes in 2021, three more than originally planned.
During 2021 the company sent $7 billion back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and paid an effective tax rate of 16.9%."

Investing.com – Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) traded 3.4% lower in premarket Tuesday on a Bloomberg report that it plans to abandon its pursuit of chip designer ARM from Japan-based Softbank.
The purchase would have handed Nvidia, a chipmaker, a prized asset at a time when capabilities related to chip designing and manufacturing are rare. ARM offers its designs to more than 500 companies that make their own chips.
According to the news service, the company has told partners that it doesn’t expect the transaction to close while Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) is now planning an IPO for ARM.
Nvidia had in September 2020 set an 18-month deadline to complete the takeover, but the transaction made little progress all this while, running into regulatory resistance in more than one country.
The deal divided the stakeholders into two camps. ARM customers like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), MediaTek (TW:2454) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) supported the deal, The Sunday Times reported in June last year.
On the other side, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were among those reportedly voicing fears that Nvidia could limit the supply of the company’s technology to its competitors or raise prices. 
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to stop the transaction in December, arguing that Nvidia would become too powerful if it gained control over ARM’s chip designs. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority, the regulator in ARM's home country, also opposed the deal.
The transaction would have faced tight scrutiny in China too where ARM has a joint venture with private equity firm Hopu Investments.

Ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting this week that’s expected to point toward a rate hike in March, the strategists warned that sharp monetary tightening to tame inflation could eventually have knock-on effects on economic activity, hurting stocks.
“There is the risk that a rates shock triggers a growth shock,” Christian Mueller-Glissmann and his colleagues wrote in a note after Monday’s dramatic sessions for European and U.S. markets. “That risk looks higher, as inflation pressures are much higher than since the 1980s.”
U.S. futures dropped on Tuesday after Monday’s late rally as traders awaited more clarity from the Fed on the path of rate hikes. Bets on a more aggressive stance by the central bank have triggered a rout across both sides of the Atlantic this month, and a rotation away from pricey stocks valued on future growth expectations.
With the post-pandemic economic rebound now past its peak, and central banks about to turn off the taps of abundant liquidity, companies have been giving more guarded guidance for the months ahead, adding to signs that the explosive earnings growth that fueled the equity rally may be nearing its end.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute strategists warned on Monday that “monetary policy cannot stabilize both inflation and growth: it has to choose between them.” Eventually, central banks will have to live with higher prices, given the cost to growth of suppressing inflation, the strategists led by Jean Boivin wrote in a note.
If anything, markets are not yet worried enough about the growth outlook, and are still too focused on rates, according to  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) strategist Max Kettner.
“As we move further along in the first half, I do think it will become increasingly clear that growth momentum will have slowed materially, and that is not great for risk assets,” Kettner said in written comments. The slowdown “might take off some of the heat of rate hike expectations, but particularly cyclical asset classes won’t like this.”

The maker of Dove soap and Magnum ice cream has had a bumpy few years, with shares falling about a quarter from highs seen in late 2019, and CEO Alan Jope's plans facing scrutiny.
Here are key developments around Unilever in the past two months.
NOV. 18, 2021:
Unilever agreed to sell its global tea business to CVC Capital Partners for 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion), concluding a process of reviewing and spinning off the division that took more than two years.
JAN. 15, 2022:
Unilever confirmed it had approached GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) about buying its consumer goods business following media reports.
Later in the day, GSK said it had rejected Unilever's 50-billion-pound ($68 billion) offer, saying it ""fundamentally undervalued"" the consumer healthcare business.
GSK said it had received the third approach from Unilever on Dec. 20 and that it comprised 41.7 billion pounds in cash and 8.3 billion in Unilever shares. 
JAN. 17
Unilever signalled it would pursue a deal for GSK's consumer business, calling it a ""strong strategic fit,"" but shares slid more than 8%. The company also said it would announce an initiative later in the month to strengthen its business. 
JAN. 19
Late in the day, Unilever said it would not raise its offer for GSK's consumer healthcare business from 50 billion pounds. Sources had told Reuters GSK would not engage with Unilever unless the offer was sweetened.
JAN. 20
Unilever shares slipped on its short-lived pursuit of GSK's consumer health assets. Influential British fund manager Terry Smith criticised the failed bid as a ""near death experience"" and urged Unilever to focus on strengthening performance.
JAN. 23
A source told Reuters that activist investor Nelson Peltz's hedge fund, Trian Partners, had built a stake of an unspecified size in Unilever, ratcheting up pressure on the company, months after Peltz stepped down from rival P&G's board.

JAN. 24
Unilever shares rose 6% on reports of Peltz's stake.

Economic losses - the combination of insured and uninsured losses - reached $343 billion, Aon said in the report which it publishes annually.
Climate change and greater population density in some areas hit by disasters are adding to the losses, said Steve Bowen, head of catastrophe insight at Aon. 
""Weather has always happened, weather is always going to happen -- climate change is essentially the steroid that makes the events become more intense,"" he said.
""There's more people moving into those high-risk areas, you have these climate-change-enhanced events affecting more people.""
European floods in July produced record economic losses for the continent at $46 billion, with insured losses of $13 billion.
In addition to losses from hurricanes, wildfires and the European floods, major disasters last year included a winter storm in Texas, tornadoes in Kentucky and an earthquake in Japan.
There were around 10,500 deaths from natural disasters last year, Aon said.

Reinsurer Munich Re https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/natural-disasters-cost-insurers-120-billion-2021-munich-re-says-2022-01-10 said earlier this month that global insured losses amounted to $120 billion in 2021, while Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-storms-make-2021-one-most-costly-record-insurers-swiss-re-says-2021-12-14 in December put the tally at $105 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to soon release details from a study of semiconductor chips it conducted last year amid a push to win funding to boost U.S. manufacturing from Congress.
In September, the department asked semiconductor chip manufacturers and other companies in the supply chain to voluntarily submit data amid a shortage of chips that has curtailed auto production around the world.
The department has said it received cooperation but has not yet released details. Automakers and chips manufacturers have warned the supply shortages could last until least 2023.
On Monday, the Commerce Department sought input on planning potential programs to incentivize government investment in semiconductor manufacturing and research.
""The United States faces both an immediate supply shortage that’s driving up prices and a long-term threat to America’s economic and national security if we don’t increase domestic supply of chips,"" said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Monday.
Chrysler-parent Stellantis said Friday it was halting production this week at its Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario where it builds minivans because of the chips shortage.
House Democrats are expected as early as this week to introduce legislation aimed at increasing U.S. competitiveness with China and spending $52 billion on semiconductor production and research, sources told Reuters, after the Senate approved funding in June.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week said the bill would come ""soon"" and a vote on the House floor is expected in February, the sources said.

Biden has been pressing Congress to approve more funds to boost chip production in the United States as shortages of the key components used in autos and computers have exacerbated supply chain bottlenecks.
On Friday, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced it plans to invest $20 billion and build two new chips plants in Ohio, while Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) in November picked Taylor, Texas for a new $17 billion plant to make advanced chips.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is expected to post record revenue on Wednesday, but analysts and investors are focusing on how fast Tesla can scale up production at two new factories this year with technology changes as well as battery and other supply chain constraints clouding the outlook.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk promises an updated product roadmap on Wednesday, with eyes on the time frames for the launch of Cybertruck and a hoped-for $25,000 electric car.

Musk said new factories will use manufacturing technology such as casting the body in only two or more pieces and integrating next-generation batteries into the vehicle body. 
While the new technologies would help cut the number of vehicle parts, thus reducing manufacturing complexity and bringing down costs, they could be ""significant production risk,"" Musk said in 2020. 
In addition, investors will want to hear about the outlook for the supply chain, with automakers straining to meet demand for electric vehicles. 
4680 BATTERIES 
Tesla expected the first vehicles equipped with its own 4680 battery which could give cars more range and bring down their costs, to be delivered early this year, but it is not clear when it would be able to mass produce the batteries.
Tesla's major battery supplier Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) will begin producing its new batteries for Tesla from as early as 2023 in Japan, the Nikkei reported on Monday. LG Energy Solution also aimed for 2023 production of the 4680 cells, Reuters reported last year.
CYBERTRUCK 
In 2019, Musk unveiled Tesla's futuristic electric pickup trucks, aiming to gain a foothold in the popular and profitable segment in the U.S. market. 
Musk, who has often missed his self-imposed launch targets, has already delayed Cybertruck production from late 2021 to late 2022. A source told Reuters that Tesla aims to start initial production of the much-anticipated model in early 2023, saying they are making changes to features and functionalities from its original version.
""This is the first time that Tesla has brought a vehicle out with serious competition,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, referring to Ford and Rivian, which are planning to ramp up production.
As it is very hard to crack into the U.S. truck market - the home turf of American ""Big Three"" automakers, Tesla is likely to go after ""weekend warriors or lifestyle buyers"" rather than traditional commercial buyers, he said. 
$25,000 ELECTRIC CARS 
Musk in 2020 promised that in three years Tesla would offer a $25,000 electric car that can drive itself. 

Tesla vice president Lars Moravy said in October that the company would not add new vehicles while battery cells were constrained, and that production of its existing models would take priority. 
""Longer term investors care about Model 2,"" Munster said with the current vehicle pricing, Tesla would not be able to grow volume by 50% every year.

Investing.com – Ericsson ADRs (NASDAQ:ERIC) traded 6.2% higher in Monday’s premarket as the adoption of 5G wireless technology gathered pace in global markets, helping it overcome the loss of market share in China.
Excluding a sales decline in mainland China, organic revenue rose 8%. The company met its 2022 EBIT margin target of 12%-14% a year earlier than scheduled, almost hitting the top end of it.
At a consolidated level, group reported sales rose 3% year-on-year to top 71 billion Swedish kronor (around $7.7 billion) as more countries adopted 5G and more clients issued orders for network deployment. Growth was primarily driven by 5G deployments in North America and Europe and Latin America as well as by growth in digital services in Middle East and Africa. The U.S.'s contribution to quarterly net sales rose to 32% from 29% in the same period a year ago.
On the other hand, China’s contribution halved to 4% for the full year as the company found itself in the crosshairs of a trade battle between Europe and China. China had retaliated in like fashion after Europe barred the likes of Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) from contracts to build 5G network infrastrucutre owing to security concerns. Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) laid off people in China and took a restructuring charge of 500 million kronor.
Net profit rose 41% to exceed 10 billion kronor, helped by a lower tax rate."

The plan underscores an even more cautious approach by Lamborghini - part of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group - to electrification, after Winkelmann last year said the brand's first fully electric car model would appear in the second half of the decade.
Lamborghini and other players in the high-performance sports car market, which include Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), Aston Martin Lagonda and McLaren, are wrestling with how to shift their ranges to battery power without losing the high performance that supports their premium pricing.
Lamborghini's first fully electric model will be a four-seater coupé sport utility (SUV), with a nod to the tradition of grand tourers (GT), the spokeswoman said confirming comments made by the Chief Executive to Italian press agency ANSA.
Winkelmann reiterated Lamborghini would make its entire lineup, including the Huracan and Aventador sports cars and the Urus SUV, hybrid in two or three years.
This timetable, however, puts Lamborghini behind rival Ferrari, which has already rolled out three hybrid models and has promised to have a battery-electric car by 2025.

Winkelmann said sales volumes for this year were expected to be in line with those of last year, when the brand shipped 8,405 cars, and that orders were already covering a good part of their planned production.

PARIS (Reuters) -Remy Cointreau is confident demand for its premium cognac in China, the United States and Europe will underpin profit growth this year after the French spirits group beat third-quarter sales forecasts.
The maker of Remy Martin cognac and Cointreau liquor was slightly more cautious, however, on prospects for Chinese New Year celebrations next month due to COVID restrictions, and its shares reversed earlier gains to trade down 1.6% by midday.
""We are optimistic on Chinese New year but a little more cautious than we were two months ago. It will be a solid 2022 Chinese New Year though not the best ever for the industry,"" Finance Chief Luca Marotta told analysts.
Remy is banking on its Club cognac in particular to win market share in China, he added.
The pandemic has helped Remy's drive towards higher-priced spirits to boost profit margins long term, accelerating a shift towards premium drinks, at-home consumption, cocktails and e-commerce.
Group sales for the three months to Dec. 31 came in at 440.5 million euros ($498.1 million), an organic rise of 21%, beating a company-compiled consensus from 18 analysts for a 15.1% rise.
Sales at the Remy Martin cognac division, which makes 90% of group profits, rose 19.4% to 332.7 million euros, also above analysts' estimates of 14.9%. 
The company said the third-quarter performance reflected double-digit sales growth in China, led by Club cognac and strong e-commerce sales during the Singles' Day online shopping bonanza.
Cognac demand in the United States also remained strong, with high-end brands such as Louis XIII cognac that sells for more than $2,000 a bottle, Remy Martin XO and 1738  Accor  (PA:ACCP) Royal outperforming.
For the full 2021/22 year, Remy kept a forecast of ""very strong"" organic growth in current operating profit and strong organic sales growth, and reiterated it was confident in its ability to outperform the premium spirits market. 
Marotta told analysts that consensus forecasts for 2021-22 organic current operating profit growth of 38% and sales growth of 26.5% were ""at the right level"".
Due to higher marketing and communication spending and a tougher comparison base in the second half, full-year profits will be driven solely by first-half growth, the group reiterated

The French company's fiscal year starts on April 1 and ends on March 31.

151,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 05:20AM ET</span>",Chinese state-owned property firms step in to rescue cash-strapped developers,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese state-owned property firms are expected to acquire more assets from cash-strapped private developers, analysts said, as Beijing steps up efforts to stabilise and tighten control over a crisis-hit sector that accounts for a quarter of its economy.
The market has seen over half a dozen deals in recent weeks following easing of rules to issue debt for quality property firms, and initiatives by local governments to facilitate asset disposal for distressed firms.
State-owned China Overseas Land & Investment (COLI) is buying stakes of Shimao Group and Agile Group in a joint venture project for a total of 3.7 billion yuan ($585 million).
Regulatory curbs on borrowing have driven China's property sector into crisis, highlighted by China Evergrande Group https://www.reuters.com/business/shares-china-evergrande-jump-after-report-restructuring-plan-be-released-soon-2022-01-24, once the country's top-selling developer but now the world's most indebted property company.
In the last two months, Beijing has taken a string of measures to restore stability in the sector hit by defaults on offshore debt obligations, credit rating downgrades and a selloff in developers' bonds and stocks.
Those measures included urging banks to provide appropriate lending to developers, making issuance of interbank notes and asset-backed securities easier, and not including M&A related loans in the debt ratio caps for state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
The sector is seeing a spurt in dealmaking as a result.
Shimao, which has defaulted on a trust loan and extended asset-backed securities payments this month, sold a commercial land in Shanghai last week to a company owned by the Shanghai municipal government for 1.1 billion yuan.
The property management arm of state-backed developer China Resources Land acquired property services businesses of Yuzhou Group and Jiangsu Zhongnan Construction this month for a total of 3.3 billion yuan.
""For sure we will see more of these deals, because the central government has made the order,"" said Oscar Choi, founder and CIO of Oscar and Partners Capital Limited. ""Large state-owned enterprises will need to respond and act."" 
Choi expects SOEs will not go beyond assets and management property business to directly acquire stakes in the distressed developers, as Beijing wants to stop short of direct bailouts and keep only the ""meaningful"" players in the market. 
""Equity investment will be a last resort ... (Beijing's) broad principle is save the market and not individual developers.""
DISTRESSED ASSETS
With a growing list of embattled private developers now scrambling for cash to meet debt obligations, pay suppliers and workers, and complete construction work, more such deals are in the offing.
Shimao is putting 36 of its projects worth 77 billion yuan on sale, according to local media The Paper on Tuesday. The firm could fetch up to 23.6 billion yuan in cash after repaying the debt pledged to the assets. 
""Many more private developers are going to end up in the hands of state-owned ones; Shimao is just one case of money,"" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Natixis Asia Pacific chief economist.
Major private developer Sunac China has also been disposing its assets in recent months to buyers including state-owned Beijing Capital Group and Zhuhai-based Huafa Group, media reported, raising over 20 billion yuan. 
Shimao and Sunac declined to comment.
While state-supported deals would send a positive signal to the market and ease the cash crunch of the sellers for a short while, developers said it will not be enough to solve the debt crisis in the sector.
""There are so many distressed assets in the market, how much can the SOEs buy?"", said a senior official of a developer based in eastern China, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.

Among China's top 30 developers, assets owned by state-owned firms are worth 6.2 trillion yuan, just 48% of their private counterparts, according to ANZ, and they generally have lower leverage ratios than their private counterparts. 
""We doubt how successful 'nationalising' the property sector can be, if there is such a plan,"" ANZ said in a report last week.

152,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 05:15AM ET</span>","'Gamification' in financial markets under scrutiny, says EU watchdog","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Gamification has introduced a new generation of retail investors to financial markets who may not be aware there are few protections in assets like cryptocurrencies, the European Union's securities watchdog said on Tuesday.
Gamification refers to using smartphones to trade, a trend which took off on Wall Street during the coronavirus pandemic with apps like Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), and has spilled over into European markets.
""We want investors to engage more in financial markets and not just keep their money under the mattress,"" Verena Ross, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority, told a Forum Europe financial services conference.
But gamification also presents significant risks, creates speculation and leaves investors not realising there are protections when trading markets like cryptoassets, she said.
Social media has also allowed the spread of unauthorised trading advice and the bloc is due this year to revamp its ""retail investor"" strategy to reflect the rise of digital finance, Ross said.
""We are looking at how to raise awareness and warn investors what they are letting themselves in for,"" Ross said.
The bloc has already proposed banning ""payment for order flow"" in the retail market.
But EU regulators face a balancing act between protecting investors while allowing retail investment to flourish in a region which has long favoured savings products.
The bloc has made a push to deepen its capital market to encourage companies to raise funds by issuing shares rather than relying on banks, made all the more urgent by Britain's departure from the EU.
Alexandra Jour-Schroeder, a senior official in the European Commission's financial services unit, said ""cumbersome"" listing rules will be reformed as the bloc lags ""far behind"" other jurisdictions in helping companies raise funds on markets.

But Francesco Ceccato, CEO of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Europe, said more was needed to harness huge savings in the EU to green the economy.
""What we really need is to marshall greater political support around something that can be a bit more radical in some places... to create an equity culture in the EU,"" Ceccato said.

Investing.com –  IBM  stock (NYSE:IBM) traded 2.7% higher in premarket Tuesday after increasing adoption of its Cloud and AI services drove the best quarterly sales growth at the tech giant in a decade.
These were IBM’s first results after the spinoff of its lower-margin managed infrastructure services business, now housed under Kyndryl. IBM’s legacy business had been under pressure for long as more clients shifted to Cloud and the company was slow to adopt the model. That’s now changing.
Fourth-quarter sales rose 6.5% to nearly $17 billion, an outcome of CEO Arvind Krishna’s focus on hybrid Cloud and AI services. Of this, hybrid Cloud brought $6.2 billion, up 16%. The company named  Dun & Bradstreet  (NYSE:DNB_old) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) as recent wins for those capabilities. It said it is partnering EY to help organizations leverage hybrid Cloud.
A hybrid model allows corporates to use outsourced Cloud-based servers as well as its own. This blended model allows clients to derive two-and-a-half-times more value, according to statements made earlier by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna.
Software revenue rose 8.2% to $7.3 billion, led by 19% growth in Red Hat as the company helped clients gain more flexibility in adopting automation. Consulting revenue was higher by 13% at $4.7 billion. Adjusted profit per share was $3.35 and beat estimates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Texas, Indiana, Washington State and the District of Columbia sued Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Monday over what they called deceptive location-tracking practices that invade users’ privacy.
""Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access,"" Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine's office said in a statement. 
Yet Google ""continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data,"" the statement said, calling the practice ""a clear violation of consumers’ privacy."" 
Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the ""attorneys general are bringing a case based on inaccurate claims and outdated assertions about our settings. We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We will vigorously defend ourselves and set the record straight.""
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton alleged Google misled consumers by continuing to track their location even when users sought to prevent it. 
Google has a ""Location History"" setting and informs users if they turn it off ""the places you go are no longer stored,"" Texas said.
Google ""continues to track users’ location through other settings and methods that it fails to adequately disclose,"" Texas said.
Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in 2020, Google made nearly $150 billion from advertising. ""Location data is key to Google’s advertising business. Consequently, it has a financial incentive to dissuade users from withholding access to that data,"" Ferguson's office said in a statement Monday.
In May 2020, Arizona filed a similar lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-arizona-lawsuit/u-s-state-of-arizona-files-consumer-fraud-lawsuit-against-google-idUSKBN2333CP against Google over collection of user location data. That lawsuit is pending.

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said ""the stunning allegations in this bipartisan suit by four attorneys general show, yet again, that tech companies continue to mislead, deceive, and prioritize profits over protecting user privacy.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of the world's largest asset owners managing $10.4 trillion said on Tuesday they would step up their response to climate change and aimed to at least halve carbon emissions from their investment portfolios by 2030.
The 69 members of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, which include reinsurer Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY), insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) and pension investor CDPQ, said they would cut emissions by between 49% and 65% over the next eight years, from a 2020 baseline.
As part of its second  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Setting Protocol (TSP), the group said that between 2020 and 2025, its members would aim to reduce absolute portfolio emissions by between 22% and 32%.
Through the TSP, the group said it had agreed a framework for reducing financed emissions in the carbon-intensive infrastructure debt and equity sector, and doubled the business sectors covered to 14, including chemicals and agriculture.
As some of the biggest investors in companies across the real economy, the asset owners said they would engage with company boards to help them align their businesses with the world's transition to a low-carbon economy.
The group hopes that by sharing its targets and approach, other asset owners will join its campaign.
“This advanced guidance will help investors already committed to net-zero to take the urgent shorter-term action that climate science demands,"" said NZAOA Chair and Allianz (DE:ALVG) board member Guenther Thallinger.

""Action is needed now, and every company is challenged to follow the lead of Alliance members and adjust business models, develop plans for the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future, and then implement those plans.""
As part of the commitment, the group's members will publish interim targets on a five-year cycle, he added.

Tesla's financial policy is likely to be prudent and liquidity would remain very good, Moody's said, adding that a more competitive offering of battery electric vehicles by other automakers could start to exert some pressure on the company's margins in 2023.

In January, Tesla reported record quarterly deliveries that far exceeded Wall Street estimates, riding out global chip shortages as it ramped up China production. It was the sixth consecutive quarter that the world's most valuable automaker posted record deliveries.

Bears are on the prowl in markets while a different sort menaces Europe's eastern flank. 
It's probably futile to expect the Russian bear to retreat the way Wall Street bears did late on Monday, when sentiment turned on a dime, allowing the S&P 500 which was 4% in the red at one point, to close higher. 
Clearly dip-buyers haven't entirely fled equity markets. Or was it a function of all those short Nasdaq positions, which suddenly found themselves in the money? 
The impulse hasn't carried through, with Asia deep in the red and Wall Street futures down almost 2%. Option market readings are not reassuring either; trading in put options, used to place bearish bets, outnumbered bullish call options by 1.1-to-1 on Monday, apparently the most bearish that ratio has been since March 2020.
Away from markets though, the global economic picture isn't looking too bad. PMIs advance readings on Monday did show an Omicron-driven slowdown in December business activity but signalled a peaking in supply chain delays. South Korean GDP expanded at the fastest pace in 11 years and of the U.S. companies that have reported Q4 earnings, 77% beat forecasts.
In the middle of this market churn, the Fed starts a two-day meeting which may well be the last before a March interest rate liftoff. Many hope it will pay attention to the tightening in financial conditions such large equity selloffs inevitably cause. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) cite the robust earnings season to argue the bearishness is overdone. And after all, they add ""the worst-case scenario could see the return of the Fed put"".

It rebounded with a net profit of 774 million Swiss francs ($845 million) in 2021 after a loss of 53 million a year earlier.
Its sales at constant currency rose nearly 30% to 7.31 billion francs, the maker of Omega and Longines watches said in a statement https://www.swatchgroup.com/en/services/archive/2022/swatch-group-key-figures-2021 on Tuesday.
Swatch shares were indicated 2.9% higher in pre-market activity.
""Swatch was able to surprise the market with an EBIT above the 1 billion franc mark. The strong (free cash flow) is also a positive,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy, who rates the stock ""hold"", wrote in a client note.
""However, we believe that the market will focus on Swatch growth, which is underperforming the market. The difference in growth to Richemont during the same period is significant, although due to specific reasons (different geographical mix, less exposure to the strong performing high end, less exposure to own retail and online)."" 
Sales of Swiss watches recovered strongly last year from the slump caused by pandemic-related lockdowns, but Swatch Group has been losing market share to industry major Rolex and connected watches such as the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch.
Its shares, which lagged their peers last year, fell out of the blue-chip SMI index in September.
Richemont also posted a jump in sales this month thanks to its strong jewellery business amid a wider luxury goods revival.

MILAN (Reuters) -UniCredit is weighing around five non-binding offers for parts of its leasing operations, two people close to the matter said, as CEO Andrea Orcel focuses on businesses that don't tie up much capital. 
In a new strategy on Dec. 9, Orcel pledged to generate enough capital to return 16 billion euros ($18 billion) to investors in dividends and share buybacks through 2024.
The former UBS banker said UniCredit would bet on businesses that would help it maximise return on allocated capital (ROAC).
That is not the case for the leasing business, and Reuters first reported in October that Italy's second-biggest bank by assets was exploring a possible sale.
After inviting around 50 investors to look at the business of which 16 responded, UniCredit just before Christmas received around five non-binding offers to which it is yet to reply, one of the sources said. 
The bidders are private equity firms Bain and Christofferson Robb & Co (CRC) and two foreign leasing industry players, the two sources said.
Italy's Alba Leasing, owned by some rival banks such as Banco BPM and BPER, is also interested, one of the sources said, adding it may need to raise capital first.
UniCredit and Bain declined to comment. CRC and Alba Leasing could not be reached.
UniCredit Leasing has around 10 billion euros in credit on its books, including around 1 billion euros of non performing debt - or 500 million euros net of writedowns.
Over two thirds of the portfolio is made up of real estate leasing contracts, with the rest relating to equipment.
The industry players are mostly interested in the equipment part, one of the sources said.
None of the bids was for the whole business, the sources said, adding UniCredit may decide to divest only parts of it, depending on the size of the loss it was willing to bear.
In December, UniCredit calculated a 700 million euro hit over the plan's duration from sales of non-core assets under an accounting principle known as IFRS5.
Private equity suitors are interested in the loan portfolio, the second source said. However, its current rate of return is just over 1%, meaning UniCredit would incur a significant loss to offload it because it would have to offer a discount to guarantee fund buyers a higher yield.
UniCredit, which is working with PwC on the sale, may eventually decide against a deal, sources said in October. 

UniCredit Leasing does not have a significant presence in car leasing, an attractive niche which this month saw Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s car leasing division ALD agree to buy Dutch rival LeasePlan for 5 billion euros.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 02:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Chinese fashion retailer SHEIN revives plan for New York listing in 2022-sources,"By Kane Wu, Fanny Potkin and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese fashion retailer SHEIN is reviving plans to list in New York this year and its founder is considering a citizenship change to bypass proposed tougher rules for offshore IPOs in China, two people familiar with the matter said.
It was not immediately clear how much the company was looking to raise from its New York debut.
The initial public offering (IPO), if finalised, would be the first major equity deal by a Chinese company in the United States since regulators in the world's second-largest economy stepped in to tighten oversight of such listings in July.
SHEIN, founded by Chinese entrepreneur Chris Xu in 2008, first started preparing for a U.S. IPO about two years ago, but shelved the plan partly due to unpredictable markets amid rising U.S.-China tensions, the sources said.
Both sources declined to be named as the plans are confidential. A SHEIN spokesperson said the company had no plans to go public.
The Nanjing-based company is one of the world's largest online fashion marketplaces targeting overseas consumers. The United States is its biggest market.
The sources said SHEIN founder Xu was eyeing Singapore citizenship partly to bypass China's new and tougher rules on overseas listings. The change in citizenship, if applied for and successful, would ease the path to an offshore IPO, they said.
Neither Xu nor other SHEIN executives have applied for Singaporean citizenship, the company spokesperson said, without elaborating. Xu did not respond to Reuters queries sent via this spokesperson.
New rules issued by China's cyberspace administration and the offshore listing filing regime to be finalised by China's securities regulator are set to make a U.S. listing process for Chinese firms more complicated, if not lengthier.
The securities regulator's draft rules for offshore listings targets companies where a majority of senior management are either Chinese citizens or reside in China, or whose main business activities are conducted in China.
VALUATION JUMP
SHEIN ships to 150 countries and territories from its many global warehouses, according to its website.
It made around 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) in revenue in 2021, taking advantage of the pandemic that shifted global consumption online, said one of the sources and another person with knowledge of the matter. Its valuation was around $50 billion in early 2021, they said.
The valuation is estimated to have as much as doubled in the past year, one of the first two sources said.
The company, whose investors include Sequoia Capital China, IDG Capital and Tiger Global, was valued at $15 billion in its last funding round in August 2020, according to CB Insights data.
According to Coresight Research, SHEIN's estimated sales in 2020 jumped 250% over the preceding year to $10 billion, with over 2,000 items added on its website weekly.

The SHEIN spokesperson said as a private company it did not disclose financial figures.
SHEIN has hired Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to work on the IPO, said the source with knowledge of the company's valuation, and another person familiar with the matter.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 01:16AM ET</span>","Analysis-Volatile markets, Fed uncertainty add to U.S. dip buyers' risks","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed, Maiya Keidan and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wild swings in stocks are testing the resolve of investors employing one of Wall Street’s most popular strategies: buying the dip.
The S&P 500 reversed a deep selloff on Monday to finish up 0.3%, after the benchmark index crossed into correction territory, while the Nasdaq flirted with a bear market before also finishing higher, suggesting that dip buyers have not gone extinct despite big declines in stocks in the first weeks of 2022.
But while dip buying has rewarded investors in the last two years as stocks doubled from their March 2020 lows, bargain hunters now face uncertainties over how aggressively the Federal Reserve will need to tighten monetary policy this year, a potential war between Russia and Ukraine, and disappointing corporate earnings.
Indeed, the few sizeable rallies in equity indexes this month appear to have created good opportunities to unload stocks, as they were swiftly followed by more declines. The Nasdaq, which traded more than 20% off its high on Monday before turning up, has seen just two days when it rallied 1% or more. 
""There doesn't seem to be a lot of confidence in risk allocations given the number of uncertainties that are out there,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management.
Traders in the options markets seemed more intent on guarding against further declines than betting on gains, while retail investors, who have frequently led the charge in past episodes of dip buying, sold a net $2.1 billion in stocks between Thursday and early Monday, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
“I don't think anything the Fed is going to do is going to make the markets happy,” said Louis Gargour, managing partner and chief investment officer at London-based LNG Capital. 
Stocks are off to a rough start in 2022, with the Nasdaq down about 14% from its November closing high as prospects of faster tightening by the Fed spurred a rally in Treasury yields that dealt a sharp blow to Wall Street's growth names. 
A correction is confirmed if an index closes 10% or more below its record closing level, according to a widely used definition. A close of 20% below marks a bear market.
Despite Monday's ultimate higher finish, all the major indexes are trading below their 200-day moving averages, a key technical level watched by market participants.
In the options markets, investors have remained on the sidelines or leaned bearish, with the Cboe Volatility Index leaping to its highest level in more than a year.
Overall trading in put options, typically used to place defensive or bearish bets on stock and index prices, outnumbered trading in bullish call options by 1.1-to-1 on Monday – the most bearish that ratio has been since March 2020, according to Trade Alert data.
""I am not seeing much along the line of 'quick end to the selloff,'"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. ""It still looks pretty fearful.""
Moez Kassam, chief investment officer at the market neutral Anson Investments Master Funds, said many hedge funds had covered their bearish equities bets when stocks sold off in December, depleting some of the fuel that had powered past reversals.
Short interest as a percentage of float recently fell below 5% overall, its lowest level in four years, even as the dollar amount of short interest has increased, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
Some investors, including Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, are taking heart from signs of extreme caution, such as the heightened bearishness of individual investors and elevated demand for downside protection, two indicators which in the past have signified market bottoms. 
""The market's risk/reward has greatly improved,"" Lerner wrote, saying the market ""is likely within a few percent of finding support."" 

Some remain cautious. Phil Orlando, portfolio manager and chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), would prefer to wait until the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee closes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday before deciding his next move. 
""I'm not looking to catch a falling knife ahead of this FOMC meeting,"" Orlando said.

Walmart (NYSE:WMT) de Mexico, known locally as Walmex, runs about 860 stores in Central America, making up almost a fourth of its footprint. 
""We think there can be attractive opportunities for greater growth in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua,"" the company said in a statement. 
""These alternatives could include, but are not limited to, potential joint ventures, partnerships or strategic alliances, a sale, or other transactions.""
Walmex opened 31 new stores - 28 in Mexico and three in Central America - during the third quarter of 2021. 
Sales slid at the retailer's supermarkets in Central America during the pandemic, but in the third quarter last year each country logged an increase in same-store sales, led by Honduras. 
Walmex in Central America operates https://www.reuters.com/companies/WALMEX.MX discount stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse stores and wholesale-price membership stores. 
""The company is choosing to focus on its strongest markets and leave in other hands the operations of some countries that are undergoing complex political and sanitary situations,"" said Alejandra Marcos, senior analyst in Intercam. 
The changes will not reach the entire region, since the announcement does not include operations in Costa Rica and Guatemala, but Intercam analysts said Mexico was the company's ""crown jewel"".
Barclay's analysts Benjamin M. Theurer and Antonio Hernandez said Walmex had ""some work to do"" in the Mexican market after underperforming peers like Chedraui and La Comer.
Walmex's revenue in Central American totaled 30 billion pesos ($1.5 billion) in the third quarter of 2021, up 13.9% from the same period a year earlier, according to a company filing.

Walmex's operating income in Central America grew 22.4%, and the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased 14.6%, reaching a 9.1% margin in the same period.

Tencent said in a social media post that it had also reported more than 10 people to authorities over their actions. 
As the Chinese government has intensified a crackdown on corruption in recent years, tech companies have doubled down on their own investigations into irregularities as their valuations and profiles have soared following the country's tech boom. 
Tencent started its anti-graft campaign in 2019 and has been regularly reporting the results of its probes. 

In 2021, one case involved a former employee from its digital music department asking for and getting favours from its suppliers, Tencent said. Another involved a sports content staffer profiting from using a company he controlled to enter a deal with Tencent, the company added. 
Beijing, which has since last year reasserted control over its once-freewheeling internet sector through a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown, said last week it would investigate and punish any corrupt behaviour found behind internet platform monopolies.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Tuesday morning, alongside U.S. equity futures. U.S. shares closed a hair-raising volatile session as concerns over U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening and geopolitical tension continue to grow.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.01% by 9:24 PM ET (2:24 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 2.33%
In Australia, the ASX 200 slid 2.46%. The country released its consumer price index and the National Australia Bank Business Confidence Index earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.67%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.93% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.69%. Developer China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) urged offshore bondholders to refrain from aggressive legal action over repayments, in response to an ad-hoc group of the company’s overseas creditors threatening to take enforcement measures.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts retreated but dip buyers left U.S. shares in the green on high volumes. This was a sharp U-turn from a selloff in Monday’s session amid a 4% drop in U.S. equities.
Investors will closely monitor the Fed’s policy decision, which will be handed down on Wednesday. Global shares are down more than 6% in January to date over expectations that the central bank will hike interest rates sooner than expected, alongside uneven company earnings.
The question for investors now is whether this fall is a buying opportunity or a warning of wider stress across more asset classes.
“Volatility is back,” RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Bloomberg.
“We’re having a sea-change in terms of Fed policy. Equity investors frankly have been behind the curve in anticipating what’s coming, so there’s a lot of catch-up to do.”
The Cboe Volatility Index climbed to its highest level in over a year before receding.
The stock recovery could come sooner than expected and “it’s time to make shopping lists and look for ‘babies that got thrown out with the bathwater,’” Oppenheimer strategists led by John Stoltzfus said in a note on Monday.
However, other investors, including Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania professor and author of “Stocks for the Long Run” Jeremy Siegel, warned that a challenging quarter lies ahead.
“I’m still very positive on long-term equities but I think it’s in for a rocky time the next two or three months. We have to get used to the fact that the Fed is going to be much more hawkish,” he said.
Geopolitical tensions over Ukraine also continue to mount. The U.S. is putting as many as 8,500 troops on heightened alert for deployment to bolster NATO forces in Eastern Europe if needed.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund will launch the World Economic Outlook update, while the U.S. releases its Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence index, later in the day."

""In my view, when the division concludes that a merger is likely to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly, in most situations, we should seek a simple injunction to block the transaction,"" said Kanter, who was confirmed in November and is one of three progressives named to top U.S. antitrust posts.
Kanter took the reins of the division at a time of rising inflation, including in key industries like meat production, and growing concern that there are a range of sectors of the economy where a handful of companies have become too powerful.

Kanter argued that asset sales, or divestitures, can fail because the company that buys the assets fails to make full use of them. He also noted that it was often difficult to craft behavioral remedies, for example creating a firewall separating two sectors of a company.
""None of this is to say that divestitures should never be an option. Sometimes business units are sufficiently discrete and complete that disentangling them from a parent company in a non-dynamic market is a straightforward exercise where divestiture might have a high degree of certainty of success,"" said Kanter. ""But in my view, those circumstances are the exception not the rule.""

NEW YORK/ SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The S&P 500's early tumble on Monday put the world's most-followed stock index within reach of confirming its first correction since the 2020 collapse in global markets brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.
The S&P 500 slumped as much as 4%, slammed by ongoing worries about rising interest rates and geopolitical fears related to Ukraine. The index was more than 10% below its Jan. 3 record high close before bouncing back to end the session with a daily gain of 0.3%. 
It is now down 8.1% from its record. A correction would be confirmed if the index closes 10% or more below its record closing level, according to a widely used definition.

Wall Street has reeled in recent months from spiking inflation and growing expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy more quickly than expected. Monday's early rout stemmed from those concerns, as well as an announcement by NATO that it was putting forces on standby to prepare for a potential Russian incursion into Ukraine.
""Investors have gotten spooked because nobody really knows what (Fed Chairman) Jay Powell will do. Will he hike three times, four times, five times?"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas.
The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks (RUT) was down more than 20% below its November record closing high Monday before reversing course. 
The Russell index ended up 2.3% on the day but remains down about 17% from its November record high following several weeks of steady declines. A close of 20% or more below its record closing high would confirm the index is in a bear market.
Hitting those low levels early in the session may have triggered some buy signals, said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
""The small cap Russell 2000 hitting 20% down (from its record) might have been a bigger indicator than anything,"" he said. 
The Nasdaq last week confirmed its fourth correction since the beginning of the pandemic, and is now down about 14% since its November record closing high.
Rising interest rates tend to disproportionately harm shares of high-growth companies because investors value them based on earnings expected years into the future, and high interest rates erode the value of future earnings more than the value of earnings made in the short term.
The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 have lagged the rest of the market because they have more stocks with higher multiples, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. 
Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies, wrote in a recent note that small caps ""are pricing in a chance of a recession."" 
""High-yield spreads have not budged, nor have '22 earnings estimates, yet relative valuations are as cheap as they were in '20,"" he noted.
Following this month's decline in the S&P 500, the index is trading at about 21 times expected earnings, still far above its 10-year average of about 17, according to Refinitiv data.

Energy is the only one of 11 S&P 500 sector indexes with a gain year to date, up about 13%. Consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and technology (SPLRCT) have been the worst performers in 2022, both down about 11%.

(Reuters) -Peloton Interactive Inc's stock surged on Monday after investment firm Blackwells Capital urged the exercise equipment maker's board to fire its chief executive and put the company up for sale.
The company's shares climbed nearly 10% to close trading at $29.71 after having dropped 3.4% in premarket trading on a day the broader market fell before staging a late-day turnaround.
Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), which initially became a market darling during the pandemic as people flocked to its bikes, treadmills and popular streamed workouts, is now on worse footing than two years ago, Blackwells said.
It urged the board to remove CEO John Foley immediately, accusing him of creating an atmosphere of high fixed costs and holding on to excessive inventory while also misleading investors about the need to raise capital.
Foley must be held ""accountable for his repeated failures"" and ""should be fired as CEO, immediately,"" Blackwells founder Jason Aintabi wrote in the letter which was made public on Monday morning.
Peloton did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Blackwells is also urging the board to put the company up for sale to a buyer like Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group or  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), Reuters reported on Sunday.
Blackwells criticized Foley for hiring his wife as a key executive and committing to a 300,000-square-foot, 20-year lease for office space in New York, among other things. 
While Peloton initially became one of the market's favorite so-called stay-at-home stocks during the pandemic, its fortunes began to dwindle as gyms opened back up and rivals offered other products that appealed to customers.
The stock price has plummeted 83% in the last year and the company is now valued at roughly $8.8 billion compared with $50 billion at the peak of its popularity.
Blackwells' letter followed on the heels of a CNBC report that said Peloton was temporarily halting production of its bikes and treadmills amid lower demand.
Even though Foley, who has led the company for nearly a decade, dismissed the report as false, the news caused the stock price of Peloton to tumble 24% on Thursday, wiping off $2.5 billion from its market value.
While many investors had become frustrated with Peloton as the stock price fell, analysts also noted that the company might be difficult to target because it has two classes of stock, effectively allowing insiders to control it.

""An agitator like Blackwells doesn't have obvious leverage and there is only so much that someone can do from outside the fence line,"" analysts at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors wrote in a note on Monday titled ""Peloton needn't break a sweat.""
Blackwells posted a 99.7% return last year, fueled by investments in CyrusOne (NASDAQ:CONE) and  Monmouth Real Estate Investment  (NYSE:MNR) Corp.

(Reuters) -IBM on Monday beat Wall Street estimates for revenue in the fourth quarter, as its focus on the cloud paid off in Big Blue's first earnings after exiting the slow-growing managed infrastructure business. 
Shares of the IT giant jumped as much as 7% aftermarket before easing to trade flat, with the company reiterating its forecast for mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2022, compared with 3.9% last year. 
""This will be the first quarter where you'll see what today's  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) looks like, and that is a higher revenue growth company,"" Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters in an interview. 
The 110-year-old company has doubled down on the software and consulting businesses after shedding its former managed infrastructure unit in November following years of growth and margin pressures. 
Revenue at IBM's consulting business rose 13.1%, while cloud revenue jumped 16% to $6.2 billion in the quarter.
With cloud adoption surging worldwide, the company has shifted its focus to the so-called ""hybrid-cloud"", where enterprises use a combination of their own data centers and leased computing resources to store and process data. 
U.S. revenue rose in the mid-single digits during the quarter even as the Omicron variant raged across the country, Kavanaugh said, adding that industries hit hard early by the pandemic were bouncing back.
IBM's revenue rose 6.5% to $16.7 billion, adjusted for the separation of the managed infrastructure services business, now Kyndryl. Analysts on average had expected $15.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

""IBM hasn't had this kind of result and with the spin-off, a lot of this sentiment was that it was going to take a few quarters for this to flush out,"" Futurum Research analyst Daniel Newman said.
Excluding items, IBM earned $3.35 per share, beating estimates of $3.30.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street bounced back from a steep sell-off late in the session to close higher on Monday, with bargain hunters pushing the indexes into positive territory by closing bell.
The S&P 500 earlier came close to confirming a correction by appearing on track to close more than 10% down from its most recent all-time high reached on Jan 3 as investors focused on concerns about an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions.
The S&P 500 recovered 4.3 percentage points from its session low to it closing level, the largest such swing since March 26, 2020, when Wall Street was bouncing back from the global slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Earlier in the day, the indexes were all more than 2% lower. The S&P appeared to be on course to confirm a correction, and the Russell 2000 looked as if it would confirm it was in a bear market.
This abrupt, late-session U-turn came in the wake of S&P 500 and the Nasdaq suffering their largest weekly percentage plunge since March 2020, when shutdowns to contain the pandemic sent the economy spiraling into its steepest and most abrupt recession on record.
""Correction territory is often a psychological sweet spot for investors. They see the correction, and they see that it's a healthy part of the markets,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
""When everything started selling off, that got a lot of people's attention, so I think we had what I would call intraday capitulation, getting some of this easy money out of the market,"" Dollarhide added.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is due to convene its two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, and market participants will be parsing its concluding statement and Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent Q&A session for clues as to the central bank's timeline for hiking key interest rates to combat inflation.
""I think investors are over-assuming a very hawkish stance by the Fed,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. ""Granted, inflation is high and is likely to get higher before it starts to decline. Specifically we see the headline CPI topping at 7.3% for both January and February, but then coming down to 3.5% by year-end.""
In a sign that geopolitical tensions are heating up, NATO announced it was putting forces on standby to prepare for a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The threat of potential conflict in that region helped U.S. Treasury yields dip, pausing their recent upward climb, which has pressured stocks in recent months. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 99.13 points, or 0.29%, to 34,364.5, the S&P 500 gained 12.19 points, or 0.28%, to 4,410.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 86.21 points, or 0.63%, to 13,855.13.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 spent most of the trading day deep in red territory, but by market close all but three were green. Consumer discretionary enjoyed the largest percentage gain. 
Fourth-quarter reporting season is in full swing, with 65 of the companies in the S&P 500 having posted results. Of those, 77% have come in above expectations, according to data from Refinitiv.
On aggregate, analysts now see S&P 500 annual EPS growth of 23.7%, per Refinitiv.
A series of disappointing earnings from big banks and, notably, lockdown darling Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) have overshadowed many better-than-expected results.
Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) gained more than 6% in after-hours trading after the company beat revenue expectations on the strength of its cloud and consulting businesses.
Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) surged after Reuters reported private equity firm Sycamore Partners is preparing to make a bid for the department store chain days after a consortium backed by activist investment firm Starboard Value proposed a buyout.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 31 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded four new highs and 1,319 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 18.42 billion shares, compared with the 10.95 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 06:16PM ET</span>",U.S. to move faster to address unfair airline consumer practices,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT) announced on Monday it is issuing a new rule to make it easier for regulators to move faster to protect airline customers from unfair and deceptive practices.
The new regulation, which was reported earlier by Reuters, will simplify and speed hearing procedures the department uses when issuing protection rules to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices by airlines and ticket agents. 
The USDOT plans future rules on airline ticket refunds and transparency of airline baggage and other fees. It will also soon issue guidance on the definitions of ""unfair"" and ""deceptive"" for purposes of airline customer protection, the department said in a statement.
Under the new rules, the department will require airlines or others seeking hearings on proposed government regulations on unfair aviation practices to move faster, make clear hearings will be granted only if in the public interest, and eliminate a requirement that hearing officers issue detailed reports.
""This rule improves the Department's ability to issue timely rules that protect airline consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, a responsibility the Department takes seriously,"" said Transportation Deputy Secretary Polly Trottenberg.
Airlines for America, an airline trade group, did not immediately comment.
At a meeting of the White House competition council on Monday, President Joe Biden said the effort would result in ""more clarity in the actual price you'll pay for high-speed internet services and airline tickets.""
USDOT said last year it intended to issue a separate proposed rule to require upfront disclosure of baggage fees, change fees and cancellation fees. Under existing U.S. rules, passengers are entitled to a fee refund if bags are lost, but not when delayed.

USDOT last year proposed new rules to require passenger airlines to refund fees for bags that are significantly delayed and refunds for services like onboard Wi-Fi that do not work.
In September, the Biden administration said it would award 16 slots for flights at Newark International Airport in New Jersey to a yet-to-be-determined low-cost carrier and said it could take action to boost competition at other major airports.

175,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 05:16PM ET</span>","Shopify eases concerns over fulfillment network changes, shares rebound","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Canada's Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc said on Monday proposed changes to its fulfillment network would help merchants on its ecommerce platform compete better with big retailers and would not reduce capacity, fueling a recovery in its shares.
Wall Street had raised concerns that the changes could mean big investments into Shopify's fulfillment network and moving from a capital-light model to owning distribution centers, something investors will likely question in the current market environment.
Shopify provides infrastructure for retailers to set up their stores online and generates revenue mainly through subscriptions and merchant services. It has benefited from the widespread shift to e-commerce during the pandemic.
But a recent sell-off in technology stocks in the face of expected higher interest rates, coupled with concerns about Shopify's fulfillment network had slammed the shares.
""We will be making changes to the SFN (Shopify Fulfillment Network) to help merchants compete with big-box retailers, such as prioritizing two-day shipping at affordable prices and access to easy returns for U.S. shoppers,"" the company said on Monday.
Shopify said it had informed warehouse partners and merchants that capacity would not be reduced due to the proposed changes. SFN is essentially a network of fulfillment centers that allow merchants to ensure timely deliveries and low shipping costs.
Shares of the Canadian company rose 7% on Monday following the statement. They had fallen nearly 9% to an 18-month low, weighed down by a report last week that Shopify was terminating or reducing contracts with warehouses and fulfillment partners.
""Shopify is nowhere close to building a type of fulfillment operation at the scale of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and investors should not expect anything like that in the near term,"" said Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian. 
Shares of Shopify have had a roller coaster ride since the COVID-19 outbreak. They surged 237% between 2019 and 2021, boosted by a broader adoption of e-commerce by retailers, food brands and other mom-and-pop businesses. That helped the company to dethrone Royal Bank of Canada as the most valuable Canadian company. The shares are down 31.6% so far this year.
Shopify now ranks third as Canada's most valuable company behind RBC and TD Bank.
The volatility displayed by Shopify shares this year is rarely seen in Canada's other big market cap stocks, like the banks, that are attractive to institutional investors due to their steady growth prospects and high dividend yields.
Shopify said on Monday it had sufficient capacity to meet the fulfillment needs of its merchants using the SFN.
""Capacity will not be reduced, and we do not anticipate disruptions to our merchants' fulfillment,"" the company added.

The company said it would have more details on its fulfillment network during its fourth-quarter earnings announcement.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 05:01PM ET</span>","Wall Street shakes off Fed, Ukraine anxiety as oil dips","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A tumultuous day on Wall Street saw stocks end higher after posting heavy losses earlier in the day, as uncertainty over rising geopolitical tensions and Fed policy weighed down oil and boosted safe havens.
All three major U.S. stock indices closed the day in positive territory, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average had posted an over 1,000-point decline earlier in the day. 
The Dow ended up 0.29%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.28% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.63%. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was down 0.78%.
The late gains marked a surprising turnaround for U.S. stocks, which were battered last week, posting their heaviest losses since 2020. The decline potentially enticed bargain hunters to help push them higher Monday.
""Recent bearishness in equities is overdone, and out of line with activity momentum, easing bottlenecks, and what we expect to be a strong earnings season,"" wrote JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts in a midday note.
The market tumult came as NATO said on Monday it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets in response to Russia's military build-up at Ukraine's borders.
The U.S. State Department on Sunday ordered diplomats' family members to leave Ukraine, while President Joe Biden weighed options for boosting U.S. military assets in the region. 
Attention is also turning to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which kicks off a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Investors are watching the central bank as closely as ever, as Fed officials look to unwind unprecedented stimulus and begin a path toward future rate hikes.
""Investors are accepting the harsh reality that the end of the ultra-easy monetary policy is upon us. This week the Federal Reserve meets and while we expect no changes at this meeting, the market is pricing in a full quarter point increase in March,"" said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors.
The risk-off attitude was evident in oil markets, as prices dipped by as much as 3% after closing Friday with a fifth straight week of gains. 
Brent crude fell $1.62, or 1.8%, to $86.27 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled down $1.83, or 2.2%, to $83.31. [O/R]
Other riskier assets felt pressure as well. Bitcoin hit a six-month low Wednesday, but was up slightly late Monday to $36,921, still well below the November all-time high of $69,000.
FED TIGHTENING LOOMS
Concerns that the Fed could tighten too quickly at its meeting this week added to investor nerves.
The U.S. central bank is expected to confirm that it will soon start draining the massive pool of liquidity that has supercharged growth stocks in recent years. 

Treasury yields were down on most maturities Monday. The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was flat on the day at 1.7511%, after earlier hitting an 11-day low of 1.7070%.
Fears over the Fed and Ukraine boosted safe haven investments. The dollar hit a two-week high against a basket of currencies, last up 0.26%. Spot gold prices also jumped 0.55% to $1,843.26 an ounce..

177,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 04:41PM ET</span>","Sinovac regimen gets strong boost from Pfizer, AstraZeneca or J&J COVID shots - study","(Reuters) - A third booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine made by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), Pfizer-BioNTech or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) increases antibody levels significantly in those who have previously received two doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac shot, a study has found.
The study found that CoronaVac received the strongest boost from a viral vector or RNA shot, including against the Delta and Omicron coronavirus variants, researchers from Brazil and Oxford University said on Monday.
China-based Sinovac's vaccine uses an inactivated version of a coronavirus strain that was isolated from a patient in China. It is currently approved in more than 50 countries including Brazil, China, Argentina, South Africa, Oman, Malaysia, Indonesia and Turkey.
""This study provides important options for policymakers in the many countries where inactivated vaccines ... have been used,"" said Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and study lead.
However, another study in December found that Sinovac's two-dose shot followed by a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine showed a lower immune response against the Omicron variant compared with other strains.
Viral vector vaccines such as the ones developed by AstraZeneca-Oxford and J&J use a weakened version of another virus to deliver genetic instructions for making proteins from the virus against which protection is sought.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's mRNA vaccines deliver a genetic transcript with instructions for making viral proteins to teach the body how to defend against infections.

A third dose of CoronaVac also increased antibodies, but the results were better when a different vaccine was used, according to the latest study that included 1,240 volunteers from the Brazilian cities of Sao Paulo and Salvador. 
Antibody levels were low before the booster doses, with only 20.4% of adults aged 18-60 and 8.9% of adults aged over 60 having detectable levels of neutralising antibodies. These were seen to significantly increase across every booster vaccine regimen, according to the study, which was published in the Lancet medical journal on Friday.

According to S3, 79% of money in short positions have produced profitable returns in January.

Last year, short sellers were down $150.5 billion in realized and unrealized losses, or 13.2%, according to S3, with the biggest industry losses for shorts in energy and semiconductors.

The online retailer also said staff injuries and illnesses globally that resulted in time away from work dropped by 43% in 2020, to 2.3 per 100 employees from 4.0 the prior year. Amazon has not reported worldwide incident figures before.
The disclosures follow growing public scrutiny of the Seattle-based company's labor practices.
Reports in recent years by Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and the Washington Post found serious injury rates at many Amazon facilities to be around double industry standards. Legislation has targeted employers like Amazon around the use of productivity quotas, and a U.S. Labor Department office recently began auditing how the government has responded to rising warehouse injuries in the pandemic.
Amazon invested $300 million in safety improvements last year, it said.
In the company's new safety report, Amazon said there were 6.4 injuries at its U.S. warehouses for every 200,000 working hours in 2020. According to government figures, the industry average was 5.5, the report said.

For Amazon's U.S. transportation and logistics arm, which includes workers at Amazon's delivery depots and air hubs, the company's injury rate was 7.6. That was better than the industry average of 9.1, the report said. (Amazon has faced scrutiny for deadly incidents involving its contracted delivery firms, not part of its tally.)
Amazon's report highlighted, among other safety initiatives, technology it developed with partners so forklifts can avoid collisions by discerning their distance from people and structures.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 03:26PM ET</span>","Shipping group MSC, Lufthansa offer to buy Alitalia successor","By Francesca Landini and Giulia Segreti
ROME (Reuters) - Swiss-based shipping group MSC and German carrier Lufthansa want to buy the majority of Alitalia successor ITA Airways and have asked for an exclusivity period of 90 days to study the deal, MSC and ITA said on Monday.
The state-owned airline, which began flying in October last year, is looking for an equity partner and has started informal talks with some potential suitors, in Europe and overseas, its chairman said this month.
MSC said the interest in ITA stemmed from ""the possibility of activating positive synergies ... both in the cargo and the passenger sector"". 
If Italian government gives its green light, the board of ITA Airways will examine details of the expression of interest at a future meeting and decide to enter exclusive talks with the two partners, a source close to the matter said.
A board meeting to approve ITA business plan is scheduled for Jan. 31.
MSC said it and Lufthansa will decide their respective involvement in the deal after studying financial data of the Italian airline.
Last week, ITA Chairman Alfredo Altavilla said the carrier posted a negative operating result of 170 million euros last year. Revenue were less than expected at 86 million euros, while the carrier could count on more than 400 million euros in cash coming from Italian tax payers.
SOLID PARTNERS
In a first reaction from workers, flight attendants and pilots union FNTA said the interest of MSC and Lufthansa was positive news for the future of the small carrier.
They are ""two extremely solid partners who could guarantee future growth to ITA with an excellent positioning at international level,"" FNTA said in a statement.
Two sources told Reuters on Sunday that Lufthansa was in talks to buy 40% in ITA Airways.
In past decades troubled airline Alitalia tried but failed to a clinch successful alliance with Air France and, more recently, with Arab Emirates' Ethiad. 

Italy is an important market for Lufthansa and it is reasonable for the German company to try to secure commercial options in the country, analysts said. However a tie-up could entail risks.
""Italy is perhaps the most difficult market in Europe to make money: there are many fast train connections on the mainland and air traffic to the islands, like short-haul flights in Europe, is dominated by low-cost airlines, particularly Ryanair and Wizz,"" Ruxandra Haradau-Doser, analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux told Reuters.

Investing.com — Shares of California-based medical device company  ResMed Inc  (NYSE:RMD) bumped up 0.4% after upgrades by analysts at BofA and JP Morgan on Monday. 
BofA analyst Lyanne Harrison upgraded ResMed to neutral from underperform, raising the price target to $250 from $229.
Harrison said the firm upgraded the stock due to valuation. ""RMD stock has retreated to $235/shr, and is now 20% below its Sep21 peak,"" said the analyst. 
""The likelihood of extended chip shortage prevents us from having a more positive view. Longer term, we expect RMD's recent market share gains to unwind as Philips (PHIA) supply returns,"" she added.
  Koninklijke Philips NV  ADR (NYSE:PHG), which moved from consumer products to healthcare, has recently been hit by chip shortages and a product recall.
Meanwhile, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst David Low upgraded ResMed to overweight from neutral, also increasing the price target to $270 from $260. Low said 2022 is ""a year of opportunity"" for ResMed and expects the company to take advantage of competitor Philip's recall. 
Also acknowledging that Philips will recover, the JPM analyst said ResMed has ""both the product range and sales force to ensure it holds onto material share gains."""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Candidates vowing to shake up the culture inside Mexico's massive oil workers' union lashed out on Monday against a leadership rival seen by some of them as holdover from what they described as its troubled past, just days ahead of a key vote. 
Some 90,000 workers from national oil company Pemex are eligible to cast ballots on Jan. 31 in the first direct election in the powerful union's 86-year history, mandated by a recent labor reform that aims to let workers choose their representation and break the grip of entrenched trade unions.
Two candidates who spoke at a news conference criticized contender Ricardo Aldana, the union's current treasurer, for carrying on the legacy of former union head Carlos Romero Deschamps, who stood down in 2019 after the president said he was under investigation for using illicit funds.
""These projects are camouflaged to carry on the corruption of Carlos Romero Deschamps,"" said rival candidate Maria Cristina Alonso, referring to Aldana. ""How dare they try to represent us?""
Fellow candidate Daniel Aranda accused past union leadership of being more interested in getting rich than protecting workers, and suggested Aldana may have embezzled funds to help the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
Both Aldana and Romero Deschamps are veteran politicians with the PRI, which ruled Mexico for most of the 20th century. 
""It's all been robbery, looting... They live in sumptuous houses, homes with yachts, even with airplanes or helicopters,"" Aranda said. 
Both spoke alongside Aldana in a news conference hosted by Mexico's labor minister, who sought to highlight the 25 candidates running for the union's top post.

Five hopefuls spoke on Monday, while the other candidates will do so later this week. 
Aldana, who spoke first, said he hoped to improve workers' quality of life, increase productivity and implement accountability and transparency measures.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 03:01PM ET</span>","Omicron survives longer on plastic, skin than prior variants; nose swabbing found best for rapid tests","By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Omicron survives longer on plastic and skin
The Omicron variant can survive longer than earlier versions of the coronavirus on plastic surfaces and human skin, Japanese researchers found in laboratory tests.
Its high ""environmental stability"" - its ability to remain infectious - might have helped Omicron replace Delta as the dominant variant and spread rapidly, they said. On plastic surfaces, average survival times of the original strain and the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were 56 hours, 191.3 hours, 156.6 hours, 59.3 hours, and 114.0 hours, respectively. That compared to 193.5 hours for Omicron, the researchers reported on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. On skin samples from cadavers, average virus survival times were 8.6 hours for the original version, 19.6 hours for Alpha, 19.1 hours for Beta, 11.0 hours Gamma, 16.8 hours for Delta and 21.1 hours for Omicron. 
On skin, all of the variants were completely inactivated by 15 seconds of exposure to alcohol-based hand sanitizers. ""Therefore,"" the researchers conclude, ""it is highly recommended that current infection control (hand hygiene) practices use disinfectants... as proposed by the World Health Organization.""
Nose swabbing best for rapid antigen tests
Users of rapid antigen tests to detect COVID-19 should swab their nostrils as directed by the manufacturer and not swab the throat or cheek instead, new research shows.
Earlier this month, with Omicron accounting for nearly all coronavirus infections in San Francisco, researchers there performed both PCR and  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT)' BinaxNOW rapid antigen test on 731 people requesting COVID-19 tests. Nasal swabbing ""detected over 95% of persons with the highest levels of virus who are most likely contagious,"" said Dr. Diane Havlir of the University of California, San Francisco. In 115 volunteers with positive PCR tests, her team compared BinaxNOW results using swab samples from the nose and the throat obtained by trained professionals. Throat swabs detected nearly 40% fewer cases than nose swabs, they reported on medRxiv ahead of peer review. A separate study from Spain, also posted on medRxiv, found that swabbing the inside of the cheek also is far less reliable than nostril swabbing for detecting infectious virus. Recent studies had suggested that Omicron is detectable earlier in the throat than in the nose, leading some experts to advise users to swab the throat, although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintained the tests should be used as directed.
""These data support using BinaxNOW from nasal swabs as directed on the package,"" Havlir said. ""Repeat rapid testing is recommended for those with negative BinaxNOW rapid tests and symptoms or an exposure"" to an infected person.
Long-term care facilities hit less hard by Omicron
Even the highly vulnerable residents of long-term care facilities are generally experiencing less severe disease from Omicron than from earlier versions of the coronavirus, according to new data.
Researchers in England compared hospitalization rates in residents of 333 facilities before and after the Omicron variant became dominant. Among 398 residents infected prior to the emergence of Omicron, 10.8% required hospitalization, compared with 4% of 1,241 infected with Omicron. The average age of infected residents was 85 years. After accounting for other risk factors, the odds of hospitalization were 50% lower for infected patients in the Omicron period, the researchers reported on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. While most facility residents had been vaccinated and about 10% had been previously infected, the reduction in relative risk of hospitalization between the pre-Omicron and Omicron periods was greatest among Omicron-infected patients who had received vaccine booster doses, at 77%. The researchers have also seen fewer deaths from COVID-19 in the Omicron period, although they said it was too soon to draw firm conclusions about the variant's effect of mortality.

""Overall,"" they conclude, ""the markedly decreased severity combined with high vaccination uptake and prior natural infection can be expected to significantly limit the impact of the current wave of Omicron infections on hospitalizations and deaths in residents of long-term care facilities.""

190,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 03:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive-U.S. voices concerns to Mexico ahead of decision on America Movil pay TV license,"By Cassandra Garrison
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States has raised concerns to Mexico about the implications for competition if that country's telecom regulator allows behemoth  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) to enter the pay TV market, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
On Jan. 12, U.S. officials including Deputy U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Jayme White told Mexico's Economy Ministry and the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) that they were worried about America Movil's Claro TV entering the sector, a source with knowledge of the conversation said. 
Mexico's IFT is expected to decide whether to grant America Movil the concession for pay TV on Wednesday, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.
Controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim, America Movil dominates the telecommunications market in Mexico, and its emergence on the pay TV scene could put rivals, including U.S. companies operating in Mexico, under significant pressure. 
America Movil and AT&T in Mexico declined to comment. The IFT and Mexico's Economy Ministry also did not comment. 
A U.S. government readout of a call said White discussed competition in Mexico's telecommunications sector on Jan. 12. 
IFT officials said late last year they were looking at whether to authorize America Movil to enter Mexico's pay TV market, though no decision had been made.
If approved, America Movil's entry would have major implications for competitors, including U.S. company AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), which operates in Mexico, and dominant broadcaster Grupo Televisa. 
America Movil already has a 70% market share for mobile internet services in Mexico and more than 62% of mobile phone services, according to IFT data.
Its entrance into pay TV could discourage rivals from investing, said Ernesto Piedras, head of Latin American market consultancy The CIU, especially if the company offers bundle options for TV, internet, mobile and other services. 
The competition concerns were discussed during a bilateral meeting to address issues relating to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade pact, the source with knowledge of the conversation said. 
""The concern is understandable about the dominance that America Movil has in various markets and of course it is an issue to address due to the impact on competition that it could have on other companies,"" the source said.
""In the case of the USTR ... the concerns could come from U.S. companies in Mexico, like AT&T."" 
Asked whether there were concerns over America Movil, USTR spokesman Adam Hodge said: ""USTR officials have raised concerns about fair competition in Mexico’s telecommunications sector and are monitoring Mexico’s implementation of their USMCA commitments."" 
America Movil had been barred from providing the service in Mexico since the privatization of state telecom firm Telmex in the early 1990s, which later evolved into America Movil.

Deemed a ""preponderant"" or dominant ""agent"" by the IFT due to its large market share, America Movil has so far had the coveted license withheld.
The company is already the largest pay TV provider in Latin America, operating in countries including Brazil and Colombia, and has been pushing to enter the sector in Mexico.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 02:51PM ET</span>","Tesla countersues JPMorgan, claims bank sought 'windfall' after Musk tweet","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Monday fought back against JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) over a disputed bond contract, countersuing the bank for seeking a ""windfall"" following Elon Musk's notorious 2018 tweet that he might take his electric car company private.
In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Tesla accused JPMorgan of ""bad faith and avarice"" for demanding $162.2 million after the bank had unilaterally changed the terms of warrants it received when Tesla sold convertible bonds in 2014.
""JPMorgan pressed its exorbitant demand as an act of retaliation against Tesla both for it having passed over JPMorgan in major business deals and out of senior JPMorgan executives' animus toward Mr. Musk,"" Tesla said.
By changing the terms of the warrants, JPMorgan ""dealt itself a pure windfall"" after receiving a ""multibillion-dollar payout"" from Tesla's soaring share price, Tesla added.
Musk is Tesla's chief executive, and according to Forbes, is the world's richest person.
JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said in an email: ""There is no merit to their claim. This comes down to fulfilling contractual obligations.""
The countersuit escalates the battle between the largest U.S. bank and world's most valuable car company, which have done little business with each other since the disputed contract.
Warrants give holders the right to buy company stock at a set ""strike"" price and date.
In its Nov. 15 lawsuit, JPMorgan said the Tesla warrants let it lower the strike price to counteract any economic impact from ""significant corporate transactions"" involving that company.
JPMorgan said Musk's Aug. 7, 2018 tweet that he might take Tesla private and had ""funding secured,"" followed by his reversing course 17 days later, was such a transaction because it made Tesla's share price more volatile.
The bank accused Tesla of defaulting because it failed to hand over shares or cash when the warrants expired in June and July 2021, by which time Tesla's share price had risen about 10-fold.

Musk's tweets resulted in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit. It ended with Musk giving up Tesla's chairmanship, and he and Tesla each being fined $20 million.
Tesla's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.

MEGAN HORNEMAN, DIRECTOR OF PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, VERDENCE CAPITAL ADVISORS, HUNT VALLEY, MD
Investors are accepting the harsh reality that the end of the ultra easy monetary policy is upon us. This week the Federal Reserve meets and while we expect no changes at this meeting, the market is pricing in a full quarter point increase in March.
Tech (is) taking the brunt of weakness: Excess liquidity and ultra easy monetary policy have fueled speculation, euphoria and excessive pricing in some investments. What we have seen is these are the areas of the market getting hampered the most in the recent volatility. Technology, which saw valuations reach dotcom like levels, is down 14% from its high with more than 70% of the stocks in the NASDAQ Index 20% or more below their 52-week high.
KEVIN MAHN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HENNION & WALSH ASSET MANAGEMENT, PARSIPPANY, NEW JERSEY
“Today’s slide is part of the continuation of the market reacting to the more hawkish pivot that the Fed took at the end of 2021. That hawkish pivot kind of met the excessive stock market valuations that we saw due in large part to that record three-year run of the S&P 500, which was the best three-year run for that stock index since 1999. So I think a large portion of this pullback is due to people taking profits, people having concern that the Fed may go too far and perhaps derail this economic recovery.""
MARC CHANDLER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, BANNOCKBURN GLOBAL FOREX
“Given people have lost money, whether it's in crypto or the stock market, people want to find a culprit and I think that people are torn between two possible candidates: the Federal Reserve and Russia. 
“I’m skeptical that all of this is Russia driven. But it doesn’t mean when the first shots are fired, there won’t be a dramatic market reaction.  
“Gold has rallied but it’s coming off its highs after peaking last Thursday. Oil prices also are reversing. Oil is having what they call an outside down day. It traded on both sides of Friday’s range, and now is below Friday’s low.”
BURNS MCKINNEY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NFJ INVESTMENT GROUP, DALLAS
“It seems that we get this every time we go through a Fed tightening cycle, but this just seems more of the same as the stock market is starting to price in the Fed basically concluding its taper and beginning interest rate hikes.”
“You have seen more and more with inflation continuing to prove to be more resilient than had previously been anticipated. Last year, the key word was transitory, transitory, transitory ... Everything ends, but I think people weren’t really pricing in inflation being as sticky as it has.”
“Poll numbers have shown that Americans are more concerned about inflation than they are about jobs. You don’t see that very often. As such, the talk has gone from the market pricing in the Fed starting to maybe hike one or two times this year, to hiking three or four times this year, and now it’s looking like it is even pricing in an outside chance of five hikes this year, and there has been some discussion about whether you can have a double boost in March. Each of those steps along the way, the market has kind of pulled back a little bit to price that in.”
DAVID MADDEN, MARKET ANALYST, EQUITI CAPITAL, LONDON
""Traders continue to be in selling mode as fears mount surrounding the Russia-Ukraine situation. Also playing into the mix are the concerns the Federal Reserve will issue a hawkish update on Wednesday. The growing Russian military presence on the Ukrainian border is adding to the speculation there will be an invasion, and those fears have been fueled by the news that UK and US embassy staff in Ukraine have been instructed to leave the country. Dealers are worried about the prospect of a war in Eastern Europe as the human and economic cost would be huge.""
""Its déjà vu in the US as worries about several interest rate hikes from the Fed this year is hammering stocks. The NASDAQ 100 is once again the underperformer of the bunch as its large exposure to the technology sector is acting like a millstone around its neck. The US central bank is due to make their latest interest rate decision on Wednesday, and even though rates are likely to be lifted, the language used will be in focus. Dealers will be trying to decipher the commentary to try and figure out how rate hikes can we expect in 2022.""
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK

""In the past half hour, panic selling is moving into the marketplace based on a bad combination of factors. The two factors that are really weighing on investor sentiment are the geopolitical situation as winds of war surface and fears that the Fed up may be overly aggressive this week.""
""Today's sharp drop is due to the geopolitical reasons because if you look at two markets that are going opposite of the other markets, you have the U.S. dollar which is moving higher and you have yields that are moving lower, so that means people are moving into safety trade.""

194,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 02:27PM ET</span>",Strategists Who Saw This Market Rout Coming See More Selling,"(Bloomberg) -- The strategists who saw this miserable stock rout coming say there’s still more pain ahead.
With the S&P 500 sliding more than 10% from recent records, bears from the likes of Mizuho International Plc and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). warn of fresh selling to come as growth momentum eases just as the Federal Reserve amps up borrowing costs.
“There’s probably more downside over the next few months as the market adjusts to the reality of the Fed removing accommodation, earnings slowdown and much less federal stimulus,” said Ed Clissold, the chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research, who late last year predicted a double-digit drop in stocks and today is warning of a correction on the order of 20% from the early January peak. 
The S&P 500 could slide another 12% as a “tightening tantrum” gathers pace, according to Mizuho strategists who came into 2022 warning of a 10% to 15% plunge in the second quarter, if not sooner.  
A slew of factors -- stretched valuations, tech-heavy indexes and rising yields -- is playing out in a rout that shows few signs of abating.
Investors are coming to terms with a more hawkish Fed that won’t step in to smooth over every market hiccup. They expect policy makers to plow on with higher rates, with a quarter-point hike in March and close to a full percentage point rise for the whole of 2022.
For many, the direction of travel is troublesome for rate-sensitive investing styles.
“We can see this downward pressure on the equity markets being relatively sticky unless there is a catalyst for a much less hawkish Fed and general global central bank reaction,” said Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho. “The market stress scenario is what we think is happening now.”
The first half of the year could see the S&P 500 plumb a bottom as low as 3,800, down 12% from current levels. The Nasdaq 100 may trough around the 12,000 level, a fall of about 15%, Chatwell said.
Still, bearish stock predictions on Wall Street have famously misfired in the bull era, with calls on market timing lashing the great and the good in the analyst community.
A toxic mix of decelerating economic growth and a tightening of monetary policy is vindicating the pessimists. The deteriorating backdrop is starting to show on quarterly earnings reports, which have so far served as reassuring beacon against any doomsday predictions.
After unprecedented successive jumps in earnings growth, the guidance from S&P 500 companies so far for the months ahead is “disappointing” and the information offered by managers in earnings calls is “concerning,” according to a note by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists on Monday. 
“The froth is coming out of an equity market that simply got too extended on valuation,” Mike Wilson, a long-term bear at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), wrote Monday.

198,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 01:20PM ET</span>",Options market dip-buyers go missing as stock sell-off worsens,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders in the options market showed little appetite to bet on an end to the continuing stock market sell-off on Monday, as Wall Street's most followed gauge of equity market fear soared to its highest level in more than a year. 
The Cboe Volatility - the Wall Street fear gauge - was recently up 9.14 points to 37.99, its highest since November 2020 as worries over a more hawkish Federal Reserve and a Russian attack on Ukraine put the S&P 500 on course to close down more than 10% from its recent high. 
Even as stocks tumbled, however, there were few signs in the options market that traders were expecting the sell-off to abate soon.
""I am not seeing much along the line of 'quick end to the sell-off',"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.
""It still looks pretty fearful,"" Murphy said.
On Monday, overall trading in put options, typically used to place defensive or bearish bets on stock and index prices, outnumbered trading in bullish call options by 1.1-to-1. That's the most bearish that ratio has been since March 2020, according to Trade Alert data.
""This is definitely more severe than anything we have seen in pretty close to two years,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
""Buying the dip"" has been a particularly well-rewarded strategy in recent years, where traders in stocks and options have profited handsomely from betting on a rapid rebound anytime stocks stumbled. 
While there were some stray bets on upside Monday, more broadly, traders appeared to be staying away from dip-buying, Susquehanna's Murphy said.
Schwab's Frederick said last week's price action when stocks rose early on some days only to give up those gains and more later in the session might be keeping investors from placing upside bets.
""If I were a bargain hunter, I might be a little gun shy based on that,"" Frederick said.
The VIX futures curve, a snapshot of prices of futures contracts on the volatility index across different expirations, shows traders paying more for near-term insurance than for contracts that expire many months out.
For instance, for instance, VIX futures expiring in February are trading at a 4-point premium to the ones expiring in September, the most since November 2020. 

While this and other signs of extreme fear can serve as contrarian indicators, since they often mark bottoms for a stock market sell-off, there were few signs on Monday that traders were optimistic.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms Inc said on Monday that its research team has built a new artificial intelligence supercomputer that it thinks will be the fastest in the world when completed in mid-2022.
Meta said in a blog post that its new AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) would help the company build better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples, work across hundreds of languages, and analyze text, images and video together to determine if content was harmful.
""This research will not only help keep people safe on our services today, but also in the future, as we build for the metaverse,"" the company said in a blog post.
The social media company changed its name in October to Meta to reflect its focus on the metaverse, which it thinks will be the successor to the mobile internet.
The metaverse, a broad term which has generated a lot of Silicon Valley buzz in recent months, refers to the idea of shared virtual environments which people can access through different devices and where they can work, play and socialize.

""The experiences we're building for the metaverse require enormous compute power (quintillions of operations/second!) and RSC will enable new AI models that can learn from trillions of examples, understand hundreds of languages, and more,"" Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post on Monday.
The company said it believed the supercomputer was currently among the fastest AI supercomputers running.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian Instagram star Chiara Ferragni has mandated BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) to find a new investor to help grow her fashion brand internationally, one of her financial backers said on Monday.
Lorenzo Castelli of venture capital Alchimia Investments, which has a 40% stake in Ferragni's company Fenice, said private equity firms, family offices and industrial players were being sounded out for a possible investment.
""We have started the process in the past days and expect to close a deal before the summer"", Castelli, who co-founded Alchimia, said in a phone interview, without disclosing details.
""A new investor can help implement the new business plan and move the company to the next stage.""
Ferragni, 34, is Italy's top fashion influencer with almost 26 million followers on Instagram.
Ferragni became popular with the launch of her fashion blog theblondesalad.com in 2009. She later launched her namesake brand, which includes clothing, shoes and makeup.

She told Corriere della Sera daily and WWD on Monday that Fenice, which owns all the licenses and operations of her brand, would double its core profit to 2.4 million euros this year.
Ferragni has a 32.5% stake in Fenice, with a third Italian investor owning the rest.

(Reuters) - Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) shares soared 36% on Monday after a Reuters report that private equity firm Sycamore Partners had approached the department store chain with a potential takeover offer of $9 billion.
A source said on Sunday Sycamore was willing to pay at least $65 per share, implying a 39% premium to the last closing price. Starboard Value-backed Acacia Research last week offered to pay $64 a share.
Kohl's confirmed on Monday it had received letters expressing takeover interest, adding the board would take action that is in ""the best interests of the company and its shareholders."" It did not name the suitors.
Activist investors such as Macellum Advisors and Engine Capital, unhappy with Kohl's performance, have also urged it to explore options, including a sale.
Like rivals Macy's (NYSE:M) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Kohl's has lost market share to off-price and online chains, but its recent tie-ups with LVMH's Sephora and PVH (NYSE:PVH)'s Calvin Klein have earned plaudits from analysts.
Engine, which owns around 1% of Kohl's, on Monday urged the retailer to ""aggressively pursue"" a buyout offer with a 37% premium, referring to Acacia's offer.
A few analysts said Kohl's, which has a market capitalization of $6.52 billion, could fetch a higher valuation.
""KSS is a strong FCF (free cash flow) generator, and it doesn't seem to be getting credit by the market, making it reasonable to consider offers,"" Citi's Paul Lejuez wrote in a note.
It could warrant a per-share value of $70 to $80,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s Michael Binetti wrote in a note.

Shares were on course for their best day ever, with the news also pushing rivals Macy's and Nordstrom higher.
However, UBS analysts are unconvinced a deal would happen as they doubt Kohl's real estate has enough value to serve as adequate collateral. They added operational changes suggested by the activists would not stop market-share losses and might not convince creditors to lend enough capital.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator is considering extending cyber risk management rules to third-party service providers, and beefing up public company disclosures when they experience a breach, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Monday.
Gary Gensler, in an address to securities industry professionals, mapped out a sweeping overhaul of SEC cyber rules, including changes to how stock exchanges and clearinghouses mitigate and report on cyber risk under the Regulation ""Systems Compliance and Integrity"" (SCI) aimed at reducing systems issues and improving resilience.
Gensler added that new cybersecurity rules could extend to registered firms' third-party service providers, including fund administrators, index providers, custodians and others not currently registered with SEC.
These new rules could include a variety of measures, such as requiring certain registrants to identify service providers that could pose such risks; holding registrants accountable for service providers’ cybersecurity measures and protecting against inappropriate access and investor information.
""This could help ensure important investor protections are not lost and key services are not disrupted as financial sector registrants increasingly rely on outsourced services"" Gensler said.

The agency could also make changes to rules around how companies disclose cybersecurity practices and cyber risk, including an update to how they must notify investors when cyber events occur.
Analysts said Gensler's outline comes at a time of growing concern about how cyber security issues could affect markets and investors. President Joe Biden's administration has also ratcheted up its focus on the issue after a recent series of high-profile cyber attacks on U.S.-based companies.

Widespread selloff in the broader market was also adding to the pressure on the stock.  
Indiana, Texas, Washington state and the District of Columbia have alleged in separate lawsuits that Google deceived users from at least 2014 to 2019 by leading them to believe that turning off location history settings would make the service stop tracking their locations. A user’s location could still be tracked by Google unless they also turned off settings in the web and app activity section, the attorney generals argued.
DC Attorney General Karl A. Racine began investigating Google's practices after a 2018 Associated Press report said that Google ""records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.""
""We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We will vigorously defend ourselves and set the record straight,"" Google told tech news platform CNET.

What can reverse this trend? If history’s any guide, look for a weaker dollar.
The tech giant hit a $3 trillion market capitalization on Jan. 3. Since then, the stock has lost 13%, while the S&P 500 has lost 11% with mega-cap tech shares taking a beating. The correlation isn’t new. Each time Apple’s market value has hit a trillion-dollar milestone, the broad market gauge has entered a technical correction. And a dollar slump has been the key to turning it around.
When Apple first reached a market cap of $1 trillion dollars in August 2018, it sparked a 20% technical correction in the S&P 500. It happened again two years later, as it breached the $2 trillion milestone and then helped fuel the tech wreck of 2020. Obviously, other factors have played a role, like Federal Reserve decisions and macro economic developments. But there’s no mistaking Apple’s role as a stock-market bellwether. 
The logic isn’t complicated. In times of crisis or global uncertainty, major U.S. assets tend to be considered havens for international buyers. To stock-market investors, that means big tech. But the demand for safety can make the assets overvalued, which is why dollar weakness serves as a key gauge for foreign investors. Tech has driven growth during much of the post-pandemic era, thanks to flows from abroad. And in turn, it’s created an inverse correlation between the dollar and U.S. equities. 
The correlation between the Bloomberg Dollar Index and Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL), as a proxy for big tech shares, is a mere 0.2. That may not be statistically significant, but note that during the bottoms of the last two corrections, the inverse correlation between the two assets was 0.18. The correlation isn’t stronger is because it has typically been preceded by dollar strength -- this time, attributed to hawkish Fed policy. Therefore, the more recent moves don’t hold as much weight.
The point being, keep an eye on the dollar. As it weakens and gives foreign investors more incentive, the S&P 500 is likely to reverse the selling that has thus far marked 2022. And history says big tech, including Apple, will play a significant role in that.

Investing.com — Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares fell another 8% on Monday after Jefferies downgraded it to hold from buy.
Analyst Andrew Uerkwitz also trimmed the firm's price target on Netflix shares to $415 per share from the prior $737.
After weaker guidance on subscriber growth, the streaming company's stock took a 21.7% dive last Friday.
The Jefferies analyst told clients in a research note that their previous buy thesis was based on steady subscription growth and a low churn and international content advantage, which they felt would lead to operating leverage as content spend steadies around $21 billion.
""We are confident in being in the middle innings of streaming penetration, but now see it taking much longer adding uncertainty. On the adjacency front, we believe Netflix isn't moving fast enough,"" Uerkwitz said.
He added that the ""best content slate we've seen is doing little to drive sub growth,"" and the United States and Canada ""may go ex-growth this year.""
Netflix's first quarter guidance, content consolidation and slowing subscriber growth at some competitors ""may mean we could be entering a period of slowing content spend at Netflix and the broader industry.""
While the analyst is cautious on the near term risks for Netflix, he explained that ""with low churn, unique scale advantages, and strong library of content, Netflix is in a position to significantly increase FCF (free cash flow) with minimal sub adds via pricing, smaller/stable content budgets, and potentially leveraging catalog."""

Analyst John Hodulik was earlier neutral on the stock and had a target of $42. The stock touched a high of $39.10 in morning trading.
UBS said among traditional media companies, Fox is best placed to benefit from an acceleration in sports betting. According to reports, he also referred to Fox’s strong position among pay TV providers with its focus on sports and news.
Hodulik sees potential increases to Fox’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization estimates from a rising renewal cycle, strong spending on political advertisements and the Super Bowl as well as a reset in NFL costs. The analyst also sees the company as well positioned to drive stable-to-growing profits over the long term as peers face more challenges.
For the third quarter ended September, Fox reported a 12% jump in total quarterly revenue, to $3.05 billion. Quarterly net income of $708 million compared to the $1.12 billion reported in the prior year quarter. Profit was lower due to the absence of a $462 million gain in the prior year quarter which was cash received from Disney for Fox’s prepayment of its share of the tax liabilities resulting from Disney’s divestiture of certain Twenty-First Century Fox assets.

With an investment of up to $150 million, the team will target growth-stage private companies that build solutions related to climate adaptation and resource efficiency for various industries. 
The bank said it has hired Tanya Barnes, who previously headed Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc's impact investing platform, to jointly manage the new team with Osei Van Horne.
Horne has been leading J.P. Morgan Asset Management's climate-focused growth equity investment practice since May last year.
Major U.S. financial and other institutions have been making renewed efforts towards their environmental, social and governance (ESG) related activities as pressure from global regulatory bodies mount with rising climate change and corporate governance concerns. 
Blackstone, the world's biggest alternative asset manager, said last week that it launched a platform https://www.reuters.com/article/blackstone-esg-idUSL4N2U1307 meant for investments and lending to renewable energy companies.

Last year, JPMorgan set out mid-term, carbon reduction goals https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/jpmorgan-debuts-carbon-reduction-goals-clients-2021-05-13 for clients in industries such as electric power, auto, oil and gas. 
It had also said it aimed to lend, invest and provide other financial services for up to $2.5 trillion of banking business to be done for companies and projects tackling climate change and social inequality over the next decade.

LONDON (Reuters) - Large banks in the European Union will have to show how they help or hinder the bloc from meeting climate goals by publishing ""pioneering"" indicators from 2024, the EU's banking watchdog said on Monday.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) set out environmental, social and governance (ESG) templates for the top 150 banks such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), SocGen and UniCredit to complete each year.
This will allow investors to compare each bank's exposure to polluting and environmentally-friendly companies, and monitor how fast lenders shift to more sustainable business models.
""We are pioneers here with templates and key performance indicators to ensure that when banks disclose something, they do it in a consistent way,"" said Pilar Gutierrez, head of a disclosures unit at the EBA. 
Final approval will be needed from the EU's executive, the European Commission. 
The EBA said the templates will cover core banking books which include loans. It scrapped an initial plan to include trading book assets like stocks and bonds after industry concerns over their short-term nature.
From 2023, banks will have to disclose their exposure to carbon intensive activities and assets that may experience risks like floods and fires as a result of climate change.
They will also have to provide details on their exposure to fossil fuel clients, on the greenhouse gas emissions they finance, and on alignment with 2050 net zero goals.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykqwbxpg/EBA%20Graphic%20on%20ESG%20Templates.PNG 
TWO RATIOS
The requirements break new ground globally by forcing banks to publish two new ratios from 2024.
A green asset ratio (GAR) shows a bank's 'green' assets as a proportion of total assets, with green being defined by inclusion in the EU's 'taxonomy' or checklist.
A banking book taxonomy alignment ratio (BTAR) measures how a bank's activities contribute to EU climate goals, showing the extent to which they are financing environmentally sustainable activities.
The Association for Financial Markets in Europe, an industry body, welcomed the extra time https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-eu-banks-idUSKCN2AT1XU for introducing GAR, which the EBA had originally indicated could be introduced this year.
""We would continue to note our wider concerns with the disclosure framework though, in that disclosures based on estimates or proxies may have little comparability and usability,"" AFME said in a statement.

Banks will have publish targets for GAR, BTAR and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for 2030.
The two ratios will create peer pressure to adopt more sustainable business strategies and help stamp out potential 'greenwashing', or the exaggerating of environmentally-friendly activities.

(Reuters) - Meme stocks  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) continued to fall out of favor for investors as fears of a faster rise in interest rates puncture the prospects of speculative trading.
After surging 600% last year amid a retail trading frenzy, GameStop fell 11% on Monday, extending a 28% slide from the start of 2022. Similarly, AMC has lost a third of its value so far this year following a more than 1,100% jump in 2021.
The value of the heavily shorted stocks zoomed when an army of small-time investors coordinated on online message boards such as Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, boosting their stock price and hurting bearish hedge funds.
""As rates rise, the present value of future cash flows diminishes and it takes some of the speculation out of the market,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital in New York.
U.S. stocks are coming off their worst week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 as a rise in the cost of borrowing would mark the end of the easy money policy that had fueled a stock market rally.
""There was a period there where there was all this free stimulus money and low rates and margin availability..that's coming to an end,"" Hayes said.
Other stocks that have drawn interest from retail investors also fell. Koss Corp, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB),  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group Inc, Workhorse Group Inc,  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY) dropped between 14% and 36% so far this month.
The $1.6 million Roundhill MEME ETF, which provides exposure to stocks with high short interest and elevated social media activity, has slumped in six of the seven weeks since its launch.
""For longer than we anticipated, meme stocks stayed up to a level which was ridiculous,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in New Jersey. 
Last week, Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, that tracks retail investor flows, said overall social media chatter on meme stocks has dropped substantially from early 2021, with some bit of speculative retail investor intrest around GameStop and AMC.

The two stocks were among the top 10 most-traded shares among Fidelity customers on Friday with buy far outnumbering sell orders. 
Short interest as a percentage of free float for both the stocks have climbed back to about 20% each, latest data from analytics company Ortex showed. Towards the end of October last year, about 16% of AMC shares and 11% of GameStop's free float were in short position.

Taking aim at aviation, a sector deemed responsible for up to 3% of global emissions, the European Union presented plans last July that foresee stricter rules on CO2 emissions and the use of synthetic fuel blends, as well as the implementation of a kerosene tax.
The alliance, whose nearly 20 members include all Lufthansa subsidiaries, Air France-KLM and major airports such as Frankfurt and Amsterdam's Schipol, argues long-haul flights via non-European hubs would not be subjected to the same associated costs, leading to a potential shift in business to such carriers. 

The alliance rejects a kerosene tax outright and proposes that the environmental protection surcharge be based on the entire flight route, not just feeder flights bringing passengers from the EU to international hubs such as Istanbul or Dubai.
In principle, the alliance is however in favour of the EU's ""Fit for 55"" climate package, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.

(Reuters) -Halliburton Co's fourth-quarter adjusted profit doubled from a year earlier, it said on Monday, beating analysts' forecasts and prompting the oilfield services company to lift its dividend following a rebound in crude and natural gas prices. 
U.S. oil prices rose more than 50% last year and have made a strong start to 2022, hovering around $85 a barrel, thanks to the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and supply cuts by producer group OPEC. 
That has encouraged producers to ramp up drilling activity, with the U.S. rig count rising 68% year-over-year to 586 at the end of the fourth quarter, according to Baker Hughes data. 
Rivals Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes topped market expectations for fourth quarter earnings last week, with Schlumberger's top executive likening current market conditions to those experienced during the last industry supercycle.
""This is momentum that I have not seen in a long time,"" Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Chief Executive Jeff Miller told investors on a call. 
The Houston, Texas-based firm said it would boost its dividend to 12 cents, payable on March 23, up from a 4.5 cents dividend previously. 
Miller said he anticipates spending in North America to grow by more than 25% in 2022 and that pricing for hydraulic fracturing will move higher, with incrementals up 30%. He said the company has been able to pass along higher prices for trucking, sand and other inputs to customers. 
Halliburton estimates the North American completions market is nearing 90% utilization, and said its fleets are currently sold out. Fully electric hydraulic fracturing locations are expected to take up a larger share of the market, Miller told investors. 
Internationally, he anticipates mid-teens spending growth. 
Wall Street analysts said the results were positive, with the exception of margins in its Completion and Production unit, which missed estimates. On Monday, Miller said margins in that unit would likely be sequentially flat for the current quarter, while margins in its Drilling and Evaluation unit would be flat to down 50 basis points. 
The company's shares were down more than 4% in early trading to $26.42, following declines in U.S. crude futures which were off more than 3% to $82.49. 

Halliburton's fourth quarter adjusted net income totalled $320 million, or 36 cents per share, topping Wall Street estimates of 34 cents a share, according to Refinitiv IBES. Adjusted net income was $160 million, or 18 cents per share, a year ago. 
Revenue of $4.3 billion also beat analysts' expectations of $4.1 billion.

Investing.com – Utz Brands stock (NYSE:UTZ) was up nearly 3% Monday after it said its subsidiaries are acquiring assets belonging to two distributors of its salty snacks.
The distributors are Clem Snacks and J&D Snacks. The two have been distributing Utz snacks for last 25 years.
Clem is a family-owned and operated direct store delivery distributor based in Brooklyn with approximately one hundred DSD routes in New York City and Long Island. J&D has been serving the Bronx, New York, since 1996 with around twenty five DSD routes, Utz said in a release.
Utz believes the deals will expand its geographical reach and accelerate share gains in the salty snack category by helping it service more retailers with increasing frequency.
The company expects to use a mix of its own cash and its revolving credit facility with its bankers to fund the purchase. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. Utz didn’t disclose the financial terms of the deals.
For its third quarter ended Oct. 3, the maker of Kettle crab chips reported a 26% jump in net sales, to $313 million. That also helped the company swing to a net profit of $31 million from a loss of $25 million in the same period a year ago.

Investing.com — Shares of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) are down more than 8% Monday after Wedbush downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform.
Analyst Ygal Arounian also lowered the price target on the social media company's shares to $36 from $56.
Arounian cited increased competition from TikTok and Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) as two reasons for the re-rating. 
“In our view we've seen little evidence of progress against IDFA since Snap reported 3Q earnings, with our checks indicating continued headwinds across digital advertising,"" the analyst said.
""While that is the biggest near and potentially mid-term impact to Snap's ability to get back to 50% plus revenue growth, competitive factors are increasing as well, particularly from TikTok, which leaves us more cautious on a risk/reward basis, particularly in an environment where high growth risk multiples are under duress.""
Arounian explained that Snap still has a strong foothold amongst the younger demographic and is well-positioned in augmented reality, which Wedbush feels has ""great value"" for advertisers. In addition, the analyst feels the company has an opportunity to make more money from the Discover, Maps and Spotlight features. 
Last week, Snap's price target was lowered to $60 from $65 by Morgan Stanley."

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) Inc's bid to revive its challenge to the constitutionality of the Federal Trade Commission's structure aimed at countering an antitrust action by the agency against the Taser manufacturer.
The justices took up an appeal by the company, which sells stun guns, body cameras and other equipment used by police, after a lower court threw out the case, finding that Axon cannot contest the constitutionality of the FTC's structure in a federal court before first enduring the agency's enforcement action in an in-house administrative proceeding.
The FTC, an independent federal agency that targets anticompetitive and fraudulent business practices, can enforce its authority either in federal court or through its own administrative hearings. 
Scottsdale, Arizona-based Axon contends that the agency is biased against the companies or individuals it targets and the results of its ""sham"" internal enforcement actions are preordained. 
Axon claimed that the agency acts as ""prosecutor, judge and jury"" in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law. Axon also challenged the authority of any FTC administrative law judges, asserting that their job protections unlawfully place them outside the president's power to control executive branch officers under the Constitution's Article II. 
The FTC last year issued https://www.reuters.com/article/us-axon-enterprise-ftc-idINKBN1Z2281 an administrative complaint against Axon challenging its 2018 acquisition of Vievu, a rival body-camera provider, for $13 million, saying the deal allowed the company to impose substantial price increases. Axon said the transaction was lawful and sued in federal court to halt the FTC proceeding. 
A federal judge said the company cannot bypass the FTC's administrative proceeding and tossed Axon's case. The judge ruled that the Federal Trade Commission Act, which established the FTC in 1914, requires the company to raise its objections at the agency and appeal any adverse result to a federal court of appeals. 
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/axon-loses-appeals-court-fight-with-ftc-over-vievu-acquisition-2021-01-28 that decision last year, prompting Axon to appeal to the Supreme Court. 

Backed by business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Axon urged the justices to reopen the courthouse doors to its lawsuit challenging the legality of the FTC judges ""and of the FTC itself."" 
President Joe Biden's administration, defending the FTC, urged the justices to reject https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/doj-spurns-taser-makers-ftc-forum-challenge-scotus-appeal-2021-09-23 the appeal.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 10:10AM ET</span>","EU regulator set to rule on Pfizer COVID pill by end-Jan, ahead of Merck","(Reuters) -The European Union's drug regulator is set to decide whether to approve  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 pill at the end of this month, before doing a final review of Merck's similar but less effective drug in February, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
Late last year, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave guidance to member states on how to use both antiviral pills as emergency treatments, while it carried out rolling reviews to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval.
The EU watchdog said the panel of experts reviewing new drugs was meeting from Monday until Thursday this week ""with the objective to conclude the evaluation, if possible"" of Pfizer's Paxlovid treatment.
""We would communicate it towards the end of this week,"" it added. 
Italy, Germany and Belgium are among a handful of EU countries that have bought the drugs.
The EMA's review of Merck's pill, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is taking longer than Pfizer's because Merck released trial data in November showing its drug was significantly less effective than previously thought.
""Merck had applied earlier than Pfizer, but then they had sent the final data on efficacy later, and therefore it took European regulators more time to examine that very last data,"" the source said. 
The source declined to be identified because the EMA's reviews are confidential.
While vaccines are central to fighting the pandemic, regulators are looking at antivirals, which can be taken at home, as a new weapon against the fast-spreading Omicron variant.
U.S. and UK regulators have given the go ahead for both drugs to treat certain high-risk adult patients. 
The EMA said on Jan. 10 it could issue ""within weeks"" a decision on whether to approve the use of Pfizer's two-drug regimen Paxlovid.
In a clinical trial, it was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths when given at an early stage to patients at high risk of severe illness.

The source also said the EMA planned to issue its decision on Valneva's VLA2001 COVID-19 vaccine candidate in March, in line with the timeline given by the French company on Jan 6. 
The EMA declined to comment on the timing of the review.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian grocery startups are luring tech-savvy customers with the promise of deliveries within 10 minutes, sparking a boom in ""quick commerce"", but heating up concerns about road safety as bike riders scramble to meet tight deadlines.
Competition is already intense in India's $600-billion grocery retailing industry, populated by the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Flipkart and Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance.
Now SoftBank-backed Blinkit and its rival Zepto are racing to hire staff and open stores in their bid to grab a share of the market by offering the convenience of delivery in 10 minutes, far lower than the hours, or days competitors take. 
Their mission: pack groceries within a few minutes at so-called dark stores, or small warehouses in densely populated neighbourhood buildings, and send bike riders to nearby locations with about seven minutes to spare.
""It's a threat to the larger players,"" Ashwin Mehta, a lead IT sector analyst at India's Ambit Capital, told Reuters. ""If people get used to 10 minutes, those companies offering 24-hour deliveries will be forced to reduce their timelines."" 
As activity grows, research firm RedSeer says India's quick commerce sector, worth $300 million last year, will swell 10-15 times to touch $5 billion by 2025. 
Blinkit and Zepto, started by two 19-year-old dropouts from Stanford, have caught consumers' fancy, satisfying cravings for food and impulse shopping, as well as urgent needs for daily supplies.
""This is very convenient, it has made a lifestyle change,"" said Sharmistha Lahiri, who now turns to Blinkit to fill the gap when ingredients suddenly run out in her kitchen, from tomatoes for soup to chocolate icing for a cake. 
The 75-year-old, who lives in the city of Gurugram near the capital, New Delhi, was a keen user of Amazon and Indian conglomerate Tata's online grocer BigBasket, but prizes Blinkit's rapid response in such situations.
The unbeatable convenience of rapid deliveries is evident in Europe and the United States, where companies such as Turkey's Getir and Germany's Gorillas are expanding fast, but India's accident-prone roads make quick commerce a dangerous business.
""Ten minutes is very sharp,"" said a former road secretary, Vijay Chhibber. ""If there was a (road safety) regulator, it would have said this can't be a company's unique selling point."" 
Blinkit and Zepto did not respond to queries from Reuters.
RISKY ROADS, DRIVERS' WOES
Even in cities, most roads are riddled with potholes, while cattle or other animals straying into traffic present a frequent challenge for motorists, who often violate basic rules. 
Last year, the World Bank said India had a death every four minutes on its roads. Crashes kill about 150,000 people each year.
All the 13 drivers for Blinkit and Zepto whom Reuters interviewed in the key cities of Mumbai, New Delhi and Gurugram said they faced pressure to meet delivery deadlines, which often led to speeding, for fear of being rebuked by store managers.
""We get five to six minutes and I feel tense and fear for my life,"" said one Blinkit driver, who sought anonymity.
In August, Blinkit's chief executive said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that riders were not penalised and could deliver ""at their own pace and rhythm,"" as dark stores are always near destination sites. 
Delivery riders disagreed. In their rush, many of them told Reuters, they mark orders as having been delivered even before they get to the destination.
And if a customer complained about the practice, they faced a penalty of 300 Indian rupees ($4.03). A Blinkit app screenshot provided by one driver showed the term, MDND, or ""Marked Delivered, Not Delivered"" used to designate such items. 
Frustration was also on display in the conversation on a WhatsApp group of Blinkit riders in Mumbai reviewed by Reuters.
""Ban this 10-minute (delivery),"" said one user, after pictures were posted of a rider said to have been injured in a deadline rush. 
The concerns reflect the dark side of India's booming gig economy, in which workers often say they feel shortchanged or battle tough working conditions.
BULLISH
Blinkit calls its service ""indistinguishable from magic"" and says it wants to become a $100-billion business.
Zepto has been valued at $570 million and has set its eyes on becoming a $20-billion company, already backed by investors such as U.S.-based Glade Brook Capital.
The instant delivery market is a $50-billion opportunity, India's largest offline retailer, Reliance, said this month, when it invested in Dunzo, another Indian startup that runs a 19-minute delivery service. 
But, unlike most foreign companies that charge $2 to $3 a delivery, deliveries by Indian startups are mostly free in a nation with a population of 1.4 billion potential customers.
""With free delivery, the business is unlikely to be viable,"" said T.N. Hari, who heads human resources at online grocery BigBasket, which delivers most orders within five hours.
""And with a delivery fee that makes it viable, the market size is likely to be small.""

For now, Indians are hooked.
Deliveries on New Year's Eve included more than 43,000 cans of fizzy drinks, a Blinkit investor said on Twitter, adding, ""33,440 condoms were ordered on @letsblinkit today. Someone ordered 80 condoms in one go.""

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) aims to launch an algorithm-based auto insurance plan by the end of the first quarter in some U.S. states that charges policyholders based on their driving performance, a company executive said in an interview.
The automaker's OnStar subsidiary has asked for regulatory approval of the new data-based insurance plan in Arizona, Illinois and Michigan together with its insurance partner American Family. It hopes to receive the go-ahead by the end of March, Andrew Rose, president of OnStar Insurance and GM's vice president of Global Innovation, said during an interview Friday.
""We hope to follow that with a dozen, two dozen and hopefully more states,"" Rose said.
GM's policy currently does not factor in the use of driver-assistance systems, which can automate some driving tasks, and control braking and acceleration.
Sensor data from GM's ""Super Cruise"" system, including an in-cabin camera that monitors drivers' eye and head movements, could factor into rate setting in later versions of the insurance plan, Rose said, but declined to provide a timeline.
""I'm very excited about what we have in market and its ability for us to show benefit to the insurance equation,"" he said.
To use such granular data, GM and other automakers would have to overcome the scrutiny of state insurance commissions, which have yet to approve the use of data from automated systems for rate setting.
The leading U.S. auto insurance research group, IIHS, on Thursday said https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/iihs-creates-safeguard-ratings-for-partial-automation there was no evidence that partial automation systems make driving safer https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/nonprofit-groups-rate-us-vehicle-driver-monitoring-systems-2022-01-20.
GM, which launched its regular OnStar insurance offer a year ago, has said it targets $6 billion in insurance revenue by 2030, with the average annual U.S. auto premium costing around $1,000.
Behavior-based auto insurance, often referred to as telematics, has been available for several years, but largely requires consumers to download a mobile app or plug a data recorder into the car. 

GM instead collects braking, acceleration and general usage data, such as seatbelt use, directly from the car, providing more reliable and consistent data, Rose said.
Customers who opt into data collection for the new plan receive an upfront discount on their policy if GM considers them safe drivers, Rose said. Drivers would not face surcharges for bad driving, he said, but those conditions might change in the future.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply lower again on Monday, as fears of an imminent war in Ukraine added to more familiar worries about rising interest rates and stretched valuations. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 419 points, or 1.2%, at 33,846 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.5%, and the NASDAQ Composite, which fell over 7.5% last week alone, was down another 1.8%. Like the NASDAQ, the S&P 500 is now down more than 10% from its 2021, a decline that traditionally qualifies as ""correction territory.""
Over the weekend, the U.S. had instructed the families of its diplomats living in Ukraine to leave the country, seeing a sustained high risk of invasion by Russia, which has massed over 100,000 soldiers on its side of the border with Ukraine since late last year. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had said at talks with his counterpart Anthony Blinken last week that Russia has no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, but a Kremlin spokesman said on Monday that Russia expected Ukraine's government to attack the two Russian-backed breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine imminently - comments which immediately raised fears that the country would use such an incident to justify invading.
Geopolitical tensions are merely compounding more prosaic fears about the market at the start of a week that will be dominated by the Federal Reserve's meeting, which ends on Wednesday. While the consensus is still for no change to monetary policy until the next meeting in March, the market's reaction is likely to be highly sensitive to any hints in the central bank's guidance that would suggest it feels it is still 'behind the curve' in tackling runaway inflation. 
Once again, the cohort of 'profitless tech' and other innovation-themed stocks was prominent in leading the declines, with Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) stock down 4.6%, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock down 7.8% and Netflix - which  had already lost over one-fifth of its value last week in response to a warning of slower subscriber growth - falling another 6.8%.
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock, meanwhile, was down 9.4%, tracking the slump in the value of the cryptocurrencies whose trading it hosts.  Bitcoin tumbled to its lowest in six months before recovering a little to trade down 4.6% at $33,747.
However, the selling also engulfed more profitable, defensive technology stocks, with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock down 2.5%, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock down 2.1%, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock down 1.6% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock down 1.9%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, the largest and most liquid holding in many innovation-themed portfolios - including those of Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) - fell 8.1% amid signs of forced liquidations. ARK Innovation itself fell another 4.3%, to its lowest in 19 months.
One stock successfully bucking the trend was Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), which rose over 31% after reports that private equity group Sycamore Capital had made an offer for the struggling department store chain. That adds to the growing list of investors that have either expressed an interest in it or have agitated aggressively to improve shareholder returns there."

The Raptor's improved off-roading capabilities and 3.0 liter twin turbo ecoboost engine will help Ford directly compete with the Jeep's Wrangler Rubicon model. 
The Raptor lineup, which usually features pickup trucks like its F-150 and the Ranger, was created to mirror off-road trophy truck designs onto their street-legal counterparts.

Investing.com – MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and other crypto-related stocks look set to extend last week’s losses as digital currencies take a beating amid rising geopolitical and economic uncertainties.
MicroStrategy stock fell 15% in Monday’s premarket trading after shedding nearly 18% Friday. Coinbase was down 11%. It lost over 13% in the last trading session.
Fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine and rising interest rates are spooking the markets, triggering a sharp erosion in value of assets considered risky. Cryptos are leading the fall, followed by stocks. Bank of Russia’s proposal to ban cryptos is also adding to the rout.
Other crypto-related stocks being knocked down in the premarket session include Hut 8 Mining (NASDAQ:HUT) (14% down), Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT), Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) (all losing 12%). ADRs of Argo Blockchain (NASDAQ:ARBK) plunged 15%.
Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell more than 7% and traded just above $33,500. The crypto has more than halved since touching a lifetime high of $68,990.6 on Nov. 10. Analysis by Korea-based site CryptoQuant suggests that over 38% of all Bitcoin ever mined is now trading at a loss, compared to a peak ratio of 34% during the previous selloff in the middle of last year.
Other cryptos were plunging on Monday, too. Shiba Inu SHIB/USD slumped 16%, Polkadot Polkadot 14%, Ethereum ETH/USD 12% and Dogecoin DOGE/USD 8%.
The latest slide in cryptos followed the crisis in Kazakhstan, where people protested against rising fuel prices. The central Asian country is the world’s second largest crypto miner.

Sarsfield will take over the post alongside Julian Salisbury, who has been heading the unit alone ever since Eric Lane ended his association of over 25 years with the bank in March last year to join investment firm Tiger Global Management.
The asset management arm provides investment and advisory services to several clients, including sovereign wealth funds, public and private pension funds and insurance companies.
In mid-2020, Goldman Sachs had merged its merchant banking and asset management businesses into a single unit as part of a broader restructuring. [https://reut.rs/33FuZfR]

Sarsfield who has worked in the premier investment bank for over 22 years, is currently co-head of its client business for the asset management arm. He was formerly Goldman Sachs's global head of the financial institutions group and the global chief operating officer of the investment banking division. 
Chief Executive David Solomon, who succeeded Lloyd Blankfein in October 2018, has streamlined the bank's structure into four main businesses - investment banking, trading, asset management and consumer banking - to shift its focus away from volatile trading and into more stable businesses.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group on Monday sought more time from its offshore bondholders to work on a ""comprehensive"" and ""effective"" debt restructuring plan, amid signs Beijing is tightening control over the cash-strapped property group.
Evergrande, once China's top selling real estate developer, has more than $300 billion in liabilities, including nearly $20 billion of international bonds all deemed to be in default after a run of missed payments late last year.
Last week, a group of Evergrande's offshore creditors said they were ready to take ""all necessary actions"" to defend their rights if the company did not show more urgency to resolve a default.
Evergrande on Monday urged bondholders to refrain from taking ""radical legal actions"" and that it looked forward to communicating with various overseas creditors to formulate a debt restructuring plan.
The company needs further studies and evaluation before entering into communication with the creditors, it said in a statement on its website.
""The board, the risk management committee and the entire company are sparing no effort ... to formulate a comprehensive, detailed and effective debt restructuring plan to protect the legal rights of all parties,"" Evergrande said.
Evergrande's shares rose earlier on Monday after it named two new board members, including Liang Senlin, chairman of China Cinda (HK) Holdings Company Limited, a unit of China Cinda Asset Management - one of the country's four biggest state asset managers. 
Evergrande set up a risk management committee last month, mostly comprising senior officials from state entities including China Cinda Asset Management.
Evergrande's assets are expected to be taken over by state-owned firms in a restructuring led by the provincial government of Guangdong, where the developer is based, and the naming of an official from a unit of a state asset manager to its board could signal the restructuring was moving forward. 
The other new board member was Siu Shawn, chairman of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Limited, a business the parent company plans to prioritise.
Evergrande's shares also drew support from a Friday report by Financial intelligence provider REDD that said the Guangdong provincial government was aiming to release a framework debt restructuring plan by March. 
It plans to separate the company's offshore assets and sell them to pay off foreign debt, the REDD report said.
Evergrande has not responded to requests for comment on the report.
The developer's stock ended the day up nearly 4%.
ASSET SALES
Regulatory curbs on borrowing have driven China's property sector into crisis, highlighted by Evergrande, which was once the country's top-selling developer, but is now the world's most indebted property company.
Beijing has taken steps to restore stability, including making it easier for state-backed developers to buy up distressed assets of indebted private firms, a source said.
Guangzhou-based Agile said on Monday it sold its 26.7% stake in a mixed-use complex to one of the joint-venture partners, state-owned developer China Overseas Land (COLI), for 1.84 billion yuan ($291 million). 
The complex is Guangzhou Asian Games City, and COLI owned 20% interest in it before the purchase.
Shimao, which holds a 26.7% stake in the same complex, is also trying to sell its stake to COLI, local media Cailianshe reported. Shimao did not respond to a request for comment.
Agile Group and Shimao Group ended up 7.4% and 0.2% respectively. The Hang Seng Mainland Properties sub-index edged up 0.6%.

Last week, Shimao said it had sold commercial land in Shanghai for 1.06 billion yuan to a company owned by the Shanghai municipal government to reduce debt.

PARIS (Reuters) -Boeing Co is investing a further $450 million in Wisk Aero to support development of future pilotless flying taxis, the U.S. aerospace giant said on Monday.
California-based Wisk, owned by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Kitty Hawk - the air vehicle firm launched by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) co-founder Larry Page - is one of dozens of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) makers but differs in focusing its efforts on autonomous flight.
""Our view is that is the big strategic advantage of Wisk, going straight to a self-flying aircraft, building those principles in at every level of the design and development,"" Boeing's Chief Strategy Officer Marc Allen told Reuters.
The decision to leapfrog a generation of piloted eVTOL aircraft being developed by independent startups and some aerospace groups entails a later entry to service than the target date of 2024 envisaged by most competitors.
Boeing declined to give a date for what it terms the sixth-generation Wisk passenger vehicle, but industry sources said the idea was to present it for certification in around 2028.
Boeing said it would be the first autonomous passenger-carrying vehicle to be certified in the United States.
In a statement, Wisk said the $450 million investment from Boeing would make it ""one of the most well-funded"" companies of its type, but gave no further details.
The fundraising follows a spate of billion-dollar SPAC mergers by competitors in a trend that has cooled recently.
Analysts say the timetable for certification remains the key source of uncertainty surrounding the industry, whose debuts include California-based Joby and Archer and European rivals Lilium and Vertical Aerospace.
Boeing owns an undisclosed majority stake in Wisk.
It is not the only aerospace company teaming up with Silicon Valley to share development costs and foster an agile approach to innovation as simultaneous leaps in electric, materials and processing technology bring aviation within reach of startups. 
""The kinds of constant demand shifts that will accompany these emerging industries really do require broad collaboration across those in industry who bring different capabilities together,"" Allen said in an interview.
Beyond that, the debt-laden U.S. aerospace giant is seen as selectively more willing to co-develop know-how on broad capabilities like autonomy and advanced production processes, rather than controlling all high-end technology in-house.

Asked if there could be other partnerships within Boeing's core aerospace activities, Allen said: ""Wisk is just one great example. I am sure it will not be the only example.""
Boeing's investment in the company could yield improvements that could be applied across Boeing's portfolio, he added.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A former 'banker of the year' faces charges including fraud and embezzlement in a Zurich court on Tuesday, in a rare high-profile prosecution in Switzerland's financial services sector.
Pierin Vincenz, along with six others, is also accused of disloyal management and forgery of documents in a case relating to trades and acquisitions made when he was chief executive of unlisted cooperative lender Raiffeisen Switzerland.
Vincenz and the other defendants all deny the allegations.
Hearings have been moved from the local courthouse to Zurich's Volkshaus theatre due to the intense interest in the case of Vincenz, who was named 'banker of the year' by Switzerland's Bilanz magazine in 2014.
A cooperative of independent retail branches, Raiffeisen is Switzerland's third-largest banking group. In 2018, the country's financial watchdog FINMA found ""serious shortcomings"" at Raiffeisen including interest conflicts and inadequate supervision in a probe related to fraud allegations against Vincenz.
FINMA discontinued https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2017/12/20171221-mm-pv its proceedings against Vincenz in late 2017 after he resigned from all executive management positions at Swiss financial institutions and promised not to take such roles in the future.
Swiss prosecutors opened an investigation, however, and Vincenz was held in custody https://www.reuters.com/article/swiss-vincenz-idINL8N1TF0XV for three and a half months in 2018.
Raiffeisen declined comment on the case beyond noting that it was a private plaintiff in the criminal proceedings. It is not facing any charges and has said that it has improved corporate governance since the FINMA probe.
Prosecutors are seeking nearly 70 million Swiss francs ($77 million) in total in assets from the seven defendants, as well as pursuing financial penalties and prison sentences ranging from two to six years for all but one of them.

They are also targeting loans granted to Vincenz and expenses racked up on his company credit card, including nearly 200,000 Swiss francs for visits to strip clubs and 100,000 francs on private travel, the indictment shows.

Precipitous declines in U.S. stocks and other risk assets have historically given pause to policy makers, giving rise to the notion of a so-called Fed put for American equities. But this time around, bets on benchmark hikes this year are intact even amid the current tumble, which has seen the technology-heavy Nasdaq index slump.
Swap markets show a quarter-point Fed rate increase is priced in for March and close to a full percentage point is in the market for the whole of 2022. 
The yield on the two-year Treasury, a tenor that’s closely linked to central bank expectations, is actually up a basis point in Monday trading at about 1.01% even as fears around Russia and other issues weigh on equity futures. The government is slated to auction two-year notes later in the day.
One key difference now is that the Fed, focused as it is on heightened inflation, may not have scope to promise support even if officials wanted to. And indeed it is the very concern about just how much the Fed might need to tighten that is adding fuel to selloffs in shares.

Murria's AdvancedAdvT said on Monday it had floated two options, one an all-share offer that values each M&C share at around 220 pence or an alternative structure that includes some cash and values them at around 200 pence. 
It said the paper offer represented a 20.7% increase on its previous proposal, but that the agency's independent directors rejected it late on Sunday. The 220 pence price - valuing M&C Saatchi at about 270 million pounds ($364 million)- is based on the AdvancedAdvT stock price when it was halted from trading. 
M&C shares were up 2.5% at 179.5 pence in morning trading, before falling following the M&C statement. 
AdvancedAdvT, the vehicle of the software entrepreneur Murria that is also backed by private equity group Marwyn, has said it would combine its digital capabilities with the brand recognition of M&C, and invest heavily to help it better compete, including with acquisitions. 
Founded in 1995 by ad mogul brothers Maurice and Charles Saatchi, M&C has been recovering from a 2019 accounting scandal and argues the offer does not reflect its expected future growth. It has said it sees little merit in a deal that does not offer its shareholders a full premium.
It said on Monday it had not seen any details about possible takeovers, and there was no guarantee this strategy would work. It also noted that major corporate change can unsettle key staff, a fundamental issue for a services company. 
Murria is M&C's deputy chairman and biggest investor. She owns 12.5% of M&C directly, while AdvancedAdvT owns 9.8%. 
In Monday's statement, AdvancedAdvT said it would want to keep Saatchi's Moray MacLennan as CEO, with AdvancedAdvT's Gavin Hugill as chief operating officer. Vin Murria would act as chairperson with a majority of independent directors.
M&C Saatchi in a trading update on Friday lifted its 2021 headline profit before tax outlook, and said a regulatory investigation into the group's accounting had closed without any enforcement action. 

Analysts at Peel Hunt said with the group's recent strong trading and the closure of the investigation it believed a further improved offer would be required. AdvancedAdvT has until Feb 3 to provide a formal offer, they said.

Investing.com – Halliburton stock (NYSE:HAL) traded 1.6% higher in Monday’s premarket as higher crude prices drove up demand for its oilfield services and equipment, helping the company beat fourth-quarter estimates.
The company's decision to raise dividend to 12 cents per share was also boosting the stock price. Rival Schlumberger, by contrast, had taken a more conservative approach last week, preferring to rebuild its cash reserves and keeping its payout unchanged.
Booming economies, supply chain issues, cold weather and geopolitical tension in Europe and Central Asia have all combined to keep supplies tight and energy prices high. Oil cartel OPEC+ has been slow to expand production and that has also kept the prices firm. Crude prices are currently trading near a seven-year high after running up more than 50% last year.
After rig counts plummeted to historic lows in late 2020, global oil drilling is recovering, boosting demand for equipment and services offered by companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).
Exploration companies around the globe are expected to almost triple the pace of spending hikes this year compared to 2021, Bloomberg quoted Evercore ISI as saying.
The worldwide rig count was 1,563 at the end of the fourth quarter, compared with 1,104 in 2020, Reuters said, citing Baker Hughes data. The U.S. rig count jumped 68% year-over-year to 586.
Halliburton's total revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.3 billion compared to revenue, rising more than 10% year-on-year. Adjusted profit per share was 36 cents, rising 29% and boosted by lower interest outgo. The company had done early redemption of $1.5 billion in the year ended December 2020.

Merck said it would meet with the agency to discuss the next steps on the oral drug, gefapixant.
Shares in the company were down about 0.5% at $79.6 before the bell.
If approved later, gefapixant would become the first such remedy for patients who have a persisting cough after the treatment of underlying health conditions such as asthma or if they have an unexplained chronic cough, Merck said. 

Last week, Japan's health regulator approved gefapixant tablets for adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough, to be marketed under the brand name Lyfnua.
The FDA's decision was not related to the drug's safety, Merck said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - LVMH's luxury watch brands Hublot and Bulgari have pushed sales above 2019 levels in the past year and more growth is expected this year on strong U.S. demand, company executives told Reuters ahead of LVMH Watch Week that kicks off on Monday.
Hublot and Bulgari, alongside LVMH stablemates Zenith and TAG Heuer, are holding LVMH Watch Week online, with digital presentations of their latest collections.
Hublot is showing an extra-slim version of its Big Bang watch, while Italian jeweller Bulgari has Serpenti Misteriosi watches which are hidden in snake-like bracelets and rings.
The Serpenti watches, which can cost as much at 240,000 euros ($271,464.00) for the most expensive models, are powered by a new miniature Piccolissimo mechanical movement.
Swiss luxury watch sales declined sharply in 2020, when the pandemic shuttered shops and curbed tourism. But they bounced back last year, with Swiss watch exports slightly above 2019 levels at the end of November, thanks to strong demand in the United States and China.
Switzerland's full-year watch exports are due on Jan 27, the same day luxury goods group LVMH reports full-year results.
""2021 was a good year, we did better than in 2019,"" Hublot Chief Executive Ricardo Guadalupe said in an interview on Monday, highlighting 30% sales growth in the United States and ""excellent numbers"" in mainland China.
""We obviously won't see the same strong rebound between 2021 and 2022, but we believe we'll have solid growth.""
He also said that tourist shoppers were still largely absent and that supply chain issues, mainly due to workers sick with the Omicron variant, had caused production delays that would hopefully be resolved by the summer. 
Bulgari Chief Executive Jean-Christophe Babin told Reuters the brand had also done better last year than in pre-pandemic 2019 thanks to market share gains.
""We want to continue with this positive trend in 2022,"" he said, adding new yellow gold models should help to attract U.S. consumers who are fans of that type of gold, while Asians tend to prefer rose gold.
""The United States became our second-biggest market last year and it has one of the best growth rates currently,"" Babin said. 

 Kering  (PA:PRTP), the other big French luxury goods group that competes with LVMH, said on Monday it was divesting its Swiss watch brands Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin.

Investing.com – Kohl's stock (NYSE:KSS) surged nearly 29% in Monday’s premarket after newswires reported that private equity firm Sycamore Partners has effectively started a bidding war for the department store chain.  
The size of Sycamore’s offer isn’t known yet. 
Last week, a group backed by activist hedge fund Starboard Value offered about $9 billion for Kohl’s. The offer is led by Acacia Research, which is run by Clifford Press. Acacia owns less than 5% of department store chain. 
The interest in the retailer is the latest example of pressure from activist investors on it to explore steps to boost the stock price. 
Macellum Advisors, another activist, is also renewing a push to make changes to its board. It has a stake of around 5% stake in Kohl’s.
Kohl’s shares closed Friday at $46.84, giving it a market value of $6.52 billion. The stock has rebounded from its pandemic lows but has essentially gone sideways for more than two decades.
Just last month, Engine Capital, with around 1% in the company, had urged the company’s board to consider a sale or a separation of its faster-growing e-commerce business."

(Reuters) - Shares in Unilever (NYSE:UL) rose 6% on Monday on reports that activist investor Nelson Peltz has built a stake in the consumer goods giant whose strategy is under scrutiny after a short-lived pursuit of GSK's consumer healthcare arm.
Peltz's hedge fund, Trian Partners, has built an unspecified stake in Unilever, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday. The New York-based fund is known for proposing operational changes at its portfolio companies which have previously included Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).
Unilever declined to comment on the investment. Shares of the owner of brands such as Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Sunsilk shampoo were up 6.0% at 3,894 pence by 1146 GMT and the biggest gainer on London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index. 
This isn't the first time Peltz has shown interest in a consumer goods company.
In 2018, Trian called for a slew of changes at Unilever's bigger rival P&G. Peltz was then added to the board of the company, following a months-long proxy fight.
P&G subsequently met some of the activist hedge fund's demands and announced new financial targets. Peltz stepped down from the company's board last year.
'NOT MUCH OF A SURPRISE'
Unilever's unexpected and ultimately unsuccessful 50 billion pound ($67.50 billion) pursuit of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s consumer health business, which had it gone through would have been one of the largest ever deals on the London market, raised questions about Unilever's plans under Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope. 
Peltz's stake in Unilever ""will not be that much of a surprise to industry specialists"",  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note, adding that his possible involvement with Unilever had been discussed long before the GSK skirmish. 
""From Unilever's perspective, the status quo is not an option. It would seem that the stars are aligning with both Unilever management and an activist pushing for more urgency,"" they added. 
By Friday's close, Unilever had lost 6% in value since the GSK overtures were disclosed on Jan. 15 with the chase effectively abandoned within a few days.
The company's shares have also dropped 31% from highs seen in late 2019, compared with a 3% rise in the FTSE 100 during the same period. 
Terry Smith, whose Fundsmith vehicle is Unilever's 13th biggest investor, took aim at Unilever last week, labelling the GSK bid ""a near death experience,"" and reiterating calls to focus on the operating performance of the existing business.

Unilever is set to announce an initiative this month to strengthen its business, and said last week it was committed to ""strict financial discipline"" for any acquisitions.

Investing.com – Peloton stock (NASDAQ:PTON) stock was up 1.2% in Monday’s premarket trading amid calls by activist investor Blackwells Capital on the company to fire chief executive John Foley.
According to The Wall Street Journal, the investment firm, run by Jason Aintabi, is also urging the fitness equipment maker to consider selling itself. A Reuters report named Disney, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) or  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) as suitors suggested by the fund.
Blackwells owns less than 5% of Peloton.  
Peloton, one of the darlings of investors during the early phase of the pandemic when its bikes and treadmills sold in big numbers, has had it rough since infections began to wane and people returned to work and exercising at gyms.
Last week, CNBC said the company would halt production for two months in the wake of falling demand for its bikes and treadmills. The company denied the report but said layoffs could take place as it attempts to cut operating expenses and improve profitability. 
Blackwells argues Peloton is weaker today than before the pandemic, the WSJ said.
From its lifetime high of nearly $55 billion around a year back, the company’s market cap has dwindled to less than $9 billion. It now trades below its September 2019 IPO price of $29.
As the world began to adjust to a post-pandemic scenario, the company first tried to broaden its consumer base by slashing prices. But even before that could fully play out, the company was forced into beginning charging separately for delivery and setup of its equipment in the U.S., its largest market.
Blackwell’s push at Peloton comes ironically at the same time as private equity KKR is buying  Accell  (AS:ACCG), a Dutch-based maker of real-world bicycles, for 1.5 billion euro (around $1.7 billion). Accell’s stock surged 24% in Amsterdam trading."

The strategist, who has long been a skeptic of the rally that pushed U.S. equities to successive records, said Monday that January’s rout “fits nicely” with his so-called fire and ice narrative, according to which markets were set for a drawdown amid tighter monetary policy and decelerating growth.
If anything, the retreat has further to go, Wilson and his colleagues wrote in a note, borrowing again from Game of Thrones to warn that “winter is here,” with concerns about a slowing economy poised to take over from jitters over Federal Reserve policy as the main force pulling stocks lower.
“We have been monitoring PMIs and earnings revisions breadth for signs the slowdown is bottoming, but it has quite a bit further to go, in our view, and equity markets are not yet priced for it,” the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists said. “It’s too early to get bullish.”
U.S. futures contracts edged lower again on Monday, after the worst week for the Nasdaq 100 index since the pandemic selloff in March 2020. Investors now have to contend with Wednesday’s Fed meeting, where officials are expected to signal that they’ll raise interest rates in March and shrink their balance sheet soon after.
Guidance Disappoints
Meanwhile, the earnings season so far has failed to assuage growing pessimism about the macroeconomic outlook.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) strategists said Monday that guidance for the months ahead has been “disappointing,” as only one S&P 500 company -- Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) -- has both beaten earnings estimates and raised its outlook.
Markets are increasingly concerned that a more hawkish shift from the Fed could hit earnings growth, Goldman strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note. “Investors will require a catalyst in the near-term to add length, but few obvious catalysts are evident in the near-term,” they said.
When it comes to places to hide amid a deteriorating backdrop, Morgan Stanley’s Wilson reiterated his recommendation for value stocks with a defensive bias. Goldman’s team favors stocks with high pricing power, while JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (NYSE:JPM) Mislav Matejka said European and U.K. stocks that are less vulnerable to rising rates are “looking interesting” versus the U.S.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A frenzy of talks for mergers and acquisitions has caught some Brazilian bankers off-guard in the early weeks of 2022. 
With the economy in recession, inflation in double digits and a polarizing election looming, a sliding stock market has made many companies into easier targets for takeovers, they say.
""It has been a long time since we began a year with such a large M&A pipeline,"" said Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Itau BBA.
Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index fell 17% over the last six months, and the real has weakened 5% against the dollar as investors fret about macroeconomic risks, slipping fiscal discipline and the outcome of an October presidential election.
The most fragile companies are the recently listed ones that lost significant market cap, bankers said, without citing specific potential targets.
Furniture retailers Mobly SA and Westwing Comercio, mileage program Dotz SA, outsourcing service Getninjas SA and marine engineering firm Oceanpact Servicos Maritimos lost more than 70% of their value since their IPOs last year.
""There is a good number of small- to mid-cap listed companies with significant price and liquidity challenges to tap into the equity capital markets to raise fresh money, so M&A becomes a more reliable and, in some cases, the only alternative,"" said Gustavo Miranda, investment banking head at  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA. 
Banco Modal SA, for example, had lost almost 60% of its value since an April IPO and received an all-share bid to be acquired by broker XP (NASDAQ:XP) Inc this month.
Discussion between mall operators Aliansce Sonae and BR Malls for a tie-up also come as shares in both companies were down more than 20% from a year earlier amid the pandemic. The deal seems to be motivated by a need to show growth and good news to investors even as the mall sector struggles to rebound from the pandemic. 
BR Malls has rejected Aliansce Sonae's proposal, but talks are expected to continue. Retailers Americanas SA and Marisa Lojas SA did not reach an agreement on a potential transaction last year. 
Ricardo Lacerda, CEO and founder of investment bank BR Partners, said the recent rout interrupted plans of newly listed companies and may force them into deals. ""Some of them were counting on new stock sales to fund expansion but couldn't complete the transactions due to market volatility,"" he said.
Debt has also become more expensive for companies, as Brazil's central bank hiked its benchmark rate last year to 9.25% in December from 2% in March, adding to fundraising costs.
""Given all the volatility hitting share offerings, M&A volumes in 2022 may surpass last year,"" said Hans Lin, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s co-head of investment banking in Brazil. Last year, deals involving Brazilian companies totaled $101.6 billion, up 152% from 2020. 
NEW OFFERINGS
Most bankers have held off forecasting share offerings this year, but several expect the volumes to fall from 2021. Share offerings totaled $26.2 billion last year, slightly below 2020's volumes in dollar, but in 78 deals, 17% up year-over-year.
""Last year we had a record year for share issuances, 2022 will not be as strong for equities as a result of macro and political volatility,"" said Itau's Greenlees.
Some companies have already announced plans for follow-on offerings, such as chicken and pork processor BRF SA (NYSE:BRFS) and petrochemical company  Braskem  SA (NYSE:BAK). The privatization of Eletrobras is also expected by June.

Bankers see follow-ons as more likely to occur than IPOs this year, as investors tend to rely on known assets during volatile periods. 
""Depending on how the market absorbs this pipeline of follow-ons, we are going to see investor sentiment improve, potentially making room for some IPOs,"" said Eduardo Miras, Brazil head of investment banking at Citi.

(Reuters) - Shares of the blank-check acquisition firm that agreed to merge with former President Donald Trump's social media venture have outperformed every other special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), despite the regulatory risks facing the deal and investors now snubbing the vast majority of such vehicles. 
Digital World Acquisition Corp, which inked an $875 million deal in October to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (TMTG), currently ranks as the best performing SPAC stock ever, according to SPAC Research. 
Top 10 SPACs (pre-closing and post-closing) by current stock price (in $): https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-TRUMP/SOCIALMEDIA-RETURNS/byprjmwazpe/chart.png 
For an interactive graphic, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3qLAAtJ
Digital World's shares ended trading at $73.12 on Friday, way above their $10 initial public offering price. This infers a valuation on the combined entity of close to $13 billion, including debt.
This is despite TMTG not having rolled out its social media app yet and the regulatory risks facing the deal. Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren asked Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler last month to investigate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws around disclosure.
The SEC has declined to comment on whether it will take any action. Digital World disclosed last month it has fielded enquiries from the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), without providing details on their nature.
The financial underperformance of most SPACs makes Digital World's stock rally, driven by Trump supporters and retail investors, all the more notable. 
Moreover, DWAC's share performance has boosted the average trading price of all 114 SPACs that have announced deals that are yet to close. Excluding DWAC, the average SPAC is currently trading at $9.88 a share, below the average trust value of about $10.05, according to SPAC Research. 
According to Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida, SPACS on an average have underperformed against the broader market by 25% during the past decade. Many of these deals' bullish financial projections have failed to come to pass. 
""DeSPACs have continued to give negative average returns in a rising market. This pattern has continued in 2021,"" Ritter said. 
If regulators let the deal go through, Digital World shareholders are all but certain to vote for it given the stock's performance. Digital World expects to issue a proxy statement with details on the deal in February, laying the ground for the vote to be held in the following weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store currently lists Feb. 21 as the date that Trump's new social media app, Truth Social, will be available to download.
Digital World CEO Patrick Orlando and other SPAC insiders paid $11.8 million to receive founder and placement shares in the SPAC that are now worth roughly $620 million, according to regulatory filings and Reuters calculations.

Investing.com – Unilever ADRs (NYSE:UL) jumped 6.8% in Monday’s premarket trading on a report over the weekend that activist investor Nelson Peltz has built a stake in the consumer goods maker.
Peltz's activist hedge fund Trian Partners is known for proposing operational fixes at its portfolio companies. The Financial Times report didn’t carry details on the size of Trian’s stake or when the share purchases began.
The gains bring Unilever stock roughly back to the level it was trading at before January 15, when it offered $68 billion for GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK) consumer health business. GSK rejected the bid as too low and Unilever has since dropped those plans. Some analysts had found the deal unexpected and raised questions over the company’s direction under Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope.
Fund manager Terry Smith called the GSK bid a “near-death experience” and urged the company to focus more on fixing its own business, Bloomberg reported.
Smith is the head of Fundsmith, Unilever’s 13th largest investor. He also said the company had “lost the plot” in seeking to promote the sustainable ethos of brands such as Hellmann’s mayonnaise rather than focusing on returns.
Peltz' focus on Unilever follows his retirement from Procter & Gamble’s board in August after nearly four years and several changes at the U.S. giant."
256,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 04:30AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank expected to break profit run in fourth quarter- Preview,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is expected to swing to a net loss when it reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday amid a slowdown in revenue at its investment bank, based on analysts' consensus estimates.
A loss would be a setback for Germany's largest bank after reporting five consecutive quarters of profit through the third quarter, its longest streak in the black since 2012.
But the loss is expected to be a blip in the bank's recent profit run rather than a sign of something more serious. Analysts are forecasting full-year net profits for 2022 and 2023, based on the consensus forecast published last week by the bank.
Deutsche's return to profit in the past few quarters has shown how a 9 billion euro overhaul by CEO Christian Sewing, begun in 2019, is paying off. Sewing has got the bank back into profit after a string of regulatory failings and billions in losses logged over the previous decade.
Part of Deutsche's overhaul involved reducing dependence on the investment bank's more volatile income. But in the past few quarters the division has been the bank's biggest revenue earner, generating around 40% of the bank's turnover by benefiting from a pandemic trading boom, as well as dealmaking fees. 
The investment bank has become a fairly stable business, said Andreas Thomae, a portfolio manager at Deka, an investor in the German bank. 
""Most importantly,"" Deutsche has ""won back customers in Germany and Europe who were a little sceptical before,"" he said.
For the fourth-quarter, the bank is expected to report a net loss attributable to shareholders of around 130 million euros ($147.20 million), based on analysts' estimates. That compares with a profit of 51 million euros a year earlier.
Revenues for the bank as a whole as well as for its investment bank are forecast to have slipped around 4% from a year earlier.
Some of the big U.S. banks' fourth-quarter results have disappointed investors partly because of ballooning expenses, hurting profit growth.
UBS analysts said costs would be a focus for Deutsche's fourth-quarter earnings, noting that the bank has said it wants to ""clear the decks of transformation charges and other costs"" this year.

2022 is a crucial year for Deutsche as it marks the deadline for the bank to meet targets set out in 2019, such as return on tangible equity. In March, Deutsche will announce a strategy review and new targets for the years ahead.

The bank said it had simplified its European structure by merging its Luxembourg and Irish entities into German business JP Morgan AG. 
JPMorgan said the new combined operation ""will be among the five largest banking legal entities in Germany"" and go into the top 20 of those supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB). It said it would have a total capital base of about 34 billion euros ($38.51 billion). 
Major U.S. banks have been reorganising their European operations since Brexit because they can no longer serve EU clients out of London. Channelling most of its EU business through a single entity will make it cheaper for JPMorgan to operate by reducing how much capital it needs to hold in total and combining different pools of liquidity. 

The reorganisation of the group's EU legal entity structure does not involve any change to its existing office locations, JPMorgan added.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 03:50AM ET</span>",Funds see promise in battered Chinese real estate dollar bonds,"By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Beaten-down dollar bonds issued by Chinese property developers are enticing domestic and global fund managers, some of whom are even planning to launch new funds targeting bargains as Beijing relents in its concerted drive to clean up the sector.
Jupai Holdings Ltd, a Chinese wealth manager, plans to start a fund to bet on such offshore Chinese property bonds.
""I think roughly half of the developers' dollar bonds were slaughtered by mistake,"" Jupai Chairman Jianda Ni said.
""We will spot value in what others dumped as trash.""
The investment appeal of the fallen angels in the property sector has grown on the heels of moves by China to ease some of the financial and regulatory constraints it imposed last year.
Curbs on borrowings by big real estate developers have driven China's property sector into a crisis, with China Evergrande Group at its forefront. Once China's top-selling developer, it has around $20 billion of international bonds, all deemed to be in default.
A Markit iBoxx index tracking China's high-yield real estate dollar bonds tumbled as much as 19% in January, following 2021's 38% slump. 
The selloff, which began in October with Evergrande, accelerated as other developers such as Kaisa Group and Shimao Group defaulted or delayed bond payments.
Paula Chan, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, also sees ""pockets of opportunities"" as the real estate sector moves ""from the bottom of the policy tightening cycle"". 
""The high-yield space presents a lot of opportunities, especially for distressed investors,"" Chan said. 
DOUBLING DOWN
China has in recent months rolled out several policies to stabilise the slowing economy, including a cut in mortgage rates, stepped-up approvals for developers' bond issuance, and government support for property acquisitions.
Fengshi Capital, a Chinese vulture fund manager, started buying developers' junk bonds late in 2021, and is considering doubling down on such bets this year, said a source with direct knowledge of the fund's plans who declined to be identified because the source was not authorised to talk to media.
Wealth manager Jupai's Ni says the firm's new fund will buy heavily discounted bonds that will mature shortly, betting they will not default. Such a strategy is based on a deep understanding of Chinese developers, as well as the character of their bosses, said Ni, who has worked for more than three decades in the Chinese real estate sector. 
Ni declined to name any targets, but said many undervalued bonds are in the range of 70-80 cents on the dollar. 
Roughly half of the dollar bonds issued by Chinese developers trade below 80 cents on the dollar, according to an estimate by Essence Securities last week. Some bonds issued by major developers currently yield more than 60%.
Mike Kelly, global head of multi-asset at the $140 billion asset manager PineBridge Investments said last week that the fund had started buying offshore Chinese property bonds and expected authorities' measures to stabilise the market would deliver ""extraordinary"" returns. 

Kelly declined to name companies. Having started to buy at the end of December, he said he was still ""in the accumulation stage"", picking up securities at 75-85 cents on the dollar.
Jean Charles Sambor, head of emerging market fixed income at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management, also expects ""significant easing"" in China's real estate policies, and the asset manager too is building a long position in the sector's debt.

(Reuters) -Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd said on Monday that it expected to resume burning cash because of stricter crew quarantine measures after flagging a surprise profit in the second half of 2021 due to cost cuts and a strong cargo market.
The airline forecast it would post an annual loss of HK$5.6 billion to HK$6.1 billion for 2021, well below the average HK$10.2 billion estimate from 12 analysts polled by Refinitiv and its HK$21.65 billion loss in 2020.
The full-year forecast was also narrower than the first-half loss of HK$7.57 billion, with Cathay pointing to positive cashflow generation in the second half.
However, the airline forecast it would burn through HK$1 billion to HK$1.5 billion of cash a month starting in February after the government tightened crew quarantine restrictions, forcing the airline to cut cargo and passenger capacity sharply.
Cathay is operating about 2% of its pre-pandemic passenger capacity and about 20% of its pre-pandemic cargo capacity in January.
Rival Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd, which also lacks a domestic market but has less-strict travel rules, forecasts it will reach 47% and 45% of pre-COVID passenger capacity in January and February respectively. 
The schedules listed on Cathay's website for February and March appear about as light as January, with only a handful of flights per month to destinations such as London, Sydney and Tokyo that had multiple daily flights before the pandemic. Flights to mainland China are less affected.
""Until conditions improve, we are doing everything in our power to maximise capacity, and estimate that mitigation measures to increase crew resources will enable us to operate approximately an additional 5% more cargo flight capacity than we are currently operating,"" Cathay Chief Executive Augustus Tang said in a statement.
Hong Kong, which has been pursuing a ""zero-COVID"" strategy in hopes of opening its border with mainland China, has suspended transit flights from most of the world. 
The financial centre last month introduced tighter crew quarantine rules after two Cathay crew members who broke self-isolation measures sparked a COVID-19 outbreak in the city. 

The two have since been fired, arrested and charged over the breaches.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 03:00AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Bears at the gate,"A look at the day ahead from Julien Ponthus
With a 14% fall from its November peak, not only is the Nasdaq deep in correction territory, it is also now within striking distance of the 20% fall bar which defines a bear market.
And while a U.S. Federal Reserve tightening cycle could be expected to weaken tech and other growth sectors, market stress is actually spread throughout Wall Street.
The S&P 500 has just suffered its biggest weekly loss since the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020 and is less than 2% away from a correction.
Friday's selloff came against the backdrop of a sharp fall in U.S. Treasury yields, which seems to suggest expectations of higher interest rates may not be the only factor denting sentiment ahead of this week's Fed meeting.
Until now, markets have been fairly happy to ignore the simmering tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine but this might be changing as President Joe Biden weighs options for boosting America's military assets in Eastern Europe.
In this context, stakes are building quickly for fourth-quarter earnings, especially after high-visibility stocks such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) disappointed investors.
Mega-caps due to update the market this week include  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
As the week starts, stress is palpable across most markets -- MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan is down over 1% while South Korean shares posted their biggest drop in five weeks and European futures are in the red.
In the meantime the dollar index is ticking up and bitcoin down to $35,295, almost 50% down from its November peaks.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 02:40AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi to unveil 2030 EV plan this week","By Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) -  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY), Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co and Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp plan to triple their investment to jointly develop electric vehicles (EVs), two people with knowledge of the plan told Reuters.
As established automakers face pressure from new competitors and an expected shift in demand toward EVs, the French-Japanese alliance is seeking to deepen cooperation.
The three are expected to announce on Thursday a plan to invest more than 20 billion euros ($23 billion) over the next five years on EV development, the sources said. By 2030, the alliance is expected to come up with more than 30 new battery EVs underpinned by five common platforms, they said.
That is in addition to 10 billion euros the group has already spent on electrification, said the two people with knowledge of the plan.
A Nissan spokesperson declined to ""comment on speculation"". Spokespeople for Renault (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi did not respond to requests for comment.
The “Alliance to 2030” plan aims to show “intensified cooperation” among the automakers, highlighting a “shared vision on electrification and connected mobility,” one source said. The five common platforms are expected to cover 90% of EVs the companies are expected to develop and launch by 2030, the sources said. 
The three-firm alliance has developed and partly deployed four common EV platforms.
One underpins EVs such as Nissan’s upcoming Ariya and Renault’s Megane EV, and another supports affordable no-frills cars by Nissan and its China market partner Dongfeng, as well as for Renault’s Dacia brand. The other two are platforms for micro minis, called “kei cars” in Japan, and light commercial vehicles.
By mid-decade, the alliance aims to deploy a fifth common platform for compact EVs designed by Renault, the sources said.
Nissan has already decided to use this platform, called CMFB-EV, and other standardised components to electrify the Nissan Micra compact car, while Renault is expected to come up with a similar EV car based on the same platform, the sources said. The Micra EV is projected to be released by the mid-2020s.
AFFORDABLE EVs
The automakers hope to make compact EVs as affordable as gasoline-fuelled vehicles of similar size, the sources said.
The automakers are expected to use common batteries and other key components. The alliance plans to jointly invest in capacity to produce in France, Britain, China and Japan a total of 220 gigawatt hours of battery capacity by 2030 under the plan, the sources said.
By standardising and sharing batteries, the alliance expects to halve battery manufacturing costs, they said.
The alliance is also expected to share solid-state lithium-ion battery technology, which Nissan has been developing, they said.
The plan had been for the leaders of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi to announce the 2030 plan last autumn at an event in Japan, but the announcement was postponed until this week because of a surge in COVID-19 in Japan, the sources said. 
A disagreement between Nissan and Renault over the French firm's proposals for a full-blown merger – tensions that burst into the open with the arrest of former alliance leader Carlos Ghosn in 2018 – corresponded with stalled efforts to collaborate on technology and vehicle development, people with knowledge of the matter have said.
The three automakers all have their own hybrid technologies with few shared key parts and systems. The limited cooperation in sourcing and development has raised concern within the group about the ability to achieve cost savings, one source said.
It was not immediately clear whether alliance leaders will discuss hybrids as part of their 2030 plan.
Nissan said in November it planned to spend some $18 billion over five years to accelerate vehicle electrification, launching 23 electrified vehicles - including gasoline-electric hybrids - by 2030, including 15 EVs. Half of Nissan's vehicle mix will be electrified by 2030, including EVs and e-Power hybrids, the company said.
Renault has said its Renault brand will be 100% electric in Europe by 2030, but company officials told Reuters the target does not apply to markets outside Europe and the group’s other brands, such as Dacia.

Philips earlier this month warned that supply chain woes would hit profit and a ventilator recall needed to be expanded, sending its shares down over 15% on their worst day on the financial markets in decades.
""We expect to start the year with a comparable sales decline, followed by a recovery and strong second half of the year,"" Chief Executive Officer Frans van Houten said in a statement.
This should lead to between 3% and 5% growth in comparable sales in 2022, with a 40 to 90 basis points improvement in the adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) margin, he added.
Overall growth will be held back by the sleep & respiratory care unit, which is still working on the massive recall of breathing-aid machines launched last year, amid concerns that a type of foam used in the devices could degrade and become toxic.
Growth, excluding this unit, is expected to reach 5% to 6%, Van Houten said.
Philips has set aside 725 million euros ($820.41 million) to repair and replace some 5 million devices worldwide, but that sum does not cover the possible costs of litigation, with the company facing more than a hundred class action suits. Fears of a large claims bill already lopped around 15 billion euros off Philips' market value in the past nine months.

The Amsterdam-based company said its comparable sales fell 10% in the fourth quarter of 2021, while adjusted EBITA dropped 35% to 647 million euros, in line with provisional numbers released on Jan. 12.

Investing.com – Property developer China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) shares climbed on Monday, over the news that it would appoint an official from a unit of state asset manager  China Cinda  Asset Management Co. Ltd. (HK:1359) to its board.
The company’s Hong Kong shares jumped 7.26% to HK$1.92 ($0.25) by 11:43 PM ET (4:43 AM GMT), after surging more than 13% earlier in the session.
China Evergrande said on Sunday that it would appoint two new board members, the first of whom is non-executive director Liang Senlin, chairman of China Cinda (HK) Holdings Co. Ltd.
The second is Shawn Siu, chairman of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Limited. The company said in October 2021 that it would prioritize the growth of its nascent electric vehicle business over its core real estate operations.
The two appointments follow the setting up of a China Evergrande risk management committee in December 2021, whose members mostly comprise senior officials from state entities including China Cinda Asset Management.
Meanwhile, China Evergrande is still sitting on more than $300 billion in liabilities, including nearly $20 billion worth of international bonds that are all deemed to be in default after a run of missed payments in late 2021.
China Evergrande’s assets will likely be taken over by state-owned firms as part of a restructuring led by the Guangdong provincial government, and the appointment is a reassuring sign that restructuring is progressing.
Shares also got a boost from Friday’s report from REDD, which said the provincial government was aiming to release a framework debt restructuring plan for the company by March 2022. It also plans to separate the company's offshore assets and sell them to pay off foreign debt, thus boosting foreign lenders' hopes of recouping some of their funds, the report added."

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning, with a potentially tighter U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy weighing on sentiment. Investors also digested inflation data from Japan and Australia.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.45% by 9:08 PM ET (2:08 AM GMT). The country’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for January was 54.6, and the country also released its services PMI.
South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.63%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.39%. Australia released its own manufacturing and services PMIs, which were at 55.3 and 45, respectively. The consumer price index is due on Tuesday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was fell 1.26%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.58% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.09%. Yu Yongding, a former member of the monetary policy committee of the People’s Bank of China, warned more government spending is needed to drive economic recovery as a looser monetary policy will not be enough.
With the past week being one of the worst for global shares since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, investors now await the Fed’s latest policy decision, which will be handed down on Wednesday. A key question is how a more hawkish Fed will impact fixed income, with U.S. Treasuries rallying after an initial fall at the beginning of the previous week. The benchmark 10-year yield inched up toward 1.77%.
There is also the risk that the Fed will tighten monetary policy more aggressively in 2022 than expected, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists warned.
The Bank of Canada will also hand down its policy decision on the same day.
Investors also await earnings reports throughout the week from companies including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Boeing Co  . (NYSE:BA),  General Electric  Company (NYSE:GE), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM),  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) NA O.N. (DE:DBKGn), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. Ltd. (KS:005930), and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)
There is “likely a longer-term rotation toward value stocks measured in quarters, not weeks” unfolding, Evercore ISI chief equity and quantitative strategist Julian Emanuel said in a note.
“Investors should retain a balanced view, staying patient in committing new capital to equities.”
A less accommodative Fed is also among the reasons why “you have a re-rating going on and certainly a bit of a, excuse the term, puking of some of the higher-spec, lower-quality segments of the market,”  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) & Co. chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, U.S.-Russia tensions over Ukraine are also on the radar, with the U.S. ordering family members at its embassy in Kyiv to leave Ukraine.
On the data front, the U.S.’ fourth-quarter GDP, pending home sales and core durable goods orders are due on Thursday."

(Reuters) -U.S. department store Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) may soon receive a second takeover offer as private equity firm Sycamore Partners prepares to make a bid only days after a consortium backed by activist investment firm Starboard Value proposed buying the company, three sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Sycamore Partners has reached out to Kohl's about a potential offer that would value the company around $9 billion, one source said. The firm is willing to pay at least $65 a share in cash for the company, the source said.
The news comes two days after Acacia Research, which is backed by Starboard, offered to pay $64 a share for Kohl's, confirming a Reuters report last week that Acacia had reached out to the company to express its interest in a takeover.
There are no guarantees that Sycamore Partners will make a bid or that a deal will be reached with either Sycamore or Acacia, the sources said. Bloomberg first reported Sycamore's interest on Sunday and the Wall Street Journal reported the Acacia bid on Friday.
Representatives for Sycamore, Acacia and Kohl's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Sycamore's interest in Kohl's illustrates investors ongoing interest in retailers and the troubles that brick and mortar retailers are facing as the pandemic has largely prompted customers to shift buying habits in favor of online retailers. 
Kohl's has been facing pressure from activist investors to perform better for roughly a year and their ongoing unhappiness has become more visible in the last weeks after the company's share price climbed only 5% in the last year.
Last week activist investment firm Macellum Advisors, which owns 5% of Kohl's stock, told the company to explore strategic options, including a sale, and warned it planned to nominate directors to its board. Late last year activist firm Engine Capital also said it wants Kohl's to consider a sale. 
Macellum's fresh pressure comes less than a year after it, along with two other activists, reached a settlement that saw Kohl's add three new directors to the board. Macellum called 2021 ""another lost year"" at Kohl's and criticized the stock price's 22% drop from April through last week.

Kohl's said last week its ""strategy is producing results"" and management and the board ""refuse to be distracted"" from delivering stronger results for all investors.
Sources said Acacia and Starboard, one of the industry's most respected and busiest activist investors, would likely work with Oak Street Real Estate Capital to try and sell off Kohl's real estate holdings to raise additional capital for a transaction. Kohl's has historically been opposed to sale-leasebacks of its real estate.

(Reuters) - Trian Partners, Nelson Peltz's activist hedge fund, has built a stake in Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc, ratcheting up the pressure on the consumer goods maker, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
Trian and Unilever declined to comment.
The Financial Times, which earlier reported the development, said that the people with knowledge of the stake building had not provided details on the size of the New York-based hedge fund's stake in the British group or when it began.
Trian is known for proposing operational fixes at its portfolio companies, often through white papers. It presents itself as a partner that can offer constructive advice rather than the corporate raider intent on breaking companies apart. 
In 2018, Trian called https://reut.rs/3nPwfUc for a slew of changes in the consumer goods company Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co. Peltz was then added to the board of the company, following a months-long proxy fight - the biggest ever involving a U.S. company at the time.
The company subsequently met some of the activist hedge fund's demands and announced new financial targets. Peltz stepped down from the board last year. 

The strategy of Unilever - maker of brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise - has come under the investor microscope after the group this month effectively abandoned its 50 billion pound ($68 billion) pursuit of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s consumer healthcare business. 
Some analysts have said the proposed mega-deal, which would have been one of the largest ever on the London market, had been unexpected and raised questions about Unilever's plan under Chief Executive Alan Jope for a more gradual shift away from lower-margin goods to health, beauty and hygiene products.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2022 09:20PM ET</span>",Hong Kong’s financial sector faces talent crunch as expats head for the exit,"By Scott Murdoch and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Late last year, Tania Sibree quit her well-paid job as a financial services lawyer in Hong Kong and returned to Australia rather than live a moment longer with the city's strict coronavirus restrictions.
Sibree, who said she had enjoyed the previous five years in Hong Kong, is one of hundreds – possibly thousands – of foreign expatriate professionals who have left or are planning to leave, threatening to dent the city's standing as one of the world's financial hubs. 
""The hotel quarantine made it just so tough for people to travel and that was the big incentive to being in Hong Kong, it was close to home and my parents. But you cannot do that long in hotel quarantine with kids,"" she said. ""Everyone had been thinking the restrictions would be lifted, it would get better and it would not go on for so long."" 
Hong Kong has only had about 13,000 coronavirus infections out of a population of 7.4 million, much lower than most places in the world. But the Chinese territory is following Beijing's ""zero-COVID"" policy rather than adapting to life with the virus. 
It has had stiff quarantines in place for two years, and last year introduced some of the strictest entry rules in the world, allowing only residents to return to the city and mandatory hotel quarantine of up to three weeks for arrivals from most countries, regardless of vaccination status, paid for by the travellers themselves. 
However, ""zero COVID"" is no closer – 140 new infections were reported in Hong Kong on Sunday - and there are no signs of the government easing those restrictions. As a result, more expats are thinking of leaving, and global banks, asset managers and corporate law firms are facing up to many of their staff exiting after annual bonuses are paid out in the first three months of the year, headhunters and industry executives told Reuters. 
""The summer in Hong Kong will be the time when many people will throw in the towel and think to themselves 'This is just untenable',"" one capital markets investment banker said, on the condition of anonymity. ""As a banker right now you're much better off being based in Singapore. You can travel, and once or twice a year you could bite the bullet and come to Hong Kong and do the quarantine if you need to.""
More than 40% of members recently surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said they were more likely to leave Hong Kong, with most citing international travel restrictions as the leading factor.
""For the fastest growing sector of wealth and asset management there is a lack of trained supply of talent. If draconian travel restrictions continue for an undefined and lengthy period, the talent issue will become all the more serious,"" said Tara Joseph, president of the chamber. ""Many in the industry also expect that eventually many jobs in the sector will be taken up by mainland Chinese talent, leading to a big talent shift.""
Hong Kong's government has played down any looming talent crunch. It said fighting the coronavirus was its top priority, for the good of the whole city, and that it was investing in talent to counter any loss of expertise or any damage to its status as a global financial hub. 
    ""We believe that Hong Kong will continue to bring together talents from local and international sources,"" a government spokesman said. ""The government will continue to promote diversified development in the financial sector, foster local talents and attract foreign talents in various aspects to tie in with the long-term development of the Hong Kong economy.""
RUSH FOR THE DOORS
Hong Kong’s population declined 1.2% between mid-2020 and mid-2021, with more than 75,000 people leaving the city, according to Hong Kong’s Census and Statistics Department. Since September, Hong Kong has had five months of consecutive net outflow in travel, immigration department data shows. 
Meanwhile, the total number of visa applicants from all countries under the 'general employment policy' fell by a third last year to 10,073. Applicants for the financial services sector were down 23%.
""The proposition of bringing people into Hong Kong is not happening,"" said John Mullally, regional director, southern China and Hong Kong financial services at headhunter Robert Walters.
    ""The only people willing to do it are the international or very senior executives or very young people without families,"" he told Reuters. ""When you look at the city, the financial services talent pool is definitely getting smaller.""
Rival Asian hub Singapore is the main beneficiary of that, said Christian Brun, chief executive of recruitment firm Wellesley.
""We will start to see more senior banking executives based in Singapore. Many people given the choice would now prefer to base themselves there,"" he said. ""We have seen that already with hedge funds and private equity and we will see it with banking too."" 
Some financial industry executives and officials take a more sanguine view, saying Hong Kong will continue to be attractive for Chinese companies and wealthy individuals as long as its low tax rate, rule of law and market freedom remain intact.
""Some of the kind of international vibe we have in the city will change. It will continue to boom, but it will be more with Chinese characteristics,"" Kenneth Gaw, president of Gaw Capital Partners, said at a conference earlier this month. 
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de facto central bank, said it was aware of pandemic-related challenges facing financial institutions, but said they should be ""transitory"" and that the fundamentals underpinning Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub would remain strong.
Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission said the number of licensed firms and individuals operating in the city had continued to grow through the end of last year, which it said underscored its attractiveness.
Nevertheless, many expats are not waiting to see how things unfold.
One financial analyst at a global research group who has called Hong Kong home for more than five years told Reuters he has been waiting for the city's international borders to open so he can see his family and friends.

But with no sign of a change, he said he has decided to move back to the United States in the second quarter.
""Basically, we need to see our families and there is no end in sight to travel restrictions, no roadmap or plan,"" he said. ""Eventually you quit waiting and realize moving is the only option.""

The investment firm, run by Jason Aintabi, is urging Peloton to sell itself to a company like Disney, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) or  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), one of the sources said. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported Blackwell's campaign against Peloton.
A representative for Blackwells declined to comment and Peloton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Peloton's fortunes have been fading for some time as its customers began shifting away from its classes when gyms reopened and other companies offered rival products.
But the trouble mounted very recently. Last week its stock price tumbled 24%, wiping away $2.5 billion in value, after CNBC reported https://cnb.cx/3FVT27l that Peloton was temporarily halting the production of its bikes and treadmills amid lower demand.
Foley wrote to his employees that ""layoffs would be the last lever (the company) would ever hope to pull but that it is evaluating the structure and size of the team and that it was ""considering all options as part of our efforts to make our business more flexible.""

The company is scheduled to release earnings on February 8 and Foley said more details would be announced then.
Blackwells has successfully pushed for change at companies including Colony Capital (NYSE:DBRG) and posted very strong returns during the early part of the pandemic when many activists were nursing losses.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Add another notch on ""Spider-Man: No Way Home's"" long list of box office achievements. 

Over the weekend,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s comic book adventure became the sixth-highest grossing movie in history with $1.69 billion at the global box office (not adjusted for inflation). It passed ""Jurassic World"" ($1.67 billion) and ""The Lion King"" ($1.66 billion) to secure that spot. 
Now in its sixth weekend of release, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" returned to the No. 1 slot in North America, adding $14.1 million between Friday and Sunday, along with $27.7 million overseas. The superhero epic, starring Tom Holland as Marvel's neighborhood web-slinger, opened in December and has generated $721 million at the domestic box office and $970.1 million internationally. 
Outside of the United States, where ""No Way Home"" ranks as the fourth-biggest movie ever, Spidey's latest adventure has done especially well in the U.K. -- Holland's birthplace -- amassing $116 million to date. Other top-earning territories include Mexico with $73.4 million, South Korea with $60.6 million and France with $59.9 million. It's notable that ""No Way Home"" has managed to shatter records and smash expectations without playing in China, which is the world's biggest moviegoing market. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Expectations of rising interest rates are bolstering the shares of regional banks, as a tumble in technology stocks pushes investors to search for assets that could thrive amid higher yields and tighter Federal Reserve policy. 
The SPDR S&P Regional Banking (NYSE:KRE) ETF was up 2% year-to-date on Friday afternoon, compared to a 6.6% decline for the S&P 500. Gains in some individual bank stocks have been even more eye-catching: Shares of Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) Group Inc are up 8.4% for the year to date, while shares of KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) are up nearly 9%. 
Regional banks make a hefty chunk of their revenues from net interest margins, boosting their appeal as investors increasingly expect the Fed to hike interest rates more aggressively this year to control inflation. The central bank meets next week and is expected to raise interest rates as soon as March. [L4N2TZ0GW][L4N2TQ2J1]
Treasury yields have risen in anticipation of tighter policy, with those on the benchmark 10-year Treasury up 40 basis points from recent lows. 
At the same time, some investors expect the expanding U.S. economy and reduced fiscal stimulus to boost loan growth, helping regional banks post full-year 2021 earnings growth of 70.1%, the seventh-fastest among the 126 subsectors in the S&P 500, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
""If you want to play the yield curve steepening, then the best way to do that is through regional banks,"" said Moustapha Mounah, assistant portfolio manager at James Investment, who has been increasing his stake in companies such as SVB Financial Group. 
Though investors expect regional banks broadly to benefit from rate increases, the pace at which the Fed tightens monetary policy could be key. A too-steep trajectory of rate increases may hurt economic growth and eventually weigh on bank earnings, Mounah said, though such an outcome is not his base forecast. 
Fed funds futures traders are fully pricing in a 25 basis point hike in March, in addition to three more rate increases by year-end.
In addition to next week’s Fed meeting which concludes on Wednesday, investors await earnings from Zions Bancorp, which is expected to release its latest quarterly results Monday, followed by  First Bancorp  (NASDAQ:FBNC) on Tuesday and  United Bankshares  (NASDAQ:UBSI) Inc and Merchants Bancorp (NASDAQ:MBIN) on Wednesday. 
The pace of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes will directly affect revenues in the sector, said Gary Tenner, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co. Tenner recently added two more expected rate hikes of 25 basis points to his valuation models for regional banks, bringing his total to four through the end of 2023, he said. 
""The impact of higher interest rates is potentially more positive for estimates and returns for regional banks"" than so-called universal banks, which also have income from investment banking, he said. Banks in the S&P 500 are up 0.4% so far in 2022. 
Besides a too-quick pace of rate hikes, regional bank shares could suffer if a stock selloff that has already pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory accelerates further, raising expectations that the Fed will raise rates at a slower pace to avoid destabilizing markets. [L1N2TZ2JG]
""There's still this debate in the share price about how much the Fed is going to raise and how fast. If the Fed backpedals then the rally we've been seeing here may slow,"" said Steve Comery, a research analyst at GAMCO Investors. [L1N2TZ2JG] 

Brady Gailey, managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, believes even two or three rate hikes would be enough for the sector to post above-market earnings growth as loan growth accelerates. He upgraded the regional bank sector to overweight in September. 
""They are set to be a big beneficiary of higher rates, but there are other fundamentals that the sector has going for it, too,"" he said.

277,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2022 07:45AM ET</span>",Heydemann on course to become first woman to lead Orange -sources,"By Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) -Orange, France's biggest telecoms operator, is on course to name Christel Heydemann as its new chief executive, making her the first woman to lead the former monopoly amid a revamp of its governance, two sources said on Sunday. 
Few women hold top executive roles at France's biggest listed companies. Heydemann would become the third CEO of the Paris CAC 40 blue-chip index, after Engie's Catherine MacGregor and Estelle Brachlianoff, who is slated to take the reins of utility group Veolia on July 1. 
The board of Orange, on which Heydemann has sat since 2017, is scheduled to meet on Friday to formally appoint her as the new boss, the sources close to the matter added. 
Heydemann currently heads European operations at French electric equipment group Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN). She was not immediately available for comment on Sunday. 
A graduate of France's elite engineering school Polytechnique, Heydemann, 47, will replace Stephane Richard at the helm of the state-controlled group after a court convicted him of complicity of misuse of public funds.
Richard, who has led Orange for the past 12 years, denies any wrongdoing.
The Orange board meeting was formally scheduled on Monday, but was postponed to Friday to solve some issues such as the date when Heydemann would formally take over and a potential temporary extension of Richard's operational role, the sources said. 
Richard was initially slated to quit the group on Jan. 31. His role as chairman remains to be filled, as the split of chairman and CEO positions is part of the governance revamp. 
Heydemann's name has been circulating for days in the French press and presented as the favoured candidate of France's finance ministry, which holds sway over the governance of Orange, in which the state owns a combined 23% stake. 
France's weekly JDD was first to report Heydemann's likely appointment at a board meeting on Friday. 
The new Orange boss will take the reins of the company as it keeps on deploying the new generation of internet mobile networks and broadband fibre optic infrastructure - capital-heavy investments that have pressured its margins as its two biggest markets, France and Spain, remain highly competitive. 
The group is deemed strategic by the government and scrutinised by the finance ministry and the Elysee Palace, an important factor to take into account for any new CEO willing to embark in a transformative deal. 

Orange has managed to stabilise its revenues after the arrival of Iliad's low-cost Free Mobile in France in 2012 triggered a price war, and it has expanded its activities in West Africa, Poland, Romania as well as in cybersecurity and banking services. 
But its recent financial underperformance, especially in Spain where it had to cut staff, has disappointed investors, with shares now trading at a price that is about a third lower than five years ago.

BERLIN/ROME (Reuters) - Germany's flagship carrier Lufthansa is in talks to buy a 40% stake in state-owned Alitalia's successor ITA Airways, two people familiar with the negotiations said on Sunday, following a newspaper report that a deal could be unveiled next week.
The talks about a tie-up between Germany's partly state-owned Lufthansa and ITA Airways are still ongoing with all outcomes possible, one of the sources said on condition of anonymity, adding the stake price was still under negotiation.
The second source said Lufthansa and ITA were in talks over a 40% stake sale, but it could take longer than a few days to reach a comprehensive deal.
A Lufthansa spokesperson declined to comment, but reiterated an earlier statement that the German carrier was open to the possibility of a partnership with ITA.
An ITA spokesperson, when asked for comment by Reuters on a potential investment by Lufthansa, did not mention Lufthansa but said that the airline's top management would present a strategic plan to the company's board on Jan. 31. A data room would then be opened in the following days, he added, allowing a potential bidder or partner to have access to key financial documents to assess the value of the company.
Italian daily Il Foglio reported on Saturday that the two companies could present a deal on a 40% stake next week as they were very close to agreeing over some key terms, such as the role of Rome's Fiumicino airport as a hub for direct flights to Africa and some routes to the Americas.
Sources told Reuters on Jan. 12 that the Italian carrier was in contact with Lufthansa, British Airways and United States-based Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) for an equity partnership, adding that formal talks could start by the end of March.
Delta said on Jan. 13 it has no plans to invest in ITA.
The German government currently holds 14% of Lufthansa shares following a bailout at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and aims to sell its stake by October 2023 at the latest.
The group was saved from bankruptcy by Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Belgium with 9 billion euros ($10.21 billion) in financial support approved by the European Commission.

A German economy ministry spokesperson declined to comment.
A deal with ITA would be subject to approval by the European Union's competition watchdog.

Pfizer/BioNtech's COVID-19 vaccine has shown to be effective against severe disease and death caused by the heavily-mutated Omicron variant but less effective in preventing transmission.
With cases soaring, some countries have expanded COVID-19 vaccine booster programmes or shortened the gap between shots as governments scramble to shore up protection.
In an interview with Israel's N12 News, Bourla was asked whether he sees booster shots being administered every four to five months on a regular basis. 
""This will not be a good scenario. What I'm hoping (is) that we will have a vaccine that you will have to do once a year,"" Bourla said. 
""Once a year - it is easier to convince people to do it. It is easier for people to remember. 
""So from a public health perspective, it is an ideal situation. We are looking to see if we can create a vaccine that covers Omicron and doesn't forget the other variants and that could be a solution,"" Bourla said. 
Bourla has said Pfizer could be ready to file for approval for a redesigned vaccine to fight Omicron, and mass produce it, as soon as March.

Citing three studies, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday that a third dose of an mRNA vaccine is key to fighting Omicron, providing 90% protection against hospitalization.
A preliminary study published by Israel's Sheba Medical Center on Monday found that a fourth shot increases antibodies to even higher levels than the third but was likely not enoughto fend off Omicron. Nonetheless, a second booster was still advised for risk groups, Sheba said.

Sources told Reuters earlier this month that Boulben was one of three people on a shortlist of possible candidates. The others are Orange's Chief Financial Officer Ramon Fernandez and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN)'s head for Europe, Christel Heydemann, who also sits on Orange's board.
Le Figaro wrote that Heydemann ""seemed on track to succeed Stephane Richard"" but that a board meeting to decide on the post has been moved from Monday to Jan. 28. 
Earlier this month, financial daily Les Echos reported that finance minister Bruno Le Maire favoured Heydemann for the post.

The French state has a 23% stake in Orange and has the final say on who runs the firm. 
Orange, France's biggest telecoms operator, said in November it would find a successor to its Chairman and CEO Stephane Richard by Jan. 31 after a Paris appeal court convicted him of complicity of misuse of public funds.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2022 07:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Vodafone and Iliad in talks to combine Italian units - sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Elvira Pollina
LONDON (Reuters) - Telecom firms Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and Iliad are in talks to strike a deal in Italy that would combine their respective businesses in a bid to end cut-throat competition in the euro zone's third-biggest economy, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Discussions between the two companies are ongoing and both parties are actively studying ways to clinch a tie-up of their respective businesses in Italy, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Iliad, which will make its wireline broadband debut in Italy on Jan. 25, is working with investment bank Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) on its strategic plans in Italy, one of the sources said, cautioning that a deal was not certain.
If successful, a deal would create a telecoms powerhouse with a mobile market penetration of about 36% and combined revenues of nearly 6 billion euros ($6.80 billion).
Iliad and Vodafone declined to comment while Lazard was not immediately available for comment.
Iliad, led by billionaire founder Xavier Niel, has been reviewing options to further expand in Italy in recent months as it seeks to take advantage of deal fever in Italy's telecoms industry to accelerate consolidation and cease a price war that has been slashing its margins, the sources said.
The discussions come as incumbent  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) is still assessing a 10.8 billion euro ($12.25 billion) takeover approach from U.S. fund KKR aimed at taking Italy's biggest phone group private.
Niel, who founded Iliad in 1990 and sits on KKR's board as an independent board director, wants to play kingmaker in the fragmented Italian telecoms market where he started an aggressive price war in 2018 when Iliad made its first foray in Italy.
Industry executives have repeatedly urged to pursue four-to-three telecoms mergers that could unlock cost synergies and lift margins by cutting the existing number of mobile operators in Italy, namely TIM, Vodafone, WindTre and Iliad.
Iliad's Italy boss Benedetto Levi said on Jan. 13 that the French firm was open to buying a rival operator.
""If a company, as a whole or in part, becomes available on the market we will consider it without any preconception,"" he told financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore.
Previously, Vodafone's boss Nick Read said on Nov. 17 that consolidation was needed in Europe, particularly in Italy, Spain and Portugal where ""all players are suffering.""
HURDLES
Vodafone has annual revenue of about 5 billion euros in Italy and a 28.5% market penetration among mobile phone customers, according to Italy's communications watchdog AGCOM.
Iliad is instead much smaller with its Italian unit reporting 674 million euros in annual revenue in 2020 and a mobile market share of about 7.7%, according to AGCOM. But the company has fared well during the pandemic, with third quarter sales up 21% to 207 million euros in 2021.
Any tie-up between the two firms would need to win the blessing from both Rome - which sees the country's telecoms infrastructure as an asset of strategic interest - and European antitrust regulators who ruled against previous merger attempts in Europe including Three's takeover of Britain's O2 in 2016, one of the sources said.
Iliad itself was allowed to enter Italy as part of the remedy package that Vimpelcom and Hutchison negotiated with European regulators to combine their Italian mobile operations in 2016 without altering the number of existing players.

Last year, Niel made a 3.1 billion euro offer for full control of Iliad and subsequently delisted the company from the Paris stock market, signalling his intention to turn the group into a ""leading telecommunications player in Europe.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government said on Friday it would suspend 44 China-bound flights from the United States by four Chinese carriers in response to the Chinese government's decision to suspend some U.S. carrier flights over COVID-19 concerns.
The suspensions will begin on Jan. 30 with Xiamen Airlines’ scheduled Los Angeles-to-Xiamen flight and run through March 29, the Transportation Department said.
The decision will cut some flights by Xiamen, Air China (OTC:AIRYY), China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA).
Since Dec. 31, Chinese authorities have suspended 20 United Airlines, 10 American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and 14 Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) flights, after some passengers tested positive for COVID-19. As recently as Tuesday, the Transportation Department said the Chinese government had announced new U.S. flight cancellations.
Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said Friday the policy for international passenger flights entering China has ""been applied equally to Chinese and foreign airlines in a fair, open and transparent way."" 
He called the U.S. move ""very unreasonable"" and added ""We urge the U.S. side to stop disrupting and restricting the normal passenger flights"" by Chinese airlines.""
Airlines for America, a trade group representing the three U.S. carriers affected by China's move along with others, said it supported Washington's action ""to ensure the fair treatment of U.S. airlines in the Chinese market.""
The Transportation Department said France and Germany have taken similar action against China’s COVID-19 actions. It said China's suspension of the 44 flights ""are adverse to the public interest and warrant proportionate remedial action."" It added that China's ""unilateral actions against the named U.S. carriers are inconsistent"" with a bilateral agreement.
China has also suspended numerous U.S. flights by Chinese carriers after passengers later tested positive.
The department said it was prepared to revisit its action if China revised its ""policies to bring about the necessary improved situation for U.S. carriers."" It warned that if China cancels more flights, ""we reserve the right to take additional action.""
China has all but shut its borders to travelers, cutting total international flights to just 200 a week, or 2% of pre-pandemic levels, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in September.
The number of U.S. flights being scrapped has surged since December, as infections caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus soared to record highs in the United States.

Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In August, the U.S. Transportation Department limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights.
Before the recent cancellations, three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers were operating about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 per week before the pandemic.

People in the USW familiar with the matter said BP has put forward proposals in local negotiations at its U.S. refineries to require waiting periods of up to 120 days between the expiration of a contract and the possible start of a strike.
“BP's position at local tables attacks the National Oil Bargaining Program,” the union said in a message to members and seen by Reuters. “Pipeline & refinery locals stand together to fight back!”
A BP spokesperson declined to discuss the details of proposals in contract negotiations.
“BP is negotiating in good faith with the United Steelworkers union to improve the competitiveness of our business and create a sustainable future for all,” said company spokesperson Cameron Nazminia. 
A union spokesperson was not immediately available to discuss the USW’s message. 
Since 1966 the union has at many refineries won a common expiration date for refinery and chemical plant contracts. The common date raises the possibility workers will strike at multiple plants simultaneously, as happened in 2015, during the last nationwide strike.
""We're standing the line,"" said a union source, who described the BP proposals as taking refineries off the common contract expiration date, allowing the company to ""influence the contract behind the scenes.""
While not changing the formal expiration date, the 120-day no strike period changes the date in practice, potentially reducing the power of collective action available to the USW with a common expiration date.
One company that has used no-strike or so-called labor peace periods is  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), which locked out 650 workers at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery nearly nine months ago, following a 75-day no-strike period.
""We don't believe Exxon is the best example to follow,"" a union source said. 

The USW is negotiating a new national agreement for 30,000 U.S. refinery and chemical plant workers with Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), the industry’s lead negotiator.
At the same time, USW local unions are negotiating site-specific issues with plant managers.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union on Friday pressed General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Mexican officials to step up efforts to ensure workers at a pick-up truck plant in central Mexico can vote freely next month to choose a new union. 
The election will allow some 7,000 workers at the plant in the city of Silao to choose among four new unions in line with a Mexican labor reform aimed at ensuring freedom of association, a key tenet of a new trade deal with the United States and Canada. 
A vote last year on the collective contract was initially marred by irregularities including destroyed ballots, prompting the U.S. government to demand ramped-up scrutiny in a formal complaint under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Workers eventually voted to dissolve the contract, opening the door to elect a new union.
UAW President Ray Curry, whose group represents U.S. GM workers, said labor inspectors should be immediately sent to Silao to ensure the plant is ""free from coercion and intimidation"" ahead of the vote on Feb. 1 and 2. 
For decades, workers at companies across Mexico have often faced intimidation tied to contentious union votes and efforts to organize.
Curry's remarks echoed similar concerns in recent days from U.S. labor federation AFL-CIO, Canadian union Unifor and Italian metalworkers union FIOM.
""We are concerned by the lack of protection for workers' rights inside the GM plant,"" the AFL-CIO said this week.

GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
U.S. officials in September closed the GM complaint about last year's vote, but the U.S. Department of Labor and the office of the U.S. Trade Representative are still tracking the issue, noted a report this week from a U.S. government labor committee.

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Intel Corp said on Friday it would invest up to $100 billion to build potentially the world's largest chip-making complex in Ohio, looking to boost capacity as a global shortage of semiconductors affects everything from smartphones to cars.
The move is part of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger's strategy to restore Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s dominance in chip making and reduce America's reliance on Asian manufacturing hubs, which have a tight hold on the market.
An initial $20 billion investment - the largest in Ohio's history - on a 1,000-acre site in New Albany will create 3,000 jobs, Gelsinger said. That could grow to $100 billion with eight total fabrication plants and would be the largest investment on record in Ohio, he told Reuters.
Dubbed the silicon heartland, it could become ""the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet,"" he said.
While chipmakers are scrambling to boost output, Intel's plans for new factories will not alleviate the current supply crunch, because such complexes take years to build.
Gelsinger reiterated on Friday he expected the chip shortages to persist into 2023.
To dramatically increase chip production in the United States, the Biden administration aims to persuade Congress to approve $52 billion in subsidy funding.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday the House of Representatives would soon introduce a bill on competitiveness to help bolster semiconductor investment and supply chains. That would include the $52 billion funding https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pelosi-says-us-house-will-soon-introduce-competitiveness-bill-2022-01-21.
U.S. President Joe Biden touted Intel's investment on Friday at a White House event with Gelsinger and again made the case for congressional action.
""China is doing everything it can to take over the global market so they can try to out compete the rest of us,"" Biden said.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at the event the current semiconductor supply chain is ""far too dependent on conditions and countries halfway around the world.""
Gelsinger said without government funding ""we're still going to start the Ohio site. It's just not going to happen as fast and it's not going to grow as big as quickly.""
THE CHIP FEAST AND FAMINE
Intel ceded the No. 1 semiconductor vendor spot to Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd in 2021, dropping to second with growth of just 0.5%, the lowest rate in the top 25, data from  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) showed. 
As part of its turnaround plan to become a major manufacturer of chips for outside customers, Intel broke ground on two factories in Arizona in September. The $20 billion plants will bring the total number of Intel factories at its campus in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler to six. 
Gelsinger told Reuters he still hoped to announce another major manufacturing site in Europe in coming months.
It is not just Intel ramping up investments. Rivals Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co or TSMC also have announced big investment plans in the U.S. And that's raising questions about a glut in chips going forward.
""We still have years in front of us before we're even having a semblance of supply demand balance,"" said Gelsinger. ""Ask yourself what portion of your life is not becoming more digital.""
""Yes, the industry is growing, and maybe the metaverse solves world hunger for the semiconductor industry. But there is a big bubble coming,"" said Alan Priestley, an analyst at Gartner. 
U.S.-CHINA TECH WAR
The U.S. build up comes as a tech war between the U.S. and China is causing a decoupling of certain technologies, such as chips. Companies looking to sell technologies to China are considering basing outside of the U.S. to avoid being snagged by U.S. export control rules. China is also investing heavily in its semiconductor manufacturing capacity.
While Gelsinger also touted the security and economic benefits of boosting U.S. chip production on Friday, Bloomberg reported in November that the Biden administration pushed back against a prior plan by the company to boost silicon wafer production in China over national security concerns. 
Intel has drawn fire for its decision to delete references to Xinjiang from an annual letter to suppliers after the chipmaker faced a backlash in China for asking suppliers to avoid the sanctions-hit region.
When asked about it in a briefing last month, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she could not comment on the company specifically, but said ""American companies should never feel the need to apologize for standing up for fundamental human rights or opposing repression,"" reiterating a call to industry to ensure that they are not sourcing products that involve forced labor from Xinjiang and urging companies to oppose China's ""weaponizing of its markets to stifle support for human rights."" 

Intel's Ohio investment is expected to attract partners and suppliers. Air Products (NYSE:APD), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), LAM Research and Ultra Clean Technology have shown interest in establishing a presence in the region, Intel said. 
Construction of the first two factories is expected to begin late in 2022 and production in 2025.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes ended sharply lower on Friday as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares plunged after a weak earnings report, capping a brutal week for stocks that saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq log their biggest weekly percentage drops since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020.
The benchmark S&P 500 posted its third straight week of declines, ending 8.3% down from its early January record high.
Losses also deepened for the Nasdaq after the tech-heavy index earlier in the week confirmed it was in a correction, closing down over 10% from its November peak. The Nasdaq has now fallen 14.3% from its November peak and on Friday closed at its lowest level since June. 
Netflix shares tumbled 21.8%, weighing on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, after the streaming giant forecast weak subscriber growth. Shares of competitor Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) fell 6.9%, dragging on the Dow, while  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) also slid 9.1%.
""It has really been a continuation of a tech rout,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management. ""It’s really a combination of a rotation out of technology as well as very poor numbers from Netflix that I think is the catalyst for today.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 450.02 points, or 1.3%, to 34,265.37, the S&P 500 lost 84.79 points, or 1.89%, to 4,397.94 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 385.10 points, or 2.72%, to 13,768.92. 
For the week, the S&P 500 fell 5.7%, the Dow dropped 4.6% and the Nasdaq declined 7.6%. 
The Dow fell for a sixth straight session, its longest streak of daily declines since February 2020.
The S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average, a key technical level, for the first time since June 2020.
""When markets get like they've gotten this week, the emotion is what takes over,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. ""Until it finds support, no one's going care about anything fundamental.""
Stocks are off to a rough start in 2022, as a fast rise in Treasury yields amid concerns the Federal Reserve will become aggressive in controlling inflation has particularly hit tech and growth shares. 
Investors are keenly focused on next week's Fed meeting for more clarity on the central bank's plans to tighten monetary policy in the coming months, after data last week showed U.S. consumer prices in December had the largest annual rise in nearly four decades.
“Between the Fed meeting and earnings, there is a lot that the market could be worried about next week,” said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among the large companies due to report next week in a busy week of earnings results.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.34-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and 24 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 13 new highs and 1,029 new lows.
About 14.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) may soon face claims from a U.S. labor board that it unlawfully fired a vocal union supporter at a New York warehouse in the midst of an organizing campaign.
A National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) official in Brooklyn recently found that claims involving the worker, Daequan Smith, had merit and plans to issue a complaint against Amazon unless the company settles the case, board spokeswoman Kayla Blado said in an email on Friday.
The development was first reported by Bloomberg. 
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A new complaint against Amazon would fuel claims by labor organizers and advocacy groups that the company uses unlawful tactics to thwart unionizing while placing profits over worker safety. 
In November, a NLRB official found that Amazon unlawfully interfered with a union election at an Alabama facility in which workers overwhelmingly voted against unionizing. The results of a second election will be tallied at the end of March. 

Smith worked at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York, that is the subject of a more recent election petition by a group of employees. A fundraising campaign launched on Smith's behalf in November says he was left homeless after his firing. 
The NLRB has the power to reinstate workers who are fired for engaging in union activities and to compensate them for lost work, but cannot grant other types of money damages.

OAKLAND, Calif./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Corp’s plan to build a $20 billion chip-making complex on the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio is the clearest sign of a burgeoning tech sector in the U.S. Midwest, a development that is sure to raise corporate competition for workers and resources.
The Intel investment is the state's largest ever, but the Columbus suburb of New Albany, where Intel will build two chip factories, already has seen an influx of data centers, including from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
Just last August, Google raised its investment in New Albany by $1 billion.
""Facilities like (the Intel factories), all of these jobs are high skilled jobs,"" said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo speaking at the announcement in Ohio. ""All of this manufacturing at every level, not just the PhDs, require some amount of training,"" she added, calling for more apprenticeship programs.
The first two Intel chip factories will create 3,000 jobs, and the company plans as many as eight factories over time. It has committed $100 million to work with Ohio universities and community colleges for building up a workforce in the chip industry.
While other rust belt centers have suffered over the decades, Ohio’s state capital Columbus with Ohio State University and six Fortune 500 companies, including Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), has fared well. 
In addition, it has been an early winner in the build up of the logistics and warehousing industry thanks to its location near the important interstate highway 70 that cuts across the U.S.

Ample water and stable power resources were also key to winning the deal as Intel needs enormous natural resources, though it has said it aims to be powered 100% by renewable energy and achieve net positive water.
""Ohio for years has been saying we have an abundance of water and that would be a strength for industry in this country. And it came in as an advantage here for us,"" said JP Nauseef, president of JobsOhio, which was instrumental in bringing the Intel investment to the state.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 05:38PM ET</span>",Qatar releases video of scarred jets in Airbus dispute,"(Adds details, repercussions of dispute)
By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -Qatar Airways took a spiralling $4 million-a-day dispute with Europe's Airbus to social media on Friday, publishing a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKN0SpWeILo&feature=youtu.be of the scarred exterior of grounded A350 jets that the airline said underscored ""serious and legitimate safety concerns.""
The two companies have been locked for months in a dispute over deterioration to paint and anti-lightning protection on the long-haul jets, which Airbus has acknowledged needs attention while insisting it does not put safety at risk.
Qatar Airways hit back with the first official images of jets grounded by its national regulator in a bid to keep the spotlight on technical matters after Airbus accused the state-owned airline of engineering the dispute to obtain compensation.
The dispute has led to the grounding of 21 planes out of 53 A350s operated by Qatar Airways and cast a pall over the airline's preparations for the World Cup later this year. The airline says it needs planes to accommodate thousands of fans.
It has also prompted Qatar Airways to exclude Airbus from a multi-billion-dollar deal to replace almost three dozen freighters, which is expected to go to rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) and could help bolster ties with Washington in an upcoming visit.
Qatar Airways is pressing for compensation of $618 million plus $4 million a day and halted taking new A350 deliveries. Airbus has said it will fight the claim in full.
In the video lasting just over a minute and a half released on YouTube, Qatar Airways showed rows of defects on the skin of some of the A350s grounded by the country's regulator.
Airbus had no immediate comment on the video.
Airbus has said there is ""no reasonable or rational basis"" for the groundings, which have not happened elsewhere.
VIDEO EVIDENCE
The clip showed areas of peeling or missing paint, cracks and damage to anti-lightning protection, as well as what the airline described as patches of carbon-fibre that were exposed to moisture and potentially damaging ultra-violet light.
The lightweight carbon-fibre jetliner relies on metallic foil embedded beneath the paint to help lightning wash safely over the fuselage, which is less conductive than earlier metal.
Lightning strikes jetliners about once a year.
The video showed flakes of the copper-mesh anti-lightning system, which is supposed to be fixed to the plane with resin, coming loose when paint was teased away by a gloved hand.
The images echoed damage to A350s first revealed in pictures exclusively https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/costly-airbus-paint-flaw-goes-wider-than-gulf-2021-11-29 published in a Reuters investigation last November.
The investigation showed that at least five other airlines had reported A350 paint or skin flaws since 2016, well before Qatar raised concerns in November 2020 when an attempt to repaint a jet in World Cup livery exposed some 980 defects.
""We continue to strongly believe that Airbus must undertake a thorough investigation of this condition to conclusively establish its full root cause,"" Qatar Airways said.
Airbus has said that it is looking at changing the design of anti-lightning mesh for future A350s, but insists there is adequate backup lightning protection. It says Qatar is undermining global protocols by seeking leverage over safety.
The question of whether a ""root-cause analysis"" exists is part of a UK court case due for a hearing in late April. 
Airbus says it has provided the relevant information and concluded that there is no airworthiness risk, a view echoed by Europe's air regulator.

The jet video capped 24 hours of intense exposure for the usually secretive aviation world after Airbus took the rare step of revoking a separate Qatar order for smaller A321neos.
Qatar Airways indicated it would fight the move, saying it was upholding all its current contracts. The jet has been a major success for Airbus which faces problems in keeping up with demand. ""The opportunity cost to Airbus (of cancelling) is zero; it may even be convenient,"" said consultant Bertrand Grabowski.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup has told staff in the New York Tri-State area to start returning to the office from Feb. 7, while BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) is targeting the same date for U.S. staff after recently postponing its return-to-office plans by nearly a month due to the Omicron variant. 
Wall Street firms were among the first to encourage staff to return to offices, but a winter wave of COVID-19 infections driven by Omicron has forced many to rethink https://www.reuters.com/business/corporate-america-revamps-back-to-office-plans-omicron-threat-2022-01-11 their plans and review their vaccination policies in recent weeks.
""With what happened with Omicron, we wanted to go back into a more conservative mode. So we only have people in the office if there's a business critical need for them to be in,"" said Kevin Abraszek, head of HR change and transformation at BNP Paribas in New York.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which sent staff at its New York metro area office home in mid-December as Omicron spread, has asked staff to prepare for a return to the office starting on Feb. 7, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. 
In other locations, return-to-office plans are still on pause and the bank will continue to monitor the data, the same person said. Staff will be expected to be in the at least two days a week, as was its policy before the holidays.
Citigroup said this month U.S. employees who had not been vaccinated against COVID by Jan. 14 would be placed on unpaid leave and fired https://reut.rs/3AiL3jk at the end of the month unless they were granted an exemption and accommodation. 
BNP Paribas, which employs nearly 14,000 people in the United States, will expect U.S. employees to work at least one day a week in the office once they return, similar to its policy late last year before Omicron struck.
A bank spokesperson said the return to office policy applied only for investment banking employees, not for employees of BNP Paribas' U.S. retail arm, Bank of the West. 
Abraszek said vaccination against COVID-19 was a requirement to be in the office, but the bank was allowing employees who have not been vaccinated to continue working from home.
""I think we're going to continue to look at that decision and that policy in the early part of this year,"" he said.
The bank plans to bring capacity back up to 50% gradually once employees start to return, said Abraszek.

""We were generally skewing around 25% to 30% late last year,"" he said. ""We'll probably reach that level and then our hope is that over the course of the spring, and certainly into the summer, that we will get closer to that 50%.""

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Risk aversion dominated markets on Friday as stocks slumped on Wall Street and in Europe, oil prices fell from seven-year highs earlier in the week and bond prices surged with traders scurrying for the relative safety of government debt.
Poor subscriber growth reported late Thursday at Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) sent its shares plunging 21.8% and cast a pall over a market already shaken by concerns the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy too aggressively to fight inflation.
Investors are waiting for details from the Fed's policy meeting next week on how it will proceed at a time that inflation is such a hot political issue it could force a more hawkish stance.
Data, however, won't begin to show an expected slower pace of rising consumer prices for at least a few months, making Fed Chair Jerome Powell's job more difficult as he tries to calm markets. 
""We know the Fed is beginning to pivot and the problem is that the inflation numbers are not going to start to trend lower until later this spring,"" said Andrew Slimmon, a managing director at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management.
Despite the negative Netflix earnings, it's too early to know whether corporate fundamentals won't continue to be strong, he said.

""By the time we get to the second rate hike, everything will be rolling over enough that everybody will back off from these calls,"" he said. ""The growth numbers will be slowing much more quickly than the Fed anticipated.""
U.S. Treasury and euro zone government bond yields fell as concerns about potential conflict in Ukraine also dented risk appetite and stock market drops increased demand for the debt.

Markets overnight in Asia were broadly lower, including in China where benchmark mortgage rates were cut on Thursday in the latest move to prop up an economy soured by its property sector.
The U.S. dollar edged lower with U.S. Treasury yields, with investors looking to next week's Fed meeting for more clarity on the outlook for rate hikes and quantitative tightening.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.138% to 95.627. The yen was last down 0.40% at $113.6300. The euro was last up 0.30 percent at $1.1344, 
Oil prices slid for a second day, pressured by an unexpected rise in U.S. crude and fuel inventories while investors took profits after global oil benchmarks touched seven-year highs.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Three U.S. studies show that a third dose of an mRNA vaccine is key to fighting the Omicron coronavirus variant, providing 90% protection against hospitalization due to COVID-19, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday.
The studies, led by the CDC, are among the first in the United States to look at the impact of booster doses against the fast-spreading Omicron variant, which now accounts for 99% of all new COVID cases.
Overall, they suggest that boosters helped protect against both infection and symptomatic disease. Adults aged 50 and older saw the most benefit from an extra dose of the vaccines made by BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
""Protection against infection and hospitalization with the Omicron variant is highest for those who are up to date with their vaccination, meaning those who are boosted when they are eligible,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a White House briefing on Friday. 
As has been shown in other countries, vaccine boosters performed better against the Delta variant than Omicron, a highly mutated version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has been able to evade immunity from vaccines and prior infections.
One of the studies, published on Friday https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e3.htm?s_cid=mm7104e3_w in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, looked at rates of hospitalization, emergency department and urgent care visits in 10 states between Aug. 26, 2021, and Jan. 5, 2022. 
It found that protection from two doses of vaccine fell to 57% in people who got their second shot at least six months earlier. Among those who received a booster, protection from hospitalization and urgent care visits was 90%.
In another study https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788485#:~:text=Conclusions%20and%20Relevance%20Among%20individuals,compared%20with%20test-negative%20controls published in the JAMA medical journal, researchers reviewed data on 23,391 COVID-19 cases caused by either the Delta or Omicron variant among people seeking testing between Dec. 10, 2021, and Jan. 1, 2022.
They found that among people seeking testing for COVID-like symptoms, those who had received three doses of an mRNA vaccine had the highest protection from infection compared with those who got two doses or were unvaccinated. 
Because of the timing of U.S. booster recommendations, most people in the study had been vaccinated within a month of seeking testing, which likely contributed to the benefit.
Data from the UK has shown that the increased antibody protection gained from boosters wanes after 10 months, so it is unclear how long that benefit would hold.
Some countries have already started offering additional booster doses, but a recent study https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-study-shows-4th-shot-covid-19-vaccine-not-able-block-omicron-2022-01-17 from Israel showed that while a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine boosted antibodies, the level was not high enough to prevent infection by the Omicron variant. 
Early enthusiasm for boosters in the United States has been lackluster, fueled in part by rapidly shifting public health messaging and concerns among some experts over a lack of U.S. data demonstrating their benefit. 

There is also the misguided perception among some Americans that if you can still get infected, why bother with a booster? 
According to the CDC, only 82.5 million, or 39.3%, of fully vaccinated Americans have received a COVID-19 booster dose.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -A group of employees at an Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) studio that works on the ""Call of Duty"" franchise said on Friday that they had formed a union and would seek voluntary recognition from the company, signaling organized labor's first foothold at the video game giant.
The union, supported by the Communications Workers of America, represents 34 people in the quality assurance department at Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Software.
Activision said it was considering the matter. Workers could also seek to hold an election supervised by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). 
Activision's stock has been battered in recent months as the company faces multiple accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct, and on Tuesday  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced plans to acquire the company https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-faces-challenge-cleaning-up-activision-blizzards-culture-2022-01-20. 
As criticism of Activision Blizzard's culture has mounted in recent months, workers have banded together to influence the company's future, including staging a walkout and circulating a petition calling for the removal of Chief Executive Bobby Kotick. 
Unionization has emerged as a goal for some, and workers in other parts of Activision Blizzard are also signing union cards, said Jessica Gonzalez, a former Activision employee, as well as a current employee who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
""I hope that we are able to serve as inspiration and to help guide other parts of Activision Blizzard ... that want to follow in our footsteps,"" said Onah Rongstad, a quality assurance tester at Raven.
Activision Blizzard said in a statement that it is ""carefully reviewing"" the request for voluntary recognition. 
""While we believe that a direct relationship between the company and its team members delivers the strongest workforce opportunities, we deeply respect the rights of all employees under the law to make their own decisions about whether or not to join a union,"" the company said.
If Activision Blizzard does not voluntarily recognize the union, workers plan to seek to hold an election sponsored by the NLRB, Rongstad said.

Workers on Raven's quality assurance team began striking in December after learning that 12 of their colleagues had been laid off, Rongstad said. 
By forming a union, the workers hope to gain more of a say in decision-making at the company as well as help set their working conditions. QA testers at Raven work up to 50- to 60-hour weeks when deadlines are looming, Rongstad said.

WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors and a joint venture with LG Energy Solution are to set announce investments of more than $6.5 billion next week in Michigan in new electric truck and battery plants, according to a state document and sources briefed on the matter. 
The Michigan Strategic Fund said Friday https://www.michiganbusiness.org/48f644/globalassets/documents/msf-board/meeting-agendas/msf_expandedagenda_january-25-2022.pdf it plans to consider at a Tuesday board meeting GM's and the Ultium Cells joint venture's plans to invest $6.5 billion and add 4,000 jobs at sites in Lansing and Orion Township.
In December https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-eyes-3-billion-investment-michigan-ev-plants-source-2021-12-10, Reuters reported that GM had proposed building a $2.5-billion battery plant near Lansing with LG Energy Solution adding 1,700 jobs. The two companies are expected to split the cost.
GM also is expected to invest at least $4 billion in Orion Township to build versions of the new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra electric pickup trucks, sources said. A significant plant expansion is expected to be completed by 2025.
The automaker also is planning electric versions of its heavy-duty pickups, but they are not likely to be built at the expanded Orion plant, one of the sources said.
GM announced in January 2021 plans to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. The company confirmed this month it also plans to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new heavy-duty vehicles by 2035.

GM said in a statement Friday it appreciates the support ""related to two prospective projects that GM is considering in Orion Township and Lansing. Until these projects receive final approval, we have no comment on potential announcement timing.""
GM announced in June it would boost electric and autonomous vehicle spending to $35 billion through 2025, a 30% jump over its prior forecast.

Google said in its court filing that the states failed to show that it illegally worked with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), now Meta, to counter ""header bidding,"" a technology that publishers developed to make more money from advertising placed on their websites. Facebook is not a defendant in the lawsuit.
The states had also alleged that Google used at least three programs to manipulate ad auctions to coerce advertisers and publishers into using Google's tools.
Google responded that the states had a ""collection of grievances"" but no proof of wrongdoing. On some allegations, Google argued the states waited too long to file its lawsuit.
""They criticize Google for not designing its products to better suit its rivals' needs and for making improvements to those products that leave its competitors too far behind. They see the 'solution' to Google’s success as holding Google back,"" the company said in its filing.
Google asked for four of the six counts to be dismissed with prejudice, which means that it could not be brought back to the same court.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said they would press on with the fight. ""The company whose motto was once 'Don't Be Evil' now asks the world to examine their egregious monopoly abuses and see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil,” he said in a statement.

The Texas lawsuit had two other claims based on state law and made against Google which were stayed in September. The search giant did not ask for them to be dismissed on Friday but may in the future.
The lawsuit is one part of a long list of antitrust investigations and federal and state litigation against the Big Tech platforms.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 02:53PM ET</span>",KKR's bid target Telecom Italia appoints veteran manager Labriola CEO,"By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) on Friday appointed veteran manager Pietro Labriola as chief executive, in a move that could complicate a takeover approach by U.S. private equity firm KKR. Labriola, who has run TIM's Brazilian operations for the last three years, was promoted to general manager in November, when former CEO Luigi Gubitosi was ousted following a string of profit warnings.
In leaving his role, Gubitosi had urged TIM to give KKR access to its books, a decision which is still pending as TIM is yet to take a stance on the bid.
Labriola's nomination was promoted by TIM's largest investor, French media giant Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), which has criticised KKR's offer saying it doesn't adequately value TIM.
Growing doubts over the chances of KKR's offer, which requires backing from both TIM and Italy's government, this week drove TIM shares down 7% to 0.4193 euros - further below the bid's price of 0.505 euros a share.
Labriola secured unanimous approval from directors, including a representative for state investor CDP.
CDP is TIM's second-biggest shareholder and favours a merger of TIM's fixed-network assets with those of state-owned fibre optic rival Open Fiber.
""My goal is to ... maximize the value of our assets in the interest of all our shareholders,"" Labriola said in a statement.
""The challenges and opportunities ahead will require cohesion among all stakeholders.""
Labriola is already at work on a plan to overhaul TIM that would serve as a benchmark for the board to weigh against KKR's proposal. 
Under a preliminary version https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/telecom-italia-gm-outline-plans-doubts-kkrs-bid-mount-2022-01-18 presented to directors this week, Labriola has proposed splitting TIM's fixed network operations from its services businesses, sources have said.
Such a move would pave the way for the merger of TIM's fixed network assets with those of Open Fiber, as advocated by CDP, while making a scenario in which KKR takes control of the group less likely.
KKR, which owns 37.5% of TIM's last-mile network, could still be involved in the revamp of the group's fixed assets, a person close to the matter said.
CDP, which owns 60% of Open Fiber, would likely emerge as a major stakeholder in any combined network venture with TIM, securing state oversight of an asset Italy deems of strategic relevance for the country.
Any government decision on how to address TIM's situation is on hold in Rome ahead of next week's presidential election. 
TIM's board meets again on Jan. 26 to approve the guidelines of Labriola's new plan before a final vote on March 2.
Under pressure for years in its hyper-competitive home market, debt-laden TIM needs to upgrade its network to meet Italy's digital goals.
Under Labriola's plan, the ""NetCo"" comprising TIM's infrastructure assets would focus on its wholesale-only business. It would include submarine cable unit Sparkle, while assuming a significant portion of the company's debt and staff, sources have said.
Vivendi, which last month reversed its long-standing opposition to TIM's handing over control of its prized network infrastructure, could then focus on TIM's retail service businesses, which include video content platform TimVision, one of the sources said.

Separately on Friday, TIM's Brazilian unit said it expected to name a new CEO in the coming days.

""Shell (LON:RDSa) announced the Board's decision to change its name to Shell plc on December 20, 2021. This change has now taken effect,"" Shell said in a filing.
The London and Amsterdam stock exchanges will reflect the name change on Jan. 25 while the New York Stock Exchange will follow on Jan. 31. 
The change will not affect share ownership and the A shares and B shares will remain unchanged for the time being, Shell said.
The shares are planned https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2021/shell-sets-out-expected-timetable-of-simplification.html to be assimilated into a single line of ordinary shares on Jan. 29.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus on Thursday raised the stakes in a dispute with major customer Qatar Airways over grounded and undelivered A350 jets by announcing it had revoked a separate contract for 50 smaller A321neo jets the airline plans to use for new routes.
The move widens a dispute that moved closer towards a rare courtroom clash on Thursday, with a procedural hearing over Qatar's claim for more than $600 million in compensation over A350 flaws pencilled in for the week of April 26 in London.
Airbus revealed it was walking away from the contract for A321neos in skeletal arguments presented during a scheduling session over the A350 dispute at a division of Britain's High Court on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said.
""We confirm we did terminate the contract for 50 A321s with Qatar Airways in accordance with our rights,"" an Airbus spokesman said following a filing setting out provisional arguments, reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
Qatar Airways is expected to fight the A321neo contract's termination, having said it plans to take delivery of the jets even though it is refusing to take more A350s until a dispute over surface erosion on the larger planes has been resolved.
The airline said in a court filing that it was ""working through the practical consequences"" of the A321 decision, adding that Airbus was not entitled to declare a ""cross-default"" on the basis of Qatar's refusal to take more A350s in the main dispute.
Qatar Airways had no immediate comment on the A321neo contract, which has its roots in an order 10 years ago worth $4.6 billion at list prices, originally for a smaller version.
Qatar Airways has said the A321s will help it launch flights to new markets where there is currently not enough demand for larger aircraft, but which are out of reach of smaller A320s.
Qatar's first A321neo is due to be delivered in February 2023, according to the airline filing. Industry experts say the hot-selling model can easily be resold, in contrast with a drop in demand for big jets like the A350, worsened by the pandemic.
GROUNDING DISPUTE
The two companies have been locked in a row for months over A350 damage including blistered paint, cracked window frames or riveted areas and erosion of a layer of lightning protection.
Qatar Airways says its national regulator has ordered it tostop flying 21 out of its 53 A350 jets as problems appeared,prompting a bitter dispute with Airbus which has said that whileit acknowledges technical problems, there is no safety issue.
Qatar Airways is seeking $618 million in compensation for the 21 grounded jets plus $4 million a day as the row drags on. The A321 development could increase that claim.
The Gulf carrier is also asking British judges to orderFrance-based Airbus not to attempt to deliver any more of thejets until what it describes as a design defect has been fixed.
Airbus has said it will ""deny in total"" the complaint and has accused Qatar Airways, once one of its most highly courted customers, of mislabelling the problem as a safety concern. 
It has indicated it will argue that state-owned Qatar Airways influenced its regulator to ground the jets to win compensation, while Qatar Airways has questioned the design and accuses Airbus of failing to produce studies, the people said.
Qatar Airways has said its local regulator is independently driving safety decisions and cannot evaluate the airworthiness of the affected jets without a deeper analysis from Airbus.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency, which is responsible for the overall design but not the locally regulated airworthiness of individual planes in service, has said it has not so far found safety problems with A350s that it inspected.

Qatar is so far the only country to ground some of the jets. 
But a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/costly-airbus-paint-flaw-goes-wider-than-gulf-2021-11-29 in November revealed at least five other airlines had discovered paint or surface flaws since 2016, prompting Airbus to set up an internal task force before the Qatar row, and to explore a new A350 anti-lightning design.

The German lender said mBank had made provisions regarding the foreign currency indexed loan agreements in the amount of 2.006 billion zloty ($504 million), adding that its fourth-quarter results would be impacted by a corresponding amount.
The additional sum, which translates to around 436 million euros, brings provisions for Germany's No. 2 bank to around 600 million euros. 
The provision is painful for Commerzbank, which is in the midst of a costly restructuring that involves cutting headcount by 10,000 people and closing branches.
The issue, which has affected banks operating throughout Poland, stems from more than a decade ago, when mortgage customers took out loans in Swiss francs https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polands-supreme-court-evacuated-due-bomb-threat-twitter-2021-05-11 to take advantage of low Swiss interest rates, only to face far higher costs when the value of the Polish zloty slumped. 
Polish courts have been deciding how the loans can be treated, including what banks can charge in interest for the loans, creating uncertainty for banks and their bottom lines.
The German lender's Frankfurt-listed shares were down 3.5% after the announcement.

Commerzbank had attempted to sell mBank but abandoned the effort after an auction petered out in 2020.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 01:45PM ET</span>",How a Russian-Ukraine conflict might hit global markets,"LONDON (Reuters) - A potential invasion of Ukraine by neighbouring Russia would be felt across a number of markets, from wheat and energy prices and the region's sovereign dollar bonds to safe have assets.
Below are four charts showing where a potential escalation of tensions could be felt across global markets: 
1/SAFE HAVENS
Inflation at multi-decade highs and impending interest rate rises have made for a bad month for bond markets, but an outright Russia-Ukraine conflict could change that.
Two-year U.S. Treasury yields have seen the biggest monthly jump since 2016 and 10-year rates appeared headed for the key 2% level. In Germany, 10-year yields rose above 0% for the first time since 2019. 
A major risk event usually sees investors rushing back to bonds, which represent the safest assets on planet and this time may not be different, even if a Russian invasion of Ukraine risks further fanning oil prices -- and therefore inflation. 
""Clearly if the Ukraine story was to go wrong there would be quite a significant bid for Treasuries, and this notion of the 10-year getting to 2% would be put on hold,"" said Padhraic Garvey, regional head of research, Americas at ING.
Other safe-havens include gold, already at two-month peaks as well as the yen. 
(Graphic: 'Safe haven' prices as Ukraine tensions build, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdvzyklegpw/One.PNG) 
2/ GRAINS AND WHEAT
Any interruption to the flow of grain out of the Black Sea region is likely to have a major impact on prices and add further fuel to food inflation at a time when its affordability is a major concern across the globe following the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Four major exporters - Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan and Romania - ship grain from ports in the Black Sea which could face disruptions from any military action or sanctions. 
Ukraine is projected to be the world's third largest exporter of corn in the 2021/22 season and fourth largest exporter of wheat, according to International Grains Council data. Russia is the world's top wheat exporter.
""Geopolitical risks have risen in recent months in the Black Sea region, which could influence wheat prices ahead,"" said Dominic Schnider, strategist at UBS. 
(Graphic: Soaring food prices fuel inflation pressures, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpomagzlpd/Soaring%20food%20prices%20fuel%20inflation%20pressures.PNG) 
3/ NATURAL GAS AND OIL
Energy markets are likely to be hit if tensions turn into conflict. Europe relies on Russia for around 35% of its natural gas, mostly coming through pipelines which cross Belarus and Poland to Germany, Nord Stream 1 going directly to Germany, and others through Ukraine.
In 2020 volumes of gas from Russia to Europe fell after lockdowns suppressed demand and did not recover fully last year when consumption surged, helping to send prices to record highs.
As part of possible sanctions in the case Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany has said it could halt the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia that was expected to increase gas imports to the bloc but also underlines Europe's energy dependence on Moscow.
SEB commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said markets would see natural gas exports from Russia to Western Europe likely significantly reduced both through Ukraine and Belarus in the event of sanctions and gas prices revisit Q4 levels. 
Oil markets could also be affected. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said the tensions risked a ""material spike"" in oil prices and noted that a rise to $150 a barrel would reduce global GDP growth to just 0.9% annualised in the first half of the year, while more than doubling inflation to 7.2%.
(Graphic: European gas prices hit record highs in December, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znvnelrqxpl/European%20gas%20prices%20hit%20record%20highs%20in%20December.PNG) 
4/ REGIONAL DOLLAR BONDS AND CURRENCIES
Russian and Ukrainian assets will be at the forefront of any markets fallout from potential military action. 
Both countries' dollar bonds have underperformed their peers in recent months as investors trimmed exposure amid escalating tensions between Washington and its allies and Moscow. 
Ukraine's fixed income markets are chiefly the remit of emerging market investors, while Russia's overall standing on capital markets has shrunk in recent years amid sanctions and geopolitical tensions, somewhat cushioning any threat of contagion through those channels. 
However, Russia's rouble and Ukraine's hryvnia have also suffered, making them the worst performing currencies in the emerging markets universe so far this year. 
Geopolitics on the Ukraine-Russian border presented ""substantial uncertainties"" to foreign currency markets, said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING.

""The events of late 2014 remind us of the liquidity gaps and U.S. dollar hoarding that led to a substantial drop in the rouble at that time,"" said Turner.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 01:36PM ET</span>",Serbian government blasts green groups for scuttling Rio's lithium project,"By Aleksandar Vasovic
BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbian politicians on Friday blasted environmentalists for forcing them to scuttle Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Plc's proposed $2.4 billion lithium project, warning the move could hurt efforts to grow and diversify the Balkan country's economy.
Environmentalists, though, having scored a victory after the government bowed to pressure and revoked Rio's lithium exploration licences on Thursday, are now demanding a moratorium on lithium mining before expected elections in April to ensure the decision is not reversed afterwards. 
Zorana Mihajlovic, Serbia's mining and energy minister, said late on Friday that Belgrade acted to fulfil the requests by various green groups to halt the Jadar lithium project, but accused them of injecting politics into environmental issues. 
""The government showed it wanted the dialogue ... (and) attempts to use ecology for political purposes demonstrate they (green groups) care nothing about the lives of the people, nor the industrial development,"" Mihajlovic told reporters. 
The country's populist ruling coalition, led by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), has come under fire for backing lithium and copper mining, eroding the comfortable majority won in a 2020 vote.
The decision is a major setback for Rio, which was hoping the project would help make it one of the world's 10 biggest producers of lithium. China is the world's largest consumer and processor of the metal, and various European countries have been working to boost their own output.
Rio last month said it would buy a second lithium asset for $825 million in Argentina, as it looks to build its battery materials business.
The European Battery Alliance, a network of electric vehicle supply chain companies formed by Brussels, said the Jadar project ""constituted an important share of potential European domestic supply."" Serbia is not a member of the EU, though it hopes to join the bloc in coming years.
""It would have contributed to support the growth of a nascent industrial battery-related ecosystem in Serbia, contributing to a substantial amount to Serbia's annual GDP,"" the alliance said in a statement. 
Rio's shares in Australia closed down 4.2% on Friday. While in London, Rio's shares ended down 2.2%. 
Thousands of Serbians blocked roads in protests against the government's backing of the project in recent months, demanding Rio leave the country and forcing the local municipality to scrap a plan to allocate land for the facility.
More protests are scheduled for Saturday in the town of Loznica in western Serbia where the mine was to be built, said Ljiljana Bralovic, one of the protest leaders.
""We want not only to see Rio Tinto out (of Serbia), we also want a permanent ban on the exploitation of lithium and borates,"" Bralovic said. 
Aleksandar Jovanovic Cuta, another protest leader, said green groups would prevent any future government's attempt to negotiate a new deal with Rio Tinto after the elections.
""Anyone who tries to do that is crazy, all of Serbia would pour to the streets,"" he said.
SUPPLY SHORTAGE
On Thursday, Rio said it was ""extremely concerned"" by Serbia's decision and was reviewing the legal basis for it.
The Australian government said it regretted Serbia's decision.
Relations between Belgrade and Canberra have soured after Sunday's deportation of Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic from Australia over its COVID-19 entry rules.
Djokovic spoke out in support of ""clean air"" in a December Instagram story post captioning a picture of the anti-mining protests, which was published by The Bridge, a digital sports platform. 
Rio has already spent $450 million in pre-feasibility, feasibility and other studies on Jadar to understand the nature of the deposit, the company said in a project fact sheet in July.
""The level of opposition to it has really ratcheted up over the last six months,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Saul Kavonic said of the Jadar mine. 
""We've been highlighting for a while now there would be about $2 a share at risk if the government cancels it."" 
At full capacity, the Jadar mine was expected to produce 58,000 tonnes of refined battery-grade lithium carbonate a year, making it Europe's biggest lithium mine by output.
Experts said the world's shortage of lithium had been forecast to last for another three years at least, but with the cancellation of the Jadar project, the shortfall would be exacerbated.
""We're at the point now where lithium supply is going to set the pace of electric vehicle rollout,"" Kavonic said. 
Robust global demand for the metal far outstripping supply growth has boosted lithium prices in recent years.

Lithium futures, which started trading on the CME in May last year, have jumped 171% to a record high of $38/kg on Thursday, according to Refinitiv data.

“I want other cities and states to be able to make announcements like the one being made here today,” Biden said Friday at the White House, flanked by Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger. “And that’s why I want to see Congress pass this bill right away and get it to my desk.”
The Biden administration has been pushing to bring more chip manufacturing to the U.S. to alleviate a shortage that stems from increased demand and supply chain kinks linked to the pandemic. But there have been few tangible results.
A lack of chips has caused production delays for consumer electronics and automobiles, and led to furloughs. The price for used cars, in large part due to a shortage of chips, continues to be a component of surging inflation.
Biden’s comments came after Intel said Friday it plans to spend $20 billion on a chipmaking hub on the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio, which the company expects to grow to be the world’s biggest silicon-manufacturing site. The plant is expected to be operational by 2025.
“Most semiconductors today are sourced overseas,” Gelsinger said at the White House. “As a country, we cannot rely solely on imports for such essential technology. And the only way to address this economic and security risk is to increase our domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity.”
Even as Biden has taken a hit for all the broader supply-chain troubles across the economy, he has been slow to press for passage of legislation that includes funding for chips. Biden and other officials including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo have signaled the overall need to boost domestic output.
Biden and his administration have had few options to help alleviate the supply crunch. None of the new facilities announced in the last year will solve the problem in the short- or medium-term, and analysts expect the current shortage to last into next year.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. are also expanding their investments in the U.S. The companies are hoping to build the new fabs with funding from the legislation that has stalled in the House, known as the CHIPS Act.
The legislation that includes the chips money passed the Senate with bipartisan support last June. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House is poised to announce its own version of the bill and will soon start the process of reconciling any differences with the Senate proposal.

The U.S. government last week signed a deal with the drugmakers to buy 600,000 more doses of the therapy, sotrovimab, for an undisclosed sum. 
The GSK-Vir therapy has shown more promise against the Omicron variant in lab studies than treatments from major rivals Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN).
""GSK had been planning to introduce another production facility to our manufacturing network in advance of Omicron,"" a GSK spokesperson told Reuters on Friday. 
""The second site provides GSK additional scale and diversity given the pandemic uncertainty."" 
Deliveries of the 600,000 additional doses will be carried out through the first quarter of 2022, the spokesperson said.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that GSK and Vir were expected to make the first deliveries in February. 

The United States is reporting an average of 752,698 new coronavirus infections a day, according to a Reuters analysis of official data, fuelling the urgent need for effective solutions. 
The Biden administration in November signed contracts worth about $1 billion for an unknown number of doses of sotrovimab before the rapid spread of Omicron, and has said it would control the distribution of the drug in the country.

(Reuters) - Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) beat expectations with a rise in fourth-quarter profit on Friday as higher crude and natural gas prices drove demand for the world's largest oilfield services company.
Oil prices surged about 50% last year and are trading at seven-year highs on a COVID-19 vaccine-fueled demand recovery and tight supplies. The global rig count was 1,563 at the end of the fourth quarter, up around 42% from a year ago, Baker Hughes data shows.
""Absent any further COVID-related disruption, oil demand is expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels before the end of the year and to further strengthen in 2023,"" Schlumberger Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said. 
Current market conditions are ""strikingly similar to those experienced during the last industry supercycle"", he added. 
Schlumberger expects 2022 capital spending of between $1.9 billion and $2 billion, versus just under $1.7 billion in 2021, and plans to increase spending in North America by at least 20%, Le Peuch said on a call with investors. 
Schlumberger shares were down 1.75% as Brent oil futures fell about 1.45% to $87.14 a barrel.
Wall Street analysts said the results were positive, with the exception of a decision to keep its dividend flat after the company generated around $1.3 billion in free cash flow for the quarter and $3 billion for the full year 2021. 
""There was an expectation of a dividend raise. I believe they will raise the dividend once the leverage targets are met,"" said James West, a senior managing director with Evercore ISI. 
Schlumberger's fourth-quarter adjusted net income rose to $587 million, or 41 cents per share, above Wall Street estimates of 39 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES. The company beat last year's fourth-quarter earnings of $309 million, or 22 cents per share. 
Fourth-quarter revenue of $6.23 billion also topped analysts' forecast of $6.09 billion.

In North America, strong offshore and land drilling activity and an uptick in exploration data licensing for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Permian Basin drove a 13% sequential jump in revenue. 
Schlumberger also said it sold $109 million in shares of Liberty Oilfield Services (NYSE:LBRT) during the quarter, bringing its stake to 31%. Last year, it closed on the sale of its U.S. fracking business to Liberty in exchange for a 37% equity stake.

The 737 MAX is integral to the Boeing's ability to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic and a safety scandal caused by two fatal crashes.
Hong Kong had temporarily restricted use of the aircraft in 2019 following a deadly plane crash in Ethiopia that claimed 157 lives. 
Airlines that intend to fly the 737 Max in Hong Kong's airspace and to the international airport need to comply with the airworthiness directive from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration or a similarly stringent directive from the country where the plane was registered, said Victor Liu, the director-general of CAD.

The airline must also carry a valid certificate of airworthiness that meets International Civil Aviation Organization standards, the directive added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Volkswagen AG agreed to a $3.5 million settlement with Ohio over claims the German automaker violated state laws by manipulating vehicle computer software in its vehicles to mask carbon dioxide emissions, the state attorney general said.
In November, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s bid to avoid lawsuits filed by officials in three states including Ohio.
Volkswagen's U.S. subsidiary argued that under the Clean Air Act, the landmark U.S. environmental law, only the federal government can pursue emissions claims. VW noted it had already reached a settlement of more than $20 billion with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and owners.
""This agreement fully resolves Ohio’s legacy claims and puts this matter behind the company as we focus on building a future of sustainable mobility,"" VW said Friday.
Texas and two counties in Utah and Florida have pending lawsuits.
The settlement is a fraction of what Ohio had previously sought. VW said in prior court papers that Ohio’s claims could have totaled ""$350 million per day, or more than $127 billion per year, over a multi-year period.""
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said ""the damage to the environment and consumer trust required us to hold Volkswagen accountable and this settlement does that.""
The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the attorney’s general office will split the award settling the 2016 lawsuit.
In 2015, Volkswagen disclosed it had used sophisticated software to evade emissions requirements in nearly 11 million vehicles worldwide. It also misled the EPA, which started asking questions in 2014.

In addition to equipping vehicles with ""defeat devices"" before they were sold, VW also installed software updates after sale, which was the conduct at issue before the Supreme Court and in the Ohio lawsuit.
Ohio's lawsuit said VW software updates allowed the vehicle to be put into ""test"" mode which suspended normal driving operations and reduced emissions only during testing.

The selloff, which began after Netflix and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) posted disappointing quarterly earnings, spread to the wider stay-at-home sector as analysts judged the new Omicron coronavirus variant will not deliver the same economic headwinds seen in the first phase of the pandemic in 2020.
""This a confirmation that the economy is gradually moving towards some sort of normalisation,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.
France will ease work-from-home rules from early February and allow nightclubs to reopen two weeks later, while Britain's business minister said people should get back to the office to benefit from in-person collaboration.
""With a return to the office and travel lanes opening, darlings of the WFH (work from home) thematic are reflecting the growing reality that the world is moving slowly but with certainty towards a new normalcy,"" said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore.
Netflix tumbled nearly 25% after it forecast new subscriber growth in the first quarter would be less than half of analysts' predictions.
The stock, a component of the elite FAANG group, was on track for its worst day in nearly nine-and-a-half years following rare rating downgrades from Wall Street analysts.
""It is hard to have confidence that Netflix will return to the historical +26.5 million net subscriber add run rate post the 2022 slowdown,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.
""The decay rate on streaming content is incredibly rapid. 'Squid Game?' That's so last quarter. 'The Witcher?' Done on New Year's Eve!""
Exercise bike maker Peloton lost nearly a quarter of its value on Thursday, leading at least nine brokerages to cut their price target on the stock.
The selloff erased nearly $2.5 billion from its market value after its CEO said the company was reviewing the size of its workforce and ""resetting"" production levels, though it denied the company was temporarily halting production.
Peloton's shares were up nearly 5% on Friday morning, bouncing back somewhat from a 23.9% drop on Thursday, its biggest one-day percentage decline since Nov. 5. 
HOME DELIVERY
Both companies were part of a group, along with others such as Zoom and Docusign whose shares soared in 2020, and in some cases 2021 as well, as people around the world were forced to stay at home in the face of the coronavirus.
However, thanks to vaccine rollouts and the spread of the less severe Omicron strain of COVID-19, life is returning to normal in many countries, leaving companies like Netflix and Peloton struggling to sustain high sales figures.
According to data from S3 Partners, short-sellers doubled their profits by betting against Peloton in 2021, the third best returning U.S. short.
Direxion's Work from Home ETF has fallen more than 9% in first three weeks of the year, compared to a 6% drop in the fall of the broader U.S. stock market. Blackrock (NYSE:BLK)'s virtual work and life multisector ETF has weakened more than 8% this year.

In Europe, lockdown winners are also going through a rough patch as rising bond yields pressurise growth and tech stocks.
Online British supermarket group Ocado (LON:OCDO), Germany's meal-kit delivery firm HelloFresh and food delivery company Delivery Hero which emerged as European stay-at-home champions in the early days of the pandemic have underperformed the pan-European STOXX 600 so far in 2022.

BERLIN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Intel still intends to develop European chip manufacturing capacity despite the delayed plans being overshadowed by its announcement on Friday of a more than $20 billion investment in two new U.S. semiconductor plants. 
The company said in September it could invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade and announce the locations of two major new European chip fabrication plants by the end of 2021.
Despite missing that deadline, Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that European factory plans were still on the cards and the company would announce the chosen manufacturing sites in coming months.
""We are a say-do company,"" he said. ""I hope that the European Union finishes their chips act and we would hope to follow that shortly with our next major announcement in Europe."" 
The European Chips Act aims to reduce the continent's dependence on Asian suppliers for advanced semiconductors by subsidising the local development of large chip factories. 
The European Commission will propose the legislation in early February, and industry analysts expect it to pass later this year. The matter is pressing as a global chip shortage has forced European automakers to cut production.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been in talks with governments, including in Germany and Italy, as it scouts for a European location and Gelsinger said the U.S. chipmaker still expected to develop a multi-fabrication site.
""Beyond that we haven't quite sized our dimensions exactly, how big or bold we are going to be at this point in time,"" he added.
Intel on Friday laid out plans to build a massive new manufacturing site near Columbus, Ohio, planning to invest up to $100 billion to make it potentially the world's largest chip-making complex.
 Gartner  (NYSE:IT) chip analyst Alan Priestley said that with the Ohio site, pressure on Intel to locate a site in Europe could have reduced.

Germany tops the list of potential hosts with the local governments of Penzing in Bavaria and Magdeburg and Dresden in eastern Germany trying to tempt Intel. The mayor of Penzing told Reuters in December that he had not heard back from the company.
Ondrej Burkacky, a senior partner at McKinsey said any additional capacity would need to start being built out now as it can take three to four years for a chip factory to reach a significant output level.

(Reuters) -The World Health Organization on Friday recommended extending the use of a reduced dosage of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5 to 11 years old.
The recommendation comes after the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunisation held a meeting on Wednesday to evaluate the vaccine. It is currently recommended for use in people aged 12 years and above.
The recommended dosage for the younger population is 10 micrograms instead of 30 micrograms offered to those 12 years and older.
""This age group (5-11) is in the lowest priority use group for vaccination except, for children who have co-morbidities,"" SAGE chairman Alejandro Cravioto said at a briefing.
Pfizer/BioNTech shots have already been authorised for use in the age group in several countries including the United States, Canada, Israel, and the European Union.
The WHO's vaccine director, Kate O'Brien, said no safety concerns were raised for application of Pfizer's vaccine in 5 to 11 years old in clinical trials.
The panel also recommended that booster doses of Pfizer's vaccine should be administered 4 months to 6 months after the completion of the primary series, in high-priority groups like older adults and health workers.
Countries with moderate to high vaccination rates should prioritise available vaccine supply to first achieve high booster dose coverage in higher risk groups before offering vaccine doses to lower risk groups.
""Increase in booster dose coverage for high risk priority groups will usually yield greater reduction in severe disease and deaths than use of equivalent vaccine to increase primary vaccination coverage,"" Cravioto added.
Cravioto said the revised roadmap for prioritisation for COVID vaccines took into account the increasing availability of vaccines, current coverage and the circulation of variants of concern.

The panel said the recommendation for use of Pfizer's booster dose was only for certain priority groups and that it was not endorsing ""unfettered"" use in all ages.
""We simply don't have evidence yet on the need for or the evidence on the performance of boosters (in children below 12 years of age),"" O'Brien said.

Peiter Zatko, a famed hacker more widely known as ""Mudge,"" was appointed head of security in 2020 after Twitter suffered a security breach that allowed hackers to tweet from verified accounts for public figures including billionaire Bill Gates and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. 
The New York Times first reported Zatko's departure and Rinki Sethi's upcoming departure as CISO earlier on Friday. Zatko and Sethi could not be immediately reached for comment.

Investing.com — Shares of streaming service Fubotv Inc (NYSE:FUBO) fell more than 7% Friday after Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin slashed her price target.
The analyst cut the price target on Fubo's shares to $15 from $60 but maintained a buy rating.
""We lower our FUBO 12-month PT to $15 from $60. Notably, even though we raised our 2022 rev estimate 3 times during 2021, FUBO shares fell 36%, despite the S&P 500 rising 27%,"" stated Martin.
The analyst said all of their price targets are based on discounted cash flows and that ""considering the consensus view that the Fed will raise interest rates 4x in 2022 for a total of 100 basis points, we raise our WACC (weighted average cost of capital) assumptions, which lowers our 12-month price targets. 
""The changes to our DCF cause us to lower our FUBO price target to $15, largely because 85% of FUBO's total DCF value sits in its estimated terminal value,"" concluded Martin."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Four Belarusian government officials have been charged in the United States with aircraft piracy for diverting a Ryanair flight last May to arrest a dissident Belarusian journalist who was on board, U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday.
The charges announced by the U.S. Department of Justice escalate the global uproar over the May 23, 2021, forced landing in Minsk of the Ryanair flight and detention of the journalist Roman Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend.
Belarus already has faced a wave of sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, from the United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada over the diverted flight, which U.S. authorities said was targeted by a false bomb threat.
Four U.S. citizens were among the approximately 132 passengers and crew members aboard the flight, prosecutors said.
The defendants were charged in a one-count indictment alleging conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy on a plane where a U.S. national was aboard, violating U.S. federal law.
The Belarus embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Thursday's charges against the Belarusian officials provide one of the most detailed accounts yet of how the fake bomb threat allegedly was used to force Ryanair flight 4978 to land in Minsk so that Protasevich could be arrested.
The diversion was directed by the head of Belarus' state aviation authority, Leonid Mikalaevich Churo, and a state security official identified as FNU LNU, according to prosecutors, who used acronyms for unknown first and last names.
Also named were Churo's deputy, Oleg Kazyuchits, and FNU LNU's superior, Andrey Anatolievich LNU.
Lawyers for the defendants could not immediately be identified.
Protasevich, a fierce critic of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, fled the country in 2019 and worked for Nexta Live, a channel on the Telegram messenger app.
Belarusian officials have accused of him being an extremist and inciting social hatred. Protasevich regards the allegations as unjustified political repression.
Protasevich's channel broadcast and helped coordinate huge protests that shook Belarus after Lukashenko claimed victory in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and Western governments alleged was rigged.
Lukashenko denies vote fraud, and says the country is facing unprecedented external pressure after the United States and its allies imposed sanctions.
Thousands of protesters were arrested in a massive crackdown on the opposition, independent media and other groups.
FLIGHT FORCED DOWN
Prosecutors said Churo and FNU LNU arrived at the Minsk air control center before the flight departed Athens for the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, where Protasevich lived, and conveyed the fake bomb threat to air traffic controllers.
The pair allegedly ensured the aircraft would be diverted to Minsk by barring the controllers from alerting authorities in neighboring Ukraine of the alleged fake threat while the flight was in their airspace, the prosecutors said.
Once in Belarusian airspace, the pilots were informed of the alleged bomb, told it would explode if they diverted to Vilnius, and given other information to make the threat appear credible, according to the prosecutors.
FNU LNU, who kept Andrey Anatolievich LNU updated in real time, had an air traffic controller declare a ""code red,"" indicating a credible threat requiring an immediate landing, prosecutors said. 
After landing, the passengers were ordered onto airport buses and detained at the terminal, where Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were led away.
Belarusian officials then began a cover-up, prosecutors said. It included Kazyuchits ordering subordinates to ""create false incident reports,"" including one showing that the fake bomb threat was received at about the time the flight entered Belarusian airspace.
The charge against the defendants carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement said the defendants undermined global efforts to keep the skies safe ""to further the improper purpose of repressing dissent and free speech.""
After being detained in Minsk, Protasevich and Sapega were placed under house arrest.

(Reuters) - Executives at U.S. companies including  Monster Beverage  and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) have stressed on higher costs for everything from labor to raw materials in the last few days, pointing to more price increases as profit margins come under severe strain.
Last year marked the largest annual rise in inflation in nearly four decades, as supply-chain snarls because of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in commodity and freight costs.
The problems have been further aggravated by the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant and staffing shortages across industries.
""We've got inflationary pressures all around,"" Hilton Schlosberg, co-chief executive officer of energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST), said on a recent investor call.
Schlosberg expressed shock at a near 60% surge in the prices of aluminum, used in making drinks cans, over the last year that forced Monster to raise prices. The company is considering another round of price increases in the coming months.
Earlier this month, Slim Jim-maker Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) said it would have to raise product prices further to offset a bigger-than-expected increase in costs. 
With only about 13% of S&P 500 companies reporting quarterly results so far, more corporate warnings on the impact of persistent cost inflation are expected.
""Inflation and supply-chain disruptions will remain a problem in 2022,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi wrote in a client note. ""While some inputs are already coming off their peaks, more meaningful relief will take course over the next couple of years as capacity additions come on."" 
Rising fuel prices and wage increases have also led some U.S. carriers including  American Airlines Group  and United Airline Holdings to warn of pressure on their profit margins in the coming months.
American expects its full-year fuel adjusted cost per available seat mile - an industry standard measure of costs - to be up about 5% compared with 2019.

The surge in raw material and freight costs has forced companies, ranging from clothing and consumers goods providers to automakers, to hike prices in order to cushion the blow to their profit margins.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has raised prices across its portfolio of detergents and cleaning products, and earlier this week said it was expecting higher prices to contribute to a major portion of its sales growth in the second half of the year.

Investing.com – CSX stock (NASDAQ:CSX) recouped some of the losses but was still down 2% Friday as traders chose to focus on the surge in the railroad operator’s fourth-quarter expenses, ignoring that it beat estimates for both revenue and profit.
Expenses of $2.1 billion increased 28% year-on-year owing to higher staff compensation, higher utilization of the locomotive fleet and terminal costs.
The company also recorded $48 million in expenses incurred for premature retirement of debt that was due 2023. Higher fuel prices hurt, too.
CSX carried higher volumes in the quarter as it rode the boom in commodities including minerals, metals, coal, fertilizer and forest products. Demand for its transportation services remained high in a period of crunch as logistics bottlenecks persisted. That helped push quarterly revenue up 21%, to $3.42 billion.
Net profit for the quarter rose 23%, to $934 million, while profit per share of 42 cents was 27% higher on the back of share buybacks during the year.
The company said it is targeting full-year volume growth in excess of GDP growth as volume momentum builds sequentially through the year.
CSX pegged its capex for the year at around $2 billion."

331,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 10:36AM ET</span>",Alzheimer's patient groups protest U.S. Medicare coverage proposal limiting use of new drugs,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Alzheimer's patient groups, disappointed by Medicare's plan to sharply limit coverage of new drugs for the brain-wasting disease, are planning publicity and lobbying campaigns to protest a proposal they say could delay their use for 10 years.
""Congress has to know how bad this will be for patients,"" said John Dwyer, president of Global Alzheimer's Platform Foundation (GAP) advocacy group.
In a preliminary decision https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/future-biogens-aduhelm-hinges-us-medicare-alzheimers-coverage-2022-01-11 last week, the U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), which runs the government health plan for people age 65 and older, said it would cover Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s already approved Aduhelm, and similar Alzheimer's disease treatments in development, only for patients enrolled in approved clinical trials.
That plan would severely limit the number of patients receiving the treatment, undercutting the Food and Drug Administration's accelerated approval of Aduhelm for patients in the early stages of the memory-robbing condition. 
The public disagreement over the drug's use is unusual for the agencies, both part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Alzheimer's Association Chief Executive Harry Johns said Medicare's plan ""usurps FDA's role in drug approvals,"" calling it ""an unprecedented and terrible draft decision."" 
His group, as well as UsAgainstAlzheimer's and GAP - three of the biggest Alzheimer patient organizations - said they plan to fight the decision by appealing to lawmakers, the Biden administration and the U.S. Health Secretary.
The Alzheimer's Association said it is using ""all avenues of communication"" to make its case. 
Biogen is also fighting the decision and in a statement said it is ""supportive of the community in raising their voices on this important issue of access."" 
The Medicare agency could alter its plan before it is finalized in April, but it is unclear what new evidence or facts would cause it to soften its stance. 
""There are only two clinical studies ... There isn't any real-world experience to convince CMS,"" said James Chambers, a researcher at the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. ""They will receive a lot of outrage as opposed to new information.""
Medicare has opened a 30-day comment period with a final decision due by April 11.
""If the (CMS) decision changes, it will be because of political pressure,"" said Raymond James analyst Chris Meekins.
CONTROVERSIAL DECISION
The FDA's June decision https://www.reuters.com/article/biogen-alzheimers-fda-idCNL2N2NP12J was the first approval of an Alzheimer's drug in nearly two decades, but was a controversial one not supported by the agency's outside advisers. It relied on evidence that the drug can reduce amyloid brain plaques, a likely contributor to Alzheimer's, rather than proof that it slows progression of the disease. 
Only one of Biogen's two large-scale trials showed that Aduhelm had an impact on cognition. 
The three Alzheimer's patient groups said Medicare's plan unfairly penalizes people with the disease - probably because there are so many of them and the cost could be enormous.
Aduhelm's price - cut recently to $28,200 from $56,000 per year - sparked concerns about Medicare's budget since Alzheimer's is an age-related disease and around 85% of people eligible for the drug are in the government plan.
The number of Americans with Alzheimer's is expected to rise to 13 million by 2050 from more than 6 million currently. Biogen has estimated that around 1 million would currently be eligible for Aduhelm.
Other companies, including Biogen partner Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, also are pursuing accelerated approval from the FDA for similar medications. 
""This decision was not about Aduhelm alone. This was a decision about drugs still in trials,"" said UsAgainstAlzheimer's chairman George Vradenburg. ""It is stunning preemption.""
Medicare typically pays for FDA-authorized medications, but by law is required to cover only products and services deemed ""reasonable and necessary"" for diagnosis or treatment. 

Vradenburg said his organization is ""communicating with Congress and the Biden Administration"" about its dismay.

332,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 10:18AM ET</span>",A $3.3 Trillion Expiry of Stock Options Adds to Market Jitters,"(Bloomberg) -- Aside from the rout in stay-at-home stocks and gyrations in bonds lurks another key force behind the market turbulence this week: More than $3 trillion of expiring stock options. 
The phenomenon -- generally known as OpEx -- has taken place like clockwork for about a year now. Around the middle of most months, American equities lurch lower, usually near the third Friday -- the day that most stock derivatives expire. 
The dynamic has been blamed on dealers in the options market balancing their exposures by buying and selling underlying stocks or index futures. And this month’s OpEx is a big one.
All told,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). estimates about $3.3 trillion of U.S. equity derivatives are set to expire Friday. That includes roughly $1.3 trillion across single stocks, the firm said. About $1 trillion of S&P 500-linked contracts will run out, and $240 billion in options tied to the world’s largest ETF, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ticker ASX:SPY).
Options are not the only driver of stocks, of course, and there is plenty of uncertainty around their influence. But they may have added to volatility as the likes of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc. slumped on miserable outlooks while the rates-driven rout tightened its grip on pricey growth stocks.
“Today’s expiry could be important for stocks with large open interest in at-the-money (ATM) options,” Goldman strategists including Vishal Vivek wrote in a note. “Market makers’ delta-hedging large options portfolios will be active. This flow is likely to dampen volatility in some names while exacerbating stock price moves in others.”
This OpEx dynamic is far from new, but it’s thought to be growing alongside the boom in options trading. A surge in retail investor participation in the market and rising hedging by institutional pros have spurred an increase in dealer activity.
This dynamic has become so large that some speculate the relationship between stocks and options has been upended, with derivatives now driving the equity market instead of vice versa.
Read more: Options Turn Upheavals Into a Mid-Month Sure Thing for S&P 500
Brent Kochuba, founder of analytic service SpotGamma, observed that last week and earlier this week, the existence of many large in-the-money single-stock call positions had led to a large positive delta skew -- the theoretical value of stock required for market makers to hedge the directional exposure resulting from all options activity. As most of these positions closed, that has contributed to recent market volatility. Now, Friday’s expiration has a relatively flat delta position. 
In other words, dealer exposure is now close to neutral, so the effects of the expiry should ease.
“Call have been closed, puts have been purchased and stock prices have dropped precipitously,” Kochuba said. “As a result of this shift, we think that some of the selling in single stocks may now subside as we head into Wednesday’s FOMC.” 
The process works roughly like this: When an investor buys or sells an option, the other side of that trade is taken up by a market maker. These dealers like to neutralize their exposure, which they do by trading the underlying. 
In the run-up to expiration, depending on where dealers’ overall positions are, they can act as a stabilizing force or a volatility accelerator.
However, it’s a complicated picture, and the exact dynamics depend on the options expiring, new ones created and moves in the underlying assets.
U.S. stocks have already endured a tumultuous start to 2022. 
The Cboe Volatility Index, a measure of expected price swings in the S&P 500 known as the VIX, has jumped about 10 points to 27 points since the start of the month. Investors are adjusting to the prospect of tighter monetary policy by ditching expensive-looking stocks, and those whose expected profits are far in the future.
The three main equity gauges dropped again on Friday morning as of 9:44 a.m. in New York. 
“Is options expiration a contributor to the selloff? Yes. Is it the prime driver? No,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. “The Fed and deleveraging is the reason for the selloff.”

Investing.com – Intuitive Surgical stock (NASDAQ:ISRG) slipped 5% Friday as the healthcare company said Covid resurgences have put pressure on the number of procedures using its da Vinci robotic surgical system.
The company warned that the pandemic impact could continue to linger and affect procedure volumes even as its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat estimates.
The da Vinci surgical systems are designed to help surgeons perform minimally invasive surgery. The systems offer surgeons high-definition 3D vision, a magnified view, and robotic and computer assistance, helping them perform precise dissection and reconstruction deep inside the body.
While the number of procedures using da Vinci systems remain under pressure, the company said it shipped 385 of them, an increase of 18% year-on-year. It closed the year with an installed base of such systems at 6,730.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 17% to $1.6 billion, driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume and system placements.
Net profit for the quarter came in at $477 million, or $1.3 per share, compared with $434 million, or $1.19 per share in the same period a year ago.

338,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 09:48AM ET</span>",Stocks Open Lower as Netflix Reinforces Risk Aversion; Dow Down 80 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday as a warning from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) about slowing subscriber growth sent shockwaves through a tech sector that is already dramatically repricing.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down another 151 points, or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial average was down 80 points, or 0.2%, at 35,636. 
For the Nasdaq, that represents a seven-month low, while the S&P and Dow are at three- and two-month lows, respectively.
For Netflix stock, the morning confirmed the overnight session's worst fears, the streaming giant losing nearly a quarter of its value, or 22.4%, after predicting it will only add a net 2.5 million subscribers worldwide in the current quarter. That's well below both its own previous forecasts, and below the rate at which it was adding subs before the pandemic, something that suggests that the streaming boom of the last two years is over. 
In comparison to some other tech stocks feeling the heat, Netflix at least has some profit to point to. Its earnings of $1.33 a share were comfortably ahead of forecasts. However, they still left the stock trading - as of Thursday's close - at over 45 times trailing 12-month earnings, a painfully high ratio for a company which appears to be having increasing problems with market saturation and competition.
Netflix has now joined the swelling ranks of those companies whose pandemic-era gains have all but completely unwound. The stock hasn't traded this low since April 2020, when streaming appeared to be the one of the biggest beneficiaries from pandemic-driven changes in consumer behavior. 
Those behavior patterns are - to a large degree - starting to revert to normal. Reports on Thursday of a production halt at Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) to clear unsold inventory also sent Peloton stock down by a quarter. A clarification from the company, which still points to widespread cost-cutting and the resizing of its ambitions, helped the stock recover 5.0% in early trading on Friday.
There was better news from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which announced it will build the first $20 billion stage of what could be a multi-plant facility in Ohio, a move that will shorten its supply chains help remove bottlenecks in the semiconductor industry. The confidence implicit in its decision helped Intel stock to a 2.0% gain.
Elsewhere, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) stock also succumbed to some profit-taking despite the oilfield services giant beating expectations with its fourth-quarter earnings and forecasting a ""substantial step up"" in capital spending this year by oil and gas companies, as high prices rebalance the risk-reward outlook for the sector. Schlumberger stock fell 2.0% but is up over 20% since the start of the year.
Crude oil prices remain close to seven-year highs despite slipping in the last 24 hours after fresh data showing that U.S. gasoline stockpiles continued to rise for a third straight week. That, along with jobless claims data on Thursday, suggested the economy is softening slightly due to the current wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19. Most analysts expect that impact to be temporary: in Europe, where the new variant arrived before it reached the U.S., the U.K., France, Ireland and others are loosening restrictions on social distancing, with most countries judging that they are past the peak for infections."

(Reuters) - Global exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew record inflows last year as investors plowed their growing cash balances into the low-cost, transparent investment products.
According to Refinitiv Lipper data, global exchange-traded funds received a record $1.22 trillion in inflows last year, which was about 71% higher than the previous year. Their net assets swelled to a record $9.94 trillion. That still pales in comparison to the assets under management of mutual funds at about $43.8 trillion.
U.S. ETFs were the biggest recipients, receiving $901 billion, while European and Asian ETFs drew about $190 billion and $88 billion respectively.

Alan Kelly, global head of ETF Services at financial services provider Apex Group, said the higher inflows into ETFs were due to their lower expenses, higher returns and transparency, compared with traditional mutual funds.
He added that the emergence of ETFs focused on recent popular themes such as cryptocurrencies, and on environmental, social and governance (ESG) themes would bolster further flows this year. 
Global equity ETFs delivered returns of 14.8%, compared with equity mutual funds' gain of 11.6% last year. Commodity and bond ETFs also surpassed the gains of their mutual fund counterparts last year, according to the data.

""ESG and thematic approaches within index management allow clients to make active investment choices, and give the opportunity for asset managers to express their convictions,"" he said. 
According to Refinitiv data, global ESG ETFs secured $119.4 billion in inflows last year, compared with $79.3 billion in 2020.

The Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF attracted over $40 billion each in net buying in 2021, while SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ASX:SPY) secured inflows of $37.55 billion.

The details of the contract would be made public to the union members after a voting by workers beginning Monday, the union said. 
""You have seven days to return to work. Contact your store manager to be placed on the schedule,"" the union told https:// the workers on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The workers went on a strike on Jan. 12 after rejecting at least two offers from the grocery chain. The union had rejected a $170 million offer made last week by Kroger, which termed it as the ""last, best and final offer"".
The offer proposed wage increases of up to $4.50 per hour depending on job classification and tenure, with the starting rate of pay increased to $16 per hour. The union, however, sought raises of at least $6 per hour for everyone.
Rising COVID-19 infections and inflation have pushed U.S. workers to demand better working conditions and higher pay, with employees at Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co and Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co's cereal plants recently securing better deals after weeks of strike.

The latest deal comes after a lot of difficult negotiation, in which Kroger accused the union of refusing to bargain in good faith, while the union alleged a few King Soopers representatives displayed ""unprofessional"" and ""outrageous"" behavior.
A U.S. court earlier this week had granted King Soopers a temporary restraining order against its striking workers, prohibiting picketing in groups of over 10 people, interfering with anyone within 20 feet of the individual or standing in front of store entrances or vehicles.

Investing.com – Schlumberger stock (NYSE:SLB) fell 1% in Friday’s premarket as traders chose to book profits following the company’s fourth-quarter results.
The shares are just slightly off their year’s high of $38.53 made Tuesday.
Fourth-quarter revenue of $6.2 billion rose 13% year-on-year as record-high prices of crude and gas drove demand for its drilling equipment and services.
Booming economies, supply chain issues, cold weather and geopolitical tension in Europe and West Asia have all combined to keep supplies tight and energy prices high. Oil prices are currently trading at a seven-year high.
""Absent any further Covid-related disruption, oil demand is expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels before the end of the year and to further strengthen in 2023,"" Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch said.
Schlumberger's fourth-quarter adjusted net profit rose to $587 million, or 41 cents per share, easily beating estimates.
The North American business benefited from strong offshore and land drilling activity and increased exploration data licensing in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the Permian.
Schlumberger’s board also approved a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents per share.
Global oil drilling is recovering after rig counts plummeted to record lows in late 2020. Explorers around the globe are expected to almost triple the pace of spending hikes this year compared to 2021, Bloomberg quoted Evercore ISI as saying.
The worldwide rig count was 1,563 at the end of the fourth quarter, compared with 1,104 in 2020, Reuters said, citing Baker Hughes data.

Investing.com – Coinbase stock (NASDAQ:COIN) traded 6% lower in premarket Friday as the world of cryptocurrencies underwent another meltdown.
Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) fell as much as 10% before retracing slightly to trade around $38,519 at 8:20 AM ET (1320 GMT). Ethereum ETH/USD, the second-largest crypto by market cap, lost 12%. Shiba Inu SHIB/USD fell 10% and Dogecoin DOGE/USD 9%.
Global crypto market cap slipped 8.6% to $1.8 trillion, according to Coinmarketcap.com, while trading volumes more than doubled.
The notion of cryptos as a hedge against inflation has been sternly tested in recent weeks. In just over 10 weeks, Bitcoin has lost more than 45% of its value since touching an all-time high of $68,990.6 in November.
The weakness in cryptos comes as yields rise and investors flee riskier assets in preparation for Fed’s first rate hike after the pandemic. So-called growth stocks have tumbled as the pandemic-induced growth tapers and the world adjusts to a normal world. Peloton stock (NASDAQ:PTON), a pandemic-winner, lost nearly a fourth of its value Thursday on reports it might halt production for a couple of months owing to lack of demand. Peloton denied the news.

Foxconn, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s main iPhone maker, has expanded its activities in electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years, announcing deals with U.S. startup Fisker Inc and Thailand's energy group PTT PCL.
Foxconn said it has signed a memorandum of understanding for a wide scope of investment on EVs including battery manufacturing with the Indonesian Ministry of Investment as well as Indonesia Battery Corporation, energy firm PT Indika Energy and Taiwanese electric scooter vendor Gogoro. 
The cooperation, which aims to build a ""new energy ecosystem"" in Indonesia, also includes the development of EV supporting industries such as energy storage systems, battery exchange stations and recycling, Foxconn said in a statement.

Under the partnership, an open ""MIH platform"" that provides both hardware and software services will be available to companies in Indonesia, the statement said, without giving details of the size of the investment or production plans.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 07:31AM ET</span>",Analysis-Netflix's modest growth forecast casts pall over streaming,"By Dawn Chmielewski
(Reuters) - Even as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) executives sought to reassure investors in a Thursday video interview that its long-term prospects for streaming media remain bright, with its popular series “Bridgerton” returning for a second season and a science-fiction film starring Ryan Reynolds coming soon, shares slipped.
By the end of the 45-minute earnings interview, Netflix stock was down more than 20%, casting a pall over the entertainment industry. Wall Street analysts and the company's own executives struggled to explain why the world’s dominant streaming service forecast modest growth for the first three months of 2022, when many had anticipated a return to predictable, pre-pandemic quarterly gains.
""It's tough to say exactly why our acquisition hasn't kind of recovered to pre-Covid levels,"" said Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann. ""It's probably a bit of just overall Covid overhang that's still happening after two years of a global pandemic that we're still unfortunately not fully out of, some macroeconomic strain in some parts of the world, like Latin America, in particular.""
Stocks of tech and media companies that have invested heavily on streaming, including the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), all dropped in after-hours trading.
Netflix projected gains of 2.5 million subscribers in the January through March quarter, roughly two-thirds of the 4 million customers added in the same period a year earlier. Wall Street analysts pointed to heightened competition and a slower-than-anticipated return to normalcy after the distortions of the pandemic as possible factors.
Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak said Netflix and other services that added subscribers during the pandemic lockdown in early 2020 - including Disney+ and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) - are struggling to regain equilibrium after outsized gains.
“Streaming is not over, it is the future,” Wlodarczak wrote. “And today, streaming still has a relatively small percentage of global television viewership.”
Others saw Netflix’s muted first-quarter forecast as a sign of intensifying competition - though co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors: ""We didn't see a hit to our engagement. We didn't see a hit to retention - all of those things that would classically lead you to looking at competition.""
Rival services, such as Disney's Disney+, WarnerMedia's HBO Max and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video, are spending billions on content to attract subscribers.
“The reality is that the streaming market has become saturated,” wrote Mike Proulx, vice president of research for Forrester. “This translates to more choice for consumers, who are growing concerned with the aggregate costs of their streaming subscriptions.”
Though 90 percent of Netflix’s growth is expected to come from outside its home market, analysts are closely tracking how Netflix’s latest price increase, which boosted the cost of a monthly subscription to $15, will affect subscriptions in the United States and Canada.
""Whether Netflix can retain subscribers at historical rates now that their most popular tier costs the same as HBO Max after their most recent price increase will be important to gauge,” wrote Joe McCormack, Analyst at Third Bridge, “As we head into a 2022 year that many seem to believe will come with streaming video subscriber saturation overall.""

Netflix co-Founder Reed Hastings told investors there's ample room for growth, as streaming gradually replaces traditional television over the next decade or two. 
""For now, we're just like staying calm,"" he said.

Investing.com – Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) traded 0.6% higher in Friday’s premarket as it said it will invest more than $20 billion in two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio, a site that could ultimately host eight such units.
At full buildout, total investment in the 1,000-acre site could be as much as $100 billion over 10 years, making it one of the largest semiconductor manufacturing sites in the world, Intel said.
This follows the company’s September announcement of committing a similar investment in setting up two units in Arizona. The new project is CEO Pat Gelsinger’s attempt to return the company to its days of glory. Over the years, it either ceded markets or saw new opportunities being grabbed by nimbler rivals.
The investments are also in line with Gelsinger’s ambitious plan to make more semiconductors in U.S., an exercise meant to de-risk economies from excessive reliance on China for critical components.
Intel said Air Products (NYSE:APD), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), LAM Research and Ultra Clean Technology have indicated plans to establish a physical presence in the region.
The commitments come at a time when every manufacturer is pouring in billions of dollars to meet record demand for chips as companies and people turn more to a digital world. While supply chains remain clogged, creating a short-term crunch, manufacturers expect long-term demand to remain firm.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>","Snap plays up augmented reality in Latin America, Asia expansion","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) is speeding up its global expansion in countries from Mexico to Japan through tie-ups with wireless carriers and highlighting its popular augmented reality features, the company told Reuters. 
The parent company of the Snapchat photo messaging app is leaning on its relative safety during a period when social media platforms such as Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), YouTube and TikTok are being scrutinized worldwide over harmful content, lax privacy and cybersecurity protections, which has led to outright bans of the services in some countries. 
Snap has largely remained unscathed by governments and regulators around the world and has developed a playbook for attracting users in new markets that plays up the appeal of its light-hearted AR (augmented reality) lenses, which can overlay computerized images on top of the physical world, and ephemeral messaging between close friends.
Since rebuilding its Android app in mid-2019, which made Snapchat more usable for people outside the United States and Europe, where Android is more widely used than iPhones, the company has reached a milestone of 100 million monthly users in India. 
Globally, Snap has 500 million monthly users, the company said during its Partner Summit in May, adding about 40% of its users are outside North America and Europe.
It now wants to deepen its India presence and attract new users globally starting with Japan, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Spain, a strategy that has not yet been reported.
The move reflects how the majority of Snapchat's users are now on Android following the rollout of the improved app, whereas previously it was one of the few apps that was mostly used on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices, said Nana Murugesan, Snap's head of international markets.
""We've seen the fruits of that play out as Android is really driving our growth,"" he said. 
Snap's strategy includes inking deals with telecom carriers and smartphone manufacturers to preinstall Snapchat. The company said it is currently in talks with carriers in Mexico, Brazil, Italy and Spain to explore deals such as joint marketing or including the app in zero-rating plans, which allow customers to use an app without it counting against mobile data limits, and was a tactic that super-charged Facebook's early expansion in regions where wireless data was expensive.
Snap is also opening new offices in Tokyo, Milan and Madrid this year to help support the growth plans, the company said. 
The expansion plan includes hosting workshops with high school and college students to promote the app with young users, adding media content in local languages to its Discover feature on Snapchat, which houses original shows from entertainment studios, and rolling out photo and video AR filters that celebrate local holidays and events.
Along with its focus on AR, Snap has in recent years positioned itself as an app for keeping in touch with a close group, and one where public content is vetted by the company, a distinction from apps like TikTok, where content creators aim to go viral.
That image could help Snap gain easier entry into markets in Asia, where families are watchful of influences on their children, said Shailesh Rao, a former executive at Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter who worked on international expansion.
""There is a premium on safety, and there is a premium on knowing your privacy is protected,"" he said. 
LUCRATIVE OPPORTUNITY IN JAPAN
Generating meaningful returns in these new markets could be difficult, said Arvind Rajan, former managing director of new markets for LinkedIn, who developed the professional networking site's entry into China in 2014. 
While attracting new users in India is easy given the large young population, U.S. tech companies have struggled with making money in the country, he said. 
In India, Snap trails Meta Platform Inc's Facebook and Instagram, which have 388 million and 257 million monthly active users, respectively, according to app analytics firm App Annie. Viral short-form video app TikTok has been banned in India since 2020 over data privacy and security concerns.
Gaining users in Japan, Brazil, Italy and Spain, in particular, will be key to laying the groundwork for Snap to grow its international revenue. The four countries are among the top 10 online advertising markets worldwide, and the total amount spent on online ads in those markets amounted to $33 billion in 2020, according to an August report from research firm MoffettNathanson.
The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company, which earns revenue by selling advertising on Snapchat, still makes most of its money in North America. Its revenue from outside North America and Europe totaled $127 million during the third quarter, an increase of 53% from the previous year.
Japan represents a lucrative opportunity, and Snap sees its AR features as the way in. In August, the company hired its first employee in Japan to lead market development in the country. 
Japan has a well-established AR developer community, and Snap wants to attract users as it makes strides in its AR technology such as its Spectacles glasses, Murugesan said, adding the company is in discussions to partner with an animation studio in Japan to create AR lenses.

The company is also hiring for a role that would build relationships and awareness with augmented reality developers in Japan, according to a job posting on Snap's website.
""If you can figure out the user growth story (in Japan), you'll make a lot money,"" Rajan said.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the first regulator globally to ground the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes, approved design changes in early December after more than two and a half years. 
The regulator had expected airlines to resume commercial flights around the beginning of this year.
A MAX 8 belonging to China Southern, the largest 737 MAX operator in the country, took off from its headquarters city in Guangzhou and touched down three hours and 33 minutes later in the same city, according to aviation data provider Variflight. The plane did not carry any passengers. 
That followed a Hainan Airlines flight on Jan. 9 from Taiyuan, where it had parked some of its grounded 737 MAX, to its base city in Haikou. That flight lasted for two hours and 52 minutes, according to tracking websites. 

Before the MAX was grounded, Boeing was selling a quarter of the planes it built annually to Chinese buyers, its largest customers. 
CAAC officials had said the planes would need to be modified and pilots would require additional training before the resumption of commercial flights in the country.

Investing.com – Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) lost more than a fifth of its value in Friday’s premarket as new market realities hit the streaming giant in the fourth quarter.
The company is projecting it will add 2.5 million users by March, substantially lower than the 4 million it added in the first quarter of 2021. It closed December at nearly 222 million users.
The muted outlook came after the company added 8.3 million subscribers in the quarter through December, short of its aim of 8.5 million.
The company faces increasing headwinds after nearly two years of scorching growth fueled by the pandemic when home-stuck people turned to streaming content for entertainment. As more people return to work, Netflix faces the task of retaining subscribers while attracting new ones.
Competition too -- Disney+ (NYSE:DIS)+, Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA),  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and local players in international markets -- has been knocking on its doors. Netflix has reacted by cutting prices in growth markets like India and spending heavily on content and technology. As a result, its operating margin for the quarter eroded to 8.2% from 14.4% a year earlier.
Last week, it hiked prices in U.S. and Canada, its most mature markets where it still sees “tremendous room for growth”.
Netflix said its subscriber growth rates have “not yet reaccelerated to pre-Covid levels,” blaming “ongoing Covid overhang” and economic hardship in several countries.

Investing.com – Peloton stock (NASDAQ:PTON) was recouping some of its Thursday losses after committing to lower operating expenses and improving profitability.
The stock was up 8% in Friday's premarket after tumbling 24% in previous session on reports it might halt all production of bikes and Treads for two months due to lack of demand. CEO John Foley disputed those reports.
However, according to a Bloomberg report, the company isn’t ruling out job cuts as part of its efforts to improve profitability.
“In the past, we’ve said layoffs would be the absolute last lever we would ever hope to pull,” he said. “However, we now need to evaluate our organization structure and size of our team, with the utmost care and compassion. And we are still in the process of considering all options as part of our efforts to make our business more flexible,” Foley wrote in a memo to staff, according to Bloomberg.
The company said it would move to a more variable cost structure to improve profitability.
Peloton estimated second-quarter revenue at about $1.14 billion, compared with its forecast of $1.1 billion-$1.2 billion. The final numbers will be out on February 8.
The company's focus on costs comes as it confronts the realities of the post-pandemic world. It was among the biggest winners of the pandemic when stuck-at-home people used its bike and treadmills as alternatives to gyms that were closed by lockdowns. With the pandemic fading and curbs on movement of people easing, people are going back to gyms and walks and runs in the parks.
The company has attempted to grow its audience by cutting prices but is still to show any concrete signs of progress there."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian assets are under pressure as investors worry about the possible extension of U.S. sanctions or new EU measures targeting officials, banks and the energy sector if Moscow attacks Ukraine - a move Russia denies it is planning. 
The Russian stock market has lost around 20% since hitting record highs in October, the rouble has fallen to a more than eight-month low and yields on Russia's 10-year benchmark OFZ state bonds spiked to their highest in nearly six years in January.
On Friday morning, Russian assets were down again, as the markets await a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva later the day. 
Despite the dangerous geopolitics, Russian officials say economic fundamentals are strong and say the rouble volatility is temporary.
How healthy are Russia's finances and what might authorities do to calm markets?
ROUBLE 
The central bank let the rouble free-float in 2014, after waves of western sanctions followed Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and as it sought to protect gold and foreign exchange reserves.
Under a fiscal rule adopted in 2017 to strengthen the National Wealth Fund (NWF) Russia buys foreign currency when oil prices are high and sells when prices go below $44 per barrel, shielding the rouble from oil price swings. 
In 2020, Russia was selling FX, which helped limit rouble losses amid an oil price slump, the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical risks.
""As oil and gas prices remain high, we believe that the main factor behind the rouble's depreciation is geopolitical"", not fundamental macro indicators, Sberbank CIB said. 
CURRENT ACCOUNT AND CAPITAL OUTFLOWS
A historic-high Russian current account surplus of $120.3 billion, equal to 7% of the gross domestic product and driven by high gas prices last year, is rouble-supportive, ING said. 
Yet net capital outflows widened to $72 billion last year, its highest since 2014 and up from $50.4 billion in 2020. ""This keeps the local currency undervalued, making it continuously favourable for the trade balance,"" ING added. 
INFLATION
While supportive of budget revenues, a weaker rouble contributes to inflation, which reached 8.62% in annual terms this week, double the central bank's target and near six-year highs. 
""Given high volatility on the Russian financial markets in the recent days, (the) possibility of the central bank raising key rate by 100 basis points is increasing,"" Alfa Bank said, forecasting the eighth straight hike in February to 9.5%.
RESERVES AND BUDGET
Russian gold and forex reserves are at an historic-high of over $630 billion, enough to cover 25 months of imports or Russia's $490 billion total external debt, Renaissance Capital said. 
Russia run a budget surplus of nearly $7 billion last year, on the back of energy prices and the weak rouble. The NWF's liquid assets - funds on central bank accounts - reached $113.5 billion, or 7.3% of GDP. 
""This can be used for budget purposes in the times of stress,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. 
RUSSIAN OFZ BONDS, STOCK MARKETS
Foreign investors sold 214 billion roubles' ($2.8 billion) of OFZ treasury bonds in November-December, with foreigners' share among OFZ holders shrinking by 1.1 percentage points to 19.5% by year-end.
The central bank can not directly buy OFZs from the market under existing laws but the finance ministry has said Russian banks may step in and increase their domestic bond portfolios. 
U.S. investors account for around a third of foreign OFZ holdings, or less than state VTB, Russia's second biggest bank, which has nearly 2 trillion roubles of OFZs in its portfolio.
The finance ministry cancelled bond auctions this week amid high volatility. It says the strong fiscal position allows it to borrow less. Russia enjoys debt level of 20% to GDP, below an average of 60% in emerging markets. 
The Russian stock market is 2.4 times cheaper than emerging market peers and nearly 5 times cheaper than the S&P 500, Gazprombank said in a note. It has average dividend yields of 10% and could provide solid returns, with the geopolitical escalation offering attractive prices, Gazprombank said. 

""But the level of uncertainty is still high,"" the bank said.

Back to inflation for a minute: Friday data shows even Japanese inflation rose 0.5% in December from a year earlier, up for a second month running at the fastest pace in nearly two years in a sign of broadening inflationary pressure from rising fuel and raw material costs.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday she was confident the Fed and the Biden administration would take steps needed to bring down inflation during 2022.
One market not feeling the inflation angst are sovereign bonds. Germany's Bund yield is back below 0% and U.S. Treasury yields are down 5 basis points early in London. After all investors need somewhere safe to hide from carnage elsewhere.

360,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 02:54AM ET</span>",The Fertilizer Crisis Is Getting Real For European Food Prices,"(Bloomberg) -- As Europe’s farmers prepare to spread fertilizers on fields after winter, sky-high nutrient prices are leaving them little choice but to use less and try to pass on the cost down the food chain.
For growers of staples like corn and wheat, it’s the first time they’ve really been exposed to a fertilizer crisis fueled by an energy crunch, export curbs and trade sanctions. It now costs much more to buy chemicals needed for winter crops coming out of dormancy, and the extra expense could prompt smaller spring plantings that make up roughly a third of European grain.
Europe has been hardest hit by fertilizer-plant cutbacks on soaring costs of gas used to run them -- and nutrient prices there remain at a record even as the pressure eased in North America. Europe could face a deficit of about 9% of its annual nitrogen-fertilizer needs in the first half, VTB Capital estimates. Food may get even pricier if harvests suffer or crop prices rise.
Many farmers yet to secure chemicals are either waiting until the last minute in case prices ease, or may spread them more thinly.
In Hungary, nitrogen fertilizer usage will drop around 30% to 40% this season, hurting crop yields, said Gyorgy Rasko, an agricultural economist who has farms in the country. 
“If there’s a drought around the end of April and May, the effect could be even more devastating, since nitrogen helps plants survive dry days,” he said.
Nitrogen nutrients are crucial for spring growth in Europe and are used again from February. They’re also the type most affected by Europe’s energy crisis because they’re produced using gas. A first-half shortage of those types may reach up to 7 million tons, VTB said. 
While the gas crunch eased lately -- and some firms like Yara International (OTC:YARIY) ASA have returned fertilizer capacity -- it’s still bad enough to keep supply limited.
“Coupled with the lack of imported fertilizers, the impact will be felt even more strongly,” said Romanian fertilizer maker Azomures, which is among those that curbed output. “Crops will suffer in terms of quality and final quantity.”
The fertilizer market also faces wider threats, from export restrictions by Russia and China to sanctions on Belarusian potash output that’s affecting trade routes.
Harvest Risk
Farmers in crop giants France and Germany probably booked about 70% of their nitrogen fertilizer needs for the growing season by year-end, a time when purchases are typically wrapping up, adviser Agritel said. Coverage in Black Sea nations like Ukraine and Romania may be even lower.
It’s still attractive to grow wheat and corn, but using less fertilizer increases risk. Curbing application on wheat by roughly 15% from normal could cut yields about 5% and may also hurt protein content, Agritel analyst Isaure Perrot said.
Some crop yields could be cut in half without nitrogen products, said Zoltan Bige, chief strategy officer at Hungarian producer Nitrogenmuvek. Polish peer  Grupa Azoty SA  (WA:ATTP) said other risks include a buildup of late orders and potential delivery delays.
Smaller crops would be more bad news for food security, with near-record global prices already squeezing consumers and contributing to faster inflation.
“Grain prices at the moment are enough to compensate for the fertilizer price,” said James Webster, a senior analyst at  The Andersons  (NASDAQ:ANDE) ANDE Centre in the U.K. “How long that stays the case depends on the future direction of markets. While it compensates, there’s still a hefty bill to be paid.”

361,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 02:50AM ET</span>",Amundi's China wealth JV garners $11 billion in 15 months since launch,"By Selena Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Europe's largest asset manager Amundi has garnered more than $11 billion of assets from Chinese investors since it became the first foreign-controlled joint venture (JV) to launch operations in the country 15 months ago.
Huihua Wealth Management, 55% owned by Amundi and the rest by a unit of Bank of China, the country's fourth-largest lender, was launched in Sept. 2020 as Beijing opened up its booming wealth management market to foreign firms. All of Huihua's products are distributed by Bank of China.
The strong performance by Amundi's venture comes just as global giants such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK),  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and UBS have moved towards forming similar majority-owned wealth tie-ups since Beijing first allowed this in 2019.
""At a household level, less than 20% of wealth was invested into financial assets, meaning that there could still be a big shift of wealth from deposit and newly earned income into financial assets, into wealth management, and into funds,"" Zhong Xiaofeng, Amundi's greater China chairman, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
Chinese banks dominate the distribution of proprietary and third-party wealth products in the country.
BlackRock's majority-owned wealth joint venture with China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) launched in May last year, with the roll-out of two wealth management products, mainly serving private bank clients of the Chinese bank.
Amundi and BlackRock's ventures are the only foreign-majority wealth platforms that are up and running.
Facing a squeeze in fees, assets managers in developed markets are chasing growth and have been looking to expand in client-facing wealth segments.
They see enormous opportunity in China, where the local $4.4 trillion wealth management market expanded by nearly 8% in the first nine months of 2021.
The majority of Amundi's wealth JV offerings are in strategies which aim to generate returns superior to fixed income. A small percentage of the assets are in equities.
Globally, Amundi had 1.81 trillion euros ($2.05 trillion) in management as of last September.
Huihua's 70 billion yuan ($11 billion)of assets were spread across more than 100 products as of the end of last year.
Despite the strong performance in the venture with Bank of China, it has not all been smooth sailing for Amundi in the country.
Amundi's fund joint venture with Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF), in which Amundi owns 33%, reported 16.3 billion euros of outflows in the first nine months of 2021, according to the company, as the Chinese bank withdrew assets from its own fund subsidiary.
Zhong said the redemptions were due to China's regulatory overhaul of the fund management industry between 2018 and 2021.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Netflix Inc dashed hopes for a quick rebound after forecasting weak first-quarter subscriber growth on Thursday, sending shares sinking nearly 20% and wiping away most of its remaining pandemic-fueled gains from 2020.
The world's largest streaming service projected it would add 2.5 million customers from January through March, less than half of the 5.9 million analysts had forecast, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) tempered its growth expectations, citing the late arrival of anticipated content, such as the second season of ""Bridgerton"" and the Ryan Reynolds time-travel movie ""The Adam Project.""
Shares of Netflix plummeted nearly 20% to $408.13 in after-hours trading. Competitor Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, which has staked its future on building a strong streaming business, saw its shares sink 4%. Streaming device  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc fell 5%.
Nasdaq futures dropped almost 1%, showing traders expect the tech-heavy index to open lower on Friday.
Netflix added 8.3 million customers from October to December, when it released a heavy lineup of new programming including the star-studded movies ""Red Notice"" and ""Don't Look Up"" and a new season of ""The Witcher."" Industry analysts had projected 8.4 million.
The company's global subscriber total at the end of 2021 reached 221.8 million.
In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it believed the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and economic hardships in several parts of the world like Latin America may have kept subscriber growth from rebounding to levels seen before the pandemic.
COVID ""created a lot of bumpiness"" that made it hard to project subscriber numbers, ""but all the fundamentals of the business are pretty solid,"" Co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos said in a post-earnings video interview.
The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.33, crushing analyst consensus estimates of 82 cents. Revenue hit $7.71 billion, in line with estimates.
Netflix last week raised prices in its biggest market https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-netflix-raises-monthly-subscription-prices-us-canada-2022-01-14, the United States and Canada, where analysts say growth is stagnating, and is now looking for growth overseas.
The company rode a roller coaster during the pandemic, with steep growth early in 2020 when people were staying home and movie theaters were closed, followed by a slowdown in 2021. Netflix picked up more than 36 million customers in 2020, and 18.2 million in 2021.
Netflix's subscriber growth in 2022 had been expected to stabilize and return to the pace logged before the pandemic, when it added 27.9 million subscribers in 2019, analysts say. The company's upcoming slate includes new installments of ""Ozark"" and ""Stranger Things"" and a three-part Kanye West documentary.
""The pandemic lockdowns pulled forward tons of demand and it is taking longer than expected to normalize,"" said Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak.
Competitors including Disney and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s HBO Max, are pouring billions into creating new programming to grab a share of the streaming market.
Netflix said competition ""may be affecting our marginal growth some,"" but added that it was still growing in every country where new streaming options have launched.
""Even in a world of uncertainty and increasing competition, we’re optimistic about our long-term growth prospects as streaming supplants linear entertainment around the world,"" Netflix said in its shareholder letter.
In their video interview, executives sought to reassure investors that Netflix's long-term prospects were bright. Sarandos said the service had not seen a decline in customer engagement or retention and he projected the switch to streaming from traditional television would continue to open opportunities worldwide. The stock remained down nearly 20%.

""The pace of the migration may be a little hard to call from time to time when there are kind of very global events or even local conditions,"" Sarandos said, ""But it's absolutely happening. There's no question of that.""
The company is looking for new ways to attract customers including with mobile video games. Netflix said it released 10 games in 2021, was pleased with the early reception and would expand its gaming portfolio in 2022.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 02:00AM ET</span>",South Korea's IPO boom leaves investment banks short changed,"By Scott Murdoch and Heekyong Yang
HONG KONG/SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's equity offering boom has created a money spinning opportunity for issuers and investors, but it has brought little cheer to at least one segment of the capital market: investment banks and brokerages working on those transactions.
LG Energy Solution Ltd's (LGES) $10.8 billion initial public offering (IPO), the largest ever in South Korea, netted bankers working on the deal less than 1% of the proceeds, Dealogic data showed.
Such rates make the country one of the lowest fee-paying major equity capital markets (ECM) in the world. 
Hong Kong IPOs generally pay fees of 2%, in line with the New York Stock Exchange, while Nasdaq listings net bankers an average of 3.4%, according to Dealogic data. In 2021, the average paid in those markets sat at 3.2%.
The low fee payouts mean South Korea will unlikely emerge as a major income generator for Western banks, even as the country is witnessing a record level of capital market activity and a new equity raising pipeline that is getting busier.
South Korean IPOs have traditionally paid low fees compared with other major markets, said one Hong Kong-based ECM banker with direct knowledge of the matter.
""Korea has never paid well, so it doesn't surprise me ... but a few million bucks is still a few million bucks,"" said the banker, who was not permitted to speak to the media and so declined to be identified.
Eleven investment banks and brokerage firms including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) Incand local brokerage KB Securities worked on the IPO of South Korean battery maker LGES.
They are set to pocket a combined $75 million, the company's IPO prospectus showed. That payment, as a portion of total funds raised, equates to 0.7% - one of the lowest proportions paid in a major market globally.
The IPO, Asia's largest since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) raised $12.9 billion in its Hong Kong secondary listing in 2019, attracted $12.8 trillion worth of bids from institutional investors and $96 billion from retail investors.
LGES is not alone in paying a low fee: KakaoBank Corp, which raised $2.1 billion via an IPO in July last year, handed bankers a 0.8% base fee, while underwriters for Krafton Inc got 0.5% for their work on a $3.6 billion deal in the same month, their prospectuses showed.
Local brokerages are, however, not complaining. 
""We felt that getting that 0.7% commission was pretty good enough, considering the level of the LGES deal,"" said a person at a local brokerage with knowledge of the transaction. 
""The base fee could seem lower than fees in other major markets like New York or Hong Kong, but the LGES deal was not necessarily too difficult for brokerage firms or banks to handle.""
Surging deal volume in the country should also offset the impact of the low fee base in the near term.
More than 20 companies went public on the main market last year, raising about 17 trillion won ($14 billion) and beating the previous record of 8.8 trillion won raised in 2010, according to bourse operator Korea Exchange.

Experts said appetite for IPOs in South Korea would likely continue into 2022 as some unicorns and e-commerce firms are seeking to go public this year to take advantage of the IPO market optimism.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Sony Group will likely add new technology partners to its electric vehicle (EV) project to help it forge a mobility business to transform cars from transportation machines to entertainment spaces, a  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) executive told Reuters.
An ongoing shift to electric cars, which are easier to build than those with internal combustion engines, is allowing new entrants into vehicle manufacturing. At the same time, autonomous driving and 5G connectivity is expected remold the auto industry by turning cars into mobile platforms for information and entertainment services.
""We see the risk of ignoring EVs as greater than the challenge they pose,"" Izumi Kawanishi, the senior general manager who will manage a new Sony Mobility business, said in an interview. The coming transformation of cars was in some ways similar to how information technology turned phones into smartphones, he added.
Announcing the creation of that new mobility unit at the CES technology tech fair in Las Vegas this month, Sony Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida suggested for the first time that the creator of PlayStation games consoles will try to turn an EV development project started two years ago into a money-making venture.
""We understand that speed is important in terms of making a decision,"" said Kawanishi, who joined the Japanese consumer electronics company as a software engineer in 1986 and heads the AI Robotics unit making Sony's Aibo robot pet. 
Kawanishi declined to say whether a final decision on whether to go ahead would come this year. 
PARTNERS
So far, Sony has built two EV ""Vision"" prototypes with a factory in Austria owned by Canadian auto parts maker  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA), which also makes cars for firms including BMW, Mercedes Benz and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp . 
Other members of its Europe-based project include German auto parts maker Bosch, French automotive technology company  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) SE and Hungarian autonomous vehicle start-up AImotive.
To bring an EV to market, Sony would likely have to invest heavily in plant and equipment. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which delivered its first electric vehicle in 2008, has spent billions of dollars to make its business viable. 
Sony will also have to take on traditional carmakers too, such as Toyota, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), which are spending tens of billions of dollars to beat the EV newcomers. 

Sony is one of a growing list of technology firms exploring automotive opportunities, including iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), South Korea's LG Electronics Taiwan's Foxconn, and China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group 
Sony will pick new partners for its EV project based on the technology they can bring to the project, without regard to their nationality, Kawanishi said, when asked if Sony would partner with Chinese companies.

VILNIUS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lithuania is under pressure from German companies to back down in a dispute with China to end a blockade of the Baltic state, as European trade officials struggle to defuse the row, people familiar with the matter said.
China has pressed multinationals to sever ties with Lithuania or face exclusion from its market, an unusually harsh move that has dragged companies into a political dispute and placed Beijing on a collision course with the European Union. [L1N2SU0G7]
The row erupted after the Baltic state allowed the opening of a de facto embassy by Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China views as part of its territory.
Some of the companies affected have asked Lithuania's political leaders to de-escalate the dispute or risk a corporate exodus, according to people involved and correspondence seen by Reuters.
Many multinationals are affected, but one of the most significant hits is to the German car sector.
In a letter to Lithuania's foreign and economy ministers, the German-Baltic Chamber of Commerce said imports of Chinese machinery and parts and the sale of Lithuanian products to China had ground to a halt and that some firms may have to leave.
Urging the ministers to seek a ""constructive solution"" to restore relations with China, the chamber said ""the basic business model of the companies is in question and some ... will have no other choice than to shut down production in Lithuania"".
Last month, Lithuania's Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte met with business leaders, including executives from German car-parts giant Continental, to listen to their concerns, said one person who attended.
The overall damage to industry runs to hundreds of millions of euros, and she was told this would escalate if the dispute continues to interrupt global production, the person said.
This week, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda also held talks with business executives when he was urged to make an ""immediate de-escalation,"" according to one person with knowledge of that discussion.
The European Union's top trade official, Valdis Dombrovskis, is also attempting to mediate between Beijing and Vilnius, ahead of a possible EU-China summit meeting in the coming months, said a person with knowledge of the matter. Lithuania belongs to the 27-state bloc.
RENAMING
The focus of the dispute is the opening of a representative office by Taiwan in Vilnius, although tensions have mounted since Lithuania's ruling coalition agreed last year to support what it described as ""those fighting for freedom"" on the island.
Renaming the office to remove the word Taiwan could resolve the dispute. Taiwan has other offices in Europe and the United States but they use the name of the city Taipei, avoiding reference to the island itself.
But salvaging relations will be difficult.
""The Lithuanian government has betrayed China’s trust,"" the Chinese foreign ministry told Reuters in a statement.
""For China-Lithuania relations to get back on track, Lithuania must first correct its attitude and take practical actions to correct its mistakes,"" said the ministry, denying that China was exerting economic pressure.
A spokesperson for the European Commission said it would resist ""coercive measures"", adding: ""We stand by Lithuania. Lithuanian exports are EU exports.""
The Commission said it was reaching out to China to resolve the situation and ""collecting facts and evidence"" to see if China was complying with international trade rules. ""We will not hesitate to act to defend our rights,"" said the spokesperson.
So far, there is no sign of a climbdown by Lithuania, with its president telling the business meeting this week that it was up to Brussels, home of the European Commission, to find a solution.
While one Lithuanian official, asking not to be named, said Brussels' involvement as a go-between was critical, another said EU backing was half-hearted and that its officials too urged Lithuania to compromise.
'NO-GO ZONE'
China appeared to reject Brussels' involvement.
""Problems between China and Lithuania should and can only be solved through bilateral channels between China and Lithuania,"" said China's foreign ministry. ""Linking China-Lithuania issues to China-EU relations is ... unlikely to solve the problem.""
The stand-off threatens Lithuanian industry, which has built up clusters of factories making parts destined for overseas, such as furniture, clothing, car parts and lasers. Hundreds of containers of goods and parts are in limbo.
It has rippled through global supply chains and, in the case of Continental, has had knock-on effects on customers such as luxury carmaker BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), two of the people said.
Volkswagen said its production is not affected, while BMW and Continental declined to comment.
""Lithuania has become a no-go zone in China,"" said Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.
""European companies cannot register it as a country of origin for products they are selling here. It's been taken off the map.""
France's trade minister Franck Riester promised to help Lithuania.
""If a Lithuanian company needs Chinese components for its production but cannot find them because China is blocking ... we will be happy to help by putting it in contact with French companies or companies from other Member States,"" he said.
Paris, which holds the EU presidency in the coming months, is attempting to speed up introduction of new EU trade defence measures, said French officials.

The measures could penalise China in such disputes, although it is unclear whether Europe, where countries such as Germany depend on it for trade, will agree to them.
Similarly, it has been difficult for Brussels to launch legal action against China because companies affected are unwilling to be publicly named, one person with knowledge of the matter said.

Australia delays border opening,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd will cut domestic capacity by 10 more percentage points, to 60% of pre-pandemic levels, in the March quarter after the state of Western Australia indefinitely delayed opening its border, the carrier said on Friday.
The opening planned for Feb. 5, was cancelled late on Thursday, with authorities in Western Australia citing health risks from a surge in the Omicron variant of coronavirus in eastern states.
In a statement, Qantas said, ""The group retains the flexibility to adjust flying levels depending on demand and clarity on border re-opening in the weeks and months ahead.""
Last week, the airline had pared about a third of planned domestic and international capacity in the March quarter, to better match demand amid rising COVID-19 infections.
Preparing for a surge in demand, it had recently recalled about 11,000 staff who had been idled without pay during the pandemic.
The move increased fixed costs and the recent capacity cuts will squeeze revenue and reduce margins.

Qantas, which ends its financial year in June, said it would give more details on the impact of the changes in half-year results late next month. 
Rival Virgin Australia said it would review its flight schedule to Western Australia to keep in line with the state's arrangements to re-open its borders.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 01:00AM ET</span>","Pegasus Asia, Tikehau Capital-backed SPAC, debuts in Singapore","By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), backed by European asset manager Tikehau Capital and a holding firm of LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault, became the second SPAC to list in Singapore on Friday as Asia investors warm to blank check firms.
The twin listings also mark the first major debut of such vehicles in Asia since a SPAC frenzy in the United States in early 2021 prior to regulatory changes and some poor returns that dampened investor sentiment.
On Thursday, Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) Technology Acquisition Corp, a SPAC backed by Vertex Holdings - in turn owned by state investor Temasek - became the first such structure to list on the local bourse.
Pegasus Asia, sponsored by Tikehau Capital and Financiere Agache, Arnault's holding firm, raised S$170 million ($126 million) and plans to invest in tech-enabled sectors. 
The SPAC, which was heavily oversubscribed, was little changed from its S$5 per unit offer price in afternoon trade.
SPACs raise money in initial public offerings then look to merge with a private company, aiming to take the target public in a shorter time-frame than in a traditional listing and with stronger valuations.
""We will immediately focus on seeking suitable targets for the business combination,"" Pegasus Asia CEO Neil Parekh said at a listing ceremony.
In September, Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) eased proposed rules in response to market feedback, allowing SPACs or shell firms to list in the city-state.
A S$150 million SPAC sponsored by Southeast Asian industrial and technology buyout fund Novo Tellus Capital Partners, which got investment from a Temasek unit, among others, lists next week.
Hong Kong is also allowing SPAC listings from this year but bars participation by retail investors.
Southeast Asia is seeing a boom in start-up funding as investors bet on post-pandemic technology plays.
""There are many private companies who desire to be with a partner who can not only bring capital but also bring them visibility and help them grow as businesses,"" Parekh, told Reuters on Thursday.
Pegasus Asia's sponsors also include former UniCredit boss Jean Pierre Mustier and banker Diego De Giorgi. The group of sponsors already have two European-listed SPACs.
""We felt very confident not having to look around for cornerstones because we see ourselves as cornerstone investors,"" said Parekh, a veteran banker.
""We have significant skin in the game,"" he added, referring to S$30 million invested by the sponsors and an unconditional commitment by Tikehau and Financiere Agache to invest an additional S$40 million in total when the SPAC merges with a target.
SGX is offering a regulatory framework similar to that in the United States, including allowing the participation of retail investors but also requires sponsors to invest in SPACs.
Analysts say risks include SPACs overvaluing companies and not finding ideal targets.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and UBS are joint issue managers and global coordinators on the Pegasus SPAC.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 12:30AM ET</span>","Peloton plans workforce size review, production changes","(Reuters) - Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc's chief executive said on Thursday the company was reviewing the size of its workforce and ""resetting"" production levels, following a report earlier in the day that it was temporarily halting production of connected fitness bikes and treadmills after a significant drop in demand.
Shares in the exercise bike maker, once a pandemic darling, closed down 24% at about $24, wiping off nearly $2.5 billion in market value.
""We now need to evaluate our organization structure and size of our team,"" CEO John Foley said. ""And we are still in the process of considering all options ... to make our business more flexible.""
According to the CNBC report, Peloton, in a confidential presentation dated Jan. 10, said it had seen a ""significant reduction"" in demand and that it planned to pause bike production in February and March. It also won't manufacture the Tread treadmill machine for six weeks, beginning next month.
""Rumors that we are halting all production of bikes and Treads are false,"" Foley said.
Peloton earlier in the day said it was taking ""significant corrective actions"" to improve its profitability and estimated second-quarter revenue to be about $1.14 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.
The company has seen a slump in demand for its fitness classes and equipment as people venture out of their houses to hit gyms again following gradual easing of pandemic-related curbs.

""During the pandemic, there was too little supply to meet the growing demand. Unfortunately, the company took those cues to bulk up supply just as demand began to falter,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said.
Peloton has been working with consulting firm McKinsey & Co for a review of its cost structure and could cut jobs, CNBC reported earlier this week.

The committee proposes to engage China International Capital Corp. and BOCI Asia Ltd. as financial advisers, and Zhong Lun Law Firm LLP as a legal adviser to help the developer deal with its debt stress and respond to creditors’ demands, Evergrande said Friday. 
Meanwhile, Evergrande kicked off the bondholder identification exercise among some offshore creditors, according to two holders of its dollar notes who said they received the notice this month. 
The developments come a day after a bondholder group said Evergrande had failed to substantially engage with it on restructuring efforts. The group said it will “seriously consider enforcement actions” to protect investors’ interests and wants to be consulted before any further assets are sold.
Evergrande, saddled with $305 billion of liabilities as of mid-2021, was deemed to be in default in December after missing dollar-bond payments. It set up the risk management committee that month, saying it would “actively engage” with creditors to formulate a viable restructuring plan.
Officially identifying bondholders is typically a key phase in a restructuring, as a borrower seeks clarity on its investor base and prepares for future communication. Evergrande didn’t immediately respond to a Bloomberg request for comment on the move. 
The financial and legal advisers will help the company in “mitigating and eliminating” debt risks, follow up with creditor demands and deal with debt issues on a “fair and equitable basis,” Evergrande said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

BANGKOK (Reuters) -Lebanon's M1 Group will partner with a Myanmar firm to take over Norwegian telco Telenor's business in the Southeast Asian country after its military junta sought a local buyer, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Telenor https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/telenor-sells-myanmar-operations-m1-group-105-mln-2021-07-08, one of the biggest foreign investors in Myanmar, said in July it was selling its operations there to M1 Group for $105 million, retreating from a country that has slid into chaos after a military coup in February last year.
Its exit has been mired in difficulties as the junta piles pressure on telecom and internet companies to install surveillance technology and bars senior executives from leaving the country.
Military leaders late last year rejected the sale solely to M1. 
Instead, they privately approved a partnership between M1 Group and Myanmar's Shwe Byain Phyu Group, the three sources said. Two of the sources said Shwe Byain Phyu would be the majority shareholder. They declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Shwe Byain Phyu is a group of companies with interests in gem mining and petrol stations. Its chairman, Thein Win Zaw, is a director of Mahar Yoma Public Company, part of a consortium that has a stake in the military-owned telco Mytel, corporate records show. He did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the sale and his links to the military.
An October order from the office of junta leader Min Aung Hlaing seen by Reuters instructed officials at the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the regulatory body, to reject the sale to M1 Group, which is owned by the family of Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. 
The order did not state a reason but the sources familiar with the matter said the junta favoured a local buyer.
Representatives of M1 Group, which is based in Beirut, did not immediately answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment. A junta representative did not respond to requests for comment.
The decision was not made public and one person briefed on the matter said it was not conveyed to Telenor. 
A spokesperson for Telenor said it was waiting for a response to its application for regulatory approval of the sale and declined to comment further.
In November, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/telenor-sale-myanmar-unit-stalls-junta-seeks-local-buyer-participation-sources-2021-11-09 that several Myanmar firms had expressed an interest in buying Telenor Myanmar’s operations and that M1 had held talks with Shwe Byain Phyu about a partnership.
The two firms made a joint proposal to take over the Telenor unit that was accepted by the junta leadership a month later, the industry sources said.
Two of the sources said the new venture would be named Atom.
SURVEILLANCE CONCERNS
Activists have expressed concerns that Telenor's exit could deepen the junta's surveillance of the population. It is one of four telecom operators in Myanmar, alongside Qatar's Ooredoo, state-backed MPT and Mytel, which is part-owned by a military-linked company.
Activist group Justice for Myanmar called on Telenor on Friday to suspend the sale.
""The fact that Shwe Byain Phyu is a buyer, a conglomerate with known links to the Myanmar military, deepens the risk to Myanmar people, whose personal data is exposed through the sale,"" spokesperson Yadanar Maung told Reuters.
Telenor has said its handover to a new buyer would include all assets, including call data records, in accordance with licence obligations.
Reuters found last year telecom and internet service providers had been secretly ordered https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-myanmars-military-moved-telecoms-sector-spy-citizens-2021-05-18 in the months before the coup to install intercept technology that would allow the army to eavesdrop on the communications of citizens.
Telenor said https://www.reuters.com/world/norways-telenor-says-myanmar-unit-sale-came-after-juntas-pressure-surveillance-2021-09-15 in September it was pulling out of the country to avoid European Union sanctions after “continued pressure” from the junta to activate the technology.
Since the Feb. 1 coup, Myanmar security forces have killed more than 1,400 people and arrested thousands to try to crush opposition, the non-governmental organisation Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said. 
The junta disputes the casualty figures.

The military seized power alleging widespread fraud in a November 2020 election won by a landslide by the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. International and local monitoring groups said there were no major irregularities with the vote.
The junta has imposed nationwide and regional shutdowns of mobile data, making it harder for democracy activists to organise protests. It also issued a confidential order https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-after-pressuring-telecom-firms-myanmars-junta-bans-executives-leaving-2021-07-05 in July restricting senior foreign telecom executives from leaving the country without permission.

The feature, available on iOS to users of the company's Twitter Blue subscription service, connects their Twitter accounts to crypto wallets where the users store NFT holdings.
Twitter displays the NFT profile pictures as hexagons, differentiating them from the standard circles available to other users. Tapping on the pictures prompts details about the art and its ownership to appear.
Like other tech companies, Twitter is rushing to cash in on crypto trends like NFTs, a type of speculative asset authenticating digital items such as images, videos and land in virtual worlds.
The social media platform last year added functionality for users to send and receive Bitcoin.
Sales of NFTs reached some $25 billion in 2021, according to data from market tracker DappRadar, although there were signs of growth slowing toward the end of the year.
Proponents of ""Web3"" technologies like NFTs say they decentralize ownership online, creating a path for users to earn money from popular creations, rather than having those benefits accrue primarily to a handful of tech platforms.
Critics dismiss the decentralization claims, noting that many of the services powering adoption of those technologies - like the six crypto wallets supported by Twitter's NFT product - are backed by a small group of venture capitalists.

In a widely circulated tweet after the launch, security researcher Jane Manchun Wong highlighted one of those links, showing how an outage at venture-backed NFT marketplace OpenSea temporarily blocked NFTs from loading on Twitter.
OpenSea did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, a crypto-oriented financial services firm, on Thursday said it hired an executive from asset management giant Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) to help grow its business and expand product offerings.
William Burt, a former managing director at Blackstone, joined Galaxy Digital as chief operating officer of Galaxy Digital Asset Management, which oversees some $2.9 billion in assets, this week, the company said.
At Blackstone, Burt was chief operating officer of the group's $55 billion Portfolio Solutions group which invests with many of the world's leading hedge fund managers for clients including pension and sovereign wealth funds. 
During the decade Burt worked for Blackstone's hedge fund unit BAAM, he played a key role in helping allocate investments and liaise with clients. Before Blackstone, he worked at McKinsey & Company.
At Galaxy Digital Asset Management, Burt will oversee day-to-day operations in the asset management business and report to Steve Kurz, Global Head of Asset Management. 
""Bill's decades of experience scaling investment management businesses will be invaluable as we continue to rapidly expand our capabilities,"" Kurz said.
Galaxy Digital was founded by former hedge fund manager turned cryptocurrency pioneer Michael Novogratz in 2018 as an investment management firm which then expanded into investment banking and trading to serve institutional and wealthy individual clients.
The New York-headquartered firm listed shares in Toronto in 2020 and is expected to list in the United States in the first quarter of 2022.

Galaxy Digital has made a number of hires from traditional financial firms including appointing former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive Michael Daffey as chairman last year.
Blackstone has seen a large group of executives leave its hedge fund unit over the past year, including most recently John McCormick (NYSE:MKC), BAAM's former co-head, and Min Htoo, BAAM's former co-chief investment officer.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.40% by 9:04 PM ET (2:04 AM GMT), with data released earlier in the day showing that the national core consumer price index grew 0.5% year-on-year, while the national CPI grew 0.8% year-on-year, in December. The Bank of Japan also released the minutes from its most recent policy meeting.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.75% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.53%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was 0.33%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.27% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.79%.
U.S. shares fell, with Nasdaq 100 contracts erasing a near 2% rally Thursday before ending in the red. The S&P 500 also gave up gains and is more than 5% off its January high.
Recent company earnings also did not meet expectations, dampening investor sentiment, with Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares falling in after-hours trading thanks to a disappointing subscriber outlook.  Peloton Interactive Inc  . (NASDAQ:PTON) shares were also on a downward trend over reported temporary production halts.
Also adding to investors’ nerves is the prospect of both U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and the possible reduction of its $8.8 trillion balance sheet.
“A lot of people are talking about inflation and that sort of thing, but their portfolios really don’t reflect it,” Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC chief investment officer Richard Bernstein told Bloomberg.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A rebound on Wall Street fizzled on Thursday as investors lost conviction that an early rally had legs, with the Nasdaq falling more than 1% and crude oil prices hitting fresh seven-year highs to rekindled fears of inflation and higher interest rates.
Concern that the Federal Reserve will aggressively move to raise rates this year is taking a toll on the market. Investors are anxiously awaiting the U.S. central bank's policy meeting next week for new details on how it will tackle inflation. 
Crude prices initially eased before climbing to fresh seven-year highs. The major Wall Street indices sharply pared gains of more than 1% to close about that much lower. The week's big rally in U.S. Treasury yields also showed signs of resuming.
""The rally looked strong on the surface, when you look at prices being higher,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. ""There are more people since the beginning of the year inclined to be sellers on weakness for fear that things keep going further lower.""
Strong earnings reports initially helped lift stocks into the black in a broad rally while the major indices in Europe also gained. The broad pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.51%. 
U.S. stocks turned negative late in the session, leading MSCI's all-country world index to fall 0.32%.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.89%, the S&P 500 lost 1.10% and the Nasdaq Composite, in a correction after Wednesday's close, fell 1.30%. 
Investors have been concerned about rising rates because they raise borrowing costs and could dent global growth prospects and douse the earnings outlook for companies.
A Reuters poll of economists showed they expect the Fed to tighten monetary policy at a much faster pace than thought a month ago to tame high inflation.
Chair Jerome Powell will stick to the Fed's message of tighter monetary policy next week as inflation has become a hot political issue, said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis.
""There's no reason for him at the moment to deviate from what clearly has been a more hawkish script. That runs the risk of the markets maybe getting more nervous next week,"" LaVorgna added.
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, rose 1.2 basis points at 1.037%. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes in late trade was down 1.2 basis points at 1.815% after earlier trading higher. 
The key catalyst for markets so far in 2022 has been expectations of higher rates as the Fed tightens monetary policy, said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF) Inc. 
""Given the amount of selling pressure we saw earlier in the week, the market is just consolidating a little bit. Rates don't always move every day in the same direction,"" Flanagan said.
European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde said euro zone inflation will decrease gradually over the year, adding that the ECB did not need to act as boldly as the Fed because of a different economic situation.

Asian share markets broke a five-day slide, pushing higher on Thursday as China underscored its diverging monetary and economic picture by cutting benchmark mortgage rates.
China's blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.9% on the day, led by property developers, amid hopes government measures would ease a funding squeeze in the embattled sector, even as another developer warned of default. 
Analysts at ING said geopolitical risks, notably the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine, could continue to weigh on global shares, adding to pressure on rising rates concerns.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.197% to 95.797, while the yen fell 0.17% at $114.1200. The euro slid 0.27% to $1.1310.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes ended sharply lower on Thursday and a rally in U.S. stocks evaporated late in the session as investors considered whether equities were bargains after a sell-off to start the year that has seen the Nasdaq fall into correction territory.
Major U.S. indexes had been gaining solidly for much of the day, following a steep drop to start the week. 
The Nasdaq on Wednesday closed more that 10% below its November all-time high, confirming it was in a correction. The tech-heavy index has now fallen nearly 12% from its record high and on Thursday closed at its lowest level since June.
“There seems to be a whole lack of conviction,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). ""The dip-buyers step in, but then they run out of momentum.” 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 313.26 points, or 0.89%, to 34,715.39, the S&P 500 lost 50.03 points, or 1.10%, to 4,482.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.24 points, or 1.3%, to 14,154.02.
Of 11 major S&P 500 sectors, 10 finished lower, with the consumer discretionary sector falling 1.9%. Utilities eked out a 0.1% gain. 
Putting a further damper on growth stocks, shares of Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) tumbled nearly 24% after CNBC reported that the exercise bike maker is pausing production of its connected fitness products as demand wanes and the company looks to control costs. Peloton was one of the mainstays of the stay-at-home trade in 2020. 
After the bell, shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) dropped sharply after the company fell short of Wall Street forecasts for new subscribers at the end of last year and offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for early 2022. 
Stocks have gotten off to a rocky start in 2022, as a fast rise in Treasury yields amid concerns the Federal Reserve will become aggressive in controlling inflation has particularly hit tech and growth shares. The benchmark S&P 500 is down nearly 6% so far this year.
""I just think we're in for a kind of rocky period here for the month of January,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""Valuations are high, rates are going up, the outlook is murky -- there's more to worry about now than there was several months ago.""
Investors are also turning to fourth-quarter earnings reports as they start to roll in.
Shares of Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Cos rose 3.2% after the property and casualty insurer reported a record quarterly profit.
Baker Hughes shares climbed 1.6% after the company reported an adjusted quarterly profit and topped analysts' earnings expectations as higher energy prices fuel demand for its equipment and services. 
Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, likely as a winter wave of COVID-19 infections disrupted business activity.
The NYSE Tick index, which measures stocks making an uptick and subtracts stocks making a downtick, plunged to a low of -2,007 late in the session. That was the sixth lowest intraday tick in history using Refinitiv data back to early 1989.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.75-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.39-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 545 new lows. 
About 11.9 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - A California investor sued Tellurian (NYSE:TELL) Inc Chairman Charif Souki on Thursday, accusing him of fraud in relation to an agreement over Tellurian stock.
Shareholder Chris Parker filed a breach of contract lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Denver seeking unspecified damages from Souki, founder of the U.S. liquefied natural gas company. Parker, a Los Angeles resident, alleged Souki reneged on a promise promised to cover any investment losses Parker suffered while holding about 11 million shares in Tellurian between 2019 and 2021. 
Souki believed there was a short-selling campaign against Tellurian's stock and convinced Parker not to sell his shares, the lawsuit said. Souki promised a stock price rise when ""certain business prospects"" were realized, the lawsuit said.
Neither Tellurian nor Souki replied to a request for comment. 
Parker said he began acquiring Tellurian shares in 2017,a year that they traded as high as $20.47 per share. By August 2019, the stock had dropped to about $5 per share. 

The complaint alleged Souki was forced by his bank to sell tens of millions of his shares to cover loans while he was telling Parker not to sell.
“Charif Souki made a clear promise to Chris Parker – a promise that Souki broke, and that in retrospect it appears he never intended to honor,” Matthew L. Schwartz, a lawyer for Parker, said in a statement.

""We are starting an analysis of this opportunity, and if we find that a possible transaction adds value to shareholders, we would submit it for their consideration,"" Banorte Chief Executive Marcos Ramirez told a news conference.
Citigroup last week said it would sell its Citibanamex consumer banking operations, ending a two decade retail presence in Mexico and prompting Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to call for domestic investors to snap up the assets and ""Mexicanize"" the bank. 
Banorte earlier said it expected to boost its net income in 2022 by as much as 17.3%, and posted higher net income and revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with the year-ago period. 
The group, which owns one of the country's largest banks and pension funds, said in a presentation accompanying quarterly results that it is targeting net income between 39.5 billion pesos and 41.1 billion pesos for 2022, compared with a total of 35 billion pesos last year.
As well, the company said it expected loans to grow between 7% and 9% in the year. 
For the fourth quarter of 2021, Banorte reported net profit of 9.1 billion pesos ($441.8 million), up nearly 52% from the same year-ago period.

Revenues stood at 26.6 billion pesos in the October to December period, up almost 7% from a year earlier.

That's far below the more than $20 million it spent in 2018 but more than the $7.53 million that went to lobbying in 2020. Google spent $2.2 million on lobbying in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Google's lobbying spend dipped in 2020 as it restructured its government relations teams.

The biggest technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), have been under pressure in Congress over allegations they abused their outsized market power. 
A long list of bills have been introduced aimed at reining them in, but none have become law. One of the bills, which would stop the platforms from giving preference to their own businesses, passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.

Dimon's total compensation will include an annual base salary of $1.5 million and performance-based incentive pay of $33 million, according to a regulatory filing.
JPMorgan Chase said directors based the pay decision on bank performance in 2021, while dealing with the challenges from the pandemic, and in the long term. It also cited Dimon's work on risk and controls, interests of customers and stakeholders and teamwork and leadership.
The rationale provided by the board was similar to that offered for Dimon's compensation in past years.
Under Dimon, who turns 66 in March, JPMorgan produced net income of $48.3 billion in 2021, up from $29.1 billion a year earlier, and a return on tangible common equity of 23%, up from 14%.
Annual profit at JPMorgan and other banks bounced back in 2021 from levels that were depressed by charges for expected loan losses from the pandemic that did not materialize.

Banks with big capital markets and investment banking businesses, such as JPMorgan, also gained from securities underwriting and takeover advisory businesses that thrived as the Federal Reserve held down interest rates to support the economy.
JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets, with $3.74 trillion at the end of December.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's money-losing health tech arm Verily on Thursday announced a new tie-up in its search for sustainable revenue, saying it would study skin health and explore new products with cosmetics maker L'Oreal SA.
The company declined to disclose terms of what it called a ""strategic, multi-year partnership and research collaboration"" with L'Oreal. 
Executives who have left Verily have criticized it for signing flashy, one-off research collaborations with pharmaceutical companies instead of focusing more attention on landing recurring subscribers to its software for clinical research and disease management.
The critics have said Verily's approach has left it with intermittent revenue and further off from generating profit. 
Dr. Amy Abernethy, president of Verily's clinical research platforms, said the company's technology will underpin a longitudinal examination into skin issues and environments and behaviors possibly affecting them. Results could aid development of diagnosis and treatment options.
Abernethy, who has worked closely with skin cancer patients, noted that existing technology struggles to differentiate between similar-looking skin conditions. 
By working together, the companies' aim is to ""power every single person with access to the most inclusive and personalized information on their skin management,"" said Barbara Lavernos, deputy chief executive officer at L'Oreal.
Verily last year booked about $400 million in revenue, according to a source briefed on the figures. Over a quarter of sales came from the low-profit-margin business of administering COVID-19 tests for outside organizations, and Verily's overall losses widened significantly from 2020, the source said. 
Verily said those numbers are inaccurate. It does not publicly report financial results.
Plans for the L'Oreal project include both the long-term software component and co-development of a new telecare service for dermatologists and consumers. The deal is Verily's first with a beauty company and follows years of talks with L'Oreal.

Corporate sibling Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is testing an artificial intelligence tool for identifying skin conditions https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-tech-fitzpatrick-exclusive-idCAKCN2DU0UA-OCATC, is not involved, executives said.
Verily's deal follows a similar partnership unveiled last August with Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Co to study oral health.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Siemens Energy on Thursday cut its outlook after wind division Siemens Gamesa warned of prolonged supply chain issues, renewing pressure on the German firm to fully take over the unit in order to get a better handle on its problems.
Siemens Energy, which owns 67% in Siemens Gamesa, said it now expects a margin on adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) before special items in a range of 2% to 4% in 2022, down from 3% to 5% previously.
The announcement came shortly after Siemens Gamesa slashed its outlook for the third time in less than nine months, creating a headache for its German parent which has limited influence on the separately listed subsidiary.
""Performance was negatively impacted by supply chain related disruptions, which are now expected to last longer than previously anticipated, further affected by the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Siemens Gamesa said in a statement.
Siemens Gamesa's onshore division has been troubled for some time -- also caused by ramp-up issues around a new class of turbines -- but recent progress led Christian Bruch, the CEO of its parent, to be more hopeful.
The latest profit warning is expected to trigger fresh demands on Bruch to buy the remaining stake in Siemens Gamesa, worth around 4.3 billion euros ($4.9 billion) currently, or seek other ways to accelerate the turnaround.
Based on preliminary figures, Siemens Gamesa's loss before interest and tax before purchase price allocation and integration & restructuring costs came in at 309 million euros in the first quarter.

This translated into an adjusted loss before interest, tax and amortisation before special items of 63 million euros for Siemens Energy, which also makes gas turbines, in the same period, compared with a 366 million profit last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved a bill that would bar tech giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) from giving preference to their own businesses on their websites, despite hefty lobbying from top executives like Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.
The biggest technology companies, including Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), have been under pressure in Congress because of allegations they abused their outsized market power. A long list of bills is aimed at reining them in, but none have become law.
Lawmakers voted on an amended version of a bill introduced by Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Chuck Grassley, a Republican, that expanded the definition of companies covered by the bill to include firms like the popular video app TikTok and specified that companies were not required to share data with firms that the U.S. government considers national security risks.
Republican Senator Ted Cruz said during the hearing that he spoke on Wednesday with Cook, saying he ""expressed significant concerns about the bill.""
Cruz, who voted for the measure, said Cook expressed a ""reasonable"" concern the bill would make it harder for Apple to allow consumers to protect their privacy by electing that apps not be allowed to monitor or track their online activities.
Klobuchar, chair of the panel's antitrust panel, said after the vote that she also had spoken with both Cook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai.
""I had discussions with them and I made my case and I listened to them. They are most likely never going to like this bill,"" she said adding that she was open to changes but not to gutting the measure. ""We're not going to put a bill forward that does nothing.""
The Cowen Washington Research Group said that despite the committee's 16-6 vote to approve the measure, enough of its supporters expressed reservations that it had less than a 50% chance of becoming law.
A second bill, which was held over, would bar big app stores, like Apple's, from requiring app providers to use their payment system and prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices through another app store or payment system.
Both bills have a version in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The legislation aimed at Big Tech set off a firestorm of opposition from powerful business groups.

Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, criticized the Klobuchar/Grassley measure and predicted it would not pass the Senate. ""Antitrust policy should aim to promote consumer welfare - not punish specific companies,"" he said in a statement. 
The advocacy group Consumer Reports supported the Klobuchar/Grassley bill to ""reset the power asymmetry between Big Tech, consumers and small businesses.""

(Reuters) - Shares of Baker Hughes (O:BKR) rose sharply on Thursday after the company reported an adjusted quarterly profit and topped analysts' earnings expectations as higher crude oil and natural gas prices fuel demand for its equipment and services. 
Oil prices surged more than 50% last year amid a global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and as OPEC+ cut supplies. Higher crude prices have spurred more drilling activity, with the U.S. rig count rising 68% year-over-year to 586 at the end of the fourth quarter, according to Baker Hughes data.
(Graphic: Rig counts rise as drilling activity rebounds from pandemic lows, https://graphics.reuters.com/SCHLUMBERGER-RESULTS/CHART/dwvkrkqrbpm/chart.png) 
""We believe the broader macro recovery should translate into rising energy demand for 2022 and relatively tight supplies for oil and natural gas,"" said Baker's Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli. In North America, Simonelli anticipates private energy companies to continue driving growth, while publicly traded firms remain disciplined. 
Shares of Baker Hughes closed up 1.64% at 26.72. They had climbed around 5% earlier in the day. 
Wall Street analysts said the report was positive, praising Baker's $645 million in free cash flow, which topped forecasts, and higher than expected EBITDA. 
Investment firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co called the earnings ""a very nice way to rebound,"" pointing to revenue and operating income across three of Baker's four reporting segments that beat expectations.
The company reported some $7.7 billion of orders in 2021 in its Turbomachinery and Process Solutions unit, driven largely by those related to liquefied natural gas (LNG).
""We believe that the step-up in LNG order activity provides a solid indication that a new LNG cycle is beginning to take shape,"" Simonelli told investors during a conference call. He anticipates 2022 orders to be in line with 2021. 
Simonelli said that disruptions from the pandemic continued to impact operations, and warned that supply chain and inflationary pressures that drove higher costs and delivery issues in its oilfield services and digital solutions business units would likely continue in the first half of 2022. 
Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $224 million, or 25 cents per share, missing analysts' estimates by 3 cents, according to data from Refinitiv IBES. The same quarter last year, Baker reported a loss of $50 million, or 7 cents per share.

Revenue for the quarter was $5.52 billion, which beat Wall Street forecasts of $5.49 billion.
For the full year, the company reported a loss of $219 million, versus a loss of $9.94 billion in 2020.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended sharply lower Thursday, paced by a slump in consumer discretionary stocks, and fresh weakness in tech after the sector failed to hold onto intraday gains for the second day in a row. 
The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9%, or 313 points, the Nasdaq slipped 1.3%.
Consumer discretionary stocks were led lower by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Garmin (NYSE:GRMN), and VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) as sentiment turned negative on risk assets late in the session.  
Financials struggled to hold onto gains even as investors digested better-than-expected quarterly results from the sector, and bought the recent dip in bank stocks.
The Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) jumped more than 3% after the insurance company delivered blowout quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines, led by gains in premiums written.
 State Street  (NYSE:STT), and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) -- both of which were under pressure a day earlier following quarterly earnings that fell short of Wall Street forecasts - gained more than 1%.
M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) and Regional Financials, however, were in the red, after quarterly results missed analysts’ expectations.
In tech, investors continued to sell into strength as the sector pared gains to end the day in negative ahead of the start of quarterly results from big tech, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) set to report after closing bell.
Ahead of Netflix's results, some on Wall Street have turned less constructive on the steaming media giant’s performance during the fiscal quarter, citing third-party data pointing to underwhelming subscriber additional in the quarter.
“As most Netflix data watchers have noticed, third party data that is used to gauge 4Q net adds has not been encouraging,” Deutsche Bank said in a note last week.
“Our analysis of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) trends data leads us to lower our 4Q net add estimate to 7.25 million, as compared to guidance of 8.5 million,” it added.
Energy stocks were pressured by falling oil prices amid data showing that U.S. weekly crude supplies unexpectedly rose.

Investing.com - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported on Thursday fourth quarter results that beat analysts' forecasts, but weaker guidance on subscriber growth flagged concerns about peaking demand following the streaming giant's recent price hike.
Netflix shares lost 13% in after-hours trading following the report.
For the first quarter of 2022, the company forecast paid net adds of 2.5 million, down from 4.0 million in the year ago quarter, but improved growth for the back half of the year that would supported by the launch of season two of Bridgerton, and its new original film The Adam Project, with both set to launch in March.
The weaker guidance arrived as fourth quarter results beat on the top and bottom lines despite a weaker-than-expected net adds during the quarter.
Netflix announced earnings per share of $1.33 on revenue of $7.71 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 84 cents on revenue of $7.71 billion.
Netflix added 8.28 million users, below its forecast of 8.5 million net subscriber adds. Analysts had expected about 8.2 million net adds.
Free cash flow for the quarter was -$569 million versus -$284 million in Q4‘20. The company said, however, it expected to be free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond.

Investing.com -- Stocks gave back their gains on Thursday, weighed by tech stocks and a sinking Peloton.
The exercise equipment maker will suspend production of its popular bikes and treadmills for at least a few weeks, according to CNBC. That sent its shares falling 20%.
Meanwhile, bond yields paused their steady climb to pandemic-era highs. The Nasdaq, which slid into correction territory on Wednesday, first gained and then went red later in the session.
Oil prices are also at seven-year highs.
The heart of earnings season is quickly approaching. Banks showed resilience in consumer and wealth management but struggled in some capital markets areas. Tech earnings kick off later tonight with Netflix.
In recent weeks, investors have shown concern that inflation would have to be answered by strong actions by the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise interest rates four times this year. New cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus appear to have reached a plateau in many areas, with some places in Europe lifting restrictions imposed to stop its spread.
Here are three things that could affect market tomorrow:
1. Peloton production
Pandemic darling  Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) got pummeled in the market on Thursday after a CNBC report that it would halt production for a while on some of its popular exercise equipment amid a slowdown in demand. The stock, which traded below its IPO price of $29 a share and is likely to face additional scrutiny on Friday.
Peloton plans to halt production of its bike for two months, from February to March, CNBC reported, citing the documents. The stoppage comes just a month after the company suspended production of its Bike+ in December until June.
2. Netflix earnings
The streaming giant is the first of the FANG gang to report this quarter, and will do so after tonight’s closing bell. For the three months ended in December, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) has forecasted 8.5 million net new subscribers and a 16% gain in revenue to  $7.7 billion. Analysts are expecting 8.3 million subscriber net adds and $7.7 billion in revenue.
3. American Airlines
 American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) operating revenue more than doubled to over $9 billion as the carrier flew more passengers and freight. The loss per share of $1.42 more than halved from last time and was narrower than expected. That was despite the fact that fuel and related taxes in the fourth quarter more than tripled from a year ago to $2.2 billion.
The carrier continues to operate well below levels that were normal before the pandemic. It expects its January to March capacity to be down 8% to 10% compared to the same period in 2019.

396,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 03:50PM ET</span>",Analysis-Microsoft faces challenge cleaning up Activision Blizzard’s culture,"By Sheila Dang, Julia Love and Dawn Chmielewski
(Reuters) - The success of Microsoft’s biggest deal ever rides on rehabilitating Activision Blizzard’s culture, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella declared after announcing the $69 billion transaction. 
Accomplishing that will require Microsoft to deviate from its usual hands-off approach on acquisitions to tackle what amounts to a “clean up” job of fixing the famed maker of the “Call of Duty” games franchise, which faces multiple accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct, analysts and management experts say.
Microsoft has traditionally allowed the companies it acquires to run autonomously, RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria said. In recent years, Microsoft purchased LinkedIn, GitHub, Skype and Mojang, the Stockholm-based creator of the video game series Minecraft, all of which have not seen major changes since their acquisitions.
The Activision deal announced on Tuesday will require a heavier hand. Since July, Activision has faced a lawsuit from California regulators alleging the company ""fostered a sexist culture."" It also has been the subject of investigative stories detailing allegations of sexual harassment internally, and its employees have staged walkouts to protest Activision’s response to the issues. Activision said it received requests from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for information ""regarding employment matters and related issues,"" and is cooperating with the agency. 
Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, whose handling of the alleged misconduct has attracted media scrutiny, is expected to leave the company after the transaction closes, according to one source. However, “cultural issues are never one person,” Jaluria said. “There is going to be a lot more work for Microsoft.”
The company has begun making changes.
Activision recently pushed out about three dozen employees following its own investigation and said it made high-level personnel changes and increased its investment in anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training as of last October.
Its board of directors formed a Workplace Responsibility Committee to oversee the company's progress in improving culture. 
Activision said it has investigated -- and will continue to investigate -- complaints of harassment, discrimination and retaliation and will provide regular updates. In October, Activision announced a zero-tolerance harassment policy.
""We recognized that we needed to make improvements in our culture and ensure an environment where people feel safe, comfortable and respected,"" Kotick told Reuters. 
A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is committed to inclusion and respect in gaming and is ""looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).""
Before the deal is expected to close by fiscal 2023, Microsoft is limited by what it can do, said Kathryn Harrigan, a professor at Columbia Business School who specializes in corporate growth and turnarounds. Beyond declaring that it is a priority, Microsoft can ask questions and collect data, she said, adding that one good place to start is to gather information such as salary data to identify wage disparity. Activision agreed to pay $18 million in September to settle a complaint filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over sexual harassment and discrimination issues.
After the deal closes, Microsoft can take a more active role by hiring advisers, bringing in law firms or mandating sensitivity training, said Brian Uzzi, a professor at Northwestern’s Kellogg (NYSE:K) School of Management.
Microsoft could also launch its own investigation of the culture at Activision, he added. 
Ultimately, Microsoft could decide to revamp Activision’s management team, Jaluria said. 
LIGHT AT END OF TUNNEL
That would be good news for some Activision employees, who have demanded Kotick’s removal by staging a walkout and circulating a petition.
Jessica Gonzalez, a former Activision employee who has helped lead worker activism, said she is cautiously optimistic that conditions will improve following the acquisition. But workers still need better representation at the company to achieve lasting change, she said.
Microsoft will need to overcome its own culture issues. The company's board of directors in January said it hired a law firm to conduct a review of its sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies after shareholders supported a proposal in November calling on Microsoft to review the effectiveness of its policies. 

That vote followed a Wall Street Journal report that Microsoft founder Bill Gates left the company’s board in 2020 amid a probe of the billionaire's past intimate relationship with a female employee.
Nadella issued a statement on Jan. 13 announcing plans for the review, saying the board appreciates the importance of a safe and inclusive workforce. He called culture “our No. 1 priority.” He used similar language in his remarks Tuesday about Activision.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 gave up gains Thursday, as rebound in financials and tech stocks following a recent a rout ran out of steam. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%, or 158 points, the Nasdaq slipped 0.8%.
Financials turned negative even as investors digested better-than-expected quarterly results from the sector, and bought the recent dip in bank stocks.
The Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) jumped more than 3% after the insurance company delivered blowout quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines, led by gains in premiums written.
 State Street  (NYSE:STT), and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) -- both of which were under pressure a day earlier following quarterly earnings that fell short of Wall Street forecasts - gained more than 1%.
M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) and Regional Financials, however, were in the red, after quarterly results missed analysts’ expectations.
Technology's attempts to stage another recovery faded, ahead of the start of quarterly results from big tech, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) set to report after closing bell.
Ahead of Netflix's results, some on Wall Street have turned less constructive on the steaming media giant’s performance during the fiscal quarter, citing third-party data pointing to underwhelming subscriber additional in the quarter.
“As most Netflix data watchers have noticed, third party data that is used to gauge 4Q net adds has not been encouraging,” Deutsche Bank said in a note last week.
“Our analysis of Google trends data leads us to lower our 4Q net add estimate to 7.25 million, as compared to guidance of 8.5 million,” it added.

EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager fined the world's most popular internet search engine in 2017 over the use of its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.
The case was the first of three decisions that have seen Google rack up 8.25 billion euros in EU antitrust fines in the last decade.
In November, the EU's General Court largely dismissed Google's challenge against the fine, saying the European Commission correctly found the company's practices harmed competition.
The judges in Luxembourg rejected the company's argument that the presence of merchant platforms showed there was strong competition.
""After careful consideration, we have decided to appeal the General Court’s decision because we feel there are areas that require legal clarification from the European Court of Justice,"" the Google spokesperson said in a statement. 

""Irrespective of the appeal, we continue to invest in our remedy, which has been working successfully for several years, and will continue to work constructively with the European Commission.""
The court's support in November could also strengthen Vestager's hand in her investigations into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

San Francisco (Reuters) -Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz will partner with self-driving sensor maker Luminar Technologies Inc to enable fully automated driving on highways for its next-generation vehicles, Luminar's founder said. 
Luminar shares surged 18% at $15.89 on Thursday. Luminar said Mercedes-Benz will have 1.5 million shares in Luminar, which will vest over time when certain milestones are met.
Vehicle autonomy ""is really going mainstream with Mercedes,"" Luminar CEO Austin Russell told Reuters on Wednesday, without disclosing a timeframe for putting the technology in Mercedes' vehicles. 
He said the two would develop ""true"" autonomy capabilities to keep drivers out of the loop, while improving safety capabilities such as automatic braking. 
Automakers from Tesla (O:TSLA) to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Volvo have set their eyes on introducing autonomous vehicles for consumers, although regulatory and technological challenges remain.
Tech firms such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Waymo and Cruise also are developing self-driving taxis or trucks for commercial use such as ride-hailing and delivery services.
General Motors is working with its majority-owned Cruise self-driving unit to introduce a personal autonomous vehicle by as early as mid-decade, Chief Executive Mary Barra said this month. 
""If you want to be able to get to truly autonomous capabilities in a consumer vehicle, and you have to industrialize hardware, software, all of these systems that come into play. That by the way, is completely different than the work that the robo-taxi companies have been working on,"" Russell said. 
He said it is a challenge to mass produce lidars and make sure they are robust enough to meet stringent requirements from automakers. 
""It is a completely different kind of business of going from a science and technology business to automotive corporation.""

Lidars, which use laser light pulses to measure the distance between the sensor and the target object, are widely seen as essential to achieving full autonomous driving. But Tesla has shunned the sensor, saying it is expensive and unnecessary.
Volvo Cars and Luminar said earlier this month that they will put a hands-free driving system in an upcoming electric sport utility vehicle.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Black accused a former top lieutenant at Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc of exploiting the billionaire's ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in an effort to launch a ""coup"" and oust him from the investment firm he co-founded.
The accusation against Josh Harris was part of a late Tuesday night filing in a New York state court in Manhattan, where Black is defending against a lawsuit filed in June by Guzel Ganieva, with whom he had a 6-1/2-year relationship.
Ganieva, a former model, accused Black of rape and other abuse and of defaming her by claiming she tried to extort him. Black has denied her claims, and filed a defamation and racketeering conspiracy lawsuit against her and her law firm.
In Tuesday's filing, Black sought Ganieva's phone records to support his claim that her lawsuit was an ""off-shoot"" of an ""attempted Apollo coup and smear campaign"" by Harris to undermine him starting in 2020 after allegations surfaced that Black had paid Epstein financial management fees.
Harris ""chafed"" because Black was ""first among equals as CEO and executive chair,"" according to the filing, and saw Black's ties to Epstein as ""an opportunity to take over at Apollo.""
The filing said Harris hired public relations executive Steven Rubenstein to ""help seed harmful stories"" about Black. He ""forged ahead with a malicious campaign"" to take Black down after being passed over in January 2021 for the CEO job at the private equity firm.
Black relinquished the CEO role and was replaced by Marc Rowan after a review by the Dechert law firm found Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning. He stepped down as Apollo's chairman in March.
Representatives for Harris and Rubenstein said neither man had relationships or dealings with Ganieva. They also denied Black's claims.
""Mr. Harris has nothing whatsoever to do with the deeply troubling situation Mr. Black finds himself in, and any statement or implication otherwise is unhinged at best,"" a spokesman for Harris said.
Evan Farber, a lawyer for Rubenstein, said Black's claims ""offer a concocted, ever-evolving conspiracy theory, packed with false information, that are not based in reality."" 

Apollo announced Harris' plan to leave his own day-to-day role in May.
Epstein killed himself in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday issued new approvals for additional altimeters that allow about 78% of the U.S. commercial air fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where 5G C-band wireless is deployed.
Some flights were being affected at San Francisco because of low visibility, with some diverted to other airports or canceled, airlines said.
Airplane models with one of 13 cleared altimeters include all Boeing (NYSE:BA) 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787 and MD-10/-11 models; all Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350 and A380 models; and some Embraer 170 and 190 regional jets. The FAA said it anticipated ""some altimeters will be too susceptible to 5G interference"" and will be prohibited from performing low-visibility landings near 5G deployments.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) agreed late Tuesday to delay switching on new telecom towers near key airports even as they turned on the new 5G C-Band service.
Radio altimeters are used to give data on height above grounds for bad-weather landings.

President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he had ""pushed as hard I can to have the 5G folks hold up and abide by what was being requested by the airlines.""
Verizon will temporarily not turn on about 500 towers near airports, sources told Reuters, or less than 10% of their planned deployment, while the carriers and the administration work on a permanent solution.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines on Thursday said a recovery in passenger traffic was likely to resume in March after a blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant, but warned that the latest wave of the health crisis would keep their costs elevated this year.
Texas-based American said while ticket sales are still not back to pre-Omicron levels, they are recovering ""quickly"" after dropping off ""considerably"" in early December.
Similarly, Chicago-based United said bookings and cancellations have started to return to normal levels. The carrier said its bookings this week were down 25% versus the same period in 2019, compared with a decline of 48% in the first week of January.
""As a result, we remain optimistic that Omicron's impact, while significant, will be focused on January and February at this point,"" United's Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told investors on an earnings call.
Nocella also said the impact of Omicron and each possible future variant on the carrier's revenue will likely pale in comparison with that of the Delta coronavirus variant.
Rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) last week, too, predicted a swift recovery from the demand slump. 
Encouraged by the improvement in bookings, United expects to report a profit in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year.
American also expects to return to profitability in March.
The company said domestic leisure and short-haul international traffic were approaching their 2019 levels, but demand for long-haul international remained challenged.
Domestic business travel, which accounted for 30% of the company's 2019 passenger revenue, recovered in the latest quarter to about 70% of the pre-pandemic level, it said.
American, however, said the volatility in travel demand due to new COVID-19 variants has created ""the most challenging planning environment in the history of commercial aviation"".
LOWER CAPACITY, HIGHER COSTS 
Both the carriers plan to match their capacity with bookings trends.
American expects its capacity in the quarter through March would be down about 8% to 10% compared to the same period in 2019. Full-year capacity is projected to be 5% lower than in the pre-pandemic year.
United's 2022 capacity is now projected to be lower than in 2019, instead of growing 5% as estimated earlier.
Lower capacity as well as lower aircraft utilization because of delayed demand are estimated to drive up costs at the both the airlines. Higher fuel prices, rising wages and increased training costs are also pinching them.
United's costs this year are now expected to be higher than in 2019, instead of going down. American estimates its costs would be 5% higher in 2022 than in the pre-pandemic year.

United reported an adjusted loss of $1.60 per share for the quarter through December, compared with a loss of $7.00 per share a year ago.
American's adjusted loss for the quarter came in at $1.42 per share, compared with a loss of $3.86 per share a year ago.

(Reuters) -Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wall Street's premier investment banks, this week informed staff of bumper bonuses for 2021, following a record-breaking year for Wall Street dealmaking.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) increased its annual bonus pool for top-performing investment bankers by 40% to 50%, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, increased its annual bonus pool for top-performing investment bankers by 30% to 40%, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment.
Record levels of deal-making and trading activities have driven profit at investment banks this year as economic stimulus measures helped propel stock markets globally to all-time highs.
Top performers in M&A advisory and equity capital markets enjoyed some of the biggest bonuses at both Goldman and JPMorgan, the people said.
Bankers in Goldman's M&A advisory and ECM divisions were handed an average 40% increase in bonuses with the very best performers seeing rises of 50% or more.
The bank's partners were handed special stock bonuses, some of which amounted to multimillion-dollar packages, the sources said. Bankers who worked on some of the biggest deals of the year were among those who received the most generous awards, one of the sources said.
Wall Street's biggest banks are facing cutthroat competition to hire and are paying more to recruit and retain top talent. But that comes at a price.
In the latest quarter, non-interest expenses at the nation's biggest banks ballooned by tens of billions of dollars, hurting profit growth, earnings disclosures showed.
The cost of retaining talent put a dampener on record 2021 earnings from both Goldman and JPMorgan.
JPMorgan Chase reported last week that its non-interest expenses jumped 11% in the fourth quarter last year, largely due to higher staff compensation. Goldman reported a 33% rise in compensation expenses last year.
JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon said the bank would pay what it takes to retain the bank's top talent. 
""We will be competitive and pay and if that squeezes margin a little bit for shareholders, so be it,"" he told analysts.
Top executives at Goldman Sachs echoed those statements on Tuesday. 

""Our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to rewarding top talent in a competitive labor environment,"" Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman told analysts.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised its annual bonus for top-performing staff by more than 20%, Reuters reported last week.

The salary will be converted to ethereum and bitcoin, the statement added.
The mayor last year said he would take his first three paychecks in bitcoin and signaled his intention to make his city the ""center of the cryptocurrency industry"".
“New York is the center of the world, and we want it to be the center of cryptocurrency and other financial innovations,” Adams said in a statement. 
 Coinbase Global  operates an exchange that enables people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. 
Despite their rising popularity among retail and professional investors, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, have struggled to go mainstream due in part to their frequent fluctuations in value. 
Both Bitcoin and ethereum notched record-high values in November, only to see those values plummet leading up the new year. On Jan. 10, Bitcoin fell more than 5%, tumbling under the $40,000 level for the first time since September. In late morning trading on Thursday, a bitcoin was worth $43,309 and ethereum was at $3,250.
After his election in November, Adams also suggested that New York schools teach courses on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, and, following a similar pledge from Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, promised to convert his first three paychecks to bitcoin.

Adams converting his first paycheck to cryptocurrency “provides a leading example” of how New York City can “empower people through tech with a more diverse set of options to manage their finances,” New York City Chief Technology Officer Matt Fraser said in a statement. 
Although Adams has yet to propose specific policies that would make New York a cryptocurrency hub, digital asset enthusiasts have called his embrace of bitcoin encouraging, and believe his stance could attract more digital asset start-ups to New York.

(Reuters) -  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) said COVID-19 cases among its staff and paid time off for people getting inoculated may hurt its ability to move freight in the current quarter, but that impact should still be less than the 4% slump in volume in the previous quarter.
The company's chief executive officer Lance Fritz, in an interview with Reuters on Thursday, did not disclose the number of positive COVID-19 cases but said it had a ""real impact"" on operations.
Fritz, however, stuck to the company's 2022 volume guidance and remains confident it will be ahead of U.S. industrial production, which is forecast to grow at 4.8% for the year.
Staff shortages due to COVID-19 cases may be the latest headache for North American railroad operators, who are already grappling with supply chain disruptions. 
Evercore ISI analyst Jonathan Chappell warned that staff COVID-19 cases and paid time offs will likely hit shipments at other rail operators as well.
CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX) is set to report its results after the bell on Thursday while Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co,  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd and  Norfolk Southern  Corp (NYSE:NSC) are reporting next week.
PRICE HIKES BOOSTS RESULTS
Union Pacific took advantage of a strong industrial demand to ship freight at higher prices during the quarter. Total operating revenue in the quarter ending Dec. 31 rose 12% to $5.73 billion, above analyst estimates of $5.58 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Operating ratio at the largest U.S. railroad operator by market value improved to 57.4% from 61% a year earlier. 
However, overall volume shipped during the quarter fell 4% as supply chain disruptions hit automotive and intermodal freight.

Net income for the quarter rose to $1.71 billion, or $2.66 per share, from $1.38 billion, or $2.05 per share, a year ago.
Shares of the company were up about 2% in afternoon trade.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wells Fargo & Co on Thursday said the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) terminated a 2015 consent order after the bank compensated customers harmed by its faulty product marketing and billing practices. 
The consent order https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2015-048.pdf related to billing and marketing practices the bank used when it sold various third-party identity theft protection and debt cancellation products to customers dating as far back as 2004. 
The bank was required to make whole customers who had bought the products, which typically involves refunds and compensation if the customer incurred additional related costs.
The bank did not disclose the number of customers affected or the total cost of remediation. It said it stopped selling the products in 2017.
While the OCC's decision to end the consent order does not have implications for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)'s daily operations, it suggests the bank is making progress addressing its legacy regulatory issues, which continue to be an overhang for its share price. 
The fourth-largest U.S. bank has been in the regulators' penalty box and paid billions in fines and restitution since September 2016, when its phony accounts sales scandal first came to light.
Wells remains under a $1.95 trillion asset cap that the Federal Reserve imposed, as well as around a dozen consent orders with regulators.

The bank is still working on a separate 2018 sweeping OCC consent order related to its selling of mortgage and auto-insurance products, which imposes a number of constraints on the bank’s business.
Wells' Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said last week satisfying the bank's regulators was a ""a multi-year effort.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chairmen of two congressional panels on oversight and trade on Thursday assailed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s expansion in China's far-western Xinjiang region, where detention camps have drawn heavy criticism, and asked the electric car maker about its Chinese product sourcing.
""Your misguided expansion into the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region sets a poor example and further empowers the (Chinese government),"" Democrats Bill Pascrell and Earl Blumenauer, who head two House of Representatives Ways and Means subcommittees, wrote in a joint letter to Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.
Tesla made a New Year's Eve announcement https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tesla-criticised-opening-showroom-chinas-xinjiang-region-2022-01-04 that it opened a showroom in Xinjiang, becoming the latest foreign business caught up in tensions related to the region. 
Xinjiang has become a significant point of conflict between Western governments and China in recent years. U.N. experts and rights groups estimate that more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps there.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Pascrell and Blumenauer in the letter asked Musk whether Tesla sources any goods made or manufactured in Xinjiang and, if so, to identify them. They also asked whether Tesla has any financial relationships with companies connected to Xinjiang and whether Tesla plans to expand into other regions in China.
The company operates a factory in Shanghai and is ramping up production there amid surging sales in China. China has also become an export hub for Teslas bound for Europe and other markets.

President Joe Biden and U.S. lawmakers have stepped up pressure on companies to distance themselves from Xinjiang. Biden signed a law on Dec. 23 barring imports of goods made in the region. The two lawmakers said the questions to Musk were in part to ""better understand Tesla's compliance"" with the new law and other U.S. trade regulations.
The United States has labeled China's treatment of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang as genocide. China has rejected accusations of forced labor or any other abuses there.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 01:16PM ET</span>",Evergrande creditors raise threat of action over default,"By Clare Jim and Marc Jones
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - A key group of China Evergrande's international creditors said on Thursday they were ready to take ""all necessary actions"" to defend their rights if the property developer did not show more urgency to resolve a default.
Evergrande is the world's most indebted property company, with more than $300 billion in total liabilities, which include nearly $20 billion of international bonds all deemed to be in default after a run of missed payments late last year.
The creditor group, represented by law firm Kirkland & Ellis and investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC), said in a statement it had to ""seriously consider"" enforcement action after a lack of engagement by the firm at the heart of China's property crisis.
One of the creditor group's advisers later told Reuters that Evergrande's team had been in communication in response to the statement, which had stressed it was prepared to take ""all necessary actions"" to defend its legal rights.
Evergrande and its advisers at U.S. investment bank Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) declined to comment. 
The property giant last month set up a risk management committee, including officials from Chinese state entities, and it has repeatedly said that this group and the company itself would actively engage with creditors and protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved.
""Actions speak considerably louder than words,"" the creditor group said in its statement, adding that the overriding impression was that Evergrande ""has disregarded its offshore creditors and the legal rights of its creditors"".
Despite efforts to engage in substantive dialogue, the group said, it has ""received little more than vague assurances of intent, lacking in both detail and substance"" and urged Evergrande not to make any asset sales without consulting first.
""The AHG (ad-hoc group) expects and calls on the directors (of Evergrande).. to strictly comply with their fiduciary duties which require them, amongst other things, to have regard to and act in the best interests of their creditors"".
(Graphic: Evergrande's woes hammered Chinese high yield debt markets, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwpkrkbnevm/Pasted%20image%201642697501345.png) 
PROPERTY RIGHTS
Evergrande's international market bonds are lower in the legal pecking order than Chinese market bonds that the company has been fighting hard in recent weeks to keep out of default.
The international debt is what is known as 'unsecured' and issued by a Hong Kong offshoot, meaning creditors do not automatically have the right to seize anything on the mainland, where Evergrande has almost all of its 1,300 projects.
Those bonds are trading at just 10-15% of their original value, meaning that their owners may feel they now have little left to lose by taking legal action.
The first step down that path would be to 'accelerate' a bond still with a future repayment date. That would then see the bond's 'trustee' order Evergrande to pay the debt immediately.
If the developer failed to come up with the money, a 'winding up' order could be made against Evergrande's Hong Kong entity that issued the debt. It would open a host of new options, although it would still be difficult for the creditors to claim any assets in mainland China.

""We continue to remain hopeful that they will engage constructively,"" Neil McDonald, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis told Reuters, adding: ""But we will take appropriate steps to protect the rights of creditors (if necessary)"". 
The price of Evergrande's defaulted bonds barely budged after the statement. Its shares had gained 4.65% in Hong Kong as Chinese property stocks extended a rebound triggered by signs that Beijing is looking to ease some pressure on developers.

Investing.com – Regions Financial stock (NYSE:RF) fell 3.4% Thursday after the bank reported a 30% drop in its fourth-quarter net profit.
Net profit in December quarter came in at $414 million compared to $588 million a year ago. Total revenue was $1.63 billion after taking a hit of 3% as both net interest and non-interest income fell.
Total loans extended during the quarter were lower than a year ago and came in at around $87 billion.
Net interest income is a bank’s bread-and-butter metric that measures the difference between the interest earned on loans and the one paid out to customers for their deposits. Non-interest income is basically fees the bank earns on services provided to customers such as investment advisory and asset management.
Among fee-based services, both capital markets and mortgage businesses suffered. The bank said the year was the best for its capital markets division since it began rebuilding that business in 2014.
During the fourth quarter alone, the bank completed three acquisitions. This included deals for point-of-sale lender EnerBank, commercial real estate loan origination platform Sabal Capital and M&A advisory services provider Clearsight Advisors.
The bank closed the quarter with deposits of nearly $137 billion, growing around $17 billion from a year ago."

(Reuters) -Unilever's strategy was under the investor microscope on Thursday after the consumer goods group effectively abandoned its 50 billion pound ($68 billion) pursuit of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s consumer healthcare business.
Shares in the maker of brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise ended down 0.7% after Unilever (NYSE:UL) said on Wednesday that it would not raise a rejected offer.
It said its view on the value of the healthcare business had not changed despite GSK lifting financial forecasts for the unit, which is 32% owned by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and makes products such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers. 
Some analysts said Unilever's management, under pressure after a 31% drop in its share price since highs seen in late 2019, had been wise not to be drawn into upping their bid for a business that GSK has said it wants to spin off. 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts called it a ""smart move,"" saying that the decision ""shows that whilst Unilever remains very keen on the asset, it is disciplined and will not do the deal at any price.""
Others said the proposed mega-deal, which would have been one of the largest ever on the London market, had been unexpected and raised questions about Unilever's plan under Chief Executive Alan Jope for a more gradual shift away from lower-margin goods to health, beauty and hygiene products.
""From our discussions with shareholders and Unilever share price action, we believe there is a clear discontent with management and the board over the changed strategy and focus on transformative M&A,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note.
Meanwhile, a group of investors said they had filed a fresh resolution urging Unilever to address a ""crucial blind spot"" and set ambitious targets to sell healthier foods.
Last week, Terry Smith, whose Fundsmith vehicle is Unilever's 13th biggest investor, lambasted the company for being ""obsessed"" with promoting its sustainability credentials at the expense of performance.
Smith took aim at Unilever again on Thursday, labelling the bid ""a near death experience,"" and reiterating calls to focus on the operating performance of the existing business ""before taking on any more challenges"".
'CALLED THEIR BLUFF'
GSK, led by Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, has stuck to its plans to spin off the consumer healthcare unit despite previous pressure from activist investors to consider alternatives.
It had rejected three approaches from Unilever, and the final proposal made on Dec. 20 comprised 41.7 billion pounds in cash and 8.3 billion pounds in Unilever shares. 
GSK's stock closed down 2% on Thursday. 
""Unilever cannot increase any offer, not because the value of GSK's consumer (unit) would not warrant it, but simply because Unilever's investors expressed a no-confidence vote on Unilever's CEO doing any deal of this size,"" a GSK investor, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Barclays analysts asked if GSK had overplayed its hand. 
""By saying (GSK) sees £50 billion as fundamentally undervaluing the business, it now makes it very difficult to accept the £50 billion on the table whilst still saving face,"" they said. 
""Some investors think that Glaxo may have overplayed their hand and Unilever has called their bluff."" 
Other large targets could be available for Unilever, with the consumer remedies industry, traditionally a part of the prescription drug sector, undergoing major transformation.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in November unveiled plans to spin off its consumer health division, owner of Listerine and Baby Powder brands, to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is looking for ways to potentially accelerate delivery of Taiwan's next generation of new-build F-16 fighter jets, U.S. officials said, bolstering the Taiwanese air force's ability to respond to what Washington and Taipei see as increasing intimidation by China's military.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they have not yet come up with a solution on how to speed delivery of Block 70 F-16s, manufactured by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and equipped with new capabilities. The aircraft are currently slated to be delivered by the end of 2026.
Taiwan's government has privately expressed its wish for a faster delivery to U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, a senior Taiwanese official said, as the self-ruled island's air force scrambles jets to intercept increasingly aggressive Chinese military flights https://graphics.reuters.com/TAIWAN-CHINA/byvrjrmgnve. 
More missions mean more wear-and-tear on Taiwan's aircraft.
""It's all about risk assessment ... and it's clear where the risks are,"" the Taiwanese official said, referring to tensions across the sensitive Taiwan Strait separating the island from mainland China. The F-16 is considered a highly maneuverable https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104505/f-16-fighting-falcon aircraft proven in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack.
Taiwan is on track to field one of the largest F-16 fleets in Asia once it takes delivery of 66 new-build F-16 C/D Block 70 aircraft under an $8 billion deal approved in 2019. It would bring the island's total number of F-16s, including older versions, to more than 200 by 2026.
Any move to accelerate deliveries of new aircraft could ultimately come down to a determination by Biden's administration that Taiwan's defense needs are more urgent than those of other U.S. allies and partners, according to experts.
""That's a Biden administration decision,"" said Rupert Hammond-Chambers, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council, an organization that encourages trade and business ties between the two. ""They would have to decide that the threat from China was more important than the threat from Iran or the threat from the Russians.""
The Block 70 aircraft are the newest F-16 configuration, with new avionics, a modernized cockpit and an improved engine, according to Lockheed Martin. 
A move to accelerate the aircraft delivery would be seen in Beijing in part through a political lens, according to Abraham Denmark, a former senior Pentagon official. 
""It is yet another clear signal of U.S. determination to support Taiwan's ability to defend itself,"" added Denmark, now an analyst at the Washington-based Wilson Center think tank.

Despite lacking formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the United States is the island's main international backer and arms supplier. That defense relationship angers China, which has ramped up military and diplomatic pressure against the island that it claims as ""sacred"" Chinese territory.
In the face of Chinese pressure, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has prioritized modernizing the armed forces, which are well-armed but dwarfed by China's military. 
Lockheed Martin declined to comment on any potential future requests to change the production schedule, referring queries to the U.S. government and Taiwan's defense ministry.
The U.S. State Department, which oversees foreign military sales, declined to comment on any internal discussions about potential changes to the delivery timeline.
Lockheed Martin's new F-16 production line in Greenville, South Carolina has several customers in the production queue ahead of Taiwan, including Bahrain, Slovakia and Bulgaria.
The U.S. government has not asked Lockheed Martin for delivery timeline changes for the Taiwanese F-16 jets, a person familiar with the situation said. 
The source declined to speculate about how much sooner Taiwan could get new-build F-16s even if a decision were made to accelerate deliveries. Any such effort would be complicated by production constraints, which include long lead times to source materials for Taiwan's specific configuration of fighter aircraft.
Taiwan's Air Force did not respond to questions on potential accelerated deliveries but told Reuters in a statement that the Taiwanese military's major weapon purchases are ""rigorously planned in accordance with actual combat needs and planning schedules."" 
The U.S. sale of F-16s to Taiwan was guided by U.S. law and ""based on an assessment of Taiwan's defense needs and the threat posed by (China), as has been the case for more than 40 years,"" a Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement.
'WEARING OUT THEIR OPPONENT'
The missions to intercept Chinese aircraft are putting stress on Taiwan's air force, which last year had several mishaps, including three fatal crashes. Over time, fuel costs, pilot fatigue and wear and tear on Taiwanese aircraft will threaten the readiness of the island's air force if this pressure continues, Taiwanese and U.S. military analysts said. 
Last March, a senior Taiwanese official said Taiwan's military had stopped intercepting every Chinese aircraft.
Taiwan's air force last week suspended combat training for its entire F-16 fleet after a recently upgraded model of the fighter jet crashed into the sea in the latest of a series of accidents.

""They (the Chinese) are wearing out their opponent without firing a shot,"" said Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. 
Taiwan's air force in 2020 scrambled 2,972 times against Chinese aircraft at a cost of T$25.5 billion ($905 million).

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany could find itself in a no-win situation if Russia invades Ukraine, pitting Berlin's main gas supplier against its most important security allies.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz would face pressure from the United States and other Western allies to respond to any invasion by stopping the recently completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany going into operation.
But doing so would risk exacerbating a gas supply crunch in Europe that has been widely blamed on a dearth of gas flows from Russia, and has caused energy prices in Europe to soar. 
The price surge has hit companies and consumers across the region hard, not least the low-income workers in Germany that Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) rely on for votes.
""Germany is between a rock and a hard place,"" said Marcel Dirsus, Non-Resident Fellow at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University. 
""The Scholz government wants to keep the Americans happy because they are Germany's most important allies outside of Europe. But they don't want to annoy the Russians either. That's tough to do.""
Russia has massed troops https://www.reuters.com/world/blinken-arrives-berlin-ukraine-talks-with-european-allies-2022-01-20 near its border with Ukraine and demanded security guarantees from the West, but denies it plans to invade its former Soviet neighbour.
Any invasion would be likely to trigger new international sanctions against Russia, with measures against Nord Stream 2 widely seen as one of the strongest ways to put pressure on Moscow.
But Scholz, who replaced Angela Merkel as chancellor late last year, already faces disagreements in his coalition government about how far German sanctions on Nord Stream 2 should go if Russia attacks Ukraine. 
The Greens would like to scrap the project, which is still awaiting regulatory approval, as they oppose fossil fuels. They also want to send a clear signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that military aggression abroad and undemocratic practices at home will not be rewarded with gas contracts.
The pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) have also signalled they prefer a tougher approach toward Russia.
Scholz will hope to find a compromise that satisfies both his coalition partners and senior members of his party such as Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht, who said Nord Stream 2 - which runs under the Baltic Sea and bypasses Ukrainian territory - should not be dragged into the Ukraine crisis.
MORATORIUM?
The European Union's most populous country and biggest economy is in danger of looking divided, and Scholz risks looking weak if he does not show firm leadership in the crisis. 
""Scholz appears too passive and absent,"" said Gwendolyn Sasse, senior fellow at Carnegie Europe, suggesting he should be trying to take on a bigger role in the EU.
The SPD sees itself as the natural heir to Germany's pioneering 'Ostpolitik' policy of opening up to the Soviet Union in the 1970s. But other European countries want Germany to do more to project Europe's influence and protect eastern neighbors that are nervous of what they see as Russian aggression.
Scholz could have one eye on opinion polls that show around 60% of Germans back Nord Stream 2, said Thorsten Benner of the Global Public Policy Institute (GPPi).
""For Scholz, there is also a concern about fairness: the U.S. is a major importer of Russian crude but hasn't committed to stopping imports while Germany is expected to call off Nord Stream 2,"" said Benner. 
Energy prices in Germany in December were up 69% compared with December 2020. Russian military action in Ukraine would be likely to push them even higher.
""In case of an invasion, we would see wild spikes in gas prices. All bets are off,"" said Hanns Koenig, an energy analyst with Aurora Energy Research.
The government would then face pressure to provide subsidies for low-income Germans and manufacturers that rely on gas for production, putting more strain on public finances already stretched by the coronavirus crisis. 
Some European politicians say Russia can do more to reduce prices and consumer bills in Europe, and have accused Moscow of using the energy situation for political purposes. 
""The flows of natural gas coming from Russia are at historically low levels,"" said Koenig. ""Russia is prioritising the routes it owns, and sending much less than they have done historically through the other ones.""
Russia denies manipulating supplies, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told visiting German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock this week that Western attempts to politicise the Nord Stream 2 project would be ""counter-productive"".

Dirsus said Scholz was unlikely to kill the project but could impose a moratorium on it in the event of an invasion.
""It will be a step designed to show the Americans and other allies that Germany is responding, but at the same time they will send a signal to Russia that the project could still be revived,"" he said.

Investing.com – RR Donnelley & Sons Co's stock (NYSE:RRD) surged nearly 6% Thursday after the ‘strategic party’ that’s been trying to outbid private investment firm Chatham Asset Management raised its offer to buy the business communications provider.
The unidentified suitor is now offering to buy RR Donnelley for $11.50 a share in cash, according to a statement by Donnelley. The buyer had previously offered $11 a share, which was more than Chatham’s $10.85 a share.
Donnelley's shares had climbed to a high of $11.31 by 11:15 AM ET on Thursday.
RR Donnelley continues to recommend Chatham’s offer. A proxy statement regarding that deal is expected to be filed Friday, and a shareholder vote is planned for Feb. 23.
The company was at the center of a bidding war between Chatham and Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Holdings for more than a month until its board decided Dec. 10 to go with the former. Chatham already owns around 15% stake in the company.
If the company does agree for purchase by the strategic party, the latter will pay both the expense reimbursement and the Atlas termination fee refund to Chatham on the company’s behalf. This will amount to at least $32 million, according to the RR Donnelley release."

NEW YORK, NY (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s top e-commerce executive Casey Carl is leaving the company at the end of February after nearly two years, the company said in an internal memo. 
Carl will be replaced by Tom Ward, Walmart's senior vice president of last mile deliveries. Ward's new title will be executive vice president and chief e-commerce officer starting February 1.
Carl is the latest executive to exit the company. Last week, Scott McCall, Walmart's chief merchandising officer of its U.S. unit, announced his retirement and was replaced by grocery chief Charles Redfield. Brett Biggs, Walmart's former chief financial officer left the company in late November. 
Carl, the Chief Omni Strategy and eCommerce Officer, led Walmart's omnichannel, e-commerce efforts, which include grocery delivery, Walmart+, marketplace and the incubation arm of Walmart, Store Nº8. 
""Casey has been a passionate advocate for our sellers and led the work to define and implement our seller value proposition, which has led to strong growth in our third-party Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services,"" Walmart U.S. Chief Executive John Furner said in the memo. ""I have appreciated Casey's contributions to the Walmart U.S. business.""
The incubator will now fall under the responsibility of Jennifer Jackson, senior vice president of enterprise strategy, M&A and strategic partnerships. 

Carl is also a 20-year  Target  (NYSE:TGT) veteran. During his time at the big box retailer, he led Target's innovation strategy to create new business models and platforms. He also led the company's omnichannel and Target.com. 
E-commerce has been a huge focus for Walmart. The company earlier this month announced that it would expand its e-commerce offering with InHome, a grocery delivery service that lets drivers enter customers' homes.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 11:07AM ET</span>","American Airlines sees returning to profitability in March, warns of higher costs","By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Abhijith Ganapavaram
(Reuters) -American Airlines Group Inc on Thursday forecast returning to profitability in March, after reporting a smaller fourth-quarter loss, but said cost pressures would remain elevated this year due to the Omicron coronavirus variant-induced turmoil.
The Texas-based carrier said ticket sales are still not back to pre-Omicron levels, but they are recovering ""quickly"" after dropping off ""considerably"" in early December.
The company said domestic leisure and short-haul international traffic were approaching their 2019 levels, but demand for long-haul international remained challenged.
Domestic business travel, which accounted for 30% of the company's 2019 passenger revenue, recovered in the latest quarter to about 70% of the pre-pandemic level. 
American, however, said the volatility in travel demand due to new COVID-19 variants has created ""the most challenging planning environment in the history of commercial aviation"".
The carrier plans to match its capacity with bookings trends. It expects its capacity in the quarter through March to be down about 8% to 10% compared to the same period in 2019. Full-year capacity is projected to be 5% lower than in the pre-pandemic year.
Its revenue in the current quarter is estimated to be down 20% to 22% versus the first quarter of 2019 due to the Omicron variant's impact on demand in the first two months of the quarter. 
Shares of the company were up 1% at $17.48 in morning trade.
U.S. carriers benefited from millions of Americans flying in November and December.
Demand during Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve was strong as well, although mass flight cancellations towards the end of the year due to rising COVID-19 infections among employees and inclement weather meant airlines could not fully tap that demand.
American said the impact of rising COVID-19 cases on travel demand, along with elevated fuel prices, would pressure its profits in near-term. Higher wages and increased training costs are also pinching the company.
The carrier said it plans to hire another 18,000 employees this year after adding 16,000 new team members last year.
It expects higher costs in the current quarter than in the same period in 2019. Overall, costs this year are now expected to be 5% higher than in 2019.

On an adjusted basis, American reported a loss of $1.42 per share for the quarter through December, compared with a loss of $3.86 per share a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, had expected a quarterly loss of $1.48 per share.
Operating revenue for the quarter rose to $9.43 billion from $4.03 billion a year earlier.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 11:06AM ET</span>","Shareholder Terry Smith labels Unilever's GSK bid ""near death experience""","By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Influential British fund manager Terry Smith attacked Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s failed 50 billion pound ($68.2 billion) bid for GSK's Consumer Health assets as a ""near death experience"" and urged Unilever management to focus on strengthening performance.
In a letter to investors of his Fundsmith vehicle, now the 13th biggest Unilever shareholder, Smith criticized Unilever for failing to openly communicate the benefits of the deal and its ""penchant for corporate gobbledegook as substitute for effective action."" 
""It seems to us that Unilever management's response to its poor performance has been to utter meaningless platitudes to which it has now attempted to add major M&A activity. What could possibly go wrong?,"" said the letter, signed by Smith and head of research, Julian Robins.
Unilever did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Late on Wednesday, Unilever effectively abandoned its offer for GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s Consumer Health unit, after the deal was widely panned by the market and analysts.
GSK had said the bid undervalued the business and that it would go ahead with its plan to spin it off instead.
""We are pleased that the Unilever management listened and has seemingly ended the attempt to acquire GSK Consumer by refusing to up its bid for a fourth time,"" the letter said, describing its critique as a post-mortem into a ""near death experience"" in the form of the failed approach.
Smith's ""near death experience"" phrase echoed comments made by Unilever's previous CEO Paul Polman when describing his successful fight against a hostile takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) in 2017.
Having rejected the bid, GSK's consumer business would face its own reckoning when it is listed as a separate company later this year, the Fundsmith letter added.
This isn't Smith's first recent attack on Unilever.

Last week, he criticised Unilever for being ""obsessed"" with sustainability at the expense of performance, after the stock featured among its equity fund's bottom-5 performers in 2021.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 11:06AM ET</span>",U.S. attorney general to meet with Boeing 737 MAX crash victims' relatives,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland plans to meet with relatives and lawyers of victims of fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes after some challenged a deferred prosecution agreement struck with the planemaker, the Justice Department said.
In December, some victims' relatives said the Department had violated their rights when it struck the January 2021 agreement with Boeing over the two crashes in a five-month period that killed 346 people.
They filed a motion arguing the United States government ""lied and violated their rights through a secret process"", and asked a U.S. judge to rescind Boeing's immunity from criminal prosecution, which was part of the $2.5 billion agreement, and order the planemaker publicly arraigned on the felony charges. 
The Justice Department said in a court filing late Wednesday the meeting with Garland would take place ""within the next week"", and that it wanted to delay responding to the families' motion until then.
A Garland spokesman and Boeing both declined comment.
The January 2021 settlement allowed Boeing to avoid prosecution, and includes a fine of $243.6 million, compensation to airlines of $1.77 billion and a $500 million crash-victim fund over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane's flawed design.
Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in the Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash, said he was pleased Garland will meet with crash victim relatives. ""Attorney General Garland has a chance to fix this injustice, hold Boeing accountable, and deter future corporate criminal behavior,"" Stumo said.
The Justice Department deal capped a 21-month investigation into the design and development of the 737 MAX following the two crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019.
The crashes ""exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers,"" the Justice Department said.
In October, a former Boeing chief technical pilot for Boeing was charged with fraud for deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet. He has denied wrongdoing.

The crashes, which cost Boeing some $20 billion and led to the plane's 20-month grounding that was lifted in late 2020, prompted Congress to pass legislation reforming new airplane certification.
The $243 million fine, which the Justice Department said was at the ""low end"" of the sentencing guidelines, represented the amount Boeing saved by not implementing full-flight simulator training.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s recipe for the department store of the future includes algorithmic recommendations and what one corporate director called ""a magic closet"" in the fitting room.
The online retailer is making another push to grow its fashion business, announcing on Thursday it will open its first-ever apparel store this year, with a tech twist. ""We wouldn't do anything in physical retail unless we felt we could significantly improve the customer experience,"" said Simoina Vasen, a managing director.
At 30,000 square feet (2,787 sq meters), the planned ""Amazon Style"" shop near Los Angeles is smaller than the typical department store. Model items are on the racks, and customers scan a code using Amazon's mobile app to select the color and size they would like. To try on the clothes, which are stored in the back, shoppers enter a virtual queue for a fitting room that they unlock with their smartphone when it is ready.
Inside, the dressing room is ""a personal space for you to continue shopping without ever having to leave,"" Vasen said. Each has a touchscreen letting shoppers request more items that staff deliver to a secure, two-sided closet ""within minutes,"" she said.
""It's like a magic closet with seemingly endless selection,"" Vasen said.
The touchscreens suggest items to shoppers too. Amazon keeps a record of every good a customer scans so its algorithms personalize clothing recommendations. Shoppers can fill out a style survey as well. By the time they arrive in a fitting room, employees have already deposited customers' requested items and others that Amazon has picked.
Shoppers can opt out with a concierge's help, Amazon said.
Amazon has unveiled tech to help customers choose outfits before. The company has surpassed Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States, according to analyst research. 
But it still has room to expand and compete with the likes of Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN), which have opened smaller-format stores. Amazon's lineup of physical grocery and convenience shops have yet to upend brick-and-mortar retail. 

The company's new store aims to attract a broad range of shoppers with hundreds of brands, Vasen said, declining to name examples.
It has hundreds of associates, and no cashier-less checkout like some Amazon stores, Vasen said. Still, using a biometric system known as Amazon One, customers can pay with a swipe of their palm.

ByteDance retained its second-ranked position in China’s online advertising market last year, with a market share of 21%, according to a recent report published by researcher Interactive Marketing Lab Zhongguancun.
The number one position was still held by e-commerce giant Alibaba, and third place went to gaming giant Tencent, according to the report. 
The overall growth of online ad sales in China declined to 9.3% in 2021 from 13.8% a year earlier, the report says.
Tech news website The Information last November reported that ByteDance's 2021 revenue was on track to rise about 60% to 400 billion yuan ($63.07 billion).
ByteDance is one of the world's biggest private tech companies with recent trades in the private-equity secondary market valuing it at about $300 billion, Reuters has reported.

The revised outlook came on the back of record holiday season sales, with revenue growth of more than 30% and same store sales 25% higher for the nine weeks ended Jan. 1.
Signet's preliminary total sales for the holiday season came in at $2.4 billion. The company said sales were broad-based with all banners and merchandise categories up double digits. Increased marketing and labor spending supported consumer shopping behavior, it said.
The company said January sales have remained strong in the high single digits, reflecting some shifts due to earlier customer shopping in the quarter. With 10 shopping days remaining in the current quarter, the company said it believes it will deliver a sequential same store sales acceleration from the third to the fourth quarter.
Signet now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $2.77 billion, with same-store sales rising 22%. As per the previous guidance, revenue was estimated to rise to a maximum of $2.48 billion. Adjusted operating income is now seen at $388 million compared to $317 million at the higher end of its previous guidance range.
The company said it will add $500 million to the remaining $184 million available under the existing share repurchase program. Within this, it intends to enter into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement after which $434 million would remain, according to a statement by the company."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday after a surge in initial jobless claims tempered fears of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 151 points, or 0.4% at 35,179 points, recouping around half of what it lost in Wednesday's selloff. The S&P 500 was likewise up 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.0%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that initial jobless claims rose to a three-month high of 286,000, well above forecasts, against a backdrop of widespread disruption to the service sector in particular from the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19. With most of the federal government's support for those hit by the pandemic now having been withdrawn, any rise in joblessness is more likely to have an immediate impact on final demand in the economy, as well as redressing the balance in a tight labor market.
""The rise in claims reflects both an increase in layoffs due to the surge in Covid cases as well as an added boost from large seasonal adjustment factors,"" said Oxford Economics' Nancy Vanden Houten in a note to clients. She added, however, that she expects the weekly number to trend around 200,000 again, once the Omicron wave passes. There are tentative signs that that may already have happened, with the seven-day average of new infections having fallen around 6% from its peak last week. 
On a heavy day for earnings, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock stood out with a 2.2% fall after it warned that it wouldn't return to pre-pandemic levels of capacity until next year at the earliest. Rival  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) stock also suffered as it reported a $931 million net loss for the quarter and spoke in only vague terms about returning to profitability in its quarterly report. 
If the travel sector suffered from negative pandemic-related newsflow, freight services had no such problems.  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) stock and CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) stock both rose 1.7% after the railroad operators both posted strong quarters, UPR's performance bolstered in particular by shipments of industrial materials and lumber. 
Lumber prices have surged again as housing starts have weathered last year's spike in prices. However, there were signs earlier that rising mortgage rates are starting to have an impact on the housing market. Existing home sales fell well short of expectations in December. 
Elsewhere, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock rose another 9.8%, continuing to receive inflows after getting regulatory approval to become a bank.  Meanwhile, Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) stock rose 2.2% after the company reported a strong fourth-quarter that allowed it to expand its buyback program. "

“We believe the broader macro recovery should translate into rising energy demand for 2022 and relatively tight supplies for oil and natural gas,” Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli said Thursday in the Houston-based company’s fourth-quarter earnings report. The world’s No. 2 oilfield contractor beat analysts’ expectations with fourth-quarter orders of $6.7 billion, up from $5.2 billion from a year earlier, according to the statement.
The hired hands of the oil patch are staging a comeback after the coronavirus pandemic triggered an historic blow to crude demand. Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR), along with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co., have endured years of painful cost-cutting and made efforts to pivot away from the boom-and-bust shale patch. But with the global economy rebounding, the world’s three biggest oilfield servicers are expected to deliver strong results for the final three months of 2021.
“The economic recovery coupled with several years of oilfield underspending has given rise to a new energy cycle,” Charles Minervino, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, wrote in a note to investors last week. “The diversified services companies should exit 2021 on a high note.”
Baker Hughes on Thursday was the first of the big three oil-services companies to release financial results for the final three months of the year, posting sales of $5.5 billion that also beat analysts’ expectations. Fourth-quarter earnings, excluding certain items, were 25 cents a share, missing analysts’ estimates by 2 cents. 
The latest batch of order for Baker Hughes, which was led by its turbomachinery business, was more than $1 billion higher than analysts expected, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Global oil drilling is climbing from a crater after rig counts plummeted to record lows in late 2020. Explorers around the globe are expected to almost triple the pace of spending hikes this year compared to 2021, according to Evercore ISI. International regions are should be responsible for a record 81% of explorers’ global spending this year, Evercore analyst James West said by phone. 
That’s a promising sign for the big three service companies, which now generate most of their sales outside the U.S. and Canada. 
“Companies are all very well positioned heading into 2022,” J. David Anderson, an analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in an email before the results were released. “The question is where the growth comes first and fastest.”
Schlumberger, the world’s biggest oil-services provider, is expected to report results Friday, and Halliburton, the top provider of frack work, will release earnings Jan.  24.

441,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 09:36AM ET</span>",Banks loan growth focus could impact U.S. Treasuries - Credit Suisse,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. banks' appetite for U.S Treasuries could slow down as they shift their focus to loan growth, at the same time that the Federal Reserve plans to shrink asset holdings and raise interest rates to fight inflation, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Zoltan Pozsar.
Asset purchases by the Fed contributed to unprecedented liquidity and trading activity through the pandemic, but trading revenue at leading Wall Street banks fell in the fourth quarter as markets normalized and the U.S. central bank started scaling back its asset purchases, which resulted in lower trading volumes.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected 30% jump in quarterly profit, partly driven by $50 billion in record loan growth.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) posted a 6% increase in loan growth last week, while its trading revenues declined, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday missed quarterly profit expectations, hit by weaker trading revenues.
""Our view that bank portfolios will easily absorb U.S. Treasury issuance amid plenty of excess liquidity and slow loan growth is changing now that loan growth is back and QT is approaching"", Pozsar said in a report on Wednesday.
Pozsar was referring to ""quantitative tightening,"" a reversal of the Fed's bond-buying stimulus.
Less demand for long-term U.S Treasuries could put further pressure on yields that have jumped this month as investors adjusted to expectations that the Fed will tighten monetary policy more aggressively to counter unabated inflation.
""We are now at a stage where banks are more interested in making loans than buying securities – and that should have the back end of the Treasury market concerned"", Pozsar said.

Rate hikes, and therefore more expensive money, are expected to boost banks' margins as lending rates tend to rise faster than short-term ones banks use to borrow.
Bank executives and analysts have said Wall Street banks expect trading revenues to settle somewhere between pre-pandemic levels and the highs of the past two years.

Investing.com – Casper Sleep stock (NYSE:CSPR) surged nearly 13% in Thursday’s premarket after deciding to go private.
The mattress-maker is being acquired by entities related to Durational Capital Management, an investment firm focused on consumer companies. The transaction is expected to close next week, Casper said.
As per a Nov. 15, 2021, announcement, Casper stockholders will receive in cash $6.90 per share, a 94% premium to the closing price on Nov. 12, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger. That gave the company a valuation of around $287 million.

(Reuters) - Hedge funds that earn returns speculating on precarious acquisitions were handed a gift this week when  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) agreed to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $68.7 billion in cash.
The transaction will require antitrust approval in the United States as well as other major jurisdictions including the European Union and China. It comes as President Joe Biden's administration is raising its scrutiny of big mergers, blaming some of them for price increases on consumers that fuel inflation. 
Activision's shares ended trading at $82.15 on Wednesday, well below the $95 per share deal price, reflecting concerns that regulators may shoot down a combination that would create the third biggest gaming company, after Tencent and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp.
This infers a 57% chance of the deal closing, based on Activision's closing share price of $65.39 before the deal was announced.
The wide spread gives investors willing to bet on whether the deal will be completed the opportunity to score double-digit returns. At a time when so-called merger arbitrage strategies have trailed the broader stock market's returns, it is an attractive but also risky proposition.
Last year, merger arbitrage funds returned nearly 10% according to Hedge Fund Research data, beating returns posted in 2020, 2019 and 2018, but trailing the broader S&P 500 stock market's 27% gain in 2021.
For some investors, Aon (NYSE:AON)'s scuttled $30 billion acquisition of Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WTW) as the U.S. Justice Department sued to block the deal hurt returns.
Now they are looking to come back, hoping that this deal will also force competitors into making deals of their own.
""The positive outlook for event-driven and merger-arbitrage oriented firms in 2022 has been accelerated with the Microsoft-Activision deal,"" said Hedge Fund Research Inc President Ken Heinz.
Microsoft and Activision gave themselves until June 2023 to complete the transaction, giving hedge funds months to handicap how regulators will react to Microsoft bundling its Xbox platform with Activision's popular games, such as World of Warcraft and Diablo. 
Investors may get hints on the Biden administration's stance soon as the Federal Trade Commission is expected to weigh in on defense contractor  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s planned $4.4 billion acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and the Justice Department will decide on healthcare insurer UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH)'s $13 billion bid for healthcare analytics and technology vendor Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG).

Hedge funds like Millennium, Tiedemann Advisors and Pentwater Capital spend a chunk of their capital betting on mergers and many have held Microsoft and Activision for some time. Mutual funds The Merger Fund run by Westchester Capital Management and The Arbitrage Funds run by Water Island Capital offer similar strategies.
Representatives for the firms either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) -A group of investors in Unilever (NYSE:UL) said on Thursday they had filed a fresh resolution urging the company to fix a ""crucial blind spot"" in its strategy and set ambitious targets to sell healthier foods.
The resolution by an 11-strong investor group with $215 billion in assets, including Candriam, Actiam and Greater Manchester Pension Fund, calls on Unilever to disclose the current proportion of sales linked to healthier products. 
It also urges the company to set a target to ""significantly increase"" that share by 2030, and publish an annual review of their progress.
While Unilever, owner of the Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Pot Noodle brands, is seen as a leader in sustainable business by many funds, the investors said increasing regulations around health meant a failure to act could hit its finances.
Governments in many of the company's main markets have introduced taxes on products high in sugar or calories as obesity levels rise.
“Unilever has long been a sustainability leader. Some even criticise it for being too focused on ESG. Yet the health profile of the food and drink products it sells remains a blind spot,"" said Ignacio Vazquez, a senior manager at responsible investment NGO ShareAction, which co-ordinated the resolution.
British fund manager, Terry Smith, whose Fundsmith vehicle is a top-10 Unilever investor, lambasted Unilever last week for being ""obsessed"" with promoting its sustainability credentials at the expense of performance. 
""By voicing their support for this resolution, Unilever's investors can help to drive change at the heart of one of the biggest foods and drink manufacturers in the world while also shielding themselves from regulatory and reputational risks,” Vazquez said.
In response, Unilever said it shared ShareAction's belief in the importance of having a long-term strategy for nutrition and health, and publishing targets, and had made a commitment to reduce sugar, salt and calories in its products.
The company said it plans to update its model for assessing nutrition in 2022, ""making it more stretching and ensuring it better reflects our current portfolio and the role our products play in the diets of our consumers"".
The resolution follows similar calls for action at last year's AGM, which ShareAction said had not resulted in much progress.
While Unilever said that in 2020, 61% of its food and drink sales were of products with ""high nutritional standards"", the investors said they questioned its metrics.
""It is key that a company with such a scale of leverage and capacity demonstrates efforts to set its targets and disclosures on the basis of government-endorsed nutrient profiling models where it operates,"" Sophie Deleuze, lead ESG analyst of engagement & voting at Candriam, told Reuters.
Deleuze urged Unilever to conduct and outline their risk profile in countries where it operates, factoring in aspects including existing and upcoming regulatory pressures, the health profile of customers, and their product preferences as a basis for reformulation.
The move comes at a turbulent time for the company, which late on Wednesday effectively abandoned a 50 billion pound ($68.11 billion) proposal to buy the consumer health unit of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).

Promoting healthy food and drink has become a hot-button issue for investors. Late last year, investors managing 12.4 trillion in assets urged policymakers to use fiscal and regulatory measures to help fix what they described as a ""global nutrition crisis"".

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ryanair has experienced a ""sea change"" in its confidence in recent weeks, a senior executive said on Thursday, on perceptions that the threat from the Omicron COVID-19 variant is easing and public attitudes to travel are improving.
Fares are also likely to rise across the European short-haul sector this summer due to lower available capacity, said Eddie Wilson, chief executive at Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in the Ryanair Group.
Wilson did not give specific guidance about Ryanair's prospects, citing reporting restrictions ahead of the company's third-quarter financial results on Jan. 31, but he did say the airline's focus was ""all about next summer"".
""There is a sea change, based on what we believe will be customer confidence and the timing of the peaking of Omicron,"" Wilson told Reuters in an interview when asked if the airline was a lot more confident than a few weeks ago.
""I think people's mindset has moved as well in terms of 'I'm traveling', 'I'm going',"" Wilson said. ""They can see the summer. They are not in the darkest days of where we were the previous year.""
Ryanair expects a 10-15% fall in available short-haul seats across Europe next summer to push up average fares in the sector compared to pre-pandemic levels, he said. 
""The macro view of this is that there are less seats in Europe, so broadly fares will be higher. They have to be,"" he said. 
Wilson said however that Ryanair had experienced fewer summer bookings than normal in the last few months due to concerns ahead of the peak of Omicron. 

He said Ryanair planned to increase the number of aircraft based in Italy this summer to 92 from 67 before the pandemic, reaching a market share of around 40%. 
He said however that he expected fewer aircraft to be based in Spain and significantly fewer in Germany due to airport costs.

(Reuters) -French train maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO)'s shares had a rocky morning on Thursday, after its quarterly update on sales and orders sparked a mixed response from traders and financial analysts.
The stock initially climbed over 3% before plummeting to trade down 5% and trigger an automatic dealing suspension on Euronext Paris, as investors sold off holdings built up during a strong rally at the turn of the year.
Alstom reported higher sales and orders for October-December, its fiscal third quarter, fuelled by growth in Europe and bigger market clout thanks to its acquisition of Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF)'s rail unit a year ago. 
However, finance chief Laurent Martinez told analysts the level of sales earning no margin would remain the same over the second half of its fiscal year and into the next as it works through a backlog of unprofitable business.
""The shares started moving within minutes of that comment,"" said Redburn analyst James Moore, who believes the market will now adjust its profit expectations for the near future.
Alstom confirmed all its financial targets, including a return to a positive-free cash flow over October to March, after first-half outflows reached nearly 1.5 billion euros.
It had previously feared an even higher outflow after marking up provisions for integrating some challenging projects it inherited from Bombardier.
The 5.5 billion-euro acquisition, which is approaching its one-year anniversary, should make the group the world's second-biggest player in its sector behind China's CRRC. 
Alstom said the integration was on track and indicated it would not need to take further provisions.
The company, which makes trains and signalling systems for urban and regional rail networks, reported third-quarter sales of 3.92 billion euros ($4.45 billion), up 6% on a proforma basis. Orders were up 5% on the same basis to 4.58 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Poland's largest drug maker Polpharma is working on a possible $4 billion takeover of Czech rival Zentiva and is looking for investors to join its bid in return for a minority stake in the Advent International company, three sources said. 
Discussions between Polpharma and potential partners are at an early stage and the Polish company has yet decide how it would structure a joint bidding vehicle, the sources said on condition of anonymity, warning that no deal was certain.
Polpharma's move comes after Advent snubbed proposals from banks last year for an initial public offering (IPO) of Zentiva as stock market listings slowed down in the second half of 2021, the sources told Reuters.
Polpharma needs a deep-pocketed private equity firm to help finance the bid that could value Zentiva at 3 billion to 3.5 billion euros ($4 billion) and it has hired JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to select potential investors, the sources said.
A representative for Polpharma said it was ""constantly looking for acquisition targets and partnership opportunities in its own and new territories"", but declined to comment on any specific deal.
JPMorgan declined to comment while Advent was not immediately available.
Private equity firms have paid high prices to hoover up large generic drug portfolios from major pharmaceutical firms in recent years, playing a key role in the creation of big industry players, but some are now looking to realise their investments.
'PRICE IS KEY'
The market for generic drugs is expected to grow from $411.6 billion in 2020 to $650.3 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate of 9.6%, according to a study by BCC Research.
Boston-based private equity firm Advent bought Zentiva, which makes a wide range of generic and over-the-counter drugs, from French pharmaceutical giant  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) for 1.9 billion euros in 2018.
Zentiva's medicines are sold in more than 40 countries and the Prague-based company has manufacturing sites in the Czech Republic, Romania and India, according to its website.
Under Advent's ownership, Zentiva's core earnings have risen to about 200 million euros through a series of acquisitions including the takeover of British firm Creo Pharmaceuticals in 2019 and the purchase of the Central and Eastern European business of rival Alvogen in 2020, one of the sources said.
Zentiva, led by Chief Executive Nick Haggar, could be valued at a multiple of more than 15 times its core earnings, the source said, adding that its valuation surged after the full integration of the Alvogen business.
Advent, however, is in no rush to part ways with its portfolio company and could back the business for another year before exploring strategic options, two of the sources said.
""The bid price is key to luring Advent to the negotiating table,"" one of them said. ""Advent is not running any auction process. It is up to interested parties to force their hand.""

On Nov. 15, Zentiva denied a Czech press report that Advent was looking to sell the company in a transaction worth between 2.4 and 3 billion euros.

LONDON (Reuters) -British food delivery company Deliveroo hit the top of its forecast for 60-70% growth in gross transaction value in 2021 after GTV rose by more than a third in the fourth quarter despite a tough yearly comparison when new lockdown restrictions were coming into force. 
Food delivery boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic when pubs and restaurants were closed, and the popularity of the platforms has not faded since hospitality reopened. 
Deliveroo founder and Chief Executive Will Shu said the performance was ""really encouraging"", although he cautioned that the first quarter of 2022 would be the hardest comparison because many of its markets were in full lockdown in the first three months of 2021.
He said the average order value of 21.40 pounds ($29.12) in the fourth quarter was down 5% year on year, reverting back to pre-COVID levels. However it was slightly up on the third quarter and the frequency of orders from its 8 million active monthly customers had increased to 3.4 per month, from 3.3 in the third quarter. 
""We feel good about the consumer engagement side,"" he said in an interview.
The company was also not struggling to recruit riders, he said, despite competing opportunities in other sectors because they valued the flexibility on offer.
Deliveroo, which competes with the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Just Eat Takeaway, said it grew market share as it improved its customer offer, including more grocery options, which accounted for 8% of GTV in the second half of 2021.
Shares in Deliveroo, which have lost more than half of their value since listing at 390 pence in March 2021, were trading up 2.6% at 174 pence on Thursday.
The company, which has yet to make a profit even as demand has boomed, said it maintained its guidance for gross profit margin as a percentage of GTV at 7.5-7.75%.
Shu said he would guide on 2022 when the company reports full-year results in March, and he would also talk about the longer-term path to profitability.

""This is a giant market that's still in its infancy,"" he said. ""We're going to invest where we see appropriate, but we have got to do that with increasing levels of efficiency.""

Investing.com – American Airlines stock (NASDAQ:AAL) traded 1.3% higher in premarket Thursday after its October-December numbers beat estimates.
Total operating revenue more than doubled to over $9 billion as the carrier flew more passengers and freight. The loss per share of $1.42 more than halved from last time and was narrower than expected. That was despite the fact that fuel and related taxes in the fourth quarter more than tripled from a year ago to $2.2 billion.
The carrier continues to operate well below levels that were normal before the pandemic. It expects its January-March capacity to be down 8%-10% compared to the same period in 2019 and revenue to be down by 20%-22%. The airline said it will continue to match its capacity with booking trends.
The airline’s forecast that was limited to the first quarter, in contrast to that of rival United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), which said last night that capacity won't get back to pre-pandemic levels at all this year.
The airlines’ comments come after Omicron wrecked their recovery plans just when things were looking up after almost two years of the pandemic.
Pilots and staff called in sick in December and with harsh weather conditions adding to the commotion, airlines were forced to cancel thousands of flights during the peak holiday season. To ensure limited operations, they had to pay higher incentives to staff which ensured the company’s on-time performance in the last month was better than any December in years prior to the pandemic.  Operations continue to face other disruptions, too, with the launch of 5G cellular service prompting some further flight cancellations over airplane safety concerns.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 07:30AM ET</span>",Tesla Berlin factory to elect works council on Feb 28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Berlin factory will elect its first works council on Feb. 28, Germany's largest union IG Metall said on Thursday, expressing concern that it was too soon for the election to result in a truly representative body.
Only one in six of the roughly 12,000 workers expected at the plant have been hired so far, in part because Tesla is still awaiting final approval from local authorities to begin production. The council will consist of 19 members.
IG Metall, which represents workers across automotive companies as well as other industrial sectors, fear that calling an election before a wider swathe of workers are hired will lead to a council top-heavy with management.
Under German labour law, only employees who have been working at a company for at least six months can stand for election.
The results of the election will be valid regardless of what proportion of the workforce votes, and a new election can only be called after two years if the workforce has grown by more than 50%.
""Those hired so far do not represent the workforce as it will look when production begins or reaches full capacity,"" said Birgit Dietze, head of IG Metall's regional office for Berlin-Brandenburg-Saxony, where Tesla's factory is located
Her comment echoed statements she made in November, when the union established that an election was on the cards.
A Tesla representative was not immediately available for comment.

Chief Executive Elon Musk has sparred with organised labour in the past and was ordered in March last year to delete a comment made on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in 2018, which threatened to strip U.S. employees of their stock options if they formed a union.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 07:06AM ET</span>",DHL expects freight rates to stay high in 2022,"DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - German logistics company Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) DHL does not expect freight costs to ease this year and is advising customers to agree longer-term contracts as a hedge, the head of the DHL freight business said in an interview.
""The short-term rate will rise a little in air and ocean freight, the long-term rate will probably remain at the 2021 level,"" Tim Scharwath told Reuters.
""In air freight, the rate might even go up a little bit more in the short term, there is even tighter capacity there.""
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted global supply chains, slowing flows of raw materials, parts and consumer goods.
Shortages of freight capacity - both ocean and air - have pushed up shipping costs globally, with the pandemic also extending port waiting times due to labour shortages and traffic disruptions.
U.S. rival FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) warned this month that rising cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant has caused staff shortages and delays in shipments transported on aircraft.
""In sea freight, we will not return to the rates we had before the coronavirus crisis,"" Scharwath said. 
""If you want to sell a stool for 10 euros from China, then this can become a problem due to the transport costs,"" he said. ""This will also force a review of some business models.""
Scharwath recommended that customers sign contracts for two to three years to hedge against future price rises: ""You buy stability through long-term commitment."" 
The DHL freight unit expects the high rates to continue to buoy profits in 2022: ""Our goal is to keep the operating result at least at the high level we had in the first nine months of 2021,"" Scharwath said.
The division, which employs more than 42,000 people and was once the group's problem child, has become a profit generator under Scharwath's direction. 
He wants to keep the operating margin above 5.5% by 2025. The unit recorded a margin of 5.7% in the first nine months of 2021.

DHL says its freight division is the market leader in the air freight market ahead of Kuehne+Nagel, and number two in sea freight among logistics firms behind that company.

The New York-based company, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, is seen as a bellwether for the insurance sector as it typically reports before its peers.
The insurer said it earned a core income of $1.29 billion, or $5.20 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $1.26 billion, or $4.91 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of $3.86 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Travelers' pre-tax net investment income jumped 10% to $743 million, driven by higher returns on its private equity and real estate partnership.
Its net written premiums rose 10% to $7.9 billion.
Travelers said the catastrophe losses it incurred in the quarter mainly stemmed from tornado activity in Kentucky, windstorms in multiple U.S. states and a wildfire in Colorado. 

Devastation from tornadoes that slammed parts of the United States in December are expected to push the insurance industry's 2021 bill for weather-related claims well above the predicted $105 billion, industry experts have said.
Travelers reported a combined ratio of 88%, compared with 86.7% a year earlier. A ratio below 100% means the insurer earned more in premiums than it paid out in claims.

461,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 06:06AM ET</span>",Unilever will not raise rejected 50 billion pound bid for GSK consumer arm,"(Reuters) - Unilever (NYSE:UL) PLC on Wednesday effectively abandoned its plans to buy GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s consumer healthcare business, saying that it would not raise its 50 billion pound ($68 billion) offer that GSK previously rejected.
U.S.-listed shares of Unilever rose 10.1% on the news, while GSK's fell 2.8%. The two stocks also trade on the FTSE, where the day's trading had closed. 
GSK has rejected three bids from Unilever for its consumer arm, which is home to brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste, Emergen-C vitamin supplement and Panadol painkiller, saying the bids ""fundamentally undervalued"" the business and its prospects.
It has said it would stick to its plan to separately list the business in mid-2022 and issued improved financial assumptions for the unit.
Unilever said in a statement it had noted these but ""determined that it does not change our view on fundamental value. Accordingly, we will not increase our offer above £50 bln"".
A spokesperson for GSK responded that the group was strongly focused on maximising shareholder value and very confident in the future of the consumer healthcare business in which  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) has a 32% stake.
""The Consumer Healthcare business has an exceptional portfolio and offers existing and prospective shareholders a highly attractive financial profile supporting investment and future returns,"" they added.
In a statement rebuffing Unilever's overtures last weekend, GSK said the bid failed to capture the unit's potential, releasing new forecasts that projected annual organic sales growth of 4%-6% for the business, which made sales of 9.6 billion pounds last year, over the medium term.
This estimate was above its prior forecast of seeking to beat the consumer health market's growth of about 4%.
The British drug maker said it intends to further share details of its strategy for the consumer brands unit at an investor day on 28 February. 
The event would follow its fourth-quarter results on 9 February where it might also throw some light on its thinking. 
Unilever's decision not to raise its bid comes after analysts and investors widely panned its offer, sending shares in the maker of Dove soap down 8% on Monday, on worries about the financial implications for the company.
A source familiar with Pfizer's strategy told Reuters earlier this week that GSK and Pfizer would open negotiations with Unilever's boss Alan Jope if the consumer goods giant was ready to improve its bid to more than 60 billion pounds.

462,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 05:45AM ET</span>",United Airlines Weaker as Omicron Forces Cut in 2022 Capacity Outlook,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – United Airlines stock (NASDAQ:UAL) traded 1.1% down in premarket Thursday after the carrier was forced to admit it won't return to pre-pandemic levels of traffic this year.
The airline had earlier estimated its capacity would grow 5% from pre-pandemic levels in 2022. The somber guidance comes as Omicron-variant Covid-19 delays the recovery in travel through a variety of channels. The company has had to cancel flights this year due to illness-related absenteeism and to international travel bans, hastily introduced by a number of governments to stop the spread of disease.
United estimates its costs in the current quarter to be 14%-15% running higher than in the same period in 2019, due largely to staff shortages and other supply chain problems. The price of jet fuel is also increasingly becoming a concern, with oil prices back at their highest in seven years.
United's total operating revenue for the December quarter rose 140% year-on-year to $8.2 billion, but that was still only at three-quarters of the same period in 2019. On an adjusted basis, the carrier reported a loss of $1.6 per share for the three months through December, its eighth straight quarter of losses. However, it was narrower than expected and a marked improvement from $7 a year ago.
“While Omicron is impacting near-term demand, we remain optimistic about the spring and excited about the summer and beyond,” United Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said in a statement.
United said its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-200 planes equipped with Pratt & Whitney engines would begin to return to service in the current quarter. It was forced to ground all of its 52 wide-body jets last year after one of its flights to Honolulu suffered an engine failure and made an emergency landing in Denver.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 05:35AM ET</span>",Boeing recovery sidetracked by regulatory tussles on big jets,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's steady climb out of successive crises - among the worst in U.S. corporate history - gained momentum last week when it won the 2021 jet order race https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-wins-annual-jet-order-race-adjusted-basis-2022-01-11 against rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) on an adjusted basis with a 737 MAX sales blitz. 
But closely watched orders and deliveries https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-vs-boeing-orders-deliveries-2021-2022-01-11 have underscored the industrial and regulatory currents still facing its bigger 787 Dreamliner and 777X flagships - issues that have left Boeing fighting concurrent battles on both sides of the Atlantic.
Regulators in Europe are challenging the safety net built in to 777X flight controls and deliveries of the 787 are expected to remain frozen until around April as U.S. regulators review production flaws, senior industry and government sources said.
The pressure surrounding two of the world's largest passenger jets highlights the immediate challenge to Boeing in the aftermath of fatal MAX crashes and the pandemic, though the rest of the industry is also bracing for a regulatory crackdown.
""There is such nervousness among the regulators who make these decisions, who sign off on these things, that they are missing something,"" one senior air safety expert told Reuters. 
""The reason for that is the aftermath of the MAX crisis https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-boeing-737max-timeline/timeline-boeings-737-max-crisis-idUKKBN27Y1RQ. What you now have is engineers looking at things differently than they ever had before,"" he said.
Initially designed and overseen by the same generation of engineers and U.S. regulators who oversaw the MAX, the upgrade to the large 777 has captured the attention of an increasingly assertive European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
EASA and Boeing are locked in a deeper than usual debate over engineering that will determine whether extra safeguards are needed for the jet's flight control system, the people said.
The European agency takes a back seat to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in certifying U.S. airplanes but its role as the other leading global regulator gives it a powerful say.
EASA has laid out an approach that could effectively force Boeing to add an extra fallback to guarantee that a single electronic failure cannot trigger simultaneous outages - a setup known as ""dissimilarity."" Alternatively, Boeing could try to prove that the current system is safe through thorough analysis. 
A major factor in the two MAX crashes that killed 346 people was a single point of failure embedded in the flight controls.
Although the decades-old architecture at the core of the 737 is radically different from the algorithmic brains of the 777, EASA's approach reflects the intense attention given to backups.
Boeing disagrees with EASA's indirect call for additional safeguards, arguing it would amount to having two systems provided by two separate suppliers running in parallel and risk introducing new problems by adding complexity, the people said. 
It is crunching data from over 1,600 hours of flight tests to build its own analysis. 
Boeing and regulators declined to give detailed comment on the rare stalemate over design principles. 
""As we work through the rigorous development, we continue to engage with the FAA and global regulators to ensure we meet their expectations and all applicable requirements,"" a Boeing spokesperson said.
EASA said it is cooperating with the FAA and noted that its job is not to dictate specific technical solutions.
""We are looking closely at the technical files with the FAA and Boeing and this work is still ongoing in an atmosphere of complete transparency and full cooperation,"" a spokesperson said.
The FAA said it would ""not approve any aircraft unless it meets our safety and certification standards.""
The financial impact of the dispute remains unclear.
A year ago, Boeing announced a $6.5 billion charge for certification delays and weaker-than-expected demand and pushed back 777X entry into service to late 2023. The design philosophy backed by EASA would delay this further, the people said.
HUMAN HAIR
In South Carolina, meanwhile, mechanics are combing through parked 787s with ultrasound devices and tools to measure gaps barely visible to the naked eye - an undertaking that makes full resumption of deliveries unlikely before April, the people said. 
The gaps - left in the process for making carbon-composite structures that make the jet lighter and cheaper to fly - are the width of a human hair but violate Boeing's specifications. 
Boeing says the 787's problems stem from specifications that incorporate a high safety margin and that it reported the issue itself. Still, it depends on FAA approval to restore deliveries.
Boeing delivered 14 in 2021 compared with 41 in 2020. 
Now, a key question is whether the FAA will accept Boeing's assertion - backed by new analysis of composites and structural tolerances - that its initial specifications of the gaps can be tweaked without risking safety, two of the people said. 
""The issues that our engineers identified and are addressing are part of our methodical approach to ensure conformance to our exacting specifications,"" the Boeing spokesperson said.
Boeing said in October inspections and repairs due to the structural compliance problems would be roughly $1 billion.
But factory changes and other requirements to overcome tiny structural blemishes have raised longer-term questions over Boeing's ability to build 787s at a sufficiently low cost and at the rates once planned, a person familiar with the matter said.
Boeing may be able to make up ground by wringing out inefficiencies in manufacturing. And a recent decision to focus production in one state will reduce fixed costs.
For now, scrutiny remains intense.
When it comes to small gaps in the structure surrounding the passenger and cargo doors in the aft fuselage, for example, the FAA has required painstaking manual checks of some 100 aircraft.

That is instead of allowing Boeing to test only a sample of planes. 
""For decades, that was an acceptable way of saying the fleet is good,"" the senior safety expert said. ""Having to inspect every single airplane is technically, from a safety perspective, unnecessary. But in this climate it is required.""

Puma had previously warned supply bottlenecks and manufacturing disruptions would mean a shortage of products well into 2022. Factories in Vietnam, a major supplier to the footwear industry, closed for months last year due to COVID-19 outbreaks.
Puma said fourth-quarter sales rose a currency-adjusted 14% to 1.77 billion euros ($2.01 billion), above analysts' average forecast for 1.63 billion euros, according to a Refinitiv poll.

(Reuters) -Premier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling and Cadbury cakes, said on Thursday its annual profits would surpass market expectations after a stellar holiday season that saw households splurge on its cakes, sauces and other sweet treats in family gatherings.
Shares of the London-listed company rose 6.7% in early trade after it forecast trading profit of at least 145 million pounds ($197.58 million) for the fiscal year ending April, ahead of analysts' average estimate of 140.7 million pounds.
The group's optimism was reflected in robust sales across its top brands, with its trademark Mr Kipling delivering its best-ever Christmas sales.
Premier Foods had spent most of its earnings from the first half of the year to furnish its stock to avoid supply snags, as Britain's food distribution channels were hit by labour shortages from prolonged lockdowns, rising prices and Brexit.
The group's third-quarter sales fell 1.8% from a year earlier as restrictions were eased compared with 2020 when lockdowns had most people eat at home. 
However, they were still 7% above pre-pandemic levels in 2019.
""The principal takeaway for us is that PFD have maintained good underlying sales momentum, in a year of tough comps and have protected margins, in a year of high cost inflation,"" analysts at Jefferies said.
Sales of Mr Kipling and Cadbury cakes in Britain spurred the growth of Premier Foods' popular sweet treats category, while its grocery brands including Bisto gravy, Sharwood's sauces and Nissin noodles also saw strong demand.

The company, which traces its roots to the early 1800s, is also ramping up its expansion into international markets, as it expects the first shipments of Mr Kipling cakes to enter U.S. stores during the fourth quarter.

Investing.com – Amazon stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) was up 0.5% in Thursday’s premarket as traders warmed up to the company making a foray into offline retail of clothing, shoes and accessories.
The world’s largest online retailer is launching a clothing store in Los Angeles suburb of Glendale later this year. Amazon owns physical grocery and bookstores, but it has never sold clothing or shoes under that roof.
“You’ll find everything from the $10 basic to the designer jeans to the $400 timeless piece,” CNBC quoted Simoina Vasen, managing director of Amazon Style, as saying. “We want to meet every budget and every price point.”
The company will rely on smartphones and touchscreens installed inside stores to make selection a more pleasant experience. Customers won’t have to leave the fitting room to call for a new item. Each item will be dropped off in a secure closet, which will unlock after an associate has delivered it.  
Apparel is a focus area for Amazon. According to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts' estimates, Amazon’s 2020 apparel and footwear sales in the U.S. grew by around 15% in 2021 to top $41 billion. 
Amazon’s most serious display of its intent to have a physical presence became evident in 2017 when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion, although it had opened a bookstore two years prior to that.  
The company's accounts, which don't break out operating results for either Whole Foods or fashion-related sales, suggest that both operations lose money currently. Whole Foods in particular is struggling with loss of market share after introducing a $9.95 delivery charge at a time when many competitors are still offering free delivery over a certain order value.
Vasen said the Style stores won’t offer any special discounts for Prime subscribers."

MADRID (Reuters) -A rise in lending thanks to new mortgages drove a recovery in financial margins at Spain's Bankinter's in the fourth quarter, although net profit fell on one-off charges.
Net interest income (NII), earnings on loans minus deposit costs, rose 0.1% year-on-year to 320.2 million euros ($363.8 million), the bank said on Thursday. 
That beat the 319 million euros forecast by analysts and was 1.4% higher than the third quarter.
For the whole of 2021, NII grew 2.3%, in line with the bank's guidance for low-single digit growth. Chief financial officer Jacobo Diaz also guided for low-single digit growth this year.
Banks across Europe are under growing pressure from rising bad debts and record low interest rates, which is driving lenders to look for other areas of growth, such as commissions generated in private banking.
Brokers Keefe, Bruyette welcomed the ""overall solid quarter from Bankinter, with good growth in loan activity and fees.""
In 2021, Bankinter's lending book grew 5.7%, boosted by a 58% rise in new mortgage loans.
Shares in Bankinter fell 0.2%, having risen almost 14% so far this year up to Wednesday's close. Spain's blue-chip index Ibex-35 had gained just 0.7% in the same period.
Bankinter's net profit fell 15% to 82.5 million euros ($93.7 million) in the October-to-December period due to charges related to its contribution to national funds that protects bank deposits and the loss of income following the listing of its insurance business LDA in April. Analysts had expected a quarterly profit of 60 million euros.
However, net profit was still below the 106 million euros recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, Bankinter reported net profit of 1.33 billion euros compared to 317 million in 2020, boosted by 896 million euros of capital gains from the listing of LDA.

Prospects for war just do not bother markets the way they used to. U.S. President Joe Biden reckons Russia intends to ""move in"" on Ukraine, and even sowed doubt over whether the West would retaliate against any ""minor incursion"". 
Yet buyers have stepped in to lift MSCI's world stocks index after two days of falls, that saw the mighty Nasdaq enter ""correction"" territory, essentially a 10% fall from recent peaks.
Wall Street, for the time being at least, appears set for a bounce, with Nasdaq futures up around 0.7%. And yields on ""safe"" bonds from Germany and the United States are moving up again after a late-Wednesday pullback.
Reasons for the regular dip-buying are well-documented -- abundant cash, negative inflation-adjusted rates, robust company earnings. And China's first mortgage reference rate cut in nearly two years, shows that policy-tightening in the developed world may be offset at least by Beijing's actions.
And despite this month's hectic bond selloff, a reminder that yields on a global debt benchmark, the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Multiverse (7-10 years) have only just risen above 2%. 
Finally, all around are signs the world economy is emerging from the Omicron knock back of late-2021 and supply chain delays continue to ease. Japan's exports and imports in December hit record highs in terms of their value in yen 
Finally, so tight are labour markets in parts of the world that Australia even mulled letting 16-year olds drive forklift trucks, a proposal that's been put on ice, some may say fortunately. But the day may yet come.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 02:56AM ET</span>",Singapore lists first SPAC as Asia investors warm up to blank check firms,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A small blank-check firm backed by state investor Temasek made its Singapore debut on Thursday, marking the first such local listing as Singapore steps up a drive to emerge as a key venue for listings of this type.
This came four months after Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) allowed special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) or shell firms to list, easing proposed rules in response to market feedback.
The listing of Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) Venture's SPAC also marks the first major debut of such vehicles in Asia since the frenzy seen in the United States in early 2021 prior to regulatory changes there. 
""As the first SPAC in Singapore, we had to tread through difficult and unchartered waters,"" Chua Kee Lock, CEO of Vertex Venture, a Temasek subsidiary, told company executives, bankers and lawyers at a listing ceremony.
With an eye on sectors such as cyber security and fintech, Vertex Technology Acquisition Corp raised S$200 million ($148 million), with 13 cornerstone investors such as Temasek-linked entities and a fund operated by Dymon Asia, contributing 55%.
The SPAC last traded little changed from its offer price of S$5 per unit after being heavily oversubscribed.
Vertex Venture, the sponsor, which manages $5.1 billion of assets with a portfolio of 200-plus companies, has up to two years to find a target. 
""The point is to attract high-growth technology companies which conventionally would not have considered this market and now they have sponsors who can take over the risk also,"" Chua told Reuters this week.
SPACs raise money in public offerings, put it in a trust and then aim to merge with a private company and take it public, typically offering shorter listing timeframes and strong valuations.
Another SPAC, Pegasus Asia, backed by European asset manager Tikehau Capital and a holding firm of LVMH's chairman, among others, raised S$150 million and plans to invest in tech-enabled sectors. It lists on Friday.
A S$150 million SPAC sponsored by Southeast Asian industrial and technology buyout fund Novo Tellus Capital Partners, got investment from a Temasek unit and others. It lists next week.
Southeast Asia is seeing a boom in start-up funding as investors bet on post-pandemic technology plays.
SGX is offering a regulatory framework similar to that in the United States, including allowing participation of retail investors but also requires sponsors to invest in SPACs.
Analysts say risks include SPACs overvaluing companies and not finding ideal targets.
'HERE TO STAY'
""While there will always be gyrations in the market, we believe the SPAC framework is here to stay and complements the traditional IPO route,"" Mohamed Nasser Ismail, SGX's head of equity capital markets, told Reuters.
By focusing on sponsors' track records and ensuring their compulsory investment in SPACs, SGX is optimistic about SPAC listings.
While considered one of Asia's leading financial and business hubs, Singapore has not captured big IPOs. Last year, fundraising on SGX halved to $565 million, a six-year low, with just eight listings, Refinitiv data shows.
Hong Kong, home to large Chinese listings, is also allowing SPAC listings from this year but bars participation from retail investors.
Eng-Kwok Seat Moey, DBS' head of capital markets, said SPACs are being accepted by many investors as an alternative to gain access to start-ups which typically tap private equity markets.
""Several Singaporean and regional companies in high-growth, high-tech sectors will be mature for listing on public markets in the coming years,"" she said, adding that these would emerge as business combination targets for SPACs listed on SGX.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and DBS are the joint issue managers on the Vertex SPAC, and joint global coordinators, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

471,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 02:45AM ET</span>","India, Tesla in 'weird stalemate' on tax cut demands with no investment pledge-sources","By Aditi Shah and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Talks between India and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc over potential tax benefits are deadlocked as the government is not keen to give the company any breaks without a commitment to manufacture locally, people familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
Tesla is desperate to import and sell its electric vehicles in India and has for nearly a year lobbied officials in New Delhi to reduce tariffs, which the company's billionaire CEO Elon Musk says are among the highest in the world.
But Indian official sources said they have been unconvinced by Tesla's lobbying as the company has not yet shared any firm plan to invest in the country, something that would be in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" vision to boost local manufacturing and create jobs.
A third person with direct knowledge of Tesla's thinking said the discussions with the Indian government have reached a ""weird stalemate situation"". 
""Things are not moving ahead (for Tesla),"" said the person.
The sources declined to be identified as the discussions are private.
The apparent deadlock could upset the electric carmaker's ambitions for the South Asian country as it was pinning hopes on lower import taxes to make its cars more affordable and the business viable.
Currently, India levies an import tax of as high as 100% on electric vehicles which have a so-called landing cost -- a car's price plus inbound shipping charges -- of $40,000 or more. 
This would make India the most expensive market for Tesla cars in the world, putting them well out of reach for most Indian consumers.
The third source said Tesla has told officials it is open to sourcing more auto components locally and eventually moving towards manufacturing, but the government sources have indicated they want firm commitments.
""If they do not want to invest anything here, how is that model going to work,"" said one senior Indian government official, who added that a cut in the import duty was ""highly unlikely"" anytime soon. 
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Modi's office and India's ministries of finance and industries, which are all reviewing Tesla's demands, did not respond to a request for comment.
HARDLINE APPROACH
Tesla, though, has pinned its hopes on the upcoming federal budget on Feb. 1 - when such tax changes are typically announced - to see if its lobbying yields any result, or then rethink how it wants to approach the Indian market, the third source and a fourth person aware of the company's plans said. 
In its latest push, Tesla recently met officials from India's tax and customs department, the fourth source said. It has previously met Modi's office https://reut.rs/3GLpudL and sought a meeting for Musk with the prime minister to discuss its plans for India.

Modi's government has in the past taken a hardline approach against demands by foreign companies as it focuses on boosting local production. In 2017, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sought tax concessions, including lower import duties, to make iPhones locally, but many of its demands were rejected by Modi's officials. 
Musk has previously said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that Tesla could consider building cars in India if it succeeds in selling imported ones. He tweeted last week https://reut.rs/33pXP3H the company was ""still working through a lot of challenges with the government.""

""I have not yet decided whether or not I will stand again at the next Annual General Meeting,"" Schwan, also chief executive of drugmaker Roche, was quoted as telling the paper in an article published on Thursday.
""In any case, the task now is to stabilise the bank, and I am happy to support the new chairman in this,"" he added.
Switzerland's second-largest lender on Monday announced the abrupt departure of Antonio Horta-Osorio as chairman following an internal probe into his personal conduct, including flouting coronavirus quarantine rules in both Britain and Switzerland.
It was the bank's second change of chairman within nine months.
New Chairman Axel Lehmann and other managers will now continue attempts to reform Switzerland's second-biggest bank, still dealing with the fallout from a slew of earlier failings, ranging from spying on executives to investment losses running into billions of dollars.

475,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 01:25AM ET</span>",Qantas raises stakes in battle over long-haul cabin crew contract,"By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd will seek to terminate contract terms with long-haul flight attendants, the carrier said on Thursday, in a move that would bring large pay cuts, after union members voted against more flexible rostering.
Qantas said it was the first time in its history it had sought to terminate an employment terms agreement, or a contract between employers and unions, which is a rare and heated move in industrial relations in Australia. 
The move sets up the airline for a high-profile union battle at a time when it also needs to strike agreements with short-haul crew in order to seal the business case for a major Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) narrowbody aircraft order https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-wins-order-renew-qantas-fleet-sources-2021-12-15.
If it succeeds, cabin crew pay and conditions would revert to a much lower Australian minimum industry standard while a new pact is negotiated.
Qantas' latest contract offer to long-haul flights attendants was rejected by 97% in a vote in December. 
The Flight Attendants' Association of Australia (FAAA) said the deal sought to cut conditions and impose a two-year pay freeze followed by 2% pay rises at a time of growing inflation.
The airline said a union counteroffer was ""unworkable"" as it would have raised costs by A$60 million ($43.30 million) over four years.
""We're seeking termination because we can't effectively run our business without the rostering changes we desperately need to properly restart our international network in a post-COVID world,"" Andrew David, its international chief executive, said in a statement.
Under the existing agreement, cabin crew on the A330 fleet cannot be used on the 787 and A380 fleets, making it more difficult for Qantas to shift aircraft types. 
The FAAA said it was willing for crew to work on all aircraft, just not on the terms proposed by the company.
The airline is running just 20% of its pre-COVID-19 international capacity in the current quarter, as the Omicron variant prompts tougher border curbs in some nations.

Qantas said Australia's Fair Work Commission was expected to deal with the application in the coming weeks, with the airline requesting an expedited hearing. It said it was open to putting back on the table the same deal the union had rejected.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 12:21AM ET</span>",European firms make slow progress in appointing more women to boards,"(Reuters) - The proportion of women in leading positions at major European companies rose last year, but fell behind schedule to reach the European Commission's proposed target of 40% for 2025, a study by an EU-sponsored non-profit organisation showed on Thursday.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said earlier this month she would try to unblock legislation for a quota of women on EU company boards, which has been stuck since 2012.
The proposal calls for listed companies in the bloc to fill at least 40% of non-executive board seats with women.
Female representation at board level rose by one percentage point to 35% in 2021 after a similar rise a year earlier, according to the study by Brussels-based association European Women on Boards (EWOB), which analysed 668 top European listed companies, included in the STOXX 600 index and national benchmarks.
""At the current speed of change we will not be able to reach 40% women on boards by 2025,"" said Rosa Kriesche-Küderli, chair of research and communication at EWOB.
Progress is also slow in top jobs: in the second year of the pandemic, only 7% of the companies' chief executives were women, according to the study, after a jump from 4.7% to 6% between 2019 and 2020.
The number of companies with high scores on EWOB's Gender Diversity Index (GDI) rose to 84 from 62 in 2020. 
It defines a high score as an index reading of 0.8 and above, where zero means there are no women on the board or in senior management positions and 1 is 50% representation.

Dutch chemicals company DSM led the rankings with a score of 1, while British insurer Admiral showed the strongest annual progress, jumping to 0.94 from 0.6.
France, Norway and Britain led the country ranking with a GDI of about 0.7, while Greece, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Poland were at the bottom of the table.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. airlines said on Wednesday the rollout of new 5G services was having only a minor impact on air travel as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it has issued new approvals to allow more low-visibility landings.
The increased approvals for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus planes meant an estimated 62% of U.S. commercial planes could perform bad-weather landings at some airports, up from 45% previously, the FAA said.
Many international carriers had canceled flights to the United States or switched aircraft on concerns that powerful signals from the 5G rollout, which began on Wednesday, could interfere with airplane systems.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) agreed late Tuesday to delay switching on new telecom towers near key airports even as they turned on the new 5G C-Band service.
The FAA early Wednesday cleared aircraft using another three radio altimeters, which are used to give data on height above grounds for bad-weather landings. It approved two others earlier.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said it had seen a ""minor operational impact"" including some delays and four cancellations as a result of the new 5G service and some additional impact to its regional fleets.
It expected the FAA to soon issue additional approvals ""for our Airbus and regional fleets.""
United Airlines said it anticipated ""minor disruptions at some airports due to the remaining 5G restrictions.""
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said that initially ""because of favorable weather conditions, we anticipate very minimal impact on our operation.""
Airplane models with one of the five cleared altimeters include some Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, MD-10/-11 and Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350 and A380 models, the FAA said.
""Even with these approvals, flights at some airports may still be affected,"" it cautioned.
President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he had ""pushed as hard I can to have the 5G folks hold up and abide by what was being requested by the airlines.""

Verizon will temporarily not turn on about 500 towers near airports, sources told Reuters, or less than 10% of their planned deployment, while the carriers and the administration work on a permanent solution.
Verizon Chief Executive Hans Vestberg told CNBC Wednesday he was confident a review of the aviation concerns around those towers near airports will ""go fast.""

U.S. Treasury yields fell but remained higher for the week thanks to continually high inflation and expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes as soon as March 2022.
“The market is now facing uncertainty regarding both rate hikes and the balance sheet,” Standard Chartered Bank global head of G-10 FX research Steven Englander said in a note.
“We therefore see scope for the recent volatility to continue near term,” the note added.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes ended sharply lower on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq confirming it was in a correction, after a diverse set of corporate earnings and as investors continued to worry about higher U.S. Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy.
The Nasdaq ended down 10.7% from its Nov. 19 closing record high, as stocks sold off into the market close. A correction is confirmed when an index closes 10% or more below its record closing level. 
The Nasdaq's last correction was in early 2021, when the tech-heavy index fell more than 10% from Feb. 12 to March 8. It was the fourth time in the two years since the coronavirus pandemic shook global markets that the index has found itself in a correction.
On Wednesday, Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 2.1%, weighing most on the Nasdaq, while declines in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also dragged on the index. 
Stocks have gotten off to a rocky start in 2022, as a fast rise in Treasury yields amid concerns the Fed will become aggressive in controlling inflation has particularly hit tech and growth shares. The benchmark S&P 500 is down about 5% so far this year.
“Any beginning of tightening often results in significant volatility and I think there is always that risk that there is a policy error and it ends the economic cycle,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. ""So we just have a lot of apprehension.”

Malpass said during a Peterson Institute for International Economics virtual event that more capital needed to flow into poor countries, but these flows have been disrupted by unusually easy monetary policies in developed countries.
He said he was struck by the scale of Microsoft's acquisition deal for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard. This dwarfed the $23.5 billion in cash contributions agreed in December by wealthier donor countries to the International Development Association, the World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- about $8 billion annually over three years, he said. 
""You have to wonder: 'Wait a minute, is this the best allocation of capital?'"" Malpass said of the Microsoft deal. ""This goes to the bond market. You know, a huge amount of (capital) flows are going to the bond market.""
A very small portion of the developing world has access to such bond financing, while too much capital remains bottled up in advanced countries, especially in central bank reserve assets used to back long-term bond purchases, he added.
A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Malpass' remarks.
His comments echoed a similar call last week for central banks to cut long term bond holdings to free up lending capital. 
""That gets you into a situation where a huge amount of the capital is being allocated to already capital-intensive parts of the world -- the advanced economies -- building more and more on top of already heavily built infrastructure and real estate, for example,"" Malpass said.

Meanwhile, a return to more normal global investment returns is needed to bring more financing capacity to small businesses in the developing world,"" he said. 
""In order to address the refugee flow, that malnutrition that's going on, and so on, there has to be more money and growth flowing into the developing countries,"" Malpass added.

(Reuters) - White House officials met on Wednesday with small and mid-sized companies to discuss competition issues in the tech sector, as momentum grows in the U.S. Congress to rein in large technology companies.
The meeting was attended by Bruce Reed, president Joe Biden’s top tech advisor and deputy chief of staff; Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council and executives of smaller tech firms such as Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) and  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) Inc, the White House said. 
""The meeting focused on the challenges entrepreneurs, brick-and-mortar retailers, and other businesses face competing in sectors dominated by a few large platforms,"" the White House said in a statement.
Concerns discussed at the meeting included fees charged by large technology companies, how large tech firms operate an online marketplace for third-party sellers and also sell their own products on such platforms, and how businesses are ranked on those platforms.

Last year President Joe Biden signed an executive order to promote more competition in the U.S. economy, urging agencies to crack down on anti-competitive practices in sectors from agriculture to drugs and labor. He has since taken several steps to promote competition in the U.S. meat industry.
The meeting to discuss competition issues in the tech sector occurred ahead of a vote in the U.S. Senate on Thursday where the Senate Judiciary Committee will mark up a bipartisan bill from Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Republican Chuck Grassley that would bar companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from favoring their products and services.

(Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) is in advanced talks to acquire privately owned natural gas producer Chief Oil & Gas for around $2.4 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
A deal for Chief Oil & Gas, founded and controlled by Texan 'wildcatter' Trevor Rees-Jones, could be announced as soon as this week, the sources said. In wildcat drilling, exploration wells are dug in areas not known to be natural resource fields.
The acquisition by Chesapeake, a U.S. shale gas and oil producer that only emerged from bankruptcy just last year, underscores the recovery of parts of the energy industry as natural resource prices surge to multi-year highs. 
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private information, cautioned that negotiations could still fall apart at the last moment. 
A Chief Oil & Gas spokesperson declined to comment. Chesapeake did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reuters reported in October that Chief Oil & Gas was up for sale, amid the surge in energy prices that has boosted corporate valuations in the industry.
If completed, it would be the second acquisition which Chesapeake has made since February 2021, when it emerged from one of the largest oil and gas producer bankruptcies of recent years. In November, Chesapeake completed the purchase of Vine Energy for $615 million. 
Since exiting Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Chesapeake has focused on natural gas production, a return to its roots as a company founded in 1989 by wildcatters Aubrey McClendon and Tom Ward.
Rees-Jones launched Chief Oil & Gas in 1994. The company operates in the Marcellus shale in northeastern Pennsylvania and has around 600,000 net acres, producing more than 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of natural gas.

The sale of Chief Oil & Gas would be the latest combination of U.S. natural gas producers in the last few months.
Privately held Alta Resources was sold in July to EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) for $2.9 billion, and Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN) Co acquired Indigo Natural Resources for $2.7 billion in September and GEP Haynesville for $1.85 billion in December.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 07:37PM ET</span>",Nasdaq confirms fourth correction since pandemic hit,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - The Nasdaq's loss on Wednesday left it down nearly 11% from its November record high close, marking the fourth time in the nearly two years since the coronavirus pandemic shook global markets that the tech-heavy index has found itself in a correction.
The index of over 3,600 stocks traded on the Nasdaq exchange has had a rough two months since its most recent record high close on Nov. 19, with investors dumping technology shares due to growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will become more aggressive in raising interest rates to control inflation.
Several heavyweight growth stocks have underperformed the Nasdaq index since its last record close, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) down 15%, 12% and 24%, respectively. 
Rising interest rates tend to disproportionately harm shares of high-growth companies because investors value them based on earnings expected years into the future, and high interest rates erode the value of future earnings more than the value of earnings made in the short term.
According to a widely used definition, a correction is confirmed when a stock or index closes 10% or more below its record closing level. More loosely, many investors view a correction as a steep decline from a recent or 52-week high.
The Nasdaq has now declined 10% or more from a record high 16 times since 1995, and four times since the coronavirus pandemic slammed financial markets in February 2020.

The Nasdaq's recent tumble has left it trading at about 31 times the next 12 months' expected earrings, expensive by historic standards, but down from this time a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.

The Nasdaq remains up about 10% over the past 12 months, and it has more than doubled from its lowest close in the March 2020 sell-off fueled by the coronavirus outbreak.

484,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 07:36PM ET</span>","United Airlines cuts capacity forecast, flags cost pressure on Omicron turmoil","By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) on Wednesday trimmed its capacity forecast and warned of higher costs, after posting a smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter loss, citing turbulence from the Omicron coronavirus variant.
The Chicago-based carrier said the latest wave of the health crisis has depressed near-term demand even as bookings for the spring and beyond remain strong.
United said its priority is to match capacity with demand. As a result, its 2022 capacity is now projected to be lower than in 2019, instead of growing 5% as estimated earlier.
It expects to restore 82% to 84% of pre-pandemic capacity in the quarter through March, with revenue recovering to just 75% to 80% of 2019 levels.
Costs this year are now expected to be higher than in 2019, instead of going down.
United's shares declined about 2.5% to $43.31 in extended trading.
Rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) last week forecast a current-quarter loss due to the Omicron variant's impact on travel.
Winter storms and an increase in COVID-19 infections among employees have led to mass flight cancellations. In one day alone, nearly one-third of United's workforce at Newark Liberty International Airport called in sick. Last week, the carrier said 3,000 employees were infected with the virus.
In response, carriers have cut their flight schedules and are offering crew members not scheduled to work incentives to pick up additional shifts and trips.
To ease staffing issues, United is offering its pilots premium pay through the end of the month.
The incentives and flight cancellations are further inflating industry costs, which have gone up in the past year with efforts to ramp up operations.
United estimated current-quarter costs to be 14% to 15% higher than in the same period in 2019.
Analysts at Jefferies said cost pressures are expected to be a ""significant headwind"" for the carrier.
United said its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-200 planes equipped with Pratt & Whitney (PW) engines would begin to return to service in the current quarter.
It had to ground the wide-body jets after a United flight to Honolulu suffered an engine failure and made an emergency landing last year in Denver.
On an adjusted basis, the carrier reported a loss of $1.60 per share for the quarter through December, compared with a loss of $7.00 per share a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, had expected a quarterly loss of $2.11 per share.

Fourth-quarter revenue came in at $8.19 billion, compared with $3.4 billion a year ago, beating the consensus estimate of $7.97 billion.
United will discuss the results on a call with analysts and investors on Thursday morning.

(Reuters) -Walt Disney Co on Wednesday named company executive Rebecca Campbell to lead its new hub for international content creation to expand regional content for its streaming services.
Campbell will oversee the creation of more locally produced content to fuel the growth of Disney+, Hulu and Star+, as the video streaming services expand globally. 
Since the launch of Disney+ in late 2019, the company's streaming business has expanded rapidly, with its service amassing 179 million subscribers through the end of fiscal 2021. The company plans to double the number of countries where its flagship Disney+ service is available to 160 by the end of fiscal 2023. 
Disney's announcement that it would invest in local content mirrors Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s strategy. Dominant streaming service Netflix has capitalized on the global popularity of series developed outside the United States, including its most recent hit, the dystopian South Korean drama ""Squid Game.""
Burbank, California-based Disney has been taking tentative steps in the same direction.
Last October, Disney announced a slate of content from the Asia-Pacific region, including a documentary on the chart-topping South Korean girl group BlackPink, a romantic melodrama series starring Korean actor Jung Hae, and ""Tokyo MER"", a Japanese medical drama starring award-winning actors Ryohei Suzuki and Kento Kaku. 
At the time, Disney said it planned to commission more than 50 productions by 2023. In November, the first Disney+ original series produced in Latin America, “Disney Intertwined” (“Entrelazados”), debuted. 
Campbell will continue overseeing Disney's international media teams, in addition to her expanded role as chair of international content and operations, the company said. She will report to Chief Executive Bob Chapek.

Another Disney executive, Michael Paull, was promoted to the newly created role of president of Disney Streaming, overseeing Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Star+. He joined Disney in 2017 after the acquisition of the streaming technology company Bamtech Media, where he was CEO.
Joe Earley, who previously served as executive vice president of marketing and operations for Disney+, has been named President of Hulu, reporting to Paull.

Global jet fuel demand, however, has again come under pressure with some countries reimposing border restrictions and other curbs to keep the Omicron coronavirus variant at bay, prompting travelers to reconsider their plans. (https://reut.rs/3nIz0qm)
""We saw a little bit more downside momentum on jet fuel due to omicron variant, but combined, we didn't really see a meaningful impact as we exited the year,"" senior executive Dax Sanders said in the earnings call.
 Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) reported a 48% jump in jet fuel volumes and 7% jump in gasoline, following a year of coronavirus-driven decline. 
The company, which transports nearly 40% of the natural gas consumed in the United States, said its natural gas transport volumes were down 3% due to declines on Colorado Interstate Gas Pipeline as output from Rockies basins fell and El Paso pipeline outages. 
Kinder Morgan said in December it expects part of its El Paso natural gas pipeline to remain out of service for ""several months"" following a blast in Arizona that killed two people in August.

Excluding items, the company earned 27 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates of 26 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Adjusted profit rose 0.82% to $609 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $604 million a year earlier.

488,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 06:05PM ET</span>",5G flight disruption eases as Emirates blasts U.S. rollout,"By David Shepardson, Tim Hepher and Jamie Freed
(Reuters) -Disruption to U.S.-bound air travel caused by the rollout of 5G services in the United States eased on Wednesday as authorities approved more flights, but a top airline warned ""irresponsible"" regulatory confusion would be felt internationally for days.
Airlines and telecom companies have been at loggerheads over the deployment of 5G mobile services over concerns that the powerful signals could interfere with airplane systems.
Carriers across Asia, the Middle East and Europe cancelled flights to the United States or switched planes at the last minute on Tuesday and Wednesday, disrupting travel for thousands of passengers, over safety concerns caused by the 5G deployment.
But Japanese carriers said late on Wednesday they would restore cancelled flights and U.S. airlines said thousands of planes were operating normally after two telecom carriers agreed to delay the rollout at key airports.
The decision late on Tuesday by AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) to delay switching on new telecom masts near key airports, just hours ahead of a wider U.S. rollout, came too late to avoid a ripple of cancellations.
Much of the initial disruption hit the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777, for decades a workhorse of long-distance air travel.
Dubai's Emirates, the world's largest international passenger carrier and the largest 777 operator, hit out at ""mixed messages"" as it suspended nine U.S. destinations.
The airline's longstanding president Tim Clark told CNN it had not been aware of the extent of the safety concerns until Tuesday and let rip at what he called it ""one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible"" episodes in his career.
Some 32,000 Emirates passengers over the next three days ""will be completely inconvenienced as a result of flight cancellations,"" Clark said, adding the message about safety risks had ""got through at a very, very late stage"".
United Airlines, by contrast, said it was forecasting only ""minor disruptions"" due to remaining 5G restrictions.
International carriers are particularly exposed because of the lead time needed to prepare flights and pre-position crews ready to fly intercontinental jets home, experts said.
""The last-minute postponement happened too late to stop the crews being sent out for today's (return) flight. It just made it a nightmare,"" said a pilot with a major European airline.
Shares in European long-haul carriers fell by 3-4%, underperforming slightly weaker shares in U.S. airlines.
INTERFERENCE
U.S. airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration have warned that the 5G frequencies and transmission strength being deployed in the United States could interfere with radio altimeter readings needed for bad-weather landings on some jets.
Radio altimeters must give clear data on the height above the ground on approach to help with automated landings and also verify that a jet has landed before allowing reverse thrust.
U.S. President Joe Biden said he had ""pushed as hard I can to have the 5G folks hold up and abide by what was being requested by the airlines until they could more modernize over the years -- so 5G would not interfere with the potential of a landing"".
Boeing said it was working with all parties on a ""data-driven solution for the long-term"". 
Its 777 was last year the second-most used widebody plane on flights to and from U.S. airports with around 210,000 flights, behind the older 767, according to data from FlightRadar24.
European regulators say no risks have been found elsewhere.
The Federal Aviation Administration is frantically reviewing guidance on which airports and planes are affected.
On Wednesday, it said it had issued new approvals allowing some 62% of U.S. commercial airplanes to perform low-visibility landings at airports where 5G is deployed, up from 45% cleared previously.
Analysts said a slump in long-haul flying caused by pandemic border restrictions would limit the immediate airline impact.
""It's the off season, so in January or February airlines will be losing money and that's not counting the impact of the pandemic. At the moment they are fighting for survival,"" said James Halstead, managing partner at UK-based Aviation Strategy.

""Where it might hurt is that some airlines are using the same long-haul aircraft to carry freight,"" he added.
Airlines reporting cancellations or model switches earlier included Germany's Lufthansa, Korean Air Lines, Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and British Airways - all long-haul carriers with major freight operations.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Strong U.S. and European corporate results could not stop a slide on Wall Street, where the Nasdaq entered a correction, as rising crude prices kept inflation concerns alive even as bond yields eased a bit after earlier touching fresh multiyear highs.
The Nasdaq closed more than 10% lower from its Nov. 19 record closing high to confirm a correction as investors continue to price in the Federal Reserve moving faster to hike interest rates, fears that led to Tuesday's sell-off.
Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic initially rebounded, with an index of Europe's 600 biggest stocks rising as much as 0.8% as robust earnings from luxury majors Burberry and Richemont countered pressure from rising yields. Buoyant reports from UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co also initially lifted Wall Street.
But the gains faded as concerns about rising inflation and higher rates rattled the market as investors await the Fed's policy meeting next week for any changes to the central bank's plan to tackle inflation.
""The market is still grappling with how do you adjust to higher rates and what are the companies that are impacted by higher rates?"" said Jon Maier, chief investment officer at Global X ETFs. 
""The market was very excited that maybe the Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) (earnings) numbers (on Tuesday) weren't so bad. Then reality sunk in."" 
The broad STOXX Europe 600 index closed up 0.23%, but MSCI's all-country world index fell 0.74% as Wall Street sold off late in the session.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.96%, the S&P 500 slipped 0.97% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.15%. 
U.S. Treasury yields earlier hit fresh two-year highs, and Germany's 10-year yield broke into positive territory for the first time since May 2019 as investors bet policymakers will curb years of stimulus in order to fight rising asset prices.
The rise above 0% for the bund -- the euro zone's benchmark -- marks a turning point for regional debt, reflecting record-high inflation that is being exacerbated by supply chain disruption.
""This inflationary episode is unusually challenging in that it is driven by both strong demand and shortages of supply,"" said Guy Foster, chief strategist at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF).
Oil prices hit their highest since 2014 amid an outage on a pipeline from Iraq to Turkey and global political tensions that stoked fears of more persistent inflation and helped prop up the dollar, which hovered near one-week highs.
The market is making interest rate adjustments throughout the major industrialized economies, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
""Those countries that seem to be ahead of the U.S. in the queue of raising grades -- Canada, the UK and Norway -- have stronger currencies this year against the dollar,"" he said. ""Other areas like the Euro, Swiss franc are softer on the year.""
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.14% to 95.579. The euro was last up 0.16 percent at $1.1343, while the yen was last down 0.29% at $114.2800. 
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4% as tech stocks in particular suffered as they had on Tuesday in Europe and on Wall Street. 
Australia's main stock index shed 1.0%, while Japan's Nikkei hit a three-month low as worries over new curbs on businesses to halt a record surge in coronavirus cases curbed risk appetite.
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, rose 0.7 basis point to 1.047% late in the session after earlier trading lower. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 1.8 basis points to 1.850%, after also trading lower.
Oil prices rose for a fourth day after a fire on a pipeline from Iraq to Turkey briefly stopped flows, increasing concerns about an already tight short-term supply outlook.
Brent crude futures settled up 93 cents at $88.44 a barrel. The international benchmark has gained 28% since the beginning of December. U.S. crude futures rose $1.53 to settle at $86.96 a barrel.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 05:16PM ET</span>",Companies worry U.S. SEC climate rule may require broad emissions disclosures,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the U.S. securities regulator wraps up a draft of a landmark new climate change rule, environmental campaigners and activist investors want it to require companies to disclose not only their own greenhouse gas emissions but those generated by their suppliers and other partners.
Corporate groups, meanwhile, are pushing for a narrower rule that will make it easier and less expensive to gather and report emissions data, and which will protect them from being sued over potential mistakes.
Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started working on a new rule requiring U.S.-listed companies to provide investors with detailed disclosures on how climate change could affect their business. 
The rule is part of a broader effort by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to address climate change challenges and cut greenhouse gas emissions 50-52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, an ambitious pledge that will require every federal agency to do its part. 
Progressives and climate campaigners want the SEC to deliver a game-changing rule that will reveal all the emissions for which a company is responsible, while many investors say they need such data to fully assess companies' exposure to climate change and related policy measures. 
Initially, the SEC under Chair Gary Gensler said it hoped to publish a draft by October 2021. Last month, Gensler said it was aiming to issue a draft in early 2022.
Staff are still working on the rule, said two people familiar with the matter, and the SEC's commissioners, who must vote to propose regulations, have not yet seen a draft.
A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment.
A major issue staff are struggling with is whether and how some or all companies should disclose the broadest measure of greenhouse-gas emissions, also known as ""Scope 3"" emissions, according to the sources and company and investor advocates.
Corporate greenhouse-gas emissions fall into three buckets: Scope 1 are emissions a company generates. Scope 2 includes emissions it creates indirectly, for example by using electricity. Scope 3 includes emissions generated up and down the company value chain, including by suppliers and customers. 
Companies say there is no agreed methodology for calculating Scope 3 emissions and providing that level of detail would be burdensome. 
Disclosing second-hand emissions data from suppliers and partners could also expose companies to litigation by both the third parties and investors, if the information transpires to be misleading, they say. 
""The biggest point of contention is with Scope 3 emissions. ... the agency is asking companies about activities that are outside of the firm’s control,"" said Tom Quaadman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which is in discussions with the SEC on the issue. ""American companies can get sued on detailing those things.""
Some inside the SEC are sympathetic to companies' concerns and staff are exploring whether Scope 3 disclosures could fall under an existing legal safe harbor that protects companies' forward-looking statements, or whether a new safe harbor could be created, the sources said. 
Steven Rothstein of investor advocacy group Ceres, which is pushing for Scope 3 disclosures, said SEC staff contacted them in recent months seeking more feedback on Scope 3 issues, including whether to provide a safe harbor.
Another option on the table to reduce companies' legal exposure would see them publicly disclose Scope 1, 2 and some Scope 3 data, while filing sensitive Scope 3 data on suppliers and partners to the SEC privately, according the sources.
""The agency is trying to determine whether they should be part of the company's financial filing or can be provided or furnished separately,"" said Tracey Lewis, policy counsel on climate for Washington group Public Citizen who has also discussed the matter with the SEC.
SECTOR DISCLOSURES
Mandating some Scope 3 disclosures would see the United States go further than Europe and voluntary standards from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. 
That group, created by the G20's Financial Stability Board, proposes companies disclose Scope 3 emissions if material and appropriate.
A spokeswoman for the taskforce said it ""strongly encourages"" all organizations to disclose Scope 3 emissions.
It is unclear if the SEC's two Republican commissioners would support such a move, although Democrats have enough votes to push the draft rule through regardless. Hester Peirce, one of the two Republicans, has suggested emissions data disclosures are the domain of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
One big challenge for the SEC, say experts, is identifying which Scope 3 metrics help investors gauge a company's financial prospects, and ensuring the rule is flexible enough to generate specific, rather than generic information. 
While emissions disclosures may be important for carbon-intensive sectors like oil, gas and automakers, they may be less relevant for others and the SEC is considering how much detail companies should provide by sector, the people said. 
Some companies in carbon-intensive sectors, including oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp, have recently begun reporting Scope 3 emissions, amid pressure from investors and climate campaigners.
The SEC is also mulling how much data financial institutions, which finance carbon-intensive industries, should disclose, the people said. Many banks have pledged to reduce their emissions ultimately to zero, which could have major implications for their operations, they noted. 

Rothstein said the SEC had also asked him whether it should include Scope 3 for large, high-revenue companies, then phase in medium and small-sized companies a year or two later.
""Scope 3 disclosure of any kind is critical and we hope that the SEC will be bold,"" he added. ""The climate crisis requires no less.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority plans to look at enhancing the disclosure regime for broker dealers that sell digital assets, and may also update its rules around how options accounts are opened, the head of Wall Street's self-regulatory body said on Wednesday. 
FINRA may put out an ""early stage concept release"" aimed at ensuring investors know that when they buy digital assets from their brokers, those assets may not be regulated, Chief Executive Officer Robert Cook said during a webcast hosted by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. 
""There are disclosure rules that apply today and we want to give opportunities to talk about those and also to make sure, to see, if there are additional enhanced requirements that ought to apply,"" Cook said on the webcast, which was focused on FINRA's 2022 priorities. 
The regulator is also considering whether to update the rules around options account openings, he said.
FINRA's current rules around options were adopted decades ago and at that time investors looking to open an options account had to go through a registered representative who would decide whether it was appropriate for the customer to trade options based on past experience and trading activity, he said.

But since then, technological innovations have made options accounts more accessible to investors and some of the old rules do not reflect that, he said. 
""This is really a question about whether those rule sets need to be tuned up in light of the changes in technology,"" Cook said.

Mastercard received the largest fine of 31.56 million pounds ($43.04 million). The other companies fined were allpay, Advanced Payment Solution, Prepaid Financial Services and Sulion.
The Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) said the firms broke competition law by agreeing not to compete or poach each other's customers on pre-paid cards offered by local authorities to distribute welfare payments to vulnerable people.
The cartel meant recipients of the cards - who included the homeless, victims of domestic abuse and asylum seekers - could have missed out on cheaper or better-quality products, the regulator said. 
The PSR previously announced in March last year it planned to fine the five companies in preliminary findings. It said on Tuesday it had concluded the investigation. 
The regulator said during the course of the investigation, all the parties settled and admitted breaking the law.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 03:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Google aims to improve spotty enforcement of children's ads policy,"By Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said this week it would immediately improve enforcement of an age-sensitive ad policy after Reuters found ads for sex toys, liquor and high-risk investments in its search engine that should have been blocked under its efforts to comply with UK regulations.
Britain started enforcing regulations last September aimed at protecting children from being tracked online. Google in response began modifying settings across its services in Europe and elsewhere for users younger than 18 years. Among the measures it had touted in August was ""expanding safeguards to prevent age-sensitive ad categories from being shown to teens.""
Specifically, the search giant began using automated tools to stop ads related to categories such as alcohol, gambling and prescription drugs from being shown to people who are not logged in to a Google account or confirmed to be at least 18.
Tech companies face a growing challenge with policing their sprawling services, and, according to posts on online advertising forums and two advertisers, Google's enforcement has been spotty.
The advertisers, who sought anonymity out of fear of retribution from the tech company, said they have been frustrated about significant lost sales due to Google's search engine correctly blocking their ads from signed-out users while erroneously allowing their competitors' ads.
Ads were shown in the UK to signed-out users last week for leveraged trading, cholesterol medication, adult toy retailers and a major grocer promoting a vodka product, Reuters found.
""We have policies in place that limit where we show certain age-sensitive ad categories,"" Google said. ""The ads in question were mislabeled and in this instance should have been restricted from serving. We are taking immediate steps to address this issue.""
It declined to elaborate on the adjustments.
Google advertising rivals such as Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) either ban many categories of age-sensitive ads altogether or have put the onus on advertisers to target their ads in ways that limit exposure to minors. Microsoft declined to comment, and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.
The UK Children's Code requires online services to meet 15 design and privacy standards to protect children, such as limiting collection of their location and other personal information. Google said its filtering of age-sensitive ads is core to its compliance with the code.
Advocacy group 5Rights Foundation, which campaigned for the regulation and reviewed the findings by Reuters, said tech companies should regularly publish internal research on how well they are living up to the code and their own policies.
""We must be wary of ‘safety washing,'"" 5Rights said. ""Tech companies need to back up their claims with action, and demonstrate how they are complying with regulations, particularly in the early stages of implementation.""

Google did not respond to the comments. The company declined to share detailed information with Reuters about how often it had failed to block age-sensitive ads.
The UK Information Commissioner's Office said in November it had reached out to Google, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other companies in social media, streaming and gaming to review their conformance to the code. The review is ongoing, the privacy regulator told Reuters.

BOSTON (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) on Wednesday laid out goals for corporate borrowers to cut emissions that included a rare ""absolute reduction"" target for companies in the energy sector by the end of the decade.
Citi said in a report that it aims for emissions from companies across its energy loan portfolio to drop 29% by 2030 from 2020. Other banks have focused on cutting clients' ""emissions intensity,"" a measure of emissions relative to output that climate activists have said does not go far enough.
Citi did target a 63% reduction in emissions intensity for borrowers across the power sector.
A Citi representative said while global absolute emissions must decrease soon, it chose an intensity target for power ""because many aspects of the global economy will need to be electrified, so we’ll need to increase power generation while also decarbonizing it.""
The figures were in a report Citi issued detailing how, like other banks, it aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions associated with its financing by 2050.
As governments vow to cut planet-warming carbon emissions, attention has turned to practical questions of how banks, energy and power companies can transition to cleaner fuels without hurting global growth.
In an introduction to the report, Citi Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said the bank aims to balance its climate efforts with other goals like not exacerbating income inequality, especially in developing markets. Dropping clients, she wrote, would be a ""last resort."" 
Among global banks, Citi financed the second-largest amount of fossil-fuel activities in 2020, $48.4 billion, according to a report last year by climate advocacy groups. 

Several of those groups on Wednesday praised Citi's approach over rivals but said the New York bank should do more to restrict lending to the oil and gas industries.
“The bank should require companies to end expansion of fossil fuels as an explicit criterion in its client assessment,"" said Jason Opeña Disterhoft, a representative of the Rainforest Action Network, via e-mail.

Analysts Benjamin Theurer and Antonio Hernandez raised their target price on Cuervo's to 58 pesos from 55 and forecasted strong sales due to tequila ""further gaining importance in the U.S."" and the easing of supply chain constraints.
La Comer's target price was maintained at 41 pesos, but the analysts pointed to the company as a market leader in sales as it keeps gaining scale. They forecast that La Comer, bread maker Bimbo and bottler Arca Continental would finish 2022 with the consumer segment's highest margin expansions.
The analysts kept their target price for Alsea at 50 pesos and highlighted that the Mexican restaurant operator could gain market share due to the struggles its smaller competitors face after two years of the pandemic.

They maintained their target price for Femsa at 90 pesos, expressing caution about openings in its OXXO convenience store chain given the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, the analysts expect most of its business segment's revenues to reach pre-pandemic levels in 2022.
Mexico started the year as the only major economy in Latin America still lagging pre-pandemic GDP levels, but the Barclays analysts estimated its year-on-year growth at 3.6%, above the market consensus of 2.8% due to a gradual economic normalization and a boost from U.S. fiscal stimulus programs.

Tech stocks weighed on the broader markets, dipping briefly near bear territory, sparked by fear of rising interest rates as the yield on the 10-year Treasury reached its highest in two years.
Biden is expected to highlight his accomplishments, including the $1 trillion infrastructure plan and the $1.9 trillion Covid-relief package passed last year. But he is still trying to get his larger social spending bill through Congress, and he hasn’t been able to escape criticism for his administration’s handling of the pandemic.
Inflation has been a tough-to-tame issue for the Biden administration. The 10-year Treasury was hovering around 1.81% on Wednesday as investors expected the Federal Reserve to cut back on years of economic stimulus to fight inflation.
On the oil front, prices are at highs not seen since 2014 because of a pipeline outage between Iraq and Turkey, Reuters reported.
The week is light on data, though oil inventory numbers will come out later on Wednesday and then on Thursday morning, delayed for a day because of the U.S. market holiday earlier this week.

(Reuters) - North American railroad operators are expected to reveal a dour picture when they report fourth-quarter results as lower freight volumes due to port congestion, labor shortages and adverse weather dampen gains from higher shipment prices.
The COVID-19 pandemic knocked volumes shipped, but the companies were able to offset some of that impact by raising prices. That may not be enough to sustain profit growth anymore, analysts say.
""The key to the rails' show-me story remains volume growth, since revenues must carry the load as more than a decade of profit growth led by pricing and PSR (Precision Scheduled Railroading) reaches maturity,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Bascome Majors said.
Still, analysts see light at the end of the tunnel. Volumes are widely expected to pick up this year, with the bulk of the growth in the second half.
""We expect volume growth to reaccelerate in H2/22, as supply-chain performance and semiconductor supply improve, a new Canadian grain harvest approaches, and the prior-year comparables become easy again,"" brokerage TD Securities said.

Investing.com — General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) said Wednesday it plans to expand its hydrogen fuel cell business beyond electric vehicles. 
The company announced new commercial applications of its Hydrotec fuel cell technology, with projects such as heavy-duty trucks, aerospace and locomotives, currently in development.
GM is planning for multiple Hydrotec-based power generators. These will include a mobile power generator to provide fast-charge capability for EVs, the Empower rapid charger to help retail fuel stations, and a palletized mobile power generator to power military camps and installations.
According to the company, the aim of the generators is to replace gas and diesel-burning generators.
Electric cars are powered by a lithium-ion battery, while hydrogen fuel cell cars, which are being developed by some automakers, are refueled with hydrogen. However, GM is looking beyond just vehicles.
“Our vision of an all-electric future is broader than just passenger vehicles or even transportation,"" said Charlie Freese, GM's executive director of the global Hydrotec business.
Freese added that “HYDROTEC fuel cells can expand access to energy across many different industries and users, while helping to reduce emissions often associated with power generation.”
GM shares are down more than 3% Wednesday."

(Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday said it plans to expand its hydrogen fuel cell business beyond vehicles by supplying hydrogen-powered generators for uses including at construction sites, music festivals, data centers and the military.
The wider application of hydrogen fuel cells will allow GM to leverage and scale existing hydrogen investments and refine the technology, GM executives said.
""Think of places where you don't have a permanent installation for power generation, but you need clean power sources,"" Charlie Freese, executive director of GM's Hydrotec business, said on a call with journalists.
The company declined to say what revenue it expects from the new business, and said an availability date and price for the generators would be announced at a later time.
The hydrogen fuel-cell systems will be assembled by GM's joint venture with Honda in Brownstown, Michigan. Utah-based Renewable Innovations will build the generators, with production slated to start next year, GM executives said. 
As part of its Hydrotec business, the automaker previously announced hydrogen fuel cell collaborations with truck maker Navistar (NYSE:NAV) International Corp, locomotive developer Wabtec Corp and aerospace equipment manufacturer Liebherr Aerospace.

Hydrogen - a fuel obtained by passing electricity through water to split the element from oxygen - has been touted by companies and governments as a way to cut carbon emissions. But most hydrogen is currently produced by electrolyzers powered by natural gas or other fossil fuels, known as ""gray hydrogen."" It is four times costlier to produce ""green hydrogen,"" which is derived from renewable energy sources.
Freese said GM's goal was to increase the use of green hydrogen and was hopeful that costs would come down. He said the company was also looking to work with infrastructure providers to install more local hydrogen production systems and reduce the need for costly hydrogen transportation.

Loans grew during the quarter across every category except home equity, with average loans and leases, excluding those from the government's Paycheck Protection Program, up 3.4% from the prior quarter and 3.2% from a year ago, the bank said.
That compared with a 6% rise in average loans at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) In contrast,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co reported a 3% drop, although it noted positive trends to the upside in the final six weeks of 2021.
2021 started with ""green shoots"" and culminated ""with $50 billion in record loan growth this quarter,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on a call with analysts. 
""We note these borrowers, both consumer and commercial, have strong capacity to continue to borrow,"" he said.
The bank also released $851 million from its reserves for pandemic-related losses that did not materialize.
Combined spending on credit and debit cards grew 22% to $212 billion in the latest quarter, and while consumers continue to pay down balances, they also opened about 1 million new credit cards with the bank last quarter.
Overall, profit rose to $6.77 billion, or 82 cents per share for the quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analyst estimates of 77 cents per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. 
The bank reported revenue, net of interest expense, of $22.1 billion, up 10% from a year earlier.
Bank of America's net interest income (NII) - a metric that measures the difference between the interest earned on loans and paid out on deposits - rose nearly 11% to $11.41 billion, helped by significant growth in loans and deposits.
Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick expects NII to rise by a ""couple hundred million"" in the first quarter this year, compared with the fourth quarter last year, ""and grow nicely each subsequent quarter in 2022.""
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also beat quarterly profit expectations on Wednesday, capping a mixed earnings season for the nation's largest banks.
WAGE INFLATION
Revenue from the bank's equities division was up 3% in the quarter, while fixed income trading was down 10% as stock prices continued to soar despite temporary hiccups from the Omicron coronavirus variant and a hawkish Fed.
Non-interest expenses rose 6%, driven by higher revenue-related compensation. 
Bank of America, like other big investment banks and wealth managers, saw higher expenses from bonuses and other revenue-based compensation as bankers and financial advisers made the most of market volatility in the second-half of the year. 
Unlike some peers, Bank of America said it expected its expenses to be flat for 2022 compared with 2021 based on estimations that some costs related to the pandemic will ease. 
""What’s going to come out over time are some of the stubborn COVID costs,"" Borthwick said on a call with reporters. 
Borthwick said it now costs more to run a branch. The extra costs come from masks, hand sanitizer, new ventilation systems, extra cleaning and, in some cases, additional benefits for frontline workers.

However, he said the bank expects additional cost savings from more customers using digital banking.
Rebutting some analyst skepticism, Moynihan said he was confident the bank would be able to continue to invest in technology and compensation packages attractive enough to recruit talent in a tight job market and keep a lid on expenses.

509,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 02:06PM ET</span>",Racketeering lawsuit against McKinsey revived by U.S. appeals court,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived a racketeering lawsuit accusing the consulting firm McKinsey & Co of concealing potential conflicts when seeking permission from bankruptcy courts to perform lucrative work on corporate restructurings.
The 3-0 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan was a victory for retired turnaround specialist Jay Alix, who accused McKinsey of running a ""criminal enterprise"" by hiding its ties to lenders and its clients' competitors.
Alix said McKinsey's conflicts of interest should have disqualified it from 13 bankruptcies including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), food retailer Harry & David and coal producer Alpha Natural Resources, causing his former firm AlixPartners to lose assignments.
He also accused McKinsey of running a ""pay-to-play"" scheme in which it arranged meetings between clients and bankruptcy lawyers in exchange for referrals from those lawyers.
The appeals court said a lower court judge erred in finding that Alix did not allege a ""proximate"" link between McKinsey's alleged wrongdoing and harm to AlixPartners, in which Alix reported owning a 35% equity stake.
In addition, the court said the judge gave ""insufficient consideration"" to whether McKinsey undermined the integrity of federal judicial proceedings, in which litigants are entitled to know that the rules are being followed.
""If McKinsey's conduct has corrupted the process of engaging bankruptcy advisors, as Alix plausibly alleges, then the unsuccessful participants in that process are directly harmed,"" Circuit Judge Barrington Parker wrote.
The court did not rule on the merits.
It returned Alix's case to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan, who had dismissed it in August 2019.
Alix has battled McKinsey in multiple courtrooms since 2016.
""Mr. Alix has lost all six of his lawsuits against McKinsey, and we are confident the evidence will ultimately show that this lawsuit is similarly meritless,"" McKinsey said in a statement.
Sean O'Shea, a lawyer for Alix, in an email said the decision allows for ""fuller disclosures of McKinsey’s frauds"" at the trial court.

Alix has sought triple damages under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which lets people sue if they believe criminal enterprises caused them harm.
The case is Alix v McKinsey & Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-2548.

Investing.com — Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI), has many analysts bullish on the deal, with Piper Sandler's Brent Bracelin saying the acquisition combined with Microsoft's gaming and search advertising segments could exceed $40 billion in 2023.
Bracelin, in a note to investors quoted by StreetInsider, added that the deal thrusts Microsoft into the metaverse arms race and has the potential to elevate its footprint in gaming and advertising. Shares of Microsoft rose 2.6% on Wednesday.
""We estimate the ATVI acquisition combined with Microsoft gaming and search advertising segments could exceed $40B+ in CY23 with a 68% and 32% mix split across gaming and advertising, respectively,"" stated the Piper Sandler analyst.
Bracelin added that a broader consumer reach ""gives Microsoft growth optionality across a variety of monetization channels via subscription, in-app purchasing, advertising, and content purchasing.""
""Considering the advertising industry is 3-4x larger than the gaming industry, we are equally bullish on the long-term opportunity for share gain potential in advertising and gaming as the Activision Blizzard-King content is repurposed across cloud, mobile, AR/VR, and the metaverse.""
Piper Sandler reiterated an overweight rating and $352 price target on Microsoft. 
Elsewhere,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was also bullish on Microsoft following the deal, with analyst Keith Weiss explaining in its client note that Microsoft is ""the asset to own in unsettled markets."""
511,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 01:25PM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley outperforms rivals with profit beat,"By Matt Scuffham and Sohini Podder
(Reuters) -Morgan Stanley reported fourth-quarter profit which beat market expectations, outperforming rivals as its focus on advising wealth clients bore fruit, sending its shares up as much as 3.7% on Wednesday.
The Wall Street investment bank also benefited from a boom in global dealmaking and keeping expenses in check at a time when its peers had been hampered with rising wages and technology costs.
Full-year profit as well as revenue was a record for the bank, which advised on some of the world's biggest mergers during the year. Net income surged 37% to $15 billion and revenue jumped 23% to nearly $60 billion.
The bank also lifted its long term target for return on tangible capital equity (ROTCE), a key metric which measures how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profit. It is targeting ROTCE of at least 20%, up from 17% previously.
""We are increasing our ROTCE goal to reflect the earnings power we see in our business model,"" Chief Executive James Gorman told analysts on a conference call.
Since taking over a decade ago, the 63-year-old CEO has transformed  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) from a Wall Street firm heavily weighted in money-losing trading businesses into a more balanced bank. He was the driving force behind Morgan Stanley's decision to acquire Smith Barney, and made wealth management the cornerstone of his plan to stabilize revenue.
The 2020 acquisitions of E*Trade and  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance for a combined $20 billion doubled down on that strategy, differentiating Morgan Stanley's focus from its peers.
The bank's wealth management unit delivered a 10% rise in revenue to $6.25 billion powering a record annual profit.
In the quarter ended Dec. 31, profit rose to $3.59 billion, or $2.01 per share and was above market expectations of $1.93 per share 
Shares in Morgan Stanley were up 2.5% in morning trading.
Its results rounded out a mixed earnings season for the nation's largest banks that cashed in on the M&A wave, but were dragged down by weak trading and higher expenses, which swelled as they spent heavily to retain key personnel in a race for talent.
Morgan Stanley's traditional rival, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter profit which missed expectations, sending its shares down as much as 8%. JPMorgan beat profit expectations last Friday but saw its shares fall 6% on expense concerns.
In contrast to some rivals, Morgan Stanley had benefited from bringing technology in-house through its acquisitions rather than having to build it from scratch, Gorman told analysts.
It has also linked pay with performance in its wealth management and investment banking divisions, Gorman said.
Compensation expense was roughly flat during the quarter compared with a year ago.
HEALTHY PIPELINE
Morgan Stanley's investment bank produced a strong performance and Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said its pipeline remained ""healthy"" going into 2022.
""CEO confidence remains high, and markets remain open and constructive,"" she told analysts. 
In 2021, Wall Street investment banking giants benefited from a global dealmaking boom.
Morgan Stanley advised on 420 deals last year and was ranked third in the global investment banking league tables, following larger rivals Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), according to data from Dealogic. 
Overall revenue from institutional securities, which houses the Morgan Stanley's investment banking and trading units, fell slightly to $6.7 billion, mainly due to weak trading.

Revenue from trading fell 26%. Equity trading revenue rose 13%, but the gains were wiped out by a 31% slump in fixed income trading revenue to $1.23 billion.
Overall revenue rose to $14.5 billion compared with $13.6 billion a year ago.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 01:16PM ET</span>",Djokovic bets on a COVID cure as he quests for tennis history,"By Nikolaj Skydsgaard
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The pandemic has blocked Novak Djokovic's march to tennis history, so the 34-year-old may be pinning his hopes on a cure for COVID to get his hands on another glorious grand slam before time runs out.
The Serbian superstar, who became a focus of the global vaccine debate over his failed attempt to enter Australia without being inoculated, holds a majority stake in a Danish biotech firm aiming to develop a treatment to counter COVID-19, the company's CEO told Reuters.
QuantBioRes boss Ivan Loncarevic, who described himself as an entrepreneur, said the tennis player's acquisition of the 80% stake was made in June 2020 but declined to say how much it was. 
The company is developing a peptide, which inhibits the coronavirus from infecting the human cell, expects to launch clinical trials in Britain this summer, according to Loncarevic, who stressed the firm was working on a treatment, not a vaccine. 
The CEO said the company had about a dozen researchers working in Denmark, Australia and Slovenia. According to the Danish company register, Djokovic and his wife Jelena own 40.8% and 39.2% of the company, respectively. 
A spokesperson for Djokovic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Djokovic has enjoyed phenomenal success - Forbes listed him in the world's top-50 highest paid athletes for 2021. It calculated his on-court earnings at $4.5 million, dwarfed by the $30 million it said he earned off court. 
Yet time may not be on the world number one's side in his quest to be viewed as the greatest player is history, as he advances deeper into his 30s.
He had desperately hoped to play in Australian Open this month with his sights firmly set on netting a 21st grand slam title, which would move him above archrivals Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal.

Frustrated Djokovic now risks being frozen out of tennis, with rules on travellers who are unvaccinated tightening in the third year of the pandemic and some tournaments reconsidering exemptions.
The most immediate concern is the next grand slam - the French Open in May where Nadal has already amassed a staggering 13 titles - after the country's sports ministry said on Monday there would be no exemption from a new vaccine pass law.

518,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 12:11PM ET</span>",Wall Street banks eye 'new normal' for trading revenue after stellar two years,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street banks are expecting trading revenue to settle at a ""new normal"" somewhere between pre-pandemic levels and the highs of the past two years, top executives and analysts say.
A massive injection of cash into capital markets by the Federal Reserve led to unprecedented liquidity and trading activity through the pandemic as investors sought opportunities to cash in. But trading revenue at leading Wall Street banks fell in the fourth quarter as markets normalized and the Fed scaled back its asset purchases.
Banks with large trading desks such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have been the biggest beneficiaries of market volatility, enabling traders to enjoy their best period since the 2007-09 financial crisis. 
Now, they face the realization that the favorable market backdrop will not last forever.
""None of us could have anticipated the environment that we've lived through over the last two years and particularly the environment this year, which was obviously a significant tailwind for our business,"" Goldman Sachs' chief executive, David Solomon, told analysts after the bank on Tuesday posted earnings that fell short of market forecasts.
""We in no way see that as a permanent environment that's going to continue at this pace,"" Solomon said. 
He added that the bank was still seeing ""reasonable"" activity in 2022 and that the business could thrive whatever market conditions materialize.
Rival Morgan Stanley does not expect trading volumes to fall back to pre-pandemic levels, Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said in an interview on Wednesday.
""We have seen differentiation in global central bank policies which should make for more active markets,"" she said. ""We've been able to gain market share and that positions us particularly well as we go into 2022."" 
Executives at rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) struck a similar tone last Friday after the country's largest bank posted earnings that disappointed.
""In our central case, markets and banking normalized somewhat in 2022 relative to their respective record years in 2020 and 2021 and resume modest growth thereafter,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told analysts. 
Barnum said trading volumes would still remain elevated in 2022.
""The beginning of a rate-hiking cycle could be quite healthy for fixed income revenues in particular,"" he said.
Analysts also expect the overall environment to remain positive for trading activity, albeit below the levels of the past two years.
""The bar from 2020 and 2021 is quite high,"" said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, part of Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) Group. ""We'll probably see some normalization and the industry is trying to figure out what that normalization will look like.""
On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley said trading revenue fell 26% in the fourth quarter. While equity trading revenue rose 13%, those gains were wiped out by a 31% slump in fixed income trading revenue, the bank said.
Executives at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have emphasized their confidence about holding on to market share gains achieved during the pandemic, in part a result of European banks retreating. 
Goldman, in particular, has focused on doing more trading on behalf of its biggest corporate clients.
""There's still upside for us from a wallet share perspective, looking at the broad client base,"" said Solomon. ""We'll take more sustainable share from what opportunity the market presents.""
Morgan Stanley's Yeshaya expressed similar sentiments.
""We feel good about holding or gaining market share as we look ahead,"" she said.

Most analysts believe prospects for trading businesses are better than people were anticipating.
""The outlook for trading is more optimistic,"" said Kush Goel, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman in New York. ""It's not going back to 2019.""

Investing.com –  Morgan Stanley  stock (NYSE:MS) traded 2% higher Wednesday as deal-making and wealth management services drove its fourth-quarter earnings higher.
The bank had to make significantly lower provisions for losses as economies rebounded and asset quality improved. That also boosted profits which rose 9% at $3.7 billion even as revenue fell short of estimates, rising 7% to $14.5 billion.
Compensation expense for the quarter was barely higher from the previous year but non-compensation expense jumped more than 10% as costs related to the acquisition of fund manager  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance weighed.
The bank’s bond trading business took a hit from rising government yields at the end of a volatile year for markets. The 31% slump in fixed income revenue overshowed the surprise 13% increase in equities-trading revenue in the fourth quarter. The equity-trading business booked a significant one-time mark-to-market gain of $225 million on a strategic investment.
Investment banking revenue rose 6%, to $2.4 billion, but the weakness in the fixed income business proved to be too much as overall quarterly revenue from the institutional securities business fell more than 4%, to $6.7 billion.  
Both wealth management and asset management grew at the bank. Wealth management revenue rose more than 10% to top $6 billion. The business added net new assets of $127 billion during the quarter, 73% higher than last time. Total client assets under management at the end of the year were $4.9 trillion, up 23%.

The comments should help allay investor concerns that the steep rise in COVID infections and hospitalizations driven by the Omicron variant of the virus in recent weeks would significantly drive up medical costs for health insurers.
Adding to those concerns was a Biden administration initiative requiring insurers to reimburse Americans for up to eight at-home rapid COVID-19 tests per month, while setting no limit for tests, including at-home tests, that insurers must cover if they are ordered or administered by a healthcare provider.
UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), however, said severity in Omicron cases is ""seemingly lower"" with patients staying in hospitals for shorter periods compared to last year.
The costs are further offset by deferral of non-urgent healthcare procedures at hospitals, the company said. Many hospitals have put off elective procedures while they deal with a surge in Omicron patients.
""Activity over the past several weeks shows primary care visits having declined about 10% and an even higher rate of decline in specialist visits,"" Chief Financial Officer John Rex said. 
Shares of the industry bellwether were up about 1%, lifting those of rivals Anthem Inc,  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM) and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI).
Company executives reiterated the 2022 enrollment target for Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans during a conference call, easing some concerns that strong competition in the sector would hamper membership growth. 
""UNH directly addressed the two primary sources of investor uncertainty going into the call - increased MA competition and impact from Omicron - favorably,"" Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said.

Humana earlier this month slashed its 2022 growth forecast for Medicare Advantage plans, citing higher-than-expected terminations in a highly competitive market. 
UnitedHealth stuck with its 2022 adjusted profit forecast of between $21.10 and $21.60 per share. It also reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates by 17 cents a share.

Investing.com — Software company  Autodesk Inc  (NASDAQ:ADSK) has acquired New Zealand-based Moxion, the company announced Wednesday.
Autodesk shares are up over 1% on the news. 
Moxion is a developer of a cloud-based platform for digital dailies used by filmmakers on productions, including ""The Midnight Sky,"" ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" and ""The Matrix Resurrections.""
Autodesk said the deal will expand its own cloud platform for media and entertainment and will help them move beyond post-production into on-set production.
The acquisition, which closed during Autodesk's fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, follows on from Autodesk's purchase of cloud-based estimating company ProEst, in December. 
""As the content demand continues to boom with pressure on creators to do more for less, this acquisition helps us facilitate broader collaboration and communication, and drive greater efficiencies in the production process, saving time and money,"" said Diana Colella, SVP of Media & Entertainment for Autodesk.

Harris Associates, the bank's third-biggest investor with a stake of 5%, according to Refinitiv data, remained hopeful for the bank and its strategic plan, Deputy Chairman David Herro said in a statement.
The U.S. fund manager had previously supported Lehmann's predecessor, who resigned after flouting COVID-19 quarantine rules.
""Although we are disappointed to see the departure of Antonio Horta-Osorio from Credit Suisse given his talents and the restructuring plan he initiated there,"" Herro said in a statement, ""we remain hopeful that with the various management enhancements, including the appointment of Axel Lehmann and the numerous appointments that have been made in the last eight months to the executive board, along with a timely execution of this new strategic plan, that Credit Suisse will not only be strengthened but revitalized.""

In December, Harris said it was ""100% supportive"" of Horta-Osorio after an internal investigation by the bank found he had breached COVID-19 rules a second time.
At the time, Herro described the infractions as minor, calling them distractions from the turnaround at the bank, which has been hit by a string of scandals and losses.

The company's shares rose nearly 2% in premarket trading as strong quarterly sales helped cushion the blow from a bigger-than-previously forecast increase in annual freight and commodity costs.
Sales of fabric & home care products, including Tide and Mr. Clean, rose 7% in the second quarter, as the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant led consumers to buy more cleaning products.
A more intense flu season also drove organic demand for personal health care products up 20%.
This, along with price hikes to offset higher commodity and freight costs, boosted net sales by 6% to $20.95 billion. Analysts had expected $20.34 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Inflationary pressures are expected to continue for a while, P&G' finance chief said after the company forecast a hit of $2.8 billion from commodity, freight and foreign exchange headwinds this year, up from $2.3 billion expected earlier.
P&G also raised its fiscal 2022 organic sales growth forecast to between 4% and 5%, from 2% and 4% earlier, and said it would buy back $9 billion to $10 billion worth of shares, compared with $7 billion to $9 billion expected earlier.
P&G also eased speculation that it could be interested in buying GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s consumer health business, which has drawn interest from European peer Unilever (NYSE:UL).

In a CNBC interview, CEO Jon Moeller said he was ""very happy with its current portfolio"" and saw no need for a large acquisition.
On Saturday, GSK rejected Unilever's $68.4 billion offer for its consumer arm, calling it undervalued and saying it would stick to plans for a separate listing of the entity this year.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 10:42AM ET</span>","Chinese regulator denies issuing guidelines on internet giants' investments, fundraisings","HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) -China's cyberspace regulator denied on Wednesday issuing a document with new guidelines for the nation's big internet companies that would require them to seek approval for new investments and fundraising.
The denial came after a document appeared on Chinese social media detailing such guidelines.
""The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has not issued this document and the information is false,"" it said on its official WeChat account without elaborating.
It was not immediately clear whether the denial referred just to the existence of the document or its plans for further regulation.
Earlier on Wednesday, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that the regulator has drafted new rules that would give it a say over investment or fundraising plans of any platform company with more than 100 million users, or with more than 10 billion yuan ($1.58 billion) in revenue.
The regulator has not responded to a request for comment on the reporting and could not be immediately reached for further comment about its denial.
The people familiar with the matter told Reuters that some internet companies have already been briefed on the plans, but the draft rules were still subject to changes.
They also said firms involved in sectors named on the negative list issued by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) last year would also need to apply for approval. 
The sources declined to be identified as the information was not yet public.
Such rules would intensify the oversight from China's increasingly assertive regulators, who have over the past year reined in formerly freewheeling internet giants in areas from dealmaking to their handling of user data. 
Chen Weiheng, partner and head of U.S. law firm Wilson Sonsini's Greater China practice, said the Reuters report, if confirmed, could significantly impact investment in the sector and ""even end the era for big internet platform operators to build an ecosystem through investments.""
Chinese tech giants such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), Meituan and ByteDance have grown over the years by acquiring or investing in smaller players, practices which Chinese regulators now criticise as monopolistic and unfair to their users.
Some of these firms have over the past year been subjected to a host of punishments, including fines for not reporting past deals and for monopolistic behaviour. From Feb. 15, China will also require companies with data on more than 1 million users to undergo a security review before listing their shares overseas.
Tencent was Asia's third most active investor in the fourth quarter with investments in 39 companies, following Sequoia Capital China and Hillhouse Capital Group, according to data from CBInsights. Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) invested in 31 companies in the fourth quarter.
China's venture funding rose 52% to $90.1 billion in 2021, the data showed.

A private equity investor who declined to be identified said such rules, if confirmed, could leave more room for smaller, independent start-ups to survive and thrive by reining in big players.

The Direxion Breakfast Commodities Strategy exchange-traded fund will track an index focused on coffee, orange juice, wheat and lean-hog futures, according to a Wednesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Prices of agricultural commodities have surged over the last year as supply-chain disruptions kept inventory low and government stimulus underpinned demand. Extreme weather also exacerbated price pressures, with historic droughts and the worst frost in decades in coffee-producing Brazil. 
The Bloomberg Coffee Subindex has jumped 77% over the last year, while Bloomberg’s lean-hog index gained 33%, and the Bloomberg Kansas Wheat Subindex rose 14%. The price gains have landed a huge win for commodity futures ETFs, which have taken in roughly $10 billion in the last year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. 
“Commodity ETFs are having something of a moment because of inflation,” Balchunas said. Direxion also filed applications for five additional funds that will focus on coffee, lumber, copper, corn, and soybeans, respectively, but the breakfast ETF packages a number of unique futures into one fund.

The breakfast ETF, if approved, may be the the only fund to track orange-juice futures, Balchunas added. Futures for one of the most popular breakfast beverages have rallied to the highest level since 2018 amid a plunge in Florida orange output. 
“Given that these are very specific and concentrated baskets of somewhat obscure commodities, they have decent ‘pop’ potential ,” Balchunas added. “Throw in the fact that they’re sort of putting a friendly thematic face on what’s otherwise been known as some legacy technical sounding commodity names. It’s possible this could find an audience despite how maybe out there it seems right now.”

By Sohini Podder and Manya Saini
(Reuters) - Special purpose acquisition company Pioneer Merger Corp and investing app Acorns Grow have mutually terminated their $2.2 billion merger agreement, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.
The deal, announced in May last year, was originally expected to close in the second half of 2021 and the Irvine, California-based company was to be listed on the Nasdaq. 
Acorns will pay Pioneer $17.5 million in termination fees in monthly payments until December 15, as per the agreement.
""Given market conditions, we will be pivoting to a private capital raise at a higher pre-money valuation,"" Chief Executive Officer Noah Kerner told Reuters.
Kerner did not disclose what valuation Acorns was targeting. A source familiar with the matter said the scrapped merger was valued at $1.5 billion pre-money. 
The source added the company was also considering a public listing through a traditional initial public offering (IPO) at a later date, but did not provide any specific timing. 
Blank-check firms, or SPACs, are publicly-traded investment vehicles that merge with a private company to take them public, thereby sidestepping the hassles associated with a traditional IPO.
The trend of listing using SPACs has fizzled out recently with the shares of several companies such as Grab Holdings and BuzzFeed, which merged with SPACs, tumbling after going public.
A regulatory squeeze in the broader blank-check market has also led to some deals getting torpedoed, such as sports card firm Topps and cannabis producer Parallel.
Backed by the likes of  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Acorns allows users to invest in stocks and bonds and uses a subscription based model.

(Reuters) -BetMGM raised its 2022 revenue forecast to more than $1.3 billion from $1 billion on Wednesday and said it expects a core profit in 2023 as the U.S. sports-betting joint venture between MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and Britain's Entain expands.
The online sportsbook for betting on NFL American football and NBA basketball was in the spotlight last year when both MGM and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) tried and failed to take over Entain.
Gambling companies have been looking to capitalise on the growing U.S. sports-betting market, while online gaming has also taken off since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
BetMGM said it was gaining market share in line with its long-term target of 20%-25% in U.S. sports-betting and iGaming. 
The U.S. venture, which is the No. 2 operator for sports betting and iGaming, has grown steadily and challenged FanDuel owner Flutter, the No.1 player in the American market, with its owners expected to invest another $450 million in 2022.
Shares in Entain rose 1% and New York-listed MGM inched up 0.2% by 1443 GMT.
Peel Hunt analysts said on Tuesday BetMGM was key to their valuation of Entain, saying the venture could be sold at the right price or could be the key reason why MGM makes another approach for the British bookmaker.

Entain's boss said in November that BetMGM was one of the reasons why DraftKings' $22 billion offer to buy the British firm fell through as MGM would have sought to take full control of the joint venture. 
BetMGM's net revenue is expected to be about $850 million in 2021, up nearly five times from 2020, while its core loss is seen in the range of $420 million to $440 million.

Toronto-listed shares of Barrick rose 3% to C$23.90.
The Carlin and Cortez mines are part of Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture between Barrick and Newmont Corp. Barrick, which has a 61.5% stake in the joint venture, operates the Nevada mines.
The company reported total preliminary gold output of 1.20 million ounces in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 1.09 million ounces a quarter ago. 
Gold prices had gained 4% during the quarter as concerns over inflation and the Omicron coronavirus variant supported the yellow metal's safe-haven appeal.
Barrick said the average market price for gold in the quarter was $1,795 per ounce, up from $1,790 per ounce in the prior quarter.
The Toronto-based miner said copper production during the quarter was 126 million pounds, a 26% increase from the previous quarter, due to increased throughput levels at its Lumwana copper mine in Zambia in southern Africa.
However, Barrick said it sold lesser copper than it produced, owing to the timing of shipments at Lumwana.
Barrick, which is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 16, said it expects its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) for gold, a key industry metric, to be down between 4% and 6% from the third quarter.
Copper's AISC is expected to rise in the range of 11% to 13% from the previous quarter, driven by higher expenses at the Lumwana mine.

Barrick said its preliminary full-year gold and copper production was 4.44 million ounces and 415 million pounds, respectively.

""We are seeing certainly fierce competition in the war for talent, and that's playing out in wage inflation,"" 
Emily Portney, chief financial officer for Bank of New York Mellon Corp, told Reuters in an interview after reporting fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday.
Portney said wages are even rising at the lower pay scales.
JPMorgan is raising pay for junior bankers again after an increase six months ago was followed by increases from competing banks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. The latest increase takes entry-level pay for JPMorgan bankers in the United States to $110,000 from $100,000, the person said.
Goldman on Tuesday reported a 23% increase in fourth-quarter operating expenses, mainly due to higher compensation and benefits costs. In August, Goldman followed rival banks in raising pay https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-raise-pay-junior-investment-bankers-business-insider-2021-08-02 for second-year analysts and first-year associates to $125,000 and $150,000.
""There is real wage inflation everywhere in the economy, everywhere,"" said Goldman's Chief Executive David Solomon.
The latest Labor Department employment report showed wages have increased solidly https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-employment-growth-misses-expectations-unemployment-rate-falls-39-2022-01-07 across the board.
At retail banks, the ongoing pandemic risks facing frontline branch workers and the high number of open jobs has pushed Bank of America and Wells Fargo to raise the minimum wage they offer to entry-level employees.
Bank of America increased its minimum wage https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-raises-us-minimum-hourly-wage-21-2021-10-06 to $21 an hour in October as part of its pledge to have its minimum wage at $25 by 2025. The bank reported on Wednesday that its non-interest expenses rose 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher revenue-related compensation, although it expects its expenses to be flat for 2022.
Wells Fargo raised its minimum wage for hourly workers to $18-$22, depending on location, late last year. The federal minimum wage in the United States is currently $7.25.
""The banking sector is not immune from the labor shortages and the trend of less people going into the industry due to the relative attractiveness of ... other industries,"" said Mark Doctoroff, co-head of MUFG's Global Financial Institutions Group.
Wells' Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said last week the bank expects a $500-million increase https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-asset-sales-boost-2022-01-14 in wage and benefits-related costs in 2022 on top of the normal level of merit and pay increases, in part because of the increase in the minimum wage.
JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, reported last week its non-interest expenses jumped 11% in the fourth quarter https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-profit-falls-trading-slowdown-2022-01-14 last year, largely due to higher staff compensation.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday as the market recovered its nerve in the wake of the inflation-driven rout on Tuesday.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 151 points, or 0.4% at 35,520 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite, which sold off the most heavily on Tuesday, was outperforming with a gain of 0.9%. All three remain below where they finished last week, however, under pressure from rising bond yields. The -Year U.S. Treasury hit a new two-year high of 1.90% overnight before easing back to 1.85%.
There was little change in the driving narrative of the last week to explain the movement, but rather a sense that Tuesday's selloff had overshot. Dip-buyers were encouraged by stronger-than-expected earnings from the financial and consumer sector, while housing starts data released earlier also pointed to sustained strength in the housing market despite fears of overheating. 
Housing starts rose 1.4% in December to their highest level since March, while building permits rose a whopping 9.1%, just shy of their all-time high. The numbers suggest that the surge in home prices over the last two years is finally prompting a response from the supply side, with a conspicuously sharp rise in the number of multi-family homes being planned and built.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 2.7% and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock rose 1.6% after both banks easily cleared an expectations bar that had been lowered by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) over the previous two trading sessions. Those three stocks continued to lose ground on Wednesday, suggesting that the strength of BofA's and Morgan Stanley's numbers was leading to some rotation within the sector. Elsewhere in financials, SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock rose 12% after it finally gained regulatory approval to become a bank, although it will have to steer clear of the cryptocurrency business that some had hoped it would get into.
Dip-buying even extended to the ARK Innovation ETF of Cathie Wood, which rose 2.1%. It's still lost more than 50% from its peak 11 months ago, as investors feel spooked by rising discount rates that disproportionately punish bets on long-term growth, especially the 'profitless tech' sector. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock rose 3.7%, as investors digested the implications of its $69 billion deal to buy video games publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), which will make it the world's third-largest gaming company by revenue. 
There was also a decent bid for luxury stocks after Swiss-based Richemont breezed past expectations with its fourth-quarter numbers. The owner of Cartier and van Cleef enjoyed a quarter relatively free from disruptions to its boutique operations, lifting Richemont (OTC:CFRUY) ADRs by 6.5%. Burberry (OTC:BURBY) ADRs also gained 5.3% after U.K.-based house raised its guidance for the full year. "

The company reiterated its forecast of 2022 revenue coming in between $317 billion and $320 billion. Adjusted profit is seen at $21.35 a share at the midpoint of its guidance range.
UnitedHealth’s outlook for 2022 brought relief to traders spooked by Humana's (NYSE:HUM) commentary early this month. Humana expects to add 150,000 to 200,000 new members in Medicare Advantage plans this year, a sharp downward revision from the earlier estimate of 325,000 to 375,000. Humana blamed higher-than-expected terminations during the recent enrollment window for 2022 Medicare coverage for its trimmed forecast.
Medicare Advantage insurance plans are funded by the U.S. government but administered by private insurers like UnitedHealth and Humana.
Fourth-quarter revenue at the company jumped more than 12% to almost $74 billion. Earnings from operations were higher by 57% at $5.5 billion.
Revenue at Optum rose over 14% to top $41 billion to take the unit’s share in the company’s total revenue near 56%, the same as a year ago. Optum relies on analytics to sell clinical care, data consulting and services related to management of benefits within health plans.
Optum’s revenue per consumer served for the full year increased 33%. The company attributed this to it serving more people in value-based care arrangements and the continued build-out of care delivery capabilities."

Individual investors bought $1.6 billion in stocks on Tuesday when U.S. shares sold off sharply after weak results from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and a spike in U.S. bond yields.
By contrast, they had bought close to $2 billion on Sept. 28 when the S&P 500 fell 2%.
""Retail investors bought a lot less than they typically would,"" Vanda's Ben Onatibia and Giacomo Pierantoni said about Tuesday's session.
""This could be the first sign that retail fatigue or capitulation is setting in, at least in the tech space.""
Vanda's research note comes as enthusiasm around so-called ""meme stocks"" also appears to be fading, a year on from the  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) frenzy when retail investors coordinated on online message boards to buy into heavily shorted stocks.
A report on Friday showed young investors were losing interest in these ""meme stocks"", with Gen Z's attention shifting to companies in areas like electric vehicles and the ""metaverse"".
A large share of purchases on Tuesday was concentrated in ProShares UltraPro QQQ, a leveraged ETF that targets three times the one-day return on the Nasdaq 100 Index, helping cushion the blow from the massive institutional selling in the sector, Vanda's analysts said.
Even  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s bumper $68.7 billion purchase of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), the biggest gaming industry deal in history, failed to cheer up retail investors.

Retail investors were net sellers of Activision on a day when its shares jumped 26%, the research house said.
Buying in retail favorites, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, has also diminished amid a tech sell-off that started last month, according to Vanda Research.

As rising yields hammer expensive-looking growth companies with shaky profit outlooks, the exchange-traded fund beloved by day traders, ticker ARKK, has already plunged 18.7% this year -- down 51% from February’s peak. 
It has now returned just 11 percentage points more than the benchmark U.S. stock gauge since the start of 2020 -- when Wood’s fortunes soared in the pandemic-fueled speculation that helped ARKK trounce just about every fund in America’s now-$7 trillion ETF market.
That year the fund handed investors 153% versus the S&P 500’s 18% return.
Last week Wood, the founder of ARK Investment Management, saw ARKK’s returns since 2020 fall below the Nasdaq 100 Index, as the new year tech wreck disproportionately lashed her favored stocks. Assets managed by ARKK, which launched in 2014, now stand at $12.8 billion versus the $28 billion peak last February.
Given the asset manager’s preference for high growth, speculative stocks, every single U.S.-listed ARK fund is now down in 2022.
Weighted by when inflows occurred, the average investor in five ARK ETFs is sitting on a 27% loss, Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a Tuesday note. The firm monitors a slew of the firm’s funds as a proxy for market risk appetite.
“It would be hard for that sentiment to get any worse at this point,” the team said.
Still, ARK and Wood manage to command remarkable investor loyalty. The latest data showed an inflow of about $193 million into ARKK. And almost all of the more than $15 billion drop in assets managed by the fund has come from underperformance rather than outflows.
Bespoke sees signs all that could be changing.
“Cumulative inflows to the ARK Invest ETF universe are steadily reversing from their peak,” the team wrote. The $24 billion still in ARK’s funds “represents a potential brutal outlook for further liquidity pressure on the space,” the note said.
Amid the turmoil, Wood’s mantra is that ARK invests with a minimum five-year time horizon, and that volatility is to be expected in the industry-disrupting and cutting-edge stocks it targets. 
On Wednesday morning, she tweeted about the “enormous” arbitrage opportunity in the disparity of valuations between private and public markets for innovative companies.

Investing.com – Bank of America stock (NYSE:BAC) traded 2.7% higher in premarket Wednesday after the company’s fourth-quarter numbers pointed to robust developments both in lending and in its fee-based businesses.
Net interest income, a bank’s bread-and-butter metric that measures the difference between the interest earned on loans and paid out on deposits, rose $1.2 billion or nearly 11% to cross $11 billion. At the end of the year, the bank’s deposit balances were up 16% year-on-year and topped $1 trillion, rising $100 billion of deposits during the last quarter alone.
Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick said asset quality remained strong with loss rates at historically low levels as the global economy continued to improve. This enabled the lender to release $851 million in loan loss reserves as contingencies the bank had estimated didn’t materialize. The release boosted profits, which were higher by 28% at $7 billion.
Combined spending on credit and debit cards grew 22% to $212 billion in the quarter, the bank said.
The bank also benefited from strong demand for its investment advisory services in a booming market for M&As, fund-raising, public offerings and corporate restructuring.
Noninterest income was up 8% to near $11 billion. Bioth asset management and investment banking notched record revenue for the quarter.
As at its Wall Street rivals, BofA's bond trading business suffered from rising government yields at the end of a volatile year for markets. Revenue in the fixed-income, currency and commodity business declined to $1.6 billion. Equities revenue rose to $1.4 billion, however.
Total revenue, net of interest expense, increased 10% to exceed $22 billion."

LONDON (Reuters) - British luxury brand Burberry expects to beat profit expectations after its full-price sales accelerated in the third quarter, driven by a strong performance in outerwear and leather goods and a material improvement in Asia and Europe.
Known for its camel, red and black check and TB monogram, Burberry has stopped markdowns in its main stores and online as these were damaging its status as a high-end luxury brand.
Shares in the group, which have risen by 1% over the last 12 months significantly underperforming its peers, jumped 6.5% to 1,871 pence on Wednesday after Burberry's bullish outlook.
Julie Brown, its finance chief, said full-price sales were up by 26% on pre-pandemic levels, with all product categories growing by double digits, helped by flagship stores that were attracting a new generation of Burberry customers.
""The brand is stronger, the product is stronger,"" she told reporters. ""The key product categories leather goods and outerwear are performing very strongly.""
The Americas continued to be a stand out, she said, with more young men coming to buy Burberry products like sneakers.
Burberry said adjusted operating profit for the year to April 3 would rise by about 35% at constant exchange rates, well ahead of consensus, which stands at 472 million pounds.
Brown said she expected forecasts to move much closer to the top end of the range - which stands at 497 million pounds - plus a benefit from currency of some 13 million pounds ($18 million).
Marco Gobbetti, the mastermind of the multi-year plan to reposition Burberry, jumped ship to Ferragamo at the beginning of the year. His replacement, Jonathan Akeroyd, joins in April.
The strategy was disrupted by COVID-19, which first hit Burberry in its important Chinese market, before moving to the Americas and Europe, where the Asian tourist market disappeared and has still not returned.
Burberry, unlike most other luxury groups, has not surpassed pre-pandemic sales levels, with comparable store sales down 3% on two years ago, due to the exit from markdown. 

Brown said the revenue headwind from this had almost played out, with a ""very minor"" impact expected in the final quarter.

Investing.com – Procter & Gamble stock (NYSE:PG) was up 2% in premarket trading Wednesday after price hikes and strong consumer demand for its healthcare and homecare products led its second quarter revenue past estimates.
Both total sales and organic sales were up 6% year-on-year as consumers looked for its detergents as well as other cleaning products. Net sales came in at $21 billion, riding a combination of a 3% increase in volumes and a similar rise in product prices.
While gross margins took a hit of 4 percentage points owing to higher commodity prices and expensive freight, consumers’ ability and willingness to absorb higher prices led the company to raise its annual outlook.
The maker of Ariel and Oral-B now expects its 2022 sales growth to be 3%-4%, a narrower forecast from the previous 2%-4%. The company also raised its guidance for organic sales growth to 4%-5% from 2%-4% earlier, a substantial increase for a company of its size at this stage of its financial year.
Volumes in the healthcare business were up 4% in the second quarter, which along with 1% increase in prices of such products, helped deliver an 8% jump in sales, the highest among P&G’s five key verticals. As the pandemic waned and gave way to seasonal flu, demand for P&G’s cough and cold treatments like Vicks rose. Demand for its toothpastes and whitening products was also strong.
Each region delivered double digit organic sales growth for the quarter in personal healthcare segment, P&G said.

Average loan balances were up 1% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Lending has been a key focus for investors after demand remained weak for much of 2021. That’s normally a bad sign for banks, but executives attributed depressed borrowing demand on companies and individual customers being flush with stimulus cash.
“Our fourth-quarter results were driven by strong organic growth, record levels of digital engagement and an improving economy,” Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in a statement Wednesday. “We grew loans by $51 billion and added $100 billion of deposits during the quarter, further strengthening our position as the leader in retail deposits.”
The banking giant’s results provide a look at how the U.S. economy fared during the last three months of 2021 as the omicron variant emerged. Average loan and lease balances of $945 billion in the fourth quarter were more than analysts’ estimate of $940 billion. The turnaround signals the economy is holding up even as the Covid-19 pandemic lingers.
Bank of America shares rose 2.3% to $47.31 at 6:53 a.m. in early New York trading. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company had climbed 41% in the past 12 months, compared with a 34% increase for the KBW Bank Index.
Rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), which reported results last week, said both commercial and consumer loans fell from a year earlier in the fourth quarter. At  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., consumer loans dropped and total commercial borrowing ticked up only slightly.
At Bank of America, net interest income, or revenue from customer loan payments minus what the company pays depositors, rose 11% from a year earlier to $11.4 billion.
In sales and trading, Bank of America reported revenue of $2.9 billion, down 2% from a year earlier. Analysts had estimated $3.1 billion. The trading boom set off by the market volatility of Covid-19 is starting to fade, and companies are having to contend with higher costs to prevent employees from defecting. 
Investment-banking fees climbed 26% to $2.4 billion as the company’s dealmakers capitalized on a combination of cheap financing for buyers and attractive valuations for sellers, which spurred a wave of acquisitions. Advisory fees totaled $850 million, up 55% from a year earlier. 
With the risk of widespread credit defaults fading further, Bank of America released $851 million in reserves in the fourth quarter. That follows a $1.1 billion release in the previous three months. Noninterest expenses rose 6% to $14.7 billion, driven in part by higher compensation. The company said it expects expenses to be little changed in 2022.
Client balances in the Merrill Lynch Wealth Management business rose 14% to a record $3.2 trillion, while assets under management increased 17% to $1.3 trillion.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group fell 9% on Wednesday after gaming rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said it will buy developer Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) in a record $68.7 billion deal for the industry. 
While Sony's PlayStation is widely seen as having a lead in the generational battle with Microsoft's Xbox, the purchase of the ""Call of Duty"" maker comes as Microsoft is aggressively expanding its Game Pass subscription service.
Sony has strengthened its network of in-house games studios in recent year and delivered a string of exclusive hits including in its ""Spider-man"" franchise, with Microsoft left playing catch-up. 
""Sony will have a monumental challenge on its hand to stand its own in this war of attrition,"" wrote Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors who recommends shorting the stock, in a note to clients. 
Sony is a pioneer in virtual reality and announced a few teasing details this month of its next generation headset, but deep pocketed and non-traditional players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms are investing in the metaverse, or virtual online worlds.
PlayStation is a major source of revenue for Activision, complicating any potential decision by Microsoft to remove titles from Sony systems and squeeze its rival. 

Many industry observers believe operability across multiple platforms is essential for the success of a metaverse where users can game, shop and work freely as advances in cloud technology weaken ties to the bulky gaming hardware that made Sony and Microsoft industry gatekeepers.
""If Microsoft continues to provide these games to (the PlaySation) platform as well, that would indicate that it may be positioning itself for metaverse in the long-term,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>",Analysis-High U.S. meat prices: packer profiteering or capacity crunch?,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is targeting a small group of meat packers for high beef, pork and poultry prices that it says are squeezing consumers and fueling inflation, arguing that they are abusing their market power.
The U.S. meatpacking industry is dominated by a few global companies which say prices reflect a surge in demand, pandemic-constrained supplies, and rising costs for labor and transportation. They deny the administration's pandemic profiteering allegations. 
Agricultural economists say that pandemic-stoked meat demand has exposed a shortage of slaughterhouse capacity, especially in beef, a supply-chain problem similar to those of other industries. 
""I think there's probably some truth on both sides,"" said David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M University, about the White House's battle with meat processors. 
""Consumers are buying beef. Our exports are booming,"" he said. ""What we're seeing with prices, I would argue as an economist, that's exactly what we should see given this bottleneck. And capacity problems aren't going to be fixed overnight.""
Cattlemen are frustrated with limited options for selling their herds, he said, adding: ""I don't think it's a bad thing that the government is looking in to this stuff.""
MEAT INDUSTRY 
At the heart of the issue, just as with supply chain snarls, is unusually strong consumer demand for meat, and especially beef. 
Americans hunkered down during the pandemic and splurged on consumable treats instead of travel or entertainment, and Chinese traded Australian imports for grain-fed U.S. beef, amid a diplomatic dispute.
That jump collided with a U.S. meat processing system already stretched to its limits by a decades-long drive for maximum efficiency and profit, leaving just four companies to dominate the beef packing market.
COVID-driven plant shutdowns, safety protocols spacing employees further apart and labor shortages cut the number of cows these plants could process, reducing prices they paid to cattle farmers even as the cost of the end product spiked for consumers. 
U.S. beef wholesale, livestock prices https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/MEAT/myvmnbgnnpr/chart.png 
Beef retail prices rose 30% from the beginning of 2020, before pandemic lockdowns started, to a peak of $7.90 per pound in October, before declining slightly in November and December, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. 
The price cattle farmers earned declined slightly over the same period, and the National Farmers Union argues that more competition is needed in meat packing.
EXPLOITATION OR CAPITALISM? 
President Joe Biden has announced steps to boost competition in beef, pork and poultry processing to curb what he argues is ""exploitation"" of consumers and farmers.
The administration's action plan includes $1 billion for grants and loans for new independent processing plants, $100 million for worker training, new labeling rules and ways for farmers to report anticompetitive practices. 
That is after a White House said in a December analysis that the four big meatpackers -  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN),  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), Marfrig Global Foods SA and Seaboard Corp - had tripled their net profit margins during the pandemic.
JBS's U.S. beef operation more than doubled its third-quarter operating margin - the rough difference between revenue and costs - to 21%, compared with the same periods of 2020 and 2019, the Brazilian company's earnings statement shows. 
JBS Q3 profit margins soar on beef demand https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/MEAT/lbvgnjodwpq/chart.png 
PAYING QUOTED PRICES
""The margins have been extremely wide"" in beef, said Derrell Peel, a livestock economist at Oklahoma State University, citing the processing bottlenecks. He blames them not on deliberate anti-competitive behavior, but on 30 years of market-driven consolidation that left the industry with no spare capacity to handle the COVID-19 demand surge.
""The main driver of why we have the industry structure we have today is because of the economics of cost efficiency. Those small packers just went broke. And the ones that got bigger survived,"" Peel said.
The North American Meat Institute, representing beef and pork packers, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argue that higher meat prices are a temporary result of forces stoking inflation across the economy, including labor shortages. 
""The market is behaving predictably,"" said Sarah Little, vice president of communications for the North American Meat Institute. Grocery chains compete for supplies and set retail meat prices - not meat processors - she noted, and Americans are willing to pay higher prices for beef. 
""There are going to be times when cattlemen make more money and packers lose money. We've certainly seen that cycle before.""
U.S. grocery chains' prices to consumers also reflect acute labor shortages, high trucking costs, and competition from China and other foreign buyers, said Jayson Lusk, head of Purdue University's agricultural economics department. 

Chinese demand for pork is easing as the country rebuilds its hog herd from a devastating bout of African swine fever, returning pork processing margins to their five year average, according to Dermot Hayes, economics professor at Iowa State University.
Price spikes show the industry needs some slack in the system, Hayes said. Government incentives could encourage more farmer groups to build processing plants and earn more selling meat rather than live animals, Hayes said.

(Reuters) - Britain-based digital banking app Revolut launched commission-free stock trading in the United States on Wednesday, a move that will see it compete with online brokerages such as  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. 
The launch by Revolut comes amid a broader surge in retail trading, which escalated last year when investors latched onto so-called ""meme stocks"" that included retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) and cinema group AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).
U.S. retail traders bought approximately $281 billion worth of stocks in 2021, up from $38 billion in 2019, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research. 
The new offering is part of Revolut's quest to become a so-called ""superapp,"" where consumers can manage every aspect of their finances, the company said. Revolut also offers payments services, cryptocurrency trading and savings accounts. 
""This to us was just the next logical step,"" said Gabe Vallejo, Revolut's U.S. head of wealth and trading. 
U.S. Revolut customers can trade full and fractional shares of more than 1,100 securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, including more than 200 exchange-traded funds. 
Zero-commission stock trading is already available to Revolut users in the United Kingdom and Europe. The company was valued at about $33 billion through an investment round in July, and is currently Britain's second-most valuable fintech company after Checkout.com. 
Revolut launched in the United States as a banking app in March 2020, and secured a U.S. broker-dealer license in September 2021.
Similar to Robinhood, Revolut will rely on payment for order flow (PFOF) to earn revenue through its commission-free trades, a controversial practice in which brokers route trades to market makers in return for a fee.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently considering whether to reform or ban the practice. Chair Gary Gensler has expressed concern that commission-free trading brokerages may encourage investors to trade more, in order to capture more PFOF, even if that is not in the investors' best interest.

Vallejo said Revolut is not concerned about the SEC review and he expected Revolut will be able to evolve as necessary should the rules change. 
""We're confident we can continue to offer this product to our customers in the most efficient manner possible,"" he said.

Investing.com – ASML ADRs (NASDAQ:ASML) traded 3% higher in Wednesday’s premarket after the maker of chipmaking equipment said revenue will grow around 20% in 2022, notwithstanding a recent fire at its Berlin plant.
ASML said it would continue to struggle to meet demand this year and forecast first-quarter sales of 3.4 billion euro at the midpoint of its guidance range. Gross margin is expected to be around 49%, down from 54.2% in the final quarter of last year.
“We experience higher demand for our systems than our production capacity can accommodate. Very strong demand in end markets puts pressure on our customers for more wafer output,” a release quoted CEO Peter Wennink as saying after the company disclosed its fourth-quarter numbers.
Demand is so strong that the company is shipping machines to its clients without conducting some of the tests on the equipment. Final testing and formal acceptance then take place at the customer site, the company said.
The robust demand is an outcome of the shift to digital and machines the world is going through, a pivot only accelerated by the pandemic.
The company made more positive announcements that are bosting the stock. ASML said it will double its 2021 dividend to 5.50 euro and has received a first order from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for a new machine that is still under development, reflecting the robustness of the market for chips and the willingness of the manufacturers to keep investing in new technologies.
Revenue jumped more than 17% to 5 billion euro ($5.7 billion) but was less than estimated. The company managed to generate higher margins to book a net profit of 1.8 billion euro. Gross margin for the quarter was 54.2% compared to 52% in the same period last year.  "

SEOUL (Reuters) -Retail investors bid for a record 114 trillion won ($96 billion) worth of shares in the IPO of South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution (LGES), adding to the frenzy for a piece of the biggest public offering in the country. 
Some 4.4 million individual investors ensured the retail portion of the initial public offering (IPO) was oversubscribed nearly 70 times at the end of the two-day bidding period on Wednesday, according LGES. 
The demand beat the previous record of battery material maker SK IE Technology Co Ltd (SKIET), which drew 81 trillion won of public subscriptions last year. 
Last week, LGES priced the offering at top of the indicative marketing range to raise $10.8 billion, making it South Korea's biggest and Asia's third-largest IPO. 
LGES continues the trend of robust demand for IPOs from South Korean retail investors - known as ""ants"" - as government stimulus efforts to bolster the economy after the coronavirus crisis have flooded markets with cash.
""I decided to subscribe to LGES IPO shares after seeing reports of the LGES IPO attracting lots of bids from retail investors. I also thought I might be missing out on this opportunity to make quick money if I don't bid for this,"" said Lee, an office worker in Seoul. 
LGES, which commands more than 20% of the global electric vehicle battery market and supplies Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) among others, had set aside about 25% of the total shares on offer for retail bidders, according to Reuters calculations. 
The retail demand comes after the company last week attracted bids worth about $12.8 trillion, also a record, from a total of 1,988 domestic and foreign institutional investors, its filings showed.
The company is expected to list on Jan. 27.
The IPO price values LGES at about 70.2 trillion won ($60 billion) and will make it South Korea's third most-valuable company after Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co and SK Hynix Inc.
Some South Korean brokerages saw a dramatic jump in the number of newly created accounts by retail investors as a result of the demand. 

KB Securities, one of the main bookrunners on the deal along with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), said it saw an almost 200% increase in the number of newly created accounts between Jan. 1 and Jan. 10, compared with the same period a month ago.

Investing.com –  Sony  (T:6758) stock plunged the most in 13 years in Tokyo trading Wednesday as traders tried to calculate the impact that Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) will have on the maker of PlayStations.
The stock closed nearly 13% down in Tokyo while the NYSE-listed shares (NYSE:SONY) traded 5% lower premarket.
While Sony’s PlayStation leads Microsoft’s Xbox in the gaming market for consoles, the acquisition of the video games publisher hands Microsoft a formidable library of titles such as Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo and Candy Crush.  
Sony and Microsoft, two of the world's dominant console makers, accounted for 17% and 11% of Activision’s 2020 revenue, making them its largest and fourth largest customer, respectively, according to a filing.
Any attempt by Microsoft to remove titles from Sony's system will be a complex exercise and could invite charges of being anti-competitive. At the same time, the industry’s biggest acquisition indicates Microsoft’s commitment to a play in the metaverse, a so-called ecosystem where people come to interact, play, watch and study online.
In the all-cash offer announced Tuesday, Microsoft said it will buy the ‘Call of Duty’-owner for $68.7 billion. The deal values each Activision share at $95. The stock of the video games publisher closed at $82.31 in the previous session, nearly 26% higher.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ASML forecast sales growth of 20% in 2022 despite a fire this month at its Berlin plant as the supplier to chipmakers on Wednesday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit.
Europe's largest technology company by market capitalisation said that the Jan. 3 fire had damaged part of one building and caused smoke damage at a second.
ASML Chief Executive Peter Wennink said ""the expected impact of the fire in part of a building at our Berlin site is included"" in the 2022 growth forecast. 
An initial assessment on Jan. 7 said shipments of ASML's DUV products would not be affected, but left open the possibility EUV shipments could be impacted as the facility in Berlin made one part needed for the systems.
""Based on our current insights, we believe we can manage the consequences of this fire without significant impact on our system output for 2022,"" Wennink said in a statement.
ASML is trying to expand production as its customers, which include TSMC, Samsung (KS:005930) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), invest heavily in new capacity to try to ease a global semiconductor shortage.
The Dutch company said its fourth quarter net profit was 1.77 billion euros ($2 billion), higher than the 1.51 billion euros expected on average by analysts and up from 1.35 billion euros a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. 
The earnings improvement was the result of better than expected margins of 54.2%, as sales of 5 billion euros were slightly below analyst estimates of 5.1 billion euros.
ASML said it would continue to struggle to meet demand this year, and forecast first-quarter sales of 3.3-3.5 billion euros. 
The lower number comes amid some of its systems being shipped to customers before they have gone through final testing, which means 2 billion euros in extra revenue will be recognised in future quarters, it added.
""Demand is cited as 'unprecedented',"" said Citi analysts in a note. ""Delayed revenue recognition and (the) commentary around demand suggest upside to 2023 consensus revenue"" forecasts,"" it said. Citi rates ASML a Buy.

For all the turmoil across financial markets yesterday, the Nasdaq creeping dangerously near correction territory and closing below a key 200-day moving average probably came as the least surprising feature for investors. 
After all, dumping expensive tech and growth stocks when bond yields rise as the Federal Reserve embarks on an interest hike cycle is seen as basic stock market trading 101.
Going overweight on banking stocks on tighter monetary policy is another common trade but that one backfired spectacularly when Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) missed quarterly profit expectations and plunged 7% as rising expenses bit into its fourth quarter earnings.
Traders are now waiting for Bofa and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to update the market today and see whether the key theme of this new earnings season might just be rising costs, including pay, denting profits across all industries.
With European and U.S. stock futures down over 0.5%, it's fair to say there's palpable uncertainty on that front as other structural forces of this tightening cycle are only gaining strength in these early days of 2022.
The dollar is pumped up against rival currencies with benchmark U.S. Treasury yields trading on two-year highs as the Federal Reserve shows signs of being more aggressive in tackling inflation while in Europe, Germany's 10-year bond yield rose above 0% for the first time since May 2019.
Moreover, latest data showed British consumer price rose to 5.4% in December, its highest since March 1992, a level which might encourage the Bank of England to speed up tightening. 
Even the cautious Bank of Japan warned investors that inflation may accelerate faster than expected if raw material costs continue to spike.
This came as oil prices are up for a fourth day to levels last seen in 2014 as an outage on a pipeline from Iraq to Turkey increased concerns about an already tight supply outlook.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Strong demand for its jewellery and watches in the Americas and Europe in a post-pandemic rebound helped quarterly sales at Cartier owner Richemont rise by nearly a third, the world's second-largest luxury group said on Wednesday.
Sales at Richemont rose to 5.658 billion euros ($6.41 billion) in the company's third quarter ended December, a 32% increase when currency swings were removed. The performance was 38% better than the 2019 Christmas quarter before the pandemic hit, Richemont said in a statement.
Shares, slightly down so far this year following a 71% jump last year, climbed 5.7% in early trading after the better-than-expected sales. 
Demand for luxury goods has rebounded strongly from the worst troughs of the coronavirus pandemic - Italy's Prada (OTC:PRDSY) and Britain's Burberry also posted strong numbers this week - and Richemont benefits from its exposure to the fast-growing jewellery category.
High-end watch sales also recovered last year, with Swiss watch exports overall slightly above 2019 levels at the end of November. 
Sales at Richemont jewellery brands Cartier, Buccellati and Van Cleef & Arpels were up 38%, while specialist watchmaker sales, including IWC and Vacheron Constantin brands, rose 25% versus the year-ago period.
The Americas posted the strongest growth - 55% - followed by Europe with 42%. China, which had already recovered from the worst of the pandemic the previous year, only saw 7% growth, Richemont said.
Analysts applauded the better-than-expected sales figures, highlighting the jewellery category, the rebound in Europe and the strong increase in retail sales in the group's own stores.
To boost sales and margins, Richemont is moving away from wholesale towards directly operated stores and online channels. Direct sales to consumers further increased, now representing 78% of group sales, and online retail sales were also up 19%, Richemont said. 
""Richemont has made significant improvements at all levels and is currently in a sweet spot to create value,"" Vontobel's Jean-Philippe Bertschy said, reiterating his 'buy' recommendation on the stock.

Peer LVMH, owner of the Bulgari and Tiffany jewellery brands, is due to post full-year results on Jan 27. Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) results are also expected around that date.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's accounting watchdog on Wednesday fined KPMG 4.3 million pounds ($5.85 million) for audits of drinks store chain Conviviality, whose brands included Bargain Booze and Wine Rack, before it went into administration in 2018.
The Financial Reporting Council said KPMG, one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms, will also have to report to the watchdog identifying the causes of the deficiencies in the 2017 audit, and the steps and remedial action which the firm has taken.
In the latest in a string of sanctions from the FRC, the KPMG's fine was reduced to 3 million pounds for admissions and early settlement of the case, the FRC said.
KPMG audit partner Nicola Quayle was fined 110,000 pounds, cut to 80,850 pounds for early settlement. She also received a severe reprimand.
""I'm sorry that our work wasn't good enough in this instance,"" said Jon Holt, chief executive of KPMG in Britain.
""I am committed to resolving, and learning from, our past cases and this development marks another step forward in dealing with these matters. We have fully cooperated with the FRC throughout their investigation,"" Holt said.
Conviviality was listed in London in 2013 and grew rapidly through a series of acquisitions, reporting significant increases in revenue, profit and net assets.
But in early 2018, the company issued a series of trading updates which resulted in its shares being suspended ahead of the company going into administration, the FRC said.
Failings admitted by KPMG included not revising initial assessments of the risks of a material misstatement following information obtained during the 2017 audit, the watchdog said.
There was also a failure to obtain sufficient audit evidence in relation to accrued franchise licence revenue.
""The audit failings in this case were serious, spanned several significant areas of the financial statements,"" said Claudia Mortimore, the FRC's deputy executive counsel.
KPMG is also facing a fine for misconduct https://www.reuters.com/business/uk-watchdog-fines-former-kpmg-accountant-misconduct-2022-01-18 in how FRC inspectors were misled during spot checks of audits of builder Carillion and software company Regenersis.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group, perched atop the gaming sector, is facing a fresh challenge from cash-rich rivals betting on a next-generation online video game boom as the Japanese conglomerate eyes expansion on multiple fronts, including electric cars. 
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), a laggard in the generational console battle with Sony, took a major step to position itself for the ""metaverse"" - a proposed immersive experience where people game, shop and socialise online - with a $69 billion deal for ""Call of Duty"" developer Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). 
Sony's shares slumped 13% on Wednesday amid concern Activision titles would be pulled from PlayStation systems. 
""They're basically trying to build a monster,"" said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy in Tokyo. ""I don't think Microsoft is spending $70 billion to become a software provider for Sony platforms.""
The full frontal approach contrasts with Sony, which has made incremental deals and gained praise for building a network of in-house gaming studios that have produced hits such as ""Spider-Man"" and ""God of War."" Analysts say it - and other giants - may now feel pressure to make more deals in response.
Microsoft's deal for Activision is made possible by its vast array of other businesses, including software and cloud services, with its market capitalization more than 14 times that of the Japanese conglomerate. 
Many observers see Activision as a tarnished business after allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct by managers and with its major franchises losing momentum, analysts say. 
The developer is ""basically a semi distressed asset,"" said Mio Kato, an analyst at LightStream Research writing on the Smartkarma platform. ""This backward-looking nature to Microsoft's strategy is what makes us sceptical about their ability to compete with PlayStation."" 
PRESSURE TO CONFORM
The deal will likely aid Microsoft's aggressive expansion of its Game Pass subscription service, which raises concerns Sony will be forced to follow suit. Offering games for a flat fee can eat into sales and erode margins. 
""Most analysts have been napping during these developments, cheering Sony's stronger movies and music business to justify a higher rating,"" Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors, wrote in a note.
Tech giants including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have also advanced into gaming in recent years, but struggled to deliver hits. 
Sony, by contrast, has a pipeline of hotly awaited titles including ""Gran Turismo 7"" and ""Horizon Forbidden West"". Microsoft has leaned heavily on the ""Halo"" series, whose latest instalment was delayed before release in December.
Advances to cloud technology are loosening ties to consoles amid expectation consumers will spend more time playing and shopping in virtual reality and attracting investment from firms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta. 
The change has been compared to the epochal shift to electric and autonomous vehicles. 
Sony, which plans to launch a next generation virtual reality headset, is also considering entering the electric car business to take advantage of its edge in areas including entertainment and chips. 
On Wednesday shares in gaming firms including Square Enix and Capcom popped on speculation the Activision deal could lead to more consolidation. 

Sony, a Japanese industry champion at a time when many local firms are losing ground to overseas rivals across a swathe of sectors, is seen as one potential buyer. 
""Sony may come under pressure to do more M&A,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note, adding that ""if there are no regulatory bottlenecks, then Microsoft may go after another target in the not too distant future.""

(Reuters) - Chinese real estate developers are staring at enormous amounts of debt maturing this year, at a time when property sales have slowed and traditional borrowing markets remain closed off following Beijing's campaign to rein in borrowing in the sector.
According to Refinitiv data, Chinese real estate developers have $117 billion worth of debt maturing in 2022, with $36 billion of those denominated in dollars.
Graphic: Chinese real estate debt maturing in the next three years, https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-DEBT/dwvkrknarpm/chart.png Developers in the country are facing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze as years of regulatory curbs on borrowing lead to a string of offshore debt defaults and credit rating downgrades. 
The slowdown in the sector further pressured developers, with property investments in December falling at the fastest pace since early-2020, clouding the country's outlook despite a robust headline economic growth figure.
China Evergrande Group has been struggling to repay more than $300 billion in liabilities, including nearly $20 billion of offshore bonds deemed in cross-default by ratings agencies last month after it missed payments.
Their worsening credit conditions have hit equity and bond prices of even the largest developers in recent months.
A 3.125% October 2025 bond issued by China's biggest developer by sales, Country Garden, has fallen about 17% this year to 73 cents as of Tuesday. 
According to Refinitiv data, the developers face debts worth $27 billion coming due in the first quarter of this year, and $31 billion in the second quarter.

Graphic: Chinese real estate firms' debt maturing in each qtr, https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-DEBT/gkplgbzxlvb/chart.png Kaisa Group Holdings, Guangzhou R&F Properties Co Ltd and Yunnan Health & Cultural Tourism Holding Group Co Ltd were among the developers having at least $2 billion worth of debt maturing this year, topping the list.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) said an unauthorized network of drug distributors and suppliers sold pharmacies more than $250 million of counterfeit versions of its HIV treatments over the last two years, endangering patients.
The drugmaker said it found 85,247 bottles that had been tampered with or faked, including versions of its Biktarvy and Descovy treatments.
In a separate statement on Wednesday, Gilead said it has seized the bottles of Gilead-labeled medication from 17 locations in nine states as part of its investigation. 
The investigation also uncovered unauthorized pharmaceutical distributors who were selling the drugs to pharmacies, Gilead said. 
Gilead said on Tuesday counterfeiters used authentic, but often empty or near-empty, bottles that once contained its HIV medication.
It said the counterfeiters then substituted fake tablets and documentation, and resealed the bottles so they would ""resemble"" unopened, authentic bottles.
The alleged scheme was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
Gilead disclosed its anti-counterfeiting efforts on the same day a federal judge in Brooklyn unsealed a related civil lawsuit that the Foster City, California-based company filed last July.
Gilead warned the public about HIV counterfeits on Aug. 5, two weeks after filing the lawsuit under seal.
The company accused 22 defendants of violating federal trademark and New York consumer protection laws for their roles in the distribution of ""dangerous"" counterfeits to ""unsuspecting patients, placing the patients' health and lives at risk.""
Gilead said a common counterfeit was an anti-psychotic drug that often causes drowsiness, where tablets were six times more potent than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended for some patients.
It said one patient who unknowingly took that drug after receiving a fake bottle of Biktarvy reported being unable to speak or walk afterwards.
The lawsuit seeks, among other remedies, the seizure of counterfeit drugs, in addition to court-ordered seizures that have already occurred.
Global sales of its HIV treatments totaled $4.19 billion in the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2021, including $2.71 billion of Biktarvy and Descovy.

Lori Mayall, Gilead's top anti-counterfeiting executive, said the presiding judge in its lawsuit ordered the defendant distributors to stop selling Gilead-branded medications, and the company was unaware of any defendant violating that order.
""We therefore believe that we have successfully stopped any additional counterfeits from these defendants reaching patients,"" Mayall said in a statement.

STOCKHOLM/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) opened a data centre in South Africa on Wednesday to provide local cloud services across Africa for the first time, joining the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in setting up facilities in the southernmost country on the continent.
Africa will be the U.S. company's 37th ""cloud region"" - an area that allows customers to get faster access from a local data centre, in this case in Johannesburg.
Oracle is racing to open at least 44 cloud regions this year as it plans to catch up with cloud computing rivals such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Though Oracle has no plans for more data centers in Africa this year, more could come next year as the company explores areas such as West Africa, Cherian Varghese, regional managing director for Middle East and Africa, told Reuters.
Increased demand for faster computing from African banks and telecom firms has attracted big cloud operators into the largely untapped market, with Microsoft the first to launch data centers in South Africa, followed by Amazon and Huawei.
Fast connectivity provided by a submarine communication cable and being Africa's most developed economy have made South Africa a key location for cloud operators, with over 50 data centres in the country, mostly near Cape Town and Johannesburg.
However, South Africa comes with infrastructure challenges, such as high power prices and frequent power cuts, meaning additional costs have to be set aside for back-up power.

Smaller cloud operators are also trying to grab a piece of the fast-expanding market for data localisation.
U.S.-based Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) is buying a majority stake in a Johannesburg-based date centre operator for $3.5 billion, while Vantage Data Centres has also announced plans to invest up to a billion dollars to set up a data centre in South Africa.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 12:46AM ET</span>","AT&T, Verizon pause 5G rollout near U.S airports to avoid flight disruptions","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) on Tuesday agreed to temporarily defer turning on some wireless towers near key airports to avert a significant disruption to U.S. flights as they roll out 5G service that will bring faster wireless service to tens of millions of people.
President Joe Biden hailed the agreement, saying it ""will avoid potentially devastating disruptions to passenger travel, cargo operations, and our economic recovery, while allowing more than 90% of wireless tower deployment to occur as scheduled."" 
Late Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration updated its list of airports that planes with approved radio altimeter equipment could use to include major airports like New York's JFK and LaGuardia, Los Angeles, Chicago's O'Hare and Midway, San Francisco and Seattle. 
The FAA was also expected to update its list of Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) planes with the approved equipment in the coming hours. The updates should dramatically lessen the impact of the nearly 1,500 notices of 5G restrictions that the FAA had issued. 
Airlines and the FAA warned that new restrictions as a result of 5G service, which Verizon and AT&T are to launch on Wednesday, would still prompt some flight disruptions. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said while the wireless moves were a positive development, ""some flight restrictions may remain."" 
United Airlines told customers on a flight from Denver to Houston that a three-hour delay was a result of the new 5G systems, according to a notice on its website. It also suggested customers with any concerns reach out to the Federal Communications Commission.
The FAA has warned that 5G wireless interference could affect sensitive airplane instruments such as radio altimeters and significantly hamper low-visibility operations.
The FAA said it anticipated ""there will be some impacts due to the limitations of some radio altimeters.""
Verizon will temporarily not turn on about 500 towers near airports, sources told Reuters, or less than 10% of their planned deployment, while the carriers and the administration work on a permanent solution, sources briefed on the matter said. Details of the agreement, including the length of the pause, were not disclosed.
Both Verizon and AT&T will launch 5G elsewhere in the country. 
Federal Communications Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement that the FAA ""has a process in place to assess altimeter performance in the 5G environment and resolve any remaining concerns. It is essential that the FAA now complete this process with both care and speed.""
Airlines for America, a passenger and cargo trade group, said the ""pause provides the opportunity to ensure all stakeholders, consumers and the U.S. economy are served in the long run.""
This is the third time that AT&T and Verizon agreed to delay deployment of the new C-Band 5G wireless service. The companies in November postponed deployment by 30 days until Jan. 5, and then agreed to delay deployment until Jan. 19.
Nearly all but a handful of the impacted sites are Verizon towers, officials said.
Still the FAA and airlines must grapple with how to resolve the concerns permanently -- especially since AT&T and Verizon earlier agreed to take some measures to reduce interference for six months.
Despite the agreement, major foreign carriers including Air India and Japan's biggest airline, ANA Holdings, said they had canceled some U.S.-bound flights because of possible 5G interference.
ANA said on its website it had canceled some Boeing 777 flights after Boeing ""announced flight restrictions on all airlines operating the Boeing 777 aircraft."" Boeing did not immediately comment.
Airlines are likely to cancel some additional flights in the coming hours as they wait for formal guidance from the FAA on the announcements from Verizon and AT&T. They warned Monday of ""catastrophic"" impacts. Airlines had raised concerns that the issue could prevent them from flying Boeing 777s and other widebody jets to many key airports.
The chief executives of major U.S. passenger and cargo carriers on Monday said the new 5G service could render a significant number of widebody aircraft unusable, ""could potentially strand tens of thousands of Americans overseas"" and cause chaos for U.S. flights.
The airlines asked ""that 5G be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate 2 miles (3.2 km) of airport runways"" at some key airports.
Verizon's rollout plan is much more aggressive than AT&T's. It is significantly impacted by the Biden administration request to delay using some towers near airport runways. 

AT&T and Verizon won significant C-Band spectrum in an $80 billion auction last year.
Verizon Chief Executive Hans Vestberg told employees on Jan. 4 the carrier saw no aviation safety issue with 5G and had resisted prior delays, officials told Reuters.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 12:16AM ET</span>",Microsoft to gobble up Activision in $69 billion metaverse bet,"By Subrat Patnaik and Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) is buying ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history as global technology giants stake their claims to a virtual future.
The deal announced by Microsoft on Tuesday, its biggest-ever and set to be the largest all-cash acquisition on record, will bolster its firepower in the booming videogaming market where it takes on leaders Tencent and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY).
It also represents the American multinational's bet on the ""metaverse,"" virtual online worlds where people can work, play and socialize, as many of its biggest competitors are already doing.
""Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said.
Microsoft, one of the biggest companies in the world largely thanks to corporate software such as its Azure cloud computing platform and Outlook franchise, is offering $95 per share - a 45% premium to Activision's Friday close.
Activision's shares were last up 26% at $82.10, still a steep discount to the offer price, reflecting concerns the deal could get stuck in regulators' crosshairs.
Microsoft has so far avoided the type of scrutiny faced by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) but this deal, which would make it the world's third largest gaming company, will put the Xbox maker on lawmakers' radars, said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow & Mazard PLLC.
""Microsoft is already big in gaming,"" he said.
However, a source familiar with the matter said Microsoft would pay a $3 billion break-fee if the deal falls through, suggesting it is confident of winning antitrust approval.
The tech major's shares were last down 1.9%. 
The deal comes at a time of weakness for Activision, maker of games such as ""Overwatch"" and ""Candy Crush"". Before the deal was announced, its shares had slumped more than 37% since reaching a record high last year, hit by allegations of sexual harassment of employees and misconduct by several top managers.
The company is still addressing those allegations and said on Monday it had fired or pushed out more than three dozen employees and disciplined another 40 since July.
CEO Bobby Kotick, who said Microsoft approached him about a possible buyout, would continue as CEO of Activision following the deal, although he is expected to leave after it closes, a source familiar with the plans said. 
In a conference call with analysts, Microsoft boss Nadella did not directly refer to the scandal but talked about the importance of culture in the company.
""It's critical for Activision Blizzard to drive forward on its renewed cultural commitments,"" he said, adding ""the success of this acquisition will depend on it.""
'METAVERSE ARMS RACE'
Data analytics firm Newzoo estimates the global gaming market generated $180.3 billion of revenues in 2021, and expects that to grow to $218.8 billion by 2024. 
Microsoft already has a significant beachhead in the sector as one of the big three console makers. It has been making investments including buying ""Minecraft"" maker Mojang Studios and Zenimax in multibillion-dollar deals in recent years.
It has also launched a popular cloud gaming service, which has more than 25 million subscribers.
According to Newzoo, Microsoft's gaming market share was 6.5% in 2020 and adding Activision would have taken it to 10.7%.
Executives talked up Activision's 400 million monthly active users as one major attraction to the deal and how vital these communities could play in Microsoft's various metaverse plays.
Activision's library of games could give Microsoft's Xbox gaming platform an edge over Sony's Playstation, which has for years enjoyed a more steady stream of exclusive games.
""The likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have already said they'd like to foray into gaming themselves, but Microsoft has come out swinging with today’s rather generous offer,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
Microsoft's offer equates to 18 times Activision's 2021 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). That compares with the 16 times EBITDA valuation of ""Grand Theft Auto"" maker Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive's cash-and-shares deal for Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) last week. 
According to Refinitiv data, the Microsoft-Activision deal would be the largest all-cash acquisition on record, trumping Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s $63.9 billion offer for  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2016 and the $60.4 billion that InBev bid for Anheuser-Busch in 2008. 
Tech companies from Microsoft to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have placed big bets on the so-called metaverse, with the buzz around it intensifying late last year after Facebook renamed itself as Meta Platforms to reflect its focus on its virtual reality business. 

""This is a significant deal for the consumer side of the business and more importantly, Microsoft acquiring Activision really starts the metaverse arms race,"" David Wagner, equity analyst and portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors said. 
""We believe the deal will get done,"" he said, but cautioned: ""This will get a lot of looks from a regulatory standpoint.""

Investing.com –   Sony  Corp. 's (T:6758) shares plunged over 10% on Wednesday after rival Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquired developer Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) in a record $68.7 billion deal.
The company’s Tokyo shares tumbled 10.22% to JPY12,775 ($111.41) by 11:58 PM ET (4:58 AM GMT).
Sony (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation is widely perceived as having a lead in the generational battle against Microsoft's Xbox. However, the acquisition of Activision, the maker of the “Call of Duty"" video game, will boost Microsoft’s aggressive expansion of its Game Pass subscription service.
Sony has strengthened its network of in-house games studios in recent years, the result of which was multiple exclusive hits such as the ""Spider-man"" franchise. This had left Microsoft struggling to keep up.
However, ""Sony will have a monumental challenge on its hand to stand its own in this war of attrition,"" Asymmetric Advisors market strategist Amir Anvarzadeh, warned in a note.
In a sign that it is adapting to the latest trends, Sony has been exploring virtual reality and announced a few teaser details of its next-generation headset earlier in the month. But other market players, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms, are already a step ahead by investing in the metaverse.
Meanwhile, with PlayStation a major source of revenue for Activision, this could make any potential attempts by Microsoft to remove titles from Sony's system a complex undertaking.
Some industry observers believe operability across multiple platforms is critical to a successful metaverse, which enables users to game, shop, and work freely.
Ever-advancing cloud technology is also weakening the appeal of the bulky gaming hardware that had thus far been Sony and Microsoft’s bread-and-butter.
""If Microsoft continues to provide these games to the PlayStation platform as well, that will indicate that it may be positioning itself for metaverse in the long-term,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Canada has put on hold its contract with Malaysian glove maker Supermax Corp as it awaits the results of an audit, weeks after the United States barred the firm over allegations the company uses forced labour.
Malaysian factories making everything from medical gloves to palm oil have increasingly come under scrutiny over allegations they abuse foreign workers, who form a significant part of the manufacturing workforce.
After the United States suspended Supermax imports last month, Canada's Public Services and Procurement department said on Wednesday it was holding Supermax deliveries as it awaits a report expected mid-month from Supermax Healthcare Canada.
""In light of the current situation, Canada has engaged with the company to seek assurances that Supermax Corp is not engaging in forced labour practices,"" the department said in a statement.
Supermax did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a ""Withhold Release Order"" on Oct 21 that prohibits imports from Supermax based on reasonable information that indicates the use of forced labour in its manufacturing operations.
Supermax has said it was in contact with the U.S. agency to obtain more clarity and that it had commissioned an independent consulting firm to conduct an audit into the status of foreign workers at its factories.
Canada said it will determine its next steps after reviewing the report from Supermax's Canadian unit.
""The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that it does not do business with companies that employ unethical practices, either directly or within their supply chains,"" it added.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 11:20PM ET</span>","BHP flags labour constraints, warns of further Omicron disruption","By Indranil Sarkar and Shashwat Awasthi
(Reuters) -Mining giant BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) on Wednesday joined rival Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) in warning of further disruptions from COVID-19, including labour shortages, and said the impact of the Omicron variant will last into the second half of its financial year.
BHP said the proposed easing of border restrictions in Western Australia on Feb. 5 may also cause some short-term disruption to the operating environment as the pandemic evolves in the state.
The mineral-rich state has maintained a hard-line on border controls during the pandemic, while a surge of Omicron cases across Australia has caused a dearth of workers in mines as well as train drivers to transport millions of tonnes of commodities.
With the country in the grip of an Omicron wave, BHP's production of some commodities fell in the December quarter. Labour constraints and wet weather also forced the global miner to cut its annual forecast for metallurgical coal.
""Workforce absenteeism arising from the COVID-19 Omicron variant is anticipated to continue into the early part of the second half of the 2022 financial year,"" the company said.
Rio Tinto forecast slightly weaker-than-expected 2022 iron ore shipments on Tuesday, partly due to tight labour market conditions.
Still, BHP's second-quarter iron ore production from Western Australia rose 5% to 73.9 million tonnes, helped by strong performance at its Jimblebar mine and ramped up production at its $3.6-billion South Flank project.
""With iron ore driving so much of the cash flow, the impact from today's result should be relatively muted considering the relative strength there will likely help to offset downgrades elsewhere,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Kaan Peker said.

BHP shareholders are set to vote on Thursday on whether to unify its structure, bringing its dual-listing in London within a single Australia-listed company.
The miner's shares were flat by 0335 GMT, while the broader market fell 0.9%.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning, with surging U.S. Treasury yields contributing to the continuation of a global selloff. Investors also continue to weigh the likelihood of a tighter U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy to curb inflation.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.89% by 9:01 PM ET (2:01 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.11%
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.51%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the Westpac Consumer Sentiment index contracted 2% in January, compared to the 1% contraction from the previous month.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.05%. China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.15% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.07%.
Global shares have had a volatile start to 2022, with challenges including a hawkish Fed, the economic impact from the omicron COVID-19 variant, and rising inflation. Higher bond yields are also forcing investors to re-evaluate valuations across a range of assets.
“Generally, we do expect to see that the bond market is going to drive volatility, more broadly based, across the equity markets and other markets as well,” CreditSights global head of strategy Winnie Cisar told Bloomberg.
She was also a little concerned about corporate earnings last quarter and in the first half of 2022, as they could miss high expectations.
In the U.S., Tuesday’s data showed that the NY Empire State manufacturing index fell to 0.70 in January. Housing data, including building permits, is due later in the day.
The question investors are wrestling with most is if the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to tighten monetary policy to guide inflation lower, or if a softening in economic growth will allow the central bank to be less aggressive in tightening, 22V Research founder Dennis DeBusschere told Bloomberg.
The former would be “terrible” for cyclical and technology shares, he added.
On the company front,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc.'s (NYSE:GS) trading revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 was worse than expected, in turn weighing on banks.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.'s (HK:9988) U.S. shares fell over a report that the U.S. is reviewing its cloud business to evaluate the risk to national security.

(Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI)'s Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick has gone from defending his handling of sexual harassment and discrimination claims at the video game maker to preparing to walk away with a windfall of at least $390 million.
The 58-year-old executive stands to receive the payday after clinching a deal on Tuesday to sell Activision to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for $68.7 billion, but the vast majority will come from the 3.95 million Activision shares he owns, regulatory filings show. 
He will miss out on a change of control payment because he doesn't own any unvested equities, which is uncommon for public company CEOs. 
Kotick plans to step down once the deal with Microsoft closes, which is expected in June 2023, a person familiar with the matter said. Had he stayed as Activision's CEO, he would have reported to Microsoft's gaming chief Phil Spencer, a far cry from running a standalone company. 
Kotick, who has led Activision since 1991 and turned it into one of the world's biggest videogame giants, said in an interview on CNBC on Tuesday that the company had ""worked through"" allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination that led to more than 20 employees being fired and 20 more individuals facing other forms of disciplinary action last year.
A spokesperson for Kotick and Activision declined to comment.
Activision shareholders only narrowly approved Kotick's $155 million pay package last year, after investors criticized the company for awarding him one of the highest compensation packages in the corporate world.
In response, Activision decreased Kotick's base salary and cash bonus by 50% and made 95% of his total compensation subject to performance. 

Activision also did away with a ""transformation transaction award"" that would have given Kotick a special payout, whose value would be determined in the future, should the company have been sold. 
In October, in light of the sexual harassment and discrimination charges at the company, Kotick dropped his salary to $62,500, the minimum allowed under California law and stopped receiving any bonuses or equities, vowing to improve the company culture.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell sharply on Tuesday as weak results from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) weighed on financial stocks and tech shares continued their sell-off to start the year as U.S. Treasury yields rose to milestones.
The Nasdaq dropped most among major indexes on Tuesday and now has fallen about 9.7% from its Nov. 19 record closing high, close to confirming a 10% correction for the first time since early 2021. The tech-heavy index also closed below its 200-day moving average, a key technical support level, for the first time since April 2020.
Goldman Sachs shares tumbled 7% after the investment bank missed quarterly profit expectations amid weak trading activity. The financials sector, which has been one of the better-performing groups in 2022, dropped 2.3%.
“The financials crumbling a little bit under the weight of less-than-impressive earnings quarters is probably the biggest factor today,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. “When you have taken out potentially one of the areas that actually was working here, that kind of casts a pall on the market.”
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields jumped to two-year highs and two-year yields breached 1% as traders prepared for the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in tackling unabated inflation.
The steep ascent in yields to start 2022 has weighed in particular on tech and growth stocks, whose future expected cash flows are discounted more sharply as yields rise.
“The hot inflation prints have spooked the market that the Fed is going to move and so we are seeing this rise in yields,” said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.
""It’s not only the rise in yields but the rapid rise in yields ... that really does cause some indigestion in the market, but particularly in growth, higher valuation, more speculative asset classes,” Mahajan said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 543.34 points, or 1.51%, to 35,368.47, the S&P 500 lost 85.74 points, or 1.84%, to 4,577.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 386.86 points, or 2.6%, to 14,506.90.
Of 11 S&P 500 sectors, 10 ended lower, with technology falling the most. Energy, the top-percentage gainer so far in 2022, was the lone sector in positive territory, rising 0.4%.
Declines in megacap stocks, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms, weighed heavily on the S&P 500 among individual shares.
A BofA survey showed that fund managers had cut their overweight positions in tech to their lowest levels since 2008, while another survey by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) found that a majority of respondents believed U.S. technology stocks are in bubble territory. 
Investors are zeroing in on next week's Fed policy meeting for more clarity on central bankers' next moves to rein in inflation. Data last week showed U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in December, culminating in the largest annual rise in inflation in nearly four decades.
In company news, Activision shares soared nearly 26% after Microsoft announced a deal to buy the video-game maker for $68.7 billion. Shares of other video game companies rose, with Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) up 2.7% and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software up 1%. Microsoft shares fell 2.4%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.93-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 69 new highs and 611 new lows.
About 11.9 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

(Reuters) - Microchip (NASDAQ:MCHP) design software maker Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems Inc is betting on growth from automakers and other chip users strapped by global supply shortages who face mounting competition from rivals such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that design their own chips.
Cadence and rivals Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) Inc and Siemens EDA are at the center of a microchip industry shift as cloud computing providers, software makers and others who traditionally have bought semiconductors from a few big companies now want to draw up their chips own in-house.
Tesla, Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google are among the leaders of in-house design. Executives across industries have taken note of how custom chips help set products apart, said Anirudh Devgan, who became Cadence's chief executive last month. The company counts Tesla as a client and analysts say Apple is as well.
Cadence shares fell 5% on Tuesday in a down market.
Developing a chip costs around $100 million, but artificial intelligence is reducing costs, even as traditional semiconductor firms keep raising prices, with many chips selling for more than $100 each.
""How many car companies have more than 1 million units? A lot of them,"" Devgan said in his first interview as CEO. ""At some volume, it's a no-brainer to do it because of cost, because of schedules and more importantly, for customization.""
Bottlenecks in the global semiconductor supply chain that have hobbled production at most major automakers for over a year also are forcing companies like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to rethink their approach to chip procurement.
The industry is consolidating hundreds of small micro-controller chips that crept into cars piecemeal over decades into a smaller number of more powerful and costlier chips. 
Tesla has always used a consolidated approach, and the results contrast sharply with those of other automakers. Despite a global chip shortage, Tesla reported record fourth-quarter production, in part because close control of its chip and system designs allowed the company's engineers to quickly rewrite code to use chips that were available.
Cadence makes electronic design automation (EDA) software that translates ideas on how a chip should work into the physical layout of tens of billions of transistors crammed onto a few millimeters of silicon. The resulting chips are often manufactured by third parties like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
In decades past, most of Cadence's customers were traditional semiconductor firms. But the newer breed of ""systems"" customers, which dream up full products in which chips play a central role, now account for about 40% of Cadence's revenue, said Jay Vleeschhouwer, head of software research for Griffin Securities.
Cadence has branched out to offer those customers software that goes beyond chip design to helping fit their custom chip into a full product. Cadence has acquired apps for tasks like packaging finished chips to put onto circuit boards and making sure the chips will not overheat and melt in daily use.
The allure of such functions ""extends to automotive, aerospace, industrial equipment, all of the makers of products"" in which chips eventually reside, said Joe Vruwink, analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. 
With the transformation of cars into rolling computers all but assured, automakers and other chip-design newcomers will face stiff competition when hiring chip architects, who are some of the most fought-over talent in the tech industry.

As little as four years ago, Vleeschhouwer said, EDA companies were not excited about the automotive market because it used less complex chips.
Now, multiple EDA firms ""have made pilgrimages to Detroit and other centers of automotive development, and they're making investments in those areas,"" he said. ""It's a consequence of the fact that the complexity of automotive systems, at the system level and the chip level, has become highly motivating.""

583,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 06:15PM ET</span>",Ford records $8.2 billion fourth-quarter gain from Rivian investment,"(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter results would include an $8.2 billion gain on its investment in Rivian Automotive Inc, following the electric-vehicle maker's blockbuster market debut in November.
Rivian had soared as much as 53% to cross $100 billion in the biggest initial public offering of 2021, but the company's shares have dropped over 27% since then.
The stock closed 8.5% lower on Tuesday after hitting its weakest since the IPO amid a broader tech selloff on Wall Street. 
Ford, an early investor in Rivian, currently owns about 12% of the California-based company and has itself been racing toward electrification in a shift away from traditional gasoline-powered cars as demand for green transport surges. 
It has pledged to invest more than $30 billion on EVs by 2030. 
In 2019, the 118-year-old Detroit automaker invested $500 million in Rivian, with plans to use the EV maker's platform to build a new Ford-branded electric vehicle, but the companies dropped those plans in 2021.
Ford, which is reporting its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 3, also said on Tuesday that it would reclassify its $900 million first-quarter 2021 non-cash gain on the Rivian investment as a special item. 
The reclassification will change the automaker's full-year adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) guidance that was previously forecast between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion including the gain. 
Ford also said it would record about $1.7 billion in costs associated with buying back and redeeming more than $7.6 billion in high-cost debt in the fourth quarter. 

It will also mark a non-cash gain of about $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $3.9 billion for the full year related to the remeasurement of its global pension and other post-retirement employee benefits. 
Ford also said it would report a $3.6 billion non-cash benefit, mostly due to changes in its global tax structure.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co was sued for $10 million on Tuesday by a 68-year-old Florida woman who said the carrier ejected her from a flight because she periodically needed to remove her mask to drink water.
Medora Clai Reading said she was wrongly removed from a Jan. 7, 2021, flight to Palm Beach, Florida, from Washington, D.C. after a hostile flight attendant kept demanding that she keep her mask on despite medical issues, including a heart condition and low blood sugar, requiring that she stay hydrated.
Southwest had no immediate comment, having yet to review the complaint. 
Reading's lawsuit in federal court in Brooklyn differs from disputes focused on travelers who are unwilling to wear masks.
The Federal Aviation Administration said airline crews in 2021 submitted 5,981 reports of unruly passengers, including 4,290 incidents related to masks.
In her complaint, Reading said that she offered to show the attendant her medical exemption card but was told, ""we don't care,"" and that the attendant objected to her later sipping water by shouting: ""You were talking!""
Reading said a gate attendant eventually ordered her off the flight, as an unmasked pilot ""laughed mockingly"" as she tearfully exited.
She said nearby police helped her to a chair and offered water, while commenting that similar occurrences were ""happening far too often"" and ""it is usually Southwest.""
Kristina Heuser, a lawyer for Reading, in an interview said a ""planeload full of witnesses"" saw the encounter, and some may have videotaped it.
Heuser said Southwest's ""hostile and abusive"" conduct reflected a ""COVID insanity"" that should not override federal laws protecting people with medical disabilities.
Reading's lawsuit alleges violations of the federal Air Carrier Access Act and various civil rights laws.

The flight attendant, two gate officials and the pilot, none of whom is identified by name, are also defendants.
The case is Reading v Southwest Airlines Co et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 22-00265.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields jumped to two-year highs and equity markets tumbled on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq falling more than 2%, as traders braced for the Federal Reserve to tackle fast-rising inflation by tightening monetary policy.
The dollar hit a six-day high as Treasury yields surged, while inflation fears were bolstered as oil prices rose to their highest since 2014 on possible supply disruptions after attacks in the Gulf increased an already tight outlook.
The jump in Treasury yields slammed U.S. and European technology stocks, while a drop in Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' stock led declines among U.S. banks after it missed quarterly earnings as the Fed slowed its asset purchases in November.
Two-year Treasury yields, which track short-term interest rate expectations, rose above 1% for the first time since February 2020 as traders priced in a more hawkish Fed before the U.S. central bank's policy meeting next week.
The two-, three- and five-year part of the yield curve will bear the brunt of expected Fed policy, said Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
""The front end of the market is still way underpriced for Fed tightenings. The two-year note could be 1.5% by March,"" he said.
The yield on two-year Treasuries rose 8.4 basis points to 1.051% and on 10-year Treasury notes they climbed 10.2 basis points to 1.874%, a yield last seen that high in early January 2020.
Yields have jumped since minutes from the Fed's December policy meeting showed it may raise rates sooner than expected and begin reducing its asset holdings to slow inflation and address a tight labor market.
Information technology was the biggest percentage declining sector on Wall Street, losing 2.48%, with interest rate-sensitive financials the second biggest, down 2.27%. 
Tech stocks also weighed the most in Europe, falling 2.2%, as European shares fell to their lowest level in more than a week. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell as much as 1.44% before paring some losses to close down 0.97%.
Securities will continue to revalue as the market anticipates rate hikes, said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.
""We still have a bit of a ways to go to prepare for three rate hikes or four rate hikes. We haven't priced that in,"" he said. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.51%, the S&P 500 fell 1.84% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.60% to close almost 10% below its record closing high on Nov. 19, which would confirm a correction. 
MSCI's all-country world index closed down 1.57% as tech stocks dropped in Asia overnight despite China easing policy again.
Investors are increasingly pricing in as many as four Fed rate hikes this year, with the first seen coming in March, and one from the European Central Bank.
Big market declines often occur in years following outsized gains on Wall Street, with nine sell-offs starting in the first quarter that averaged 10.9% since World War Two, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. 
However, ""history is a great guide, but it's never gospel,"" he said.
Oil was the only positive sector on Wall Street as Brent crude prices hit $88 a barrel after Yemen's Houthi group attacked the United Arab Emirates, escalating hostilities between the Iran-aligned group and a Saudi Arabian-led coalition.
Brent crude futures rose $1.03 to settle at $87.51 a barrel. U.S. crude futures settled up $1.61 at $85.43 a barrel. 
Gold prices fell. U.S. gold futures settled down 0.2%at $1,812.40 an ounce.
Japan's yen initially fell after the Bank of Japan said it would stick to its ultra-loose monetary policy, despite hopes the economy is finally kicking clear of deflation.

The yen was last down 0.01% at $114.5900. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.523% to 95.749 and the euro was last down 0.74%, at $1.1323.
Russia's rouble, highly volatile recently, firmed 1.18% to 76.9395 a dollar after reports the West was no longer considering cutting Russian banks off from the Swift global payments system and was instead eyeing sanctions on banks.

590,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 04:27PM ET</span>",Texas Power Grid Braces for Freeze That Imperils Fuel Supply,"(Bloomberg) -- The Texas power grid and the natural gas drillers, wind farms and solar arrays that supply it are facing their second test in a less than a month as sub-zero weather bears down on the Lone Star state. 
Temperatures in wide swaths of the second-largest U.S. state are forecast to plunge to well-below normal in coming days, according to the National Weather Service. 
The freeze will arrive little more than two weeks after the first arctic blast of the year crippled an as-yet undetermined number of gas wells, processing plants and other equipment vital to ensuring the steady flow of fuel to electricity generators.
During the early January chill, more than 10% of Texas gas production was knocked offline over a two-day period, according to BloombergNEF data. It was the most severe cut since the infamous February 2021 disaster that killed more than 200 people and paralyzed the state for the better part of a week.
“It is important to remember, however, as we have consistently stated, that some variation in production occurs with sudden temperature changes -– these are field operations, not controlled factory settings,” Todd Staples, president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association, said in an email.
Freeze Offs
In Midland, Texas, the unofficial capitol of the Permian Basin oil and gas field, temperatures are forecast to bottom out at 18 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-8 Celsius) on Thursday, 15 degrees below the normal low for that day. 
Gas wells are particularly susceptible to so-called freeze offs because of the high volumes of subterranean water that typically flow out of the ground alongside the fuel. Wind installations also can be knocked offline by intense cold while overcast weather and snow disrupt solar-power output. 
“If we experience another severe winter storm before operators have weatherized their equipment, the grid could be at risk again,” said Virginia Palacios, executive director of watchdog group Commission Shift. 
Crude Ripples
The impending chill may also roil oil markets depending on the extent of freeze offs in the Permian, North America’s largest crude field. Any supply hiccups typically create dislocations in regional oil prices before rippling into the broader oil-futures market. 
During this month’s earlier cold snap, West Texas crude rallied to a two-week high as buyers scrambled for supplies. 
The Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees oil and gas production in the state, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 04:21PM ET</span>",Explainer-Do 5G telecoms pose a threat to airline safety?,"(Reuters) - The chief executives of major U.S. passenger and cargo airlines have warned of a ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis this week as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) deploy new 5G services.
They said the new C band 5G service set to begin on Wednesday could render a significant number of aircraft unusable, causing chaos for U.S. flights and potentially stranding tens of thousands of Americans overseas.
Here is the background to the dispute:
WHAT HAPPENED?
The United States auctioned mid-range 5G bandwidth to mobile phone companies in early 2021 in the 3.7-3.98 GHz range on the spectrum known as C band, for about $80 billion.
WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned that the new 5G technology could interfere with instruments such as altimeters, which measure how far above the ground an airplane is travelling.Altimeters operate in the 4.2-4.4 GHz range and the concern is that the auctioned frequencies sit too close to this range.
In addition to altitude, altimeter readouts are also used to facilitate automated landings and to help detect dangerous currents called wind shear.
United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said last month the FAA's 5G directives would bar the use of radio altimeters at about 40 of the biggest U.S. airports.
U.S. airlines have warned the directives could disrupt up to 4% of daily flights. 
Kirby said if left unresolved it could mean that at major U.S. airports in the event of bad weather, cloud cover or even heavy smog ""you could only do visual approaches essentially.""
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THE FREQUENCY MAKE?
The higher the frequency in the spectrum, the faster the service. So in order to get full value from 5G, operators want to operate at higher frequencies.
Some of the C band spectrum auctioned had been used for satellite radio but the transition to 5G means there will be much more traffic.
WHAT DO THE TELECOMS COMPANIES SAY?
Verizon and AT&T have argued that C band 5G has been deployed in about 40 other countries without aviation interference issues.
They have agreed to buffer zones around 50 airports in the United States, similar to those used in France, for six months to reduce interference risks.
WHY NOT AN ISSUE ELSEWHERE?
The European Union in 2019 set standards for mid-range 5G frequencies in a 3.4-3.8 GHz range, a lower frequency than the service set to be rolled out in the United States. The bandwidth has been auctioned in Europe and is in use in many of the bloc's 27 member states so far without issue.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which oversees 31 states, said on Dec. 17 the issue was specific to U.S. airspace. ""At this stage, no risk of unsafe interference has been identified in Europe,"" it said.
FAA officials have noted the spectrum used by France (3.6-3.8 GHz) sits further away from the spectrum (4.2-4.4 GHz) used for altimeters in the United States and France's power level for 5G is much lower than what is authorized in the United States.
Verizon has said it will not use spectrum that is closer to the higher band for several years.
In South Korea, the 5G mobile communication frequency is 3.42-3.7 GHz band and there has been no report of interference with radio wave since commercialization of 5G in April 2019.
Currently, 5G mobile communication wireless stations are in operation near airports, but there have been no reports of problems.
""Wireless carriers in nearly 40 countries throughout Europe and Asia now use the C band for 5G, with no reported effects on radio altimeters that operate in the same internationally designated 4.2-4.4 GHz band,"" CTIA, a U.S. wireless trade group, said in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission.
HOW CAN THIS BE FIXED?

In the short-term, AT&T and Verizon agreed to temporarily defer turning on some wireless towers near key airports to avert a significant disruption to U.S. flights.
Longer-term the FAA needs to clear and allow the vast majority of the U.S. commercial airplane fleet to perform low-visibility landings at many airports where 5G C-band will be deployed. This means certifying altimeters to operate near 5G base stations.

Investing.com -- Stocks tumbled after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) missed fourth quarter estimates on weak trading activity, which weighed heavily on financials as corporate earnings reports roll out.
Big tech stocks got pounded by rising yields for Treasurys. The 10-year yield was at a two-year high, crossing 1% for the first time since early 2020. The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates three or four times this year, possibly beginning as early as March.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)grabbed headlines by announcing a $75 billion deal to buy game developer Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) in a big move into a fast-growing category.
Meanwhile telecom giants AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) andVerizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) said they would steer clear of U.S. airports in their 5G frequency rollout on Wednesday, as airlines and regulators raised questions about whether the frequencies would interfere with aircraft.
The government started taking orders from Americans who want four free Covid-19 rapid tests to be mailed to them in the next few weeks. The move, which came a day earlier than expected, comes as the Biden administration battles the latest surge in coronavirus cases.

(Reuters) -Kohl's Corp has been approached by a potential buyer, sources said on Tuesday, as the department store came under fresh pressure from an activist hedge fund to explore strategic options if it does not find a way to boost its stock price.
Acacia Research, which is backed by activist investment firm Starboard Value, has held talks nL1N2TY16E with Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) in the last few days to lay the groundwork for a bid, Reuters reported earlier, citing two people familiar with the discussions.
Representatives for Acacia and Starboard did not respond to requests for comment and it is not guaranteed that a bid or potential takeover will follow.
Macellum Advisors nL1N2SR2QD said on Tuesday that Kohl's should explore strategic options, including a sale, adding it planned to nominate directors to the retailer's board, confirming a Reuters report from December.
Kohl's share price jumped as much as 6% on a day the market was broadly trading lower. Kohl's said it does not comment on ""rumors and speculation"".
In a separate statement it said its ""strategy is producing results"" and that management and the board ""refuse to be distracted"" from delivering stronger results for all investors.
The approach from Acacia and push by Macellum create fresh upheaval for a company that only last year reached a deal with a group of activists, including Macellum, to refresh its board, and then faced calls from another activist, Engine Capital, to sell itself.
Since then changes including brand partnerships with beauty products chain Sephora have led to stronger sales, the company said. It added that ""based on our performance in 2021, we are positioned to exceed our key 2023 financial goals two years ahead of plan"".
But Macellum, which owns nearly 5% of Kohl's stock, hasn't been satisfied by progress achieved since last year when it along with two other firms nominated nine directors, including Macellum's chief executive officer, Jonathan Duskin.
Calling 2021 ""another lost year at Kohl's"", Macellum criticized the stock price's 22% drop from April when it reached the settlement through this week. In 2021, Kohl's agreed to add three new directors to its board, including two nominated by Macellum and the others.
Kohl's can optimize its balance sheet by monetizing $4 billion of its real estate and returning the proceeds to shareholders through a buyback, which could boost its stock to $100 apiece, Macellum said.
If Kohl's can't pursue improvements it should consider a sale, the hedge fund said, adding ""there are well-capitalized strategic and financial buyers that could pay a meaningful premium to acquire Kohl's."" It did not name those firms.

Starboard and Acacia would likely work with Oak Street Real Estate Capital LLC to try and sell off Kohl's real estate holdings to raise additional capital for a transaction, the sources familiar with the discussions said.
Kohl's real estate holdings are estimated to be worth between $7 billion and $8 billion.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 03:20PM ET</span>","Goldman profit hit by weaker trading, rising expenses; shares tumble","By Matt Scuffham and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -Shares in  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) fell as much as 8% Tuesday after Wall Street's premier investment bank missed quarterly profit expectations, hampered by weaker trading revenues and rising expenses.
The share decline put Goldman on course for its worst single-day showing since June 2020, shedding about $10 billion off its market valuation since Friday's close, although it recovered to trade down 6.5% towards the close.
Bank earnings in the fourth quarter have taken a hit from lower trading volumes as the Federal Reserve slowed the pace of its asset purchases after 18 months of pumping liquidity into capital markets to ease the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Fed's intervention had fueled trading activity as clients bought and sold more stocks and bonds, repositioning their portfolios to match the changing economic environment. But fourth-quarter earnings from large U.S. banks have showed the market backdrop returning to more normal levels.
With its capital markets focus, Goldman had been one of the main beneficiaries of market volatility since March 2020, enabling its fixed income and equities traders to enjoy their best period since the 2007-09 financial crisis.
However, revenue from global markets fell 7% in the fourth quarter to nearly $4 billion, owing to declines in both equities and fixed income trading revenues compared with a year ago.
""Goldman Sachs had an impressive record year, but a thud of a quarter,"" said Viola Risk Advisers analyst David Hendler.
Since taking over the reins from Lloyd Blankfein in 2018, Goldman's Chief Executive David Solomon has looked to diversify the bank's revenue with an aim to focus more on predictable revenue streams like consumer banking, wealth and asset management. The strategy aims to reduce the bank's reliance on unpredictable capital markets-focused businesses. 
However, the bank's global markets division, which houses its trading businesses, still accounted for more than a third of its revenues last year.
Aside from the trading slowdown, Goldman was also handicapped by a 23% rise in operating expenses, mainly reflecting higher compensation and benefits costs. 
Wage inflation has crimped banks' profits as top Wall Street banks have raised salaries for junior bankers, in particular, over the past year to attract and retain top talent.
Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski expressed surprise that Goldman's compensation ratio, which measures the proportion of a bank's revenues set aside to pay staff, had risen during the quarter. 
""This is the first time we've been covering the stock where the ratio increased 3Q to 4Q,"" he said.
Goldman has traditionally been one of the best-paying banks. 
""Our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to rewarding top talent in a competitive labor environment,"" Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman told analysts on a conference call.
For the year as a whole, Goldman's compensation ratio was 200 basis points lower at 30% than it was the year previously.
Last week, top executives at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the country's largest bank, flagged similarly high fourth quarter expenses and saw its shares fall 6%.
TRADING PAIN
Like its rivals, Goldman's trading slowdown overshadowed a 45% jump in investment banking revenue to $3.8 billion as its top rainmakers raked in record fees from advising on some of the largest mergers and initial public offerings. 
The bank's investment banking pipeline remained strong heading into 2022, Solomon told analysts.
Solomon acknowledged last year was exceptional in terms of client's trading activity but said he anticipates more market volatility than usual in 2022.
""Activity levels, given we're in a very, very unusual macro environment, are going to continue to be reasonable as we start into this year,"" he told analysts. ""You've still got a lot of volatility around the pandemic.""
The bank expects to hold on to market share gains made by its trading business even as the market environment returns to normal, executives said.

Goldman's profit fell to $3.8 billion in the quarter $4.4 billion a year earlier.
Earnings per share fell to $10.81 from $12.08 a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $11.76 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shareholders urged a judge on Tuesday to find Elon Musk coerced the company's board into a 2016 deal for SolarCity and asked that the chief executive be ordered to pay the electric vehicle company one of the largest judgments ever of $13 billion.
""This case has always been about whether the acquisition of SolarCity was a rescue from financial distress, a bailout, orchestrated by Elon Musk,"" Randy Baron, an attorney for shareholders, told the Zoom hearing.
The closing arguments recounted key findings from a 10-day trial in July when Musk spent two days on the stand defending the deal.
The lawsuit by union pension funds and asset managers alleges that Musk strong-armed the Tesla board into approving the deal for the cash-strapped SolarCity, in which Musk was the top shareholder. 
Musk has countered that the deal was part of a decade-old master plan to create a vertically integrated company that would transform energy generation and consumption with SolarCity's roof panels and Tesla's cars and batteries.
Evan Chesler, one of the lawyers representing Musk, told the hearing that the deal was not a bailout and SolarCity was far from insolvent and its finances resembled many high-growth tech companies.
""They were building billions of dollars of long-term value,"" Chesler said of SolarCity.
The all-stock deal was valued at $2.6 billion in 2016, but since that time Tesla's stock has soared. 
Shareholder attorney Lee Rudy urged Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware's Court of Chancery to order Musk return the Tesla stock he received, which would be worth around $13 billion at its current price.
Musk said in court papers such an award would be at least five times the largest award ever in a comparable shareholder lawsuit and called it a ""windfall"" for plaintiffs.
Rudy said Slights should consider Musk's contempt for the deposition and trial process, in which he repeatedly clashed with and insulted shareholder attorneys.
""It would be a windfall for Elon Musk if he got to keep shares he never should have gotten in the first place,"" Rudy said. 
Chesler called the request to order Musk to return the stock from the deal ""preposterous"" and said it ignored five years of unprecedented success at Tesla.
Tesla's stock was down 1% at around $1,040 in afternoon trade.
Tesla acquired SolarCity as the electric vehicle maker was approaching the launch of its Model 3, a mass-market sedan that was critical to its strategy. Shareholders allege the deal was a needless distraction and burdened Tesla with SolarCity's financial woes and debt.
Shareholders claim that despite owning only 22% of Tesla, Musk was a controlling shareholder due to his ties to board members and domineering style. If plaintiffs can prove this, it increases the likelihood that the court will conclude the deal was unfair to shareholders. 
Musk's lawyers said the celebrity entrepreneur had no power to fire directors or control their pay and he recused himself from price negotiations on the SolarCity deal.
""Without Elon Musk, Tesla might not exist let alone have a $1 trillion value,"" said Vanessa Lavely, an attorney for Musk. ""That doesn't make him a controller. That makes him a highly effective CEO.""

Slights ended the hearing by saying he expects to rule in about three months.
He said last week he intends to retire in the coming months and a related shareholder lawsuit challenging Musk's record pay package was transferred from Slights to another judge.

Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev cut the price target on SoFi by over 40% to $17 from $30.

(Reuters) -European shares closed at a one-week low on Tuesday, with tech stocks losing the most as a rise in short-term U.S. Treasury yields reflected increased expectations for an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve as soon as March. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 1.0% to 479.79 points. Tech stocks declined 2.2%, the most among their peers, as they resumed a losing spree that began at the start of the year. 
Two-year Treasury yields , which track short-term rate expectations in the United States, crossed 1% for the first time since February 2020. Higher lending rates tend to discount future earnings in technology firms.
The European tech sector has closed lower for 10 of the 12 trading sessions so far this year. 
""With the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) and BoE (Bank of England) already in tightening mode, it is difficult not to see the ECB (European Central Bank) similarly changing tack and moving policy towards fighting inflation also, particularly given the impact of soaring energy prices and the expectation that these are expected to continue their steady rise higher,"" said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital.
""We had a good start to the year, but that early euphoria has waned, and equities might have a difficult couple of weeks in the run-up to the Federal Reserve meeting."" 
The STOXX 600 hit record highs at the start of this month, but sharply reversed course as hawkish central banks, geopolitical tensions and soaring energy prices kept investors on edge.
Investors are now awaiting next week's Fed policy meeting following hawkish signals from central bank officials.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Beverages Africa (CCBA), the biggest bottling unit of Coca-Cola in the continent, is eyeing further consolidation of the parent's bottling operations there, its chief executive said on Tuesday, as it prepares to go public.
CCBA is the Atlanta-based company's eighth biggest bottling company with operations in 14 countries in the continent. Its spate of acquisitions since 2017 has brought bottling operations in Zambia, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, South Africa and other smaller bottlers under its fold to form a $3.2 billion behemoth by 2021.
""At CCBA, we firmly believe (in) one bottler, one country because that is the only way we can win in Africa,"" said CCBA CEO Jacques Vermeulen, during a virtual presentation to investors.
The company is also open to brand acquisitions and partnerships with other beverage makers in the continent, he added, but stressed that consolidation is second only to organic growth in its priorities.
Coca-Cola had said in April it was planning to list CCBA over the next 18 months, depending on market conditions. The primary listing would be in Amsterdam with a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).
Vermeulen did not reveal further details on the initial public offering.
Based on its revenue, CCBA could be among the top 40 companies on the local stock exchange.
The company has outpaced most of Coca-Cola's other bottling units in volume growth, but sales took a hit during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Chief Financial Officer Norton Kingwill said the company has returned to double-digit top-line growth and almost fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
Parent Coca-Cola will report full-year 2021 results, including for CCBA, in February.

Stepping up diplomacy after talks with Russia ended in stalemate last week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Kyiv on Wednesday before heading to Berlin to discuss ""joint efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine"" with German, British and French officials.
As fears of conflict rose, Britain said this week it had begun supplying Ukraine with anti-tank weapons, Canada's foreign minister visited Ukraine and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock held talks in Moscow and Kyiv to try to ease tensions. 
Baerbock warned that Moscow would suffer if it does attack its neighbour, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz signalled that Berlin's response might include stopping the Nord Stream 2 pipeline bringing gas to Germany.
Asked about the pipeline after meeting NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, Scholz said it was ""clear that there will be a high price to pay and that everything will have to be discussed should there be a military intervention in Ukraine"".
Scholz has previously said Germany is open to sanctions in the event of a Russian attack and that everything would be on the table. This would include Nord Stream 2, which has been built but has not yet secured approval to open.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said after meeting Baerbock on Tuesday that the pipeline would increase European energy security when it is open, and that ""attempts to politicise this project"" would be counter-productive.
Russia denies plans to attack Ukraine but says it could take unspecified military action unless its demands - including a promise by the NATO alliance never to admit Kyiv - are met.
Tens of thousands of Russian troops remain near Ukraine's borders and Moscow has also sent troops and military hardware to Belarus this week in preparation for drills with its close ally that have caused further concern in the West.
The tensions have helped push the Russian rouble down against the U.S. dollar and Russian stocks have fallen. 
MORE NATO-RUSSIA TALKS
In Berlin, Stoltenberg said he had invited NATO allies and Russia to a further series of meetings at the NATO-Russia Council to discuss ways to improve the security situation, after an inconclusive first round of talks in two years last week.
""NATO's allies are prepared to discuss concrete proposals on how to reduce risks and enhance transparency regarding military activities and how to reduce space and cyber threats,"" he told a joint news conference with Scholz.
""We are also prepared to resume the exchange of briefings on exercises and our respective nuclear policies.""
Although the West is rallying behind Ukraine, the former Soviet republic is not a NATO member and it has no treaty obligations to defend it.
U.S. President Joe Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troopsto Ukraine to fight Russian soldiers. 
Following up on last week's talks with Russia, which produced no breakthrough, Blinken will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv on Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said.
""The United States does not want conflict. We want peace,"" a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters.
""(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin has it in his power to take steps to de-escalate this crisis so the United States and Russia can pursue a relationship that is not based on hostility or crisis,"" the official said.

Blinken spoke with Lavrov on Tuesday and urged de-escalation, the State Department said separately. The senior official said the two decided in the call that it would be useful to meet in person.
Visiting Ukraine on Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said Ottawa would take a decision at the appropriate time on supplying military hardware to Ukraine.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 01:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive-U.S. examining Alibaba's cloud unit for national security risks - sources,"By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is reviewing e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s cloud business to determine whether it poses a risk to U.S. national security, according to three people briefed on the matter, as the government ramps up scrutiny of Chinese technology companies' dealings with U.S. firms.
The focus of the probe is on how the company stores U.S. clients' data, including personal information and intellectual property, and whether the Chinese government could gain access to it, the people said. The potential for Beijing to disrupt access by U.S. users to their information stored on Alibaba cloud is also a concern, one of the people said.
U.S. regulators could ultimately choose to force the company to take measures to reduce the risks posed by the cloud business or prohibit Americans at home and abroad from using the service altogether. The U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba fell nearly 3% before the market open Tuesday and were last trading down just over 1%. Former President Donald Trump's Commerce Department was concerned about Alibaba's cloud business, but the Biden administration launched the formal review after he took office in January, according to one of the three people and a former Trump administration official. 
Alibaba's U.S. cloud business is small, with annual revenue of less than an estimated $50 million, according to research firm  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) Inc. But if regulators ultimately decide to block transactions between American firms and Alibaba Cloud, it would damage the bottom line one of the company's most promising businesses and deal a blow to reputation of the company as a whole. 
A Commerce Department spokesperson said the agency does not comment on the ""existence or non-existence of transaction reviews."" The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.
Alibaba declined to comment. It did flag similar concerns about operating in the U.S. in its most recent annual report, saying U.S. companies that have contracts with Alibaba ""may be prohibited from continuing to do business with us, including performing their obligations under agreements involving our...cloud services."" 
The probe into Alibaba's cloud business is being led by a small office within the Commerce Department known as the Office of Intelligence and Security. It was created by the Trump administration to wield broad new powers to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from ""foreign adversary"" nations like China, Russia, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela.
The office has been particularly focused on Chinese cloud providers, one of the sources said, amid growing concern over the potential for data theft and access disruption by Beijing. 
The Trump administration issued a warning in August, 2020 against Chinese cloud providers including Alibaba, ""to prevent U.S. citizens' most sensitive personal information and our businesses' most valuable intellectual property...from being stored and processed on cloud-based systems accessible to our foreign adversaries."" 
Cloud servers are also seen as ripe for hackers to launch cyber attacks because they can conceal the origin of the attack and offer access to a vast array of client networks. 
While there are scant public cases of the Chinese government compelling a tech company to turn over sensitive customer data, indictments of Chinese hackers reveal their use of cloud servers to gain access to private information.
For example, hackers connected to the Chinese Ministry of State Security penetrated HPE’s cloud computing service and used it as a launch pad to attack customers, plundering reams of corporate and government secrets for years in what U.S. prosecutors say was an effort to boost Chinese economic interests. 
""PILLAR OF GROWTH"" Alibaba, the world's fourth largest cloud provider according to research firm Canalys, has about 4 million customers and describes its cloud business as its ""second pillar of growth."" It saw a 50% rise in revenue to $9.2 billion in 2020, though the division accounts for just 8% of overall sales. 
It has boasted business relationships with units of top U.S. companies including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM)'s Red Hat, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), according to press releases.
While the sweeping Trump era powers don't cover foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, U.S. regulators have previously found ways to link them to their U.S. parent companies, which can in turn be subject to restrictions. 
Before tech tensions between the United States and China started to boil, Alibaba had big ambitions for its U.S. cloud business. In 2015, it launched a cloud computing hub in Silicon Valley, its first outside of China, with plans to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google. It later added additional data centers there and in Virginia. A person familiar with the matter says the company scaled back its U.S. gambit during Trump's presidency as tensions with China escalated.

In 2018, U.S. authorities blocked a bid by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, now Ant Group, to acquire U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc over national security concerns. But a move to put Ant Group on a trade blacklist failed and an executive order banning its mobile payment app Alipay was revoked by Biden. 
Biden, like Trump, has placed more and more restrictions on Chinese companies. Last month, the U.S. government put investment and export curbs on dozens of Chinese firms, including top drone maker DJI, accusing them of complicity in the oppression of China's Uyghur minority or helping the military.

Investing.com — Medical device company  NeuroMetrix  Inc (NASDAQ:NURO) saw a 31.5% jump in its share price after it revealed the U.S Food and Drug Administration awarded its Quell technology product Breakthrough Device Designation.
The Breakthrough Device Designation has been granted to reduce moderate to severe symptoms of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.
The FDA Breakthrough Device Program is in place to help patients receive faster access to technologies that have the possibility of providing more effective treatment or diagnosis for life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases. The program means the FDA will give NeuroMetrix priority review and interactive communication regarding development and commercialization.
NeuroMetrix submitted data supporting the designation that included results from a 6-week study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Quell used at home for treatment of patients diagnosed with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.
""This Breakthrough Device Designation is an important step in our effort to make Quell technology available to patients suffering from the debilitating effects of CIPN,” said Shai Gozani, CEO of NeuroMetrix. “We are looking forward to completion and subsequent reporting of the results from the ongoing multi-center RCT of Quell in CIPN."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was withdrawing proposed conditions that could have allowed delivery company FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) to install a laser-based missile-defense on Airbus A321-200 airplanes.
The FAA said Tuesday it ""has determined that further internal study is necessary."" The FAA said to avoid confusion ""a comment period on a proposal that the agency is not moving forward at this time, the FAA is withdrawing the notice."" FedEx did not comment Tuesday and the FAA declined comment beyond the withdrawal. 
The FAA had said on Friday it was proposing conditions and opening the proposal for public comment.
In October, 2019, FedEx applied for approval to use a feature that emits infrared laser energy outside the aircraft as a countermeasure against heat-seeking missiles, the FAA disclosed Friday.
For decades, the airline industry and several governments have been grappling with the threat to airliners from shoulder-fired missiles known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADs. Some use infrared systems to target an aircraft's engines. 
""The FedEx missile-defense system directs infrared laser energy toward an incoming missile, in an effort to interrupt 
the missile’s tracking of the aircraft’s heat,"" the FAA document said.
According to the U.S. State Department, more than 40 civil airplanes have been hit by MANPADs since the 1970s.
In November 2002, two missiles narrowly missed an Arkia Israeli Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 757 passenger jet on take-off from Mombasa airport, and efforts to combat the threat accelerated.

In 2003, an Airbus A300 freighter flown by DHL was damaged by MANPADs and forced to make an emergency landing in Baghdad.
In 2007 and 2008, FedEx took part in a U.S. government trial of anti-missile technology for civil planes by installing  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC)'s Guardian countermeasures system on some commercial cargo flights while BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) said it had installed its JetEye system on an American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) airplane.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accounting watchdog said on Tuesday that KPMG and one of its former employees have admitted misconduct during the regulator's spot checks on an audit of software company Regenersis in 2015.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said Stuart Smith has admitted that he misled inspectors from the watchdog, and that his conduct was contrary to his ICAEW professional accounting body's code of ethics.
""KPMG has admitted that Mr Smith’s conduct amounted to misconduct, and that the firm is liable to be sanctioned in this respect,"" the FRC said in a statement.
The watchdog fined Smith 150,000 pounds ($203,745) and banned him from practising as an accountant for three years.
The FRC said sanctions on KPMG will be determined at the conclusion of an on-going tribunal hearing on checks on audits of Regenersis and builder Carillion.
Five other former KPMG employees are contesting FRC accusations of forging missing documents requested by the watchdog's inspectors during the inspections.
Smith, who was also due to contest the allegations at the hearing, decided to settle just before proceedings began last week.
""KPMG agrees that it is liable for the costs of, and incidental to, the investigation, enforcement proceedings and settlement in respect of KPMG and Mr Smith,"" the watchdog said.
KPMG had already admitted nL8N2TQ517 last week to misconduct in how the FRC was dealt with during spot checks of audits of Regenersis and Carillion, saying it had self-reported to the FRC after an internal investigation.

Jon Holt, CEO of KPMG UK, said last week he was very sorry for the misconduct and was determined to ensure it will never be repeated.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli expects sales of its upmarket chocolates to grow less in 2022 than last year, it said on Tuesday, and blamed supply chain bottlenecks for a slowdown in late 2021 in North America.
The maker of the best-selling Lindor chocolate balls, which has maintained spending on advertising and new products throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, said market share gains boosted organic sales by 13.3% last year.
Lindt, along with other chocolate makers, saw a dip in demand in 2020, but sales recovered strongly in 2021 as people ate more treats and bought gifts for friends and relatives they had been unable to see at the height of the pandemic.
Major European markets as well as the online business recorded double-digit growth, but North America slowed to 10.7% in the full year, from 18.8% in the first half, Lindt said. 
The slowdown ""was partly due to temporary supply chain bottlenecks caused by a lack of labour and materials at Russell Stover's three production sites,"" the Swiss chocolate maker said in an emailed statement, referring to a U.S. brand the group owns.
""Labour and materials shortages are largely confined to Russell Stover and have already improved since late autumn 2021.
""Measures to further improve the situation have been initiated. We are confident that the situation will normalise in the first quarter of 2022,"" the company added.
The group's participation certificates, which are more liquid than its shares, have fallen more than 10% so far this year, and on Tuesday closed down 4.1%.
Analysts said expectations were very high for the company.
Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said the performance was driven by a very strong premium chocolate market and market share gains, with beats in Europe and the rest of the world offsetting the miss in North America.
Looking ahead, the company based in Kilchberg on Lake Zurich said it expected its organic sales to grow 5%-7% this year, in line with medium to long-term guidance.
The company confirmed it expects to post an operating margin of ""around 14%"" for 2021 when it releases full results on March 8.
The margin is expected to reach 15% next year and then rise by 20-40 basis points per year from 2023, Lindt said.

Full-year sales rose to 4.59 billion Swiss francs ($5.01 billion), ahead of a 4.55 billion franc estimate in a Refinitiv poll.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators need to provide more clarity on the rules of the road for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets amid ongoing confusion over what activities are allowed, a top banking executive said on Tuesday.
""We're hoping for more clarity around digital assets,"" Emily Portney, chief financial officer for Bank of New (BNY) York Mellon Corp, the country's tenth largest lender, told Reuters in an interview. 
""Frankly, it's a bit confusing about who actually regulates digital assets and especially crypto … and of course exactly what you can or cannot do,"" said Portney, speaking after the bank posted a 17% rise in fourth quarter profits.
Portney's comments highlight growing frustration among banking industry executives as U.S. President Joe Biden's regulators have taken a cautious approach to digital assets. With cryptocurrencies surpassing $3 trillion in November, banks are keen to enter the space but many feel they cannot launch new products or expand existing offerings until the rules are clearer. 
BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), which specializes in holding and servicing assets on behalf of clients, in February announced it was developing a custody and administration platform for digital assets.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said in November that banks must obtain written permission from their bank supervisors before engaging in cryptocurrency-related activities, including custody services, a reversal from the Trump administration's policy which gave banks permission to provide crypto custody services.

The OCC and other regulators are engaged in a “policy sprint” to understand where to offer regulatory clarity for banks on cryptocurrencies. That effort will likely inform new guidance or rules, which could be released as soon as this year.
""A lot of the activity is happening in I guess what I would call the shadow banking system just because of the lack of clarity,"" said Portney.

Europe's fifth-largest insurer set out ambitious three-year targets in Nov 2019, including raising its target for business operating profit after tax return on equity (BOPAT ROE) to more than 14% from the previous goal of more than 12%. 
""We're fully in the race to deliver to shareholders all our targets for 2022... we can even exceed those targets,"" Greco told Reuters Breakingviews in an interview.
Insurers were gloomy about the outlook for the industry when the coronavirus outbreak took hold in early 2020. But they have remained profitable after excluding COVID-19 from many policies and raising premiums.
Greco said the commercial insurance business in particular was likely to see strong growth this year, helped both by rising premium rates and by increasing demand for cover. 
Traditional markets such as Germany and Switzerland as well as emerging markets such as Brazil and Indonesia provided growth opportunities, he said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) has filed another set of patent infringement lawsuits against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the latest salvo between the two companies over royalty payment for use of 5G wireless patents in iPhones.
Both companies have already sued each other in the United States as negotiations failed over the renewal of a seven-year licensing contract for telecoms patents first struck in 2015.
Ericsson sued first in October, claiming that Apple was trying to improperly cut down the royalty rates. The iPhone maker then filed a lawsuit in December accusing the Swedish company of using ""strong-arm tactics"" to renew patents.
""Ericsson has refused to negotiate fair terms for renewing our patent licensing agreement, and instead has been suing Apple around the world to extort excessive royalties ... we are asking the court to help determine a fair price,"" an Apple spokesman said on Tuesday. 
Patent lawsuits are quite common among technology companies because every dollar saved could amount to significant amounts over the duration of the agreement, with companies such as Ericsson charging $2.50 to $5 for every 5G handset.
""Since the prior agreement has expired, and we have been unable to reach agreement on the terms and scope of a new licence, Apple is now using our technology without a licence,"" an Ericsson spokesman said.

The Swedish company invests about $5 billion a year in research, has a portfolio of more than 57,000 patents and royalties from its patent portfolio account for roughly a third of its operating profit. 
Last year Ericsson settled patent lawsuits with Samsung (KS:005930) after several months of court battles that temporarily hit its quarterly earnings. Pending dues are usually cleared after a settlement is reached.

Forty-nine percent of market participants polled by  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) answered “yes” when asked if there was a bubble in such shares, according to its January global market survey released Tuesday. Thirty-nine percent said “no” and 12% didn’t know. 
The high-growth stocks that benefitted most from historically low interest rates are now being hit hardest by expectations of tighter monetary policy from central banks worldwide. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which had more than doubled since March 2020, slid 1.6% Tuesday and is down almost 9% from its mid-November peak. 
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s January global fund manager survey showed that net allocation to the technology sector fell 20% month-over-month to 1%, the lowest since 2008.
Yet correctly identifying a bubble in asset prices or timing its collapse has always been difficult. In a Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) survey from March, U.S. technology stocks were regarded as one the most bubbly assets, though prices continued to plow ahead anyway. 
The recent drop, however, comes amid growing and widespread conviction that the Federal Reserve is poised to start raising interest rates and rolling back the unprecedentedly loose monetary policy that helped stocks soar during the pandemic.
“Higher interest rates are going to be here to stay and that has to factor into everyone’s decisions -- not just those that are borrowing capital but mostly in terms of valuations,” Julie Biel, portfolio manager and senior research analyst at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, said on Bloomberg TV. “So those super high-flying narrative-driven tech stocks are going to continue to take a beating.”
Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, says technology stocks have been “collateral damage” from the recent spike in bond yields. Looking to the future, she sees the most pain persisting for tech companies without profits, saying those with strong balance sheets and pricing power will have further room to run.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) shareholders are urging Canada's No. 3 lender to seriously examine the Mexican consumer banking unit being sold by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), arguing it would benefit from scaling up in the fast-growing Latin American country.
Markets view Scotiabank as a logical bidder even though Chief Executive Officer Brian Porter downplayed appetite for big deals just a day before Citi announced the sale of Citibanamex, the third biggest retail bank in Mexico.
Acquiring Citibanamex, estimated to be worth $4 billion to $8 billion, would help Scotiabank expand in Mexico, which accounted for nearly a quarter of its international business revenue in fiscal 2021, and 7.6% of total revenue.
""It's another opportunity to expand outside of Canada, which I'm in favour of,"" said Allan Small of Allan Small Financial Group with iA Private Wealth.
""If the assets are made available at the right price, I would not be surprised to see Scotiabank bid for them,"" Small added.
Scotiabank had about C$7.5 billion of excess capital at the end of 2021, but Porter said the bank is not considering acquisitions outside of U.S. wealth deals of less than C$900 million ($719 million).
""There aren't any big files on my desk in terms of buying somebody's stake in a Mexican bank or anything like that,"" Porter said last week at a conference. 
A Scotiabank spokesperson declined to comment further. 
Expansion in Mexico is not without risks. Scotiabank's international business, dominated by Mexico, Peru, Chile and Colombia, has disappointed recently as the pandemic hit some markets later and harder than at home. 
And the business has historically accounted for most of its impaired loans and write-offs.
FASTER GROWTH
Still, it has helped Scotiabank outperform in other periods. Even in 2021, strength in Mexico and Chile helped offset weakness in the other two markets, and Porter expects them to continue leading growth this year. 
With faster economic growth and interest rate increases than Canada, the unit is also expected to drive a recovery in net interest margins. 
A deal ""would add significant incremental scale that could drive stronger bottom line results within Mexico,"" said Edward Jones Analyst James Shanahan.
Limited Canadian growth has driven major banks' overseas expansion for decades. They have redoubled their efforts after amassing billions of dollars of excess capital during the pandemic, with most focused on the United States.
That has raised some questions about overpaying. Amid concerns about the premium Bank of Montreal paid in its $16.3 billion purchase of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' U.S. unit last month, executives said it could extract greater efficiencies and better returns than smaller players.
Referring to an analyst estimate that Citi could seek as much $15 billion for Citibanamex, Kingwest & Co Portfolio Manager Anthony Visano said Scotiabank would require ""substantial equity financing"" to fund such a deal. But its presence in the same markets as Citi would help it achieve better synergies than BMO would in the U.S., and create Mexico's second-biggest lender by deposits, he said.
""Does it warrant a higher price on the surface? Possibly,"" he said. ""But they'd be right to be prudent. The key consideration is price."" 

Should Scotiabank bid, it could face hefty competition from potential suitors including Mexican entrepreneur Javier Garza Calderon, local billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego, Carlos Slim's Inbursa and Spain's  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN).
And while Mexican government officials have said they have ""no bias"" toward foreign or local bidders, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has urged domestic investors to ""Mexicanize"" the bank.

The U.S. Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission issued a joint statement saying U.S. industries had become increasingly concentrated and a surge in merger filings in 2020 and 2021 signaled the situation will worsen.
In the statement FTC Chair Lina Khan cited a need to prevent price rises and prevent companies from pushing wages down. She said the agencies were soliciting public opinion on how best to address this. 
Jonathan Kanter, head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said the government wanted to ""think carefully about how to ensure our merger enforcement tools are fit for purpose in the modern economy.""
The FTC and Justice Department had said in July, when the Biden administration issued a competition executive order, that they would soon launch a review of merger guidelines to determine if they were overly permissive.
Previous guidelines spelled out analytical techniques and evidence to be relied upon to determine if a merger is legal under antitrust law. 

Sarah Miller, founder of the American Economic Liberties Project, called the plan to rejig the guidelines a victory.

The miner's share price is down more than 4.5% on Tuesday, weighed by a recent fall in Bitcoin, which is down again today.
Lewis said the company was an early mover in the Bitcoin mining space and its hash capacity of 3.5 EH/s points to 1.9% of the current global hash capacity makes it one of the largest publicly traded BTC miners.

Last year the group filed a request to put more than 3,000 workers under a temporary lay-off scheme for 13 weeks, triggering protests from unions.
Following negotiations with unions, the group agreed to furlough more than 2,000 workers at four plants in southern Italy which make aircraft parts for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus. The four plants employ more than 4,000 people in total.
The workers will be under a temporary lay-off scheme for 13 weeks starting Jan. 17. 
To overhaul its loss-making division Leonardo will press on with investments to broaden the range of products it makes at the division.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Bosch have agreed to set up a joint venture by the end of this year to equip battery cell factories and help make Europe self-sufficient in battery production.
The venture will deliver battery production systems and assist battery cell manufacturers in scaling up and maintaining production sites, Volkswagen said on Tuesday, adding it would serve its own factories and others across Europe.
""Europe has a one-time chance to become the global powerhouse for batteries in coming years,"" Volkswagen board member Thomas Schmall, who is responsible for VW's battery plans, said.
""We are working to build a complete, localised, European supply chain for 'made in Europe' e-mobility.""
The companies did not say how much they would invest in the venture.
So far, battery cell plants capable of generating just under 900 gigawatt hours (GWh) of capacity have been announced in Europe, according to data from the European Battery Alliance (EBA) - set to make up about 16% of global production by 2029.
But the EBA has said a third of global batteries should be produced in Europe by 2030 to cut dependence on suppliers that dominate the market, mostly from South Korea and China.
The largest planned battery plant in Europe is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s, located in Berlin next to its electric vehicle factory and set to produce over 100 GWh of capacity at its peak.
Both the plant and the factory are still awaiting approval from regional authorities to begin production.
Volkswagen, intent on outdoing Tesla as the top electric vehicle (EV) seller, has announced plans to build six so-called gigafactories in Europe by the end of the decade with a joint capacity of 240 GWh, in an attempt to control as much of the supply chain as possible.
Volkswagen's CEO Herbert Diess, who clashed at the end of last year with the company's powerful workers council over his electrification strategy, said the battery division was expected to generate sales of 20 billion euros ($22.7 billion) by the end of the decade and was being readied for a partial sale.
The carmaker, which last December upped its spending on electrification in the next five years to 52 billion euros, has committed to exclusively selling EVs in Europe from 2035. 
For Bosch, the move will strengthen its role in the transition towards EVs, which for many suppliers represents an existential threat as building a EV requires fewer steps and less labour than building an internal combustion engine car.
The supplier, the world's largest, has in the past decided against investing in battery cell production itself, deeming the upfront capital investment too costly.

German newspaper Handelsblatt reported in December the two companies were also nearing an agreement to cooperate on automotive software, with Volkswagen planning to invest a triple-digit million euro amount. The companies declined to comment.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and ADT Inc have launched a $105 million joint venture, Canopy, to develop and market in-vehicle security systems for commercial and retail customers, the companies said on Tuesday.
The first standalone systems, due in about 12 months, will employ video cameras to monitor vehicles and equipment stowed in them. Customers will be able to live-stream video via a mobile app.
Designed for self-installation in a variety of vehicle makes and models, the systems will be available for purchase from Ford dealers and other retail and online outlets. ADT will provide monitoring services, for a monthly subscription fee.
Canopy has not disclosed prices or fees.
Eventually, Canopy plans to develop original-equipment systems that will be installed at the factory, according to Christian Moran, interim chief executive of the joint venture, which will be headquartered in Detroit and London.
Ford's investment in Canopy is about $63 million, or 60%, and ADT's is about $42 million or 40%.
Ford will be the first to offer the vehicle security systems to existing customers, but Canopy expects to approach other vehicle manufacturers, as well as insurance and technology companies.

The vehicle security systems will bundle acoustic sensors and radar with Ford's AI-driven camera technology in a package about the size of a dash cam. The device can be mounted in a pickup bed or van cargo area.
With the automaker's Ford Pro commercial services unit as a launch partner, Canopy aims to sell its first systems and subscription service early next year to owners of commercial trucks and vans in the United States and the UK, including Ford's F-150 and F-150 Lightning pickups and Transit and E-Transit vans.

BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Larry Fink, chief executive of the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), has defended its focus on the interests of society as well as on profits in the face of criticism from many sides.
Asset managers increasingly analyse corporate performance on environmental, social and governance-related issues to bolster returns and to attract cash from investors focused matters such as workforce diversity or how to cut carbon emissions.
In his annual open letter, Fink built on themes he has raised in previous January missives to other CEOs. He called on them to find a purpose and to practice 'stakeholder capitalism,' whereby companies seek to serve the interests of all connected to them. 
""Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics,"" Fink said in the letter issued late on Monday, entitled The Power of Capitalism. 
He said it was not 'woke' and did not have an ideological agenda, but was capitalist in that it was based on mutually beneficial relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and communities.
Fink, 69, also spoke up for BlackRock's stance in engaging with companies on the transition to a low-carbon economy rather than divesting from fossil fuel sectors, saying the companies cannot be the ""climate police."" 
""Divesting from entire sectors – or simply passing carbon-intensive assets from public markets to private markets – will not get the world to net zero,"" he said.
In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday Fink added that he is frustrated about the process of the energy transition. He said it will require ""a combination of government and private sector and that's just not happening.""
MISSED OPPORTUNITY?
While Fink had used previous letters to announce actions like a tougher threshold for some funds to invest in coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, climate campaigners called the latest letter a missed opportunity.
""There’s not much to see here other than more hot air from a would-be climate leader,"" said Ben Cushing, Fossil-Free Finance Campaign Manager with the Sierra Club.
Jennifer J. Schulp, a director at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Fink's emphasis on profits showed his focus on the shareholder aspects of stakeholder capitalism, which she called ""an ill-defined and vaguely-defined term."" 
""I took this as him trying to stake out a middle ground and find a balance,"" Schulp said in an interview. 
Overseeing $10 trillion as of Dec. 31, BlackRock is one of the most influential voices in U.S. and European boardrooms, making Fink's annual letter a must-read.
In Monday's letter, Fink unveiled plans to launch a Center for Stakeholder Capitalism to create a ""forum for research, dialogue, and debate."" 
Fink also said that BlackRock is working to expand an initiative for investors to use technology to cast proxy votes. 
Under pressure from investors BlackRock cast a more critical set of proxy votes in 2021 such as backing calls for emissions reports or the disclosure of workforce diversity data. 
At the same time the fund manager has faced challenges from conservative U.S. politicians. On Monday, West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore said his agency would no longer use a BlackRock liquidity fund, where it kept $21.8 million as of Jan. 6. 

In a news release, Moore cited BlackRock's dealings in China and noted ""that BlackRock has urged companies to embrace 'net zero' investment strategies that would harm the coal, oil and natural gas industries."" 
A BlackRock spokesman declined comment on the action.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has appointed wealth management executive Emma Crystal as its new chief sustainability officer, replacing Marisa Drew, who leaves after more than 18 years at the bank, a memo to staff seen by Reuters showed.
Crystal, who currently leads the International Wealth Management business for Northern & Western Europe, will start in the new role on April 1 and report directly to Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein, the memo said.
A spokesman for Credit Suisse confirmed the contents of the memo.
Switzerland's second-largest lender created a new division focused on sustainability and research in July 2020, earmarking 300 billion Swiss francs for sustainable financing over the next decade and creating its first executive-level sustainability role, filled by Lydie Hudson (NYSE:HUD).
However, following a series of major scandals, the bank in November 2021 announced a restructuring under recently appointed chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio, which did away with the sustainability division and executive-level sustainability role, reintegrating it into the business divisions instead. Hudson is due to leave the bank at the end of the first quarter.
Horta-Osorio left Credit Suisse on Monday after less than nine months in the job, following an internal probe into his personal conduct.
Drew, formerly an investment banker and then head of the bank's sustainability-focused impact advisory and finance department, was named chief sustainability officer and head of sustainability strategy in Aug. 2020, reporting to Hudson before her departure.
Drew is leaving the bank after 18 years to pursue an opportunity outside the firm, Gottstein said in the memo.
Crystal joined Credit Suisse in 2013 and since 2020 has led international wealth management's sustainable client solutions unit alongside her regional role.
""Emma will be responsible for partnering with the divisions, regions and functions, to deliver on our existing Sustainability commitments, including expanding our wealth management product shelf, investment banking financing offering and net zero deliverables,"" Gottstein said.

Her successor within wealth management is yet to be announced.

Investing.com – Gap stock (NYSE:GPS) plunged 7.8% Tuesday after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) MS downgraded it to underweight with a target of $14, still 17% lower than its prevailing price of $16.85.
Analyst Kimberly Greenberger earlier rated the stock equal weight with a target of $20. According to reports, she sees promotions and discounts hurting margins, expecting Gap and other mall-based specialty retailers to revert to the declining path of pre-pandemic times. She believes the margin erosion could last several years.
Greenberger’s caution comes after the pandemic-fueled consumption drove retailers’ operating margins to a record.
Excluding today’s fall, Gap shares have lost more than 45% of their value since the start of June.
Gap is home to well-known brands like Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta. For the third quarter ended Oct. 30, net sales were down 1% at $3.9 billion compared to 2019 levels. The company blamed supply chain disruptions for the muted sales.
Third-quarter adjusted operating margin of 4.3% decreased 320 basis points compared to 2019. That forced it to significantly lower its annual outlook in November, less than three months after raising it.
The company expects its 2021 diluted earnings per share to come in between 45 cents and 60 cents, compared to the $1.90 to $2.05 range it gave in August. Estimate for net sales was cut to about 20% from the near 30% growth seen earlier on a year-on-year basis. Operating margin was seen down by 2.5 percentage points from the previous estimate to about 4.5% for the year.

MILAN (Reuters) -Prada sales bounced back sharply in 2021 as pent-up demand for luxury handbags and clothes helped push revenues above pre-pandemic levels, the Italian fashion group said.
In an unscheduled trading update, Prada (OTC:PRDSY) said on Tuesday that group sales last year rose 41% at constant exchange rates to 3.364 billion euros ($3.83 billion), 8% above 2019 levels.
Milan-based Prada, known for its minimalist designs, was in the middle of a shift upmarket and online to revive sales when the coronavirus crisis hit, forcing retailers to shut stores around the globe and depriving them of key tourist spending.
But like other luxury groups Prada has emerged strongly from the pandemic thanks to a desire among cooped-up consumers to pamper themselves with high-end purchases. These have not been hit by the same supply chain snags as some other products given that the luxury industry produces mainly in Europe. 
Prada is the first major luxury group to release results in 2022, with Richemont and Burberry due on Wednesday and LVMH next week. 
In November, Prada set itself a medium-term sales goal of 4.5 billion euros and the figure for 2021 was above an estimate of 3.28 billion euros in an analyst consensus cited by UBS.
The Hong Kong-listed group, which had not been due to disclose full-year results before March, said sales had particularly accelerated in the second half of last year thanks to its retail network, which grew by 27% compared to 2020 and by 21% compared to 2019, including e-commerce. 
Core profit also showed a ""significant increase"" in the second half of 2021 thanks to a higher contribution from the retail channel and a full-price policy, while the group had a ""sound net financial surplus"" at the end of 2021, it added.
""The Prada Group has the capabilities and resources to set itself apart and deliver on its future growth objectives,"" said Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli, who said in November he could hand over the running of the family-owned fashion house to his son Lorenzo in three to four years time.

While Prada's 2021 sales are still below a record 3.6 billion euros in 2013 and growth rates lag industry leaders Louis Vuitton and Hermes, the recovery has been accelerating and analysts say momentum for the Italian brand is strong.
UBS analysts estimate that barring a nasty surprise in the final quarter, listed luxury goods companies will end 2021 with an average 30% sales increase at constant currencies, which strip out the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, with group sales exceeding the 2019 level by around 10%.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Farallon Capital Management on Tuesday urged Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp to secure the legally required support of two-thirds of its shareholders before the Japanese industrial conglomerate continues with a controversial plan to split in three.
U.S. hedge fund Farallon, Toshiba's third-largest shareholder with a stake of more than 6%, joined the second-largest investor 3D Investment Partners in demanding a higher threshold for the break-up plan.
Since Toshiba is nearly 30% owned by foreign funds, many of which appear to oppose the split, setting the 67% bar could force the conglomerate to ditch its plan.
Toshiba should seek approval from two-thirds of its shareholders ""before it risks expending significant time, cost and management resources on the separation plan,"" Farallon said in a statement.
""The separation plan without shareholder trust would achieve nothing but the creation of three discrete companies, with each inheriting the same issues as Toshiba,"" it said.
Toshiba is preparing to hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting (EGM) in March to gauge shareholder support for the break-up plan, set to be completed by March 2024. But details of the meeting have been undecided, including the level of shareholder support it will require to continue with the plan.
In a statement to Reuters, the company said it would announce the EGM date and agenda when it decides on the convocation.

With its demand, Farallon is effectively forcing Toshiba to bring forward by more than a year a legally mandated vote requiring backing from two-thirds of shareholders. Officially, the vote is not slated to be held until the annual shareholders' meeting in 2023.
The break-up plan was announced last November after a five-month strategic review following years of accounting scandals and governance issues that undermined investor confidence and saw Toshiba's market value more than halve, to around $18 billion, from an early 2000s peak.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Acacia Research, which is backed by activist investor Starboard Value, has reached out to Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) to express its interest in making a bid for the retailer, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Acacia, which buys businesses in sectors such as technology and healthcare, would likely be the lead investor in a bid with Starboard backing it, the sources said.
The outreach comes at a time when hedge fund Macellum Advisors GP LLC is stepping up pressure on Kohl's to add new board members and hire bankers to consider a sale if the retailer does not improve its business to boost its stock price.
Kohl's stock price is trading up 2.13% on a day when the broader market is down.
There is no guarantee that any transaction will happen, said the sources, who are not permitted to discuss the private outreach publicly.
As a result of its partnership with Starboard, Acacia has roughly $1 billion in available capital and Starboard would provide additional capital to support a bid, the sources added.
Starboard and Acacia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Kohl's representative said the company cannot comment on ""rumors and speculation.""

The sources said that Starboard and Acacia would likely work with Oak Street Real Estate Capital LLC to try and sell off Kohl's real estate holdings to raise additional capital for a transaction.
Kohl's real estate holdings are estimated to be worth between $7 billion and $8 billion.

Investing.com — Shares of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell over 1% Tuesday following the announcement of a price increase last week. Reuters reported Friday that the company has increased the monthly fee by $1 to $2 depending on the plan to help fund new programming. 
Analysts have been largely positive on the news, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Doug Anmuth telling investors in a note that he believes the increase will drive an incremental $1 billion-plus of revenue in 2022. Anmuth added that each price increase ""could drive a bit more friction."" However, he believes Netflix is willing to trade off a small amount of subscribers for incremental revenue.
BMO Capital analyst Daniel Salmon reiterated an 0utperform rating and a $700 price target on Netflix, explaining in his note to clients that ""increases in the U.S., Canada and South Korea show continued pricing power.""
The analyst added that this supports the expanding free cash flow on which ""more investors are focused after high-multiple businesses have been re-valued.""
Elsewhere, Piper Sandler, Wedbush and KeyBanc were all positive on the price hike. 
However, Deutsche Bank lowered their price target on Netflix shares to $580 from $590, maintaining a Hold rating. While they did not cite the price change, Deutsche Bank said in its note that third-party data used to calculate the company's Q4 net additions ""has not been encouraging."" "

Investing.com – Peloton stock (NASDAQ:PTON) fell 5.5% Tuesday on fears the company’s decision to charge for setup and delivery of its bicycles and treadmills will create dissonance amongst consumers at a time when it’s struggling to sell more of its fitness equipment.
Just five months back, the company lowered the price of its flagship exercise bike to grow its consumer base. That attempt fell flat owing to its image of being a maker of premium products.
Effective January 31, Peloton will charge $250 for setup and delivery of its bicycles and $350 for its treadmills. These services once came bundled with the price of the equipment. The price of the bike in the U.S. will now jump to $1,745 while Peloton Tread will cost $2,845.
Peloton also said it will hike the base price of both pieces of equipment for customers in the U.K., Germany and Australia, although delivery and setup will continue to come with no separate charge.
Last year’s reopening of the economy brought a rude surprise to Peloton, one of the biggest winners of the pandemic when stuck-at-home people used its machines to exercise at home. As the pandemic waned, the company struggled to retain its clients as people returned to their walks and runs and to gyms.
The company also struggled with the recall of its treadmill machine. The stock is now trading at less than $31, less than one-fifth of its high of $166.50.
Late last month, Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler drew attention to another soft quarter for the company amid increasing costs and supply chain bottlenecks.
For the second quarter ended December, Peloton expects revenue to come in between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. For the full year, the company has guided for revenue of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion.

The review based on studies involving around 65,000 pregnancies at different stages did not find any sign of higher risk of complications, miscarriages, preterm births or severe side-effects on the unborn babies from mRNA shots, the European Medicines Agency said. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech, as well as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), currently supply such vaccines to the European Union. 
While the EMA acknowledged some limitations in the data, it said results were consistent across studies.
""The benefits of receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy outweigh any possible risks for expectant mothers and unborn babies,"" the agency said https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-latest-safety-data-provide-reassurance-about-use-mrna-vaccines-during-pregnancy.

The review by an internal team also found that COVID-19 shots are as effective at cutting the risk of hospitalisation and death in pregnant people as in non-pregnant people. 
Several EU countries have already endorsed the use of COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant people, and the EMA's backing of mRNA shots is likely to bolster vaccination campaigns in smaller nations that rely on the regulator's scientific expertise.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened broadly lower again on Monday as inflation fears, embodied in rising bond yields and surging oil prices, combined with some weak-looking earnings to dampen sentiment.
While technology stocks underperformed again, losses were broad-based. By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 518 points, or 1.4%, at 35,394 points, a four-week low. The S&P 500 was also down 1.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5%. 
That came after a long holiday weekend during which U.S. Treasury bond yields had snuck up to their highest in over two years. The benchmark 10-year yield hit 1.85% before retracing to 1.81%, while the two-year yield rose above 1% for the first time since the start of the panic. Meanwhile, crude oil prices surged to a seven-year high as a drone strike by Iranian-backed militia in Yemen against the United Arab Emirates added to concerns that the world's biggest producers will struggle to meet their commitments to increase supplies to world markets. 
The mood was also soured by more disappointments on the earnings front, where Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) joined JPMorgan and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in reporting a decline from the sugar-rush highs of last year's results. Lower revenues from bond trading and a sharp rise in operating expenses were only partly offset by another strong quarter for deal-making revenue. Goldman stock fell 8.1% to its lowest since July. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), whose report on Friday had kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season, fell 3.0% to its lowest since September.
Macro data also disappointed, with the New York Empire State Manufacturing Index plummeting to a 19-month low as Omicron-variant Covid-19 spread across the state this month.
The general sell-off overshadowed some major M&A news, as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) agreed to pay over $50 billion for troubled videogames publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). The deal will make Microsoft, which already owns the publisher of Minecraft, the world's third-biggest videogame company by revenue - a striking development given the doubts that CEO Satya Nadella had about the place of the Xbox in Microsoft's future when he took over at the helm of the software giant. For Activision, the deal represents an exit under irresistible pressure on CEO Bobby Kotick, who has been unable to fix long-running problems with the company's workplace culture.  Activision stock rose some 30% on the news, while Microsoft stock fell 1.5%. in line with the market.
Oil and gas stocks bucked the trend, firmly supported by the rise in crude prices.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 2.5% while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 3.2% and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) stock rose 2.4%.
Elsewhere,  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) came under pressure after Reuters reported that the company's Cloud hosting business in the U.S. is under scrutiny from regulators in the country, amid concerns that the data it is hosting may be accessible to the Chinese government. The ADRs fell 2.2%.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA, the world's biggest furniture brand, said on Tuesday it was on track to become climate positive by 2030 as its annual carbon emissions fell 6% from pre-pandemic levels despite record sales. 
Brand owner Inter IKEA said emissions in the value chain - from raw material production to customers' use and disposal of products - totalled 26.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the 12 months through August, against an upwardly revised 27.9 million in fiscal 2019, when emissions fell for the first time. 
The revision was due to bigger emissions than estimated previously from materials such as wood, paper-based materials, plastics and candles, a company spokesperson said. 
Compared to fiscal 2020, when emissions fell as stores closed temporarily due to the pandemic, emissions increased 6%, from an upwardly revised 24.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
While the climate footprint from materials kept expanding, the drop in total emissions came mainly from the use of more renewable energy across operations, and a larger share of sales of more energy efficient light bulbs and plant based food.
Whether emissions will fall in the current year will depend on the sales performance of such products alongside the speed of the switch towards renewable energy in production. IKEA expects the footprint from materials to keep expanding this year. 
Inter IKEA CEO Jon Abrahamsson was confident about reaching IKEA's target to be climate positive - reducing more greenhouse gas emissions than its value chain emits - by 2030. 
""We have (since baseline year 2016) managed to do a third of what our ambition is for 2030 so we are well on track. Then there are big challenges ahead and we need to put all our energy and efforts into securing that we continue on a positive trend towards this goal,"" he said in an interview. 
IKEA, most of whose products are wood-based, increased retail sales in fiscal 2021 to 41.9 billion euros ($47.7 billion) despite global supply chain disruptions as consumers spent more on their homes.
One of the world's biggest wood buyers, it used 21 million cubic metres of wood in products and packaging, up around 10% from the year before. 

It said in its sustainability report for 2021 that 99.5% of the wood used was from responsibly managed forests - as certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) - or recycled. Some 14% of wood used was recycled, up from 12% the year before.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be the first major streaming service to report earnings this week, offering investors a sign of whether companies have started to pull in enough new customers to justify big spending on online programming in 2022.
The dominant streaming service reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Wall Street will watch for how many customers Netflix picked up overseas as the pace of streaming growth levels off from torrid pandemic gains of 2020.
Wall Street is watching to see if the streaming wars are paying off as companies add high-profile and expensive shows such as Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's new reality series with the Kardashian family, a ""Lord of the Rings"" series on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Video and a ""Game of Thrones"" prequel on AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s HBO Max. 
Netflix raised prices on Friday in its biggest market, the United States and Canada, where analysts say growth is stagnating. The company went on a roller coaster ride during the pandemic, with steep growth early in 2020 when people were staying home and movie theaters were closed. The rate of new sign-ups fell in 2021 as pandemic restrictions eased and COVID slowed production of new programming. The company projected 8.5 million new streaming subscribers for October to December.
In 2022, Netflix's growth is expected to stabilize, analysts say, putting it on track to return to subscriber gains logged before the pandemic. The company has new seasons of global phenomenon ""Squid Game"" and Emmy winner ""The Crown"" in the works, plus a large slate of movies. 
But the streaming pioneer is confronting stiffer competition in the U.S. and abroad from new entrants, price promotions and heavy spending on exclusive content. As these subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services invest heavily in content intensifying the ""streaming wars,"" Wall Street is beginning to question the return on this investment. 
""2022 should prove that no one single company has a monopoly on great content and that time spent on any one legacy SVOD platform is not guaranteed,"" media analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a research note. 
Nathanson trimmed his forecasts for total Netflix streaming viewers year-end to 250 million from 252 million, citing the maturation of the U.S., Canada and Western European markets. Growth, he estimated, would come from regions in the Asia Pacific where customers pay less for Netflix.
Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney told Reuters that Netflix will likely continue to add a million subscribers a year in its home market, but that 90 percent of its gains will happen outside of the United States. 
The competition for customers is most intense in the U.S., where the number of households subscribing to streaming service reached 78%, according to Leichtman Research, and where Deloitte estimated the churn, or rate at which people drop or subscribe to services, are averaging a relatively high 35%. 
Popular Netflix shows like ""Squid Game"" and the star-studded disaster film ""Don't Look Up"" will likely add around 550,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada in the fourth quarter, Nathanson predicts. NBCUniversal's Peacock and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC)'s Paramount+ are likely to report the greatest gains in the U.S., he wrote, buoyed by National Football League and English football games, and more kids content available on Paramount+.
The contest for consumers' time and attention is also playing out across the globe, fueling aggressive spending on content. London-based researcher Ampere Analysis projects the industry-wide spending tally will exceed $230 billion this year, led by companies spending heavily on sports rights such as NBCUniversal parent Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), at $22.7 billion, and Disney at $33 billion. 

Netflix, which does not air live sports, had forecast it would it would spend $17 billion on programming in 2021. It has not disclosed spending for 2022. 
The Beijing Olympics and the Super Bowl will air on NBCU's Peacock service in Feburary. In addition to the Kardashians' new show, Disney will debut a Star Wars series about Obi-Wan Kenobi with Ewan McGregor reprising his role as the Jedi master.

The all-cash offer values each Activision share at $95, a premium of over 45% to its Friday closing price of $65.39. U.S. markets were shut Monday for the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday.
Demand for gaming has been booming with the pandemic only accelerating it as stuck-at home consumers found a way to engage themselves.
This acquisition will accelerate the growth in Microsoft’s gaming business across mobile, PC, console and cloud and will provide building blocks for the metaverse, the world’s second-most valued company said.
It also provides the maker of Xbox consoles a vast library of popular franchises such as Warcraft, Diablo and Candy Crush. Once the deal is secured, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY).
Bobby Kotick, who has led Activision for more than three decades, will continue to serve as its CEO.
Microsoft is Activision’s fourth largest customer and was said to be miffed with it because of series of allegations of sexual misconduct against top executives of the games publisher. Many of those officials have since left Activision or been fired. Those woes have weighed on the stock, which is down 28% in the past year."

Investment banking revenue rose 45% to touch $3.8 billion as M&A fees soared and more corporates tapped public markets, all of which generated demand for Goldman’s advisory services. Consumer and wealth management business revenue rose 19%.
Revenue in asset management operations were down 10% as equity investment in public entities took a hit. Investments in debt instruments also yielded lower net gains. Investments in private equity were the saving grace in the bank’s asset management business.
Revenue in the fixed income, currency and commodity business took a hit of 7% to come in just short of $4 billion, reflecting lower demand for intermediation and volatility in markets amid rising government bond yields.

""The Board's overarching failure to be responsive, the repeated lack of both preparation and willingness to engage, the absence of candor and the pre-arranged press release all indicate that the Board had no intention of constructive engagement,"" the letter said.
A representative for Safety Insurance was not immediately available to comment.
Last week, Safety Insurance, which has a market capitalization of $1.3 billion, announced governance changes that include expanding its board by one person to seven members, appointing a lead independent director and appointing a new chair to its nominating and governance committee.
The company, which specializes in property and casualty insurance in Massachusetts, did not identify the people who would take up those roles.
""The changes announced by Safety's press release fall woefully short of what is required to put the Company on a better path forward,"" Ides, which has owned a roughly 1% stake in Safety Insurance for about a year, wrote in the letter.
In early December, Ides nominated insurance industry executives Olga Kondrashova and Farooq Sheikh to Safety Insurance's board, according to the letter.
The hedge fund laid out its criticisms in Tuesday's letter and called on Safety Insurance to buy back 10% of its shares and continue those repurchases over time, start the process of having all directors stand for election every year, and improve its proxy advisor audit scores.
It also insisted that Safety Insurance hold quarterly earnings calls, something most publicly traded companies do routinely.
Safety Insurance's stock price has climbed 14% in the last 52 weeks but still has lagged the benchmark SPDR S&P Insurance (NYSE:KIE) ETF, which gained 25%. Over the last three years, the company's share price gained 22% while the benchmark climbed 49%.
Ides was co-founded by Dianne McKeever and Rob Longnecker in 2015, and won success when it pushed companies like  Arcosa  (NYSE:ACA) Inc and  Boingo Wireless  (NASDAQ:WIFI) to diversify their boards. McKeever is the chief investment officer at Ides.

(Reuters) -IHG said on Tuesday finance industry veteran Deanna Oppenheimer will become the Holiday Inn-owner's first female chair when she replaces long-serving Chairman Patrick Cescau after his retirement later this year.
Cescau, 73, will retire at the end of August after almost a decade in the role and Oppenheimer will take over as non-executive chair in September, IHG said.
Oppenheimer, 63, currently serves as non-executive chair of British fund supermarket  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) and is also on the board of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), the news and information company that owns Reuters News.
Oppenheimer will be joining only a handful of other women as top brass at a FTSE 100 company.
The percentage of female non-executive directors on FTSE 100 boards was at an all time high in the 12 months to July 2021, according to a report published by EY in October.
The change at IHG, once the world's biggest hotelier, comes as the hospitality industry navigates a bumpy recovery from the pandemic, with some companies still facing uncertainty due to the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
IHG, which also owns the Crowne Plaza, Regent and Hualuxe chains, had said in October it had seen signs of recovery and that revenue was inching closer to pre-pandemic levels.

Oppenheimer's experience includes stints at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), where she was a senior executive at its UK and Europe businesses, as well as Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Premier Inn owner  Whitbread  (LON:WTB), where she held director positions.
French-born Cescau has also served as the CEO of consumer products giant Unilever (NYSE:UL).

""Hitting the 9 million mark is going to be extremely difficult,"" Kazunari Kamakura, an executive at the world's biggest car maker, said during an online briefing. Toyota, he added, could not predict how long the chip shortage would last.
Toyota and other automakers have been forced to curb production even as demand in key markets such as China has rebounded. In addition to tackling chip shortages caused by COVID-19 supply-chain disruptions, car makers also have had to contend with soaring semiconductor demand at consumer electronic companies.
The surge in Omicron infections did not factor into the latest production outlook, but it is, nonetheless, a concern for Toyota, Kamakura said. Toyota's business year runs from April to March.
COVID-19 lockdown restrictions last year disrupted supplies of components from plants in Southeast Asia.
The maker of the Corolla compact sedan said it will build 700,000 cars globally in February, more than last year, but 150,000 fewer than it had initially planned. 

To reach its annual 9 million production target, set in September, Toyota would have to build 1 million vehicles in March.
In North America, Toyota forecasts a reduction of about 25,000 to 30,000 vehicles in February.

The deal is the latest in a string of settlements that Endo has struck in recent months to resolve similar cases, including a $63 million settlement with Texas in December.
The Florida settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, Endo said, while reiterating that its goal was to achieve a global opioid settlement. 

Thousands of lawsuits have been filed seeking to hold drugmakers, drug distributors and pharmacy chains responsible for a drug abuse crisis, which the U.S. government says has led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over two decades.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jay Goffman, a former bankruptcy lawyer and current vice chairman at Rothschild & Co, is joining CEO advisory firm Teneo to help lead its financial advisory business, he said.
The firm was expected to announce the move on Tuesday.
Goffman, 63, is the latest high-profile restructuring adviser to shift toward consulting and crisis management after practicing law or banking on Wall Street. Jon Henes, a former Kirkland & Ellis LLP restructuring partner, started strategic consulting firm C Street Advisory Group last year.
In addition to legal counsel and bankers who arrange financing, companies facing financial turmoil also rely on crisis managers to help navigate relations with employees, suppliers, government officials and media coverage.
Goffman headed or co-led the restructuring practice at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP for roughly a dozen years before moving to Rothschild as a banker helping distressed companies obtain fresh financing and rework their balance sheets.
After a spate of bankruptcies following the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate restructurings have slowed amid low interest rates and recovering financial markets. Federal Reserve policymakers, though, have signaled a looming rate hike in part to battle inflation, which Goffman contends could contribute to another wave of restructurings for companies that have not addressed unsustainable debts.
""It’s hard to put an exact date on it, but it’s coming,"" Goffman said, adding he worries the next cycle of distress could be ""longer and deeper.""
Teneo, meanwhile, acquired Deloitte’s UK restructuring business last year and in 2020 acquired Goldin Associates, a financial advisory firm focused on distressed companies. Teneo is currently advising OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP on its bankruptcy case.
Goffman helped pioneer so-called prepackaged bankruptcies, in which companies and creditors present an agreed-upon restructuring to a judge right after filing for Chapter 11 in an effort to limit the amount of time spent navigating court proceedings.
One company Goffman advised, school bus manufacturer Blue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD), used the strategy to receive bankruptcy-court approval of its reorganization in less than two days.
He also worked on the bankruptcies of solar-energy company SunEdison Inc in 2016 and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the famed movie studio with the roaring lion logo that filed for Chapter 11 in 2010. When the parent of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) filed for bankruptcy in 2011, he advised creditors and helped engineer a merger with rival US Airways.

The strategic partnership comes amid tight competition in the e-commerce space in China with players like  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD),  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and Douyin. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
The deal will let Shopify merchants sell on JD's cross-border platform JD Worldwide and open up access to its 550 million active customers in China, the companies said.
Shopify merchants in the U.S. can start selling their products in China within three to four weeks instead of waiting for 12 months to do so, a wait-time typically required by foreign brands to sell in the country, Shopify said.
This is part of a larger strategic partnership between Shopify and JD.com focused on solving cross-border commerce challenges for merchants in the U.S. and China, the companies added.

For over a year, China has been cracking down on its tech sector, including e-commerce companies, taking aim at their overseas growth ambitions and domestic concentration of market power, with JD.com also feeling the pressure.
Last month, JD.com along with four other e-commerce companies were summoned by a Chinese province over livestreaming irregularities during the Singles' Day shopping festival on Nov. 11, according to state-owned media.

659,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 06:56AM ET</span>","After flying start, Stellantis must tackle Tesla and China","By Giulio Piovaccari
MILAN (Reuters) - If playing catch up with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is what everyone in the auto industry is about then Stellantis, the company formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), has had a good start – its shares have far outpaced its U.S. rival in its inaugural year.
But this is just the first lap.
Fixing its business in China and overcapacity in Europe are just two areas where analysts want to see Stellantis making progress when Chief Executive Carlos Tavares unveils his detailed business plan on March 1. 
After all, despite its shares surging more than 60% since their debut on Jan. 18, 2021 - compared with a 27% gain for Tesla's - Stellantis' market value of 59 billion euros ($67 billion) is still just 6% of its U.S. rival's.
A strong first year augurs well, though, with Jefferies analysts saying Tavares has shown vision and ambition with a ""sustained stream of strategic initiatives.""
Since forging the world's No. 4 carmaker by production, Tavares has mapped out a 30 billion euro electrification strategy, and formed alliances with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and iPhone assembler Foxconn to accelerate development of software and semiconductors for future connected vehicles.
He has also drawn up plans for five battery plants and cut deals with unions to keep streamlining its European operations - side-stepping potential labour conflicts and pushing the company's operating profit margin up to around 10%. 
Excluding former Peugeot-controlled parts maker Faurecia, Stellantis' workforce was almost unchanged in the past year at around 300,000 - keeping Tavares' promise not to cut jobs or close plants following the merger. 
All this despite facing a semiconductor and supply chain crunch that cost global automakers millions of vehicles in lost production last year and is not expected to ease quickly.
Marco Santino, a partner at management consultants Oliver Wyman, said Tavares was living up to his reputation as a practical man avoiding a ""muscular"" approach with unions and the outlines of his strategy were in place.
""The path has been mapped out already, it needs to be consolidated,"" he said. ""I don't expect fireworks from his business plan"". 
CHALLENGES 
But many say more bold action is needed. 
Jefferies analysts, for example, say Stellantis' 14 brands - including Jeep, Ram, Citroen, Opel and Maserati - walk ""a fine line between differentiation and internal competition."" 
This at a time when Tesla is leading the industry transition to an electric and software-driven future with a single brand and a highly focused strategy. 
Tavares has said every aspect of the group is under the microscope, including its brands, some of which analysts have suggested could be eliminated to save money.
""For the time being, we love them all and you cannot kill what you love,"" the 63-year old said last year.
""When you love them, you give them a chance,"" he said, adding each brand would be given 10 years to prove itself profitable. 
As the group enters its second year, another long term challenge is reviving its fortunes in China, the world's biggest auto market, where Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot-owner PSA had almost negligible market shares.
""We are now negotiating and changing very many things at core,"" Tavares has said about his China plans, without giving details. 
Jefferies analysts said the company could look to leverage its strong Jeep and Maserati brands there. It could also consider using China as an export base to the rest of Asia, or deepen its ties with Foxconn beyond their current joint venture, they said.

""Luckily for Tavares, he's got time,"" Oliver Wyman's Santino said. ""Investors' focus is on Europe's turnaround at the moment. And on that he is delivering"".

Investing.com –  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) fell 4.4% in Tuesday’s premarket trading on a Reuters report that the Biden administration is investigating the company’s Cloud business for carrying potential risk to U.S. national security.
The focus of the probe is on how the company stores U.S. clients' data, including personal information and intellectual property, and whether the Chinese government could gain access to it, according to the Reuters report. The potential for Beijing to disrupt access by U.S. users to their information stored on Alibaba Cloud is a worry too, the report said.
 Gartner  (NYSE:IT) estimates Alibaba's U.S. Cloud business revenue to be less than $50 million but the operation has attracted increasing focus from the Chinese internet giant owing to its potential. Alibaba’s Cloud business fetched $9.2 billion in revenue in 2020, contributing a small 8% overall but growing at 50%. It competes in the U.S. with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and others in the Cloud-hosting space.
Alibaba had in its 2021 annual report flagged concerns surrounding its U.S. operations. “U.S. entities and individuals with whom we have existing contractual or other relationships may be prohibited from continuing to do business with us, including performing their obligations under agreements involving our supply chain, logistics, software development, Cloud services and other products and services,” it warned.
Relations between the world’s two largest economies have been strained for a few years now. On its part, China, wary of rules its listed companies have to follow to comply with the SEC and other regulators in the U.S., has increased its own oversight of data handling practices of its internet giants."

The ongoing rout in tech stocks -- a no-brainer pick for more than a decade -- looks to be more than a short-term pullback: Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s January global fund manager survey showed that net allocation to the sector fell 20% month-over-month to 1%, the lowest since 2008. At the same time, overweight positions on bank stocks rose to 41% among BofA’s clients, closing in on a record set in October 2017.
“Central bank tightening remains the #1 risk to markets in 2022,” strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in the survey. That’s bad news for expensive technology stocks that are valued on future growth expectations and good news for bank stocks, which have suffered for most of the past decade amid ultra-low or negative yields.
The stampede out of tech continued on Tuesday, with futures contracts on the Nasdaq 100 falling as much as 2.1% while yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes hit a two-year high of 1.85%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is now down 4.3% this year, while the KBW Bank Index of U.S. lenders has jumped 11%.
BofA’s survey, showing the newfound popularity of banks, was conducted between January 7 and 13 and comprised responses from 329 fund managers with $1.1 trillion in assets under management.
A separate Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) survey published today showed that a majority of more than 500 respondents think U.S. tech shares are in a bubble. In the survey of market watchers conducted last week, 49% agreed the sector is in bubble territory, while 39% disagreed and the other 12% said they didn’t know.
The direction of travel in markets may now be dependent on the earnings season that kicked off last week. U.S. reports, which include Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Bank of America and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). this week, “could help tip the scales in either a positive or negative direction,” according to AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.

Investing.com –  Toyota  ADRs (NYSE:TM) traded 0.3% lower in Tuesday’s premarket after the world’s largest carmaker warned it might miss its annual production target of 9 million vehicles because of a shortage of semiconductors.
The company rued that competition for chips meant it didn’t have enough of them to raise its output in time to make up for last year’s pandemic-led shortfall.
""Hitting the 9 million mark is going to be extremely difficult,"" Reuters quoted Kazunari Kamakura, a Toyota executive, as saying during an online briefing.
To meet its annual target, set in September, Toyota will have to build 1 million vehicles in March. Toyota said it will build 700,000 cars globally in February, more than last year, but 150,000 fewer than it had initially planned.
Bottlenecks due to shortage of chips forced carmakers like Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) last year to curtail production for weeks at a stretch. While automakers compete with manufacturers of mobiles, laptops and other electronic gadgets for chips that are limited in supply, the problem was accentuated because of the pandemic. Factories were shut and ships were stuck at ports. Air transport was limited too.
Chipmakers have since committed billions of dollars to expand capacities. But new factories take time to come up while demand remains at record levels."

On Monday, the EU extended setting minimum prices for electrical steel from Japan, China, Russia, South Korea and the United States for five years on the basis that producers would otherwise dump it on the EU market.
""The Japanese steel industry will carefully study this decision and determine a proper course of action,"" Eiji Hashimoto, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said in a statement. 
During the expiry review proceedings by the European Commission, the Japanese steel industry claimed that revoking the anti-dumping measures would not lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to the industry in the EU, but the EU rejected Japan's claims, Hashimoto said. 
Despite the EU's imposition of minimum prices for grain-oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel (GOES) in 2015, the EU's imports of the products from Japan stood at 20,000-30,000 tonnes a year between 2016 and 2020, up from 15,000 tonnes in 2015, according to an official at the Japanese federation. 

GOES are used in power transformers.
""The actual impact from the extension may be limited as the EU's import prices of these Japanese electrical steel are mostly above the minimum prices, but we will continue our claim to protect free trade,"" the official said.

The company said revenue rose 43% in 2021 to 2.786 billion euros ($3.17 billion), on a preliminary basis after adjusting for currency effects. That brings revenue to only 1% below its 2019 result of 2.884 billion euros.
The company had raised its outlook in October, predicting sales to grow by about 40% on a currency-adjusted level, on the back of strong demand in Europe and the Americas. 
Operating profit (EBIT) for 2021 is now seen at 228 million euros. In October, it was raised to 175 million to 200 million euros, compared with a previous forecast for 125 million to 175 million euros.
Fourth-quarter sales stood at 906 million euros, up 55% from the year before, Hugo Boss said.

Just Group specialises in annuities paying a fixed income to pensioners with reduced life expectancies.
The company said income from retirement sales jumped 25% to 2.7 billion pounds ($3.68 billion) last year, while new business profits grew by a ""low double digit"" percentage.
The firm added that its underlying organic capital generation more than doubled from the previous year, exceeding its 2022 target a year early.
""Having improved and rebuilt the capital position, we've very much swung back to growth,"" CEO David Richardson told Reuters.
Just Group shares were 6.3% higher at 91.20 pence by 0916 GMT, sending it to the top of the FTSE mid-cap index. RBC analysts described the retirement income sales as ""strong"", reiterating their ""outperform"" rating on the stock. 
Just Group and other UK life insurers have suffered in the past few years as pension reforms have led to reduced demand for individual annuities,
But demand has risen for so-called bulk annuities, which involve transferring the risk of UK company defined benefit - or final salary - pension schemes to an insurer. Such schemes are often in deficit, causing a drag on company balance sheets.
Just Group's bulk annuity sales hit a record of more than 1.9 billion pounds in 2021 and it said there was a strong pipeline of potential deals.

Investing.com -- Kohl's stock (NYSE:KSS) traded 0.8% lower in premarket Tuesday after another activist investor leaned on the retailer to shake itself up.   
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Macellum Advisors is renewing a push to get the department store chain to consider a sale of the business or make changes to its board.
Just last month, Engine Capital, with around 1% in the company, had petitioned the company’s board to consider a sale or a separation of its faster-growing e-commerce business.  
Macellum has stake of around 5% in Kohl’s and wants the company to boost its lagging stock price. Kohl’s has so far resisted those attempts. The hedge fund believes there are buyers for the chain. Macellum was part of a group that ran a proxy fight at the retailer last year until a settlement with Kohl’s was reached in April. The agreement barred the investor and the other firms from agitating at the company until last week, the WSJ report said.
Kohl’s shares closed Friday at $47.77, giving it a market value of $6.65 billion. The stock has rebounded from its pandemic lows but has essentially gone sideways for more than two decades. Markets were shut Monday on account of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

Musk said last year he expected the Berlin factory to have received its licence to begin mass production of its Model Y cars by December, but bureaucratic hurdles and an ongoing court case over the factory's water use have delayed the process.

A first hearing in the court case will take place on Feb. 11, although regional finance minister Joerg Steinbach told German newspaper Tagesspiegel earlier this month that the license to begin production could come before the case was resolved.

Mastercard received the largest fine of 31.56 million pounds ($43.04 million). The other companies fined were allpay, Advanced Payment Solution, Prepaid Financial Services and Sulion.
The Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) said the firms broke competition law by agreeing not to compete or poach each other's customers on pre-paid cards offered by local authorities to distribute welfare payments to vulnerable people.
The cartel meant recipients of the cards - who included the homeless, victims of domestic abuse and asylum seekers - could have missed out on cheaper or better-quality products, the regulator said. 
The PSR previously announced in March last year it planned to fine the five companies in preliminary findings. It said on Tuesday it had concluded the investigation. 
The regulator said during the course of the investigation, all the parties settled and admitted breaking the law.

The annual shipments, however, failed to scale the pre-pandemic levels.
While shipments were above the 296-million mark that the industry reached in 2020, they remained below 2019, when they rang in at 372 million for the year, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications (CAICT), a government-backed think-tank.
Last month, China had shipped 32.7 million smartphones domestically, up 29.6% year-on-year.
Phone brands and other hardware companies struggled in 2021 to source components, as a chip shortage and supply chain restraints crimped the global economy.
These difficulties have compounded struggles for Chinese smartphone brands, which have in recent years endured slowing growth as consumers delay upgrading their handsets to the latest models.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), the only major foreign brand competing in China's domestic market, has largely dodged this trend in 2021.

Nasdaq futures are down almost 1% on Tuesday, making it likely the tech-heavy index will add to its year-to-date losses of around 4.5%. Having risen for 12 of the past 13 years, it is under heavy pressure from the prospect of higher interest rates and bond yields, more so than the broader S&P 500 index or MSCI's global equity benchmark.
The 4.5% loss masks deeper falls -- 29 shares have lost 10% or more already this year, according to Capital Economics.
Nasdaq futures positioning has shifted dramatically short, Citi analysts point out, noting that $2 billion worth of remaining long positions are deep in the red.
Those investors will be looking nervously towards bond markets, where two-year U.S. Treasury borrowing costs have risen above 1% for the first time since Feb. 2020. In Europe, German 10-year yields are close to bursting above 0% for the first time since mid-2019.
Inflation is front and centre, as crude oil prices hit seven-year prices. That's good news for some -- the Bank of Japan signalled earlier the country was finally emerging sustainably out of deflation -- but the bond selloff is setting the stage for a dismal stock market session; most Asian bourses fell and Europe looks set to open weaker.
All eyes on central banks now. The U.S. Federal Reserve is now more or less priced to start lifting interest rates from March, Canada could move as early as next week while Britain's forecast-beating labour data on Tuesday, makes it all but certain the Bank of England's Feb 2 meeting will yield a hike.

678,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 03:06AM ET</span>",Horta-Osorio's broken promise the final straw at embittered Credit Suisse,"By Oliver Hirt, Sumeet Chatterjee and John O'Donnell
ZURICH/FRANKFURT/HONG KONG (Reuters) -After taking over as chairman of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Antonio Horta-Osorio pledged to develop a culture of personal accountability at the Swiss bank following a string of scandals.
That promise ultimately sealed his fate as he was forced to resign https://reut.rs/3roQ4D4 after barely eight months in office for flouting coronavirus quarantine rules in both Britain and Switzerland.
It marked the end of his attempts to reform Switzerland's second-biggest bank, still dealing with the fallout from a slew of earlier failings https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/spies-lies-chairmans-exit-credit-suisses-scandals-2022-01-17, from spying on executives to investment losses running into billions of dollars.
After resigning, Horta-Osorio expressed regret that his ""personal actions ... compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally"". His spokesperson said he would not be speaking to the media.
It was just days after promising to clean up the bank by creating a sense of responsibility that Horta-Osorio flew to London in a private jet to attend the Wimbledon tennis finals, breaking https://reut.rs/3qCHTDG Britain's coronavirus quarantine rules in the process, three people with knowledge of the matter said. 
When the breach came to light at the end of last year, Horta-Osorio had already been called out for a similar quarantine transgression in Switzerland and the bank was scouring his record for any other violations.
An internal investigation also looked at the Portuguese banker's use of company jets. He had directed a corporate plane to drop him off in the Maldives on the way back from a business trip in Asia, two people familiar with the matter said.
The episodes strengthened the hand of senior managers bristling at what they saw as his interference in strategy, making it all but impossible for the chairman to prevail in a tug-of-war with executives at the bank he had been brought in to overhaul.
UNFORGIVING BACKDROP
Horta-Osorio explained his Wimbledon lapse by saying he was unaware he had failed to get the business waiver for British rules his office had asked for, laying the blame on staff who he said did not inform him, one of the people said.
He had intended to take Credit Suisse clients to the tennis tournament and then gave two tickets to his children when customers bowed out due to the pandemic, the person said.
But his defence, coming in the wake of a public apology in December for breaking Swiss quarantine rules, fell flat.
The breaches took place against an unforgiving backdrop of growing hostility among Credit Suisse's senior executives, many of whom resented the chairman's efforts to reform, people familiar with the matter said.
Horta-Osorio suspected details of his transgressions were leaked by people in that group, said one of those people, describing ""antipathy"" towards him within the bank. One person said the chairman had been at ""war"" with key members of the executive board.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on whether there were rifts between the former chairman and the executive board, including Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein. The bank has not published its investigation into Horta-Osorio.
Another person who attends the bank's high-level meetings said Horta-Osorio, unlike his predecessor Urs Rohner, had questioned executives closely when they gathered every quarter to review the bank's performance.
During discussions with management about the second quarter of last year, he persevered with pointed questions about the wealth management business and growth projections, asking to see the data on which the forecasts were made, one source said. 
""There were quite a few red faces,"" the person said. 
He said many senior employees were unhappy with Horta-Osorio's attempts to make the board of directors more powerful at the expense of executives.
'ORCHESTRATED CAMPAIGN'
As well as burning bridges with top bankers, the quarantine breaches prompted widespread criticism of the Portuguese banker in Switzerland, where Credit Suisse is regulated and where one in three of 49,000 staff work.
One of the people who spoke to Reuters said Horta-Osorio had been taken aback by the hostility he encountered while in Switzerland.
Horta-Osorio's abrupt departure now leaves a question mark over the bank, as its stock price continues to dwindle and amid renewed speculation that it could become a takeover target for its stronger neighbour UBS, or a foreign bank.
David Herro of Harris Associates, one of the bank's largest shareholders, had backed Horta-Osorio even after the quarantine transgressions came to light https://reut.rs/33HtTzR, describing his role in turning the bank around as an important reason to invest. 
""There is an orchestrated campaign because there are constituents who don't want to see a strong rebounding Credit Suisse,"" he told Reuters before the resignation, adding that Swiss media had been kinder to his Swiss predecessor.
In recent days, Horta-Osorio had tried to salvage the situation, said one person.
He had successfully battled through a similar embarrassment as chief executive of Britain's Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank after a newspaper reported that he was having an extra-marital affair while travelling on business.
In an email sent to Lloyds staff in 2016, Horta-Osorio made clear he had not breached the bank's rules by mixing business with personal expenses, and showed contrition. 

""Having the highest professional standards raises the bar against which we are judged,"" he wrote. ""I don't expect anyone to get everything right all the time. The important point being how we learn from those mistakes."" 
In Switzerland, his apologies rang hollow.

Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co plans to raise 5 billion yuan ($790 million) by selling three-year bonds through China's interbank market, it said in a filing on Monday. The funds would be used to finance real estate project acquisitions in the form of lending, it said.
The bond sales plan by the Shanghai government-controlled bank pointed to a broadening of financing channels for the property sector and more financial institutions were expected to follow suit, analysts said.
Beijing is already encouraging large property developers to acquire assets from cash-strapped real estate firms to ease liquidity pressure. Developer China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co said last week it planned to issue bonds for real estate acquisitions.
China will also make it easier for state-backed property developers to buy up distressed assets of debt-laden private firms by not counting such loans as debt under rules that cap borrowing, a source told Reuters this month.
Also on Tuesday, Jin Xiandong, an official at China's National Development and Reform Commission, told a conference the market was adjusting to news of defaults by some highly leveraged real estate developers and he did not expect them to affect Chinese companies' overseas bonds more generally.
The CSI300 Real Estate Index jumped nearly 5%, on Tuesday morning, while the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index gained more than 3%.
Dollar bonds of Chinese developers also rebounded following sharp falls in the previous session. 
A Country Garden Holdings 2026 bond rose to 70.866 cents on the dollar, up from 64.865 over night, according to data by Duration Finance, after the developer scooped up $10 million of its own bonds on Monday. Its shares jumped 5.3%.
Separately, in a rare case where a trust company took over assets from a distressed developer, state-owned Minmetals International Trust bought all equities in two projects from struggling China Evergrande Group, filings at the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System showed.
Two projects - in the southern cities of Kunming and Foshan - were pledged to a Minmetals trust loan extended to Evergrande, according to the filings, and Minmetals spent 50 million yuan ($7.9 million) and 30 million yuan respectively to acquire all the equity in the projects. It held 51% in the latter project before the acquisition.
Minmetals said in a statement it wanted to help solve the Evergrande's problems to ""ensure home delivery, ensure people's livelihood, and ensure stability"".

More cash-strapped developers worked to avoid defaults or raise money. Shimao Group rose 4%, after it won approval on Monday from creditors to extend the payment deadline of a 450 million yuan asset-backed security (ABS).

683,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 02:07AM ET</span>",Starbucks ties up with Meituan to bolster presence in crucial China market,"By Sophie Yu and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) -Starbucks, which has seen sales slow in China due to COVID-19's fallout, is attempting to widen its reach in its second-biggest market globally by distributing its coffees through the country's dominant food delivery firm, Meituan.
The U.S. coffee chain said on Tuesday it has entered into a partnership with Meituan that will allow its Chinese customers to order coffee delivery and make reservations at its stores via the super-app's platforms.
The move comes as competition in the Chinese coffee market is intensifying, and is aimed at expanding the availability of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which first begun food delivery services in the country in 2018 through an exclusive partnership with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group's Ele.me arm, Meituan's main rival. 
""Exclusive cooperations have a time frame,"" said Liu Xingliang, president of tech consultancy China Internet Data Center. ""Starbucks will expand service with more partners, I believe this is not a surprise.""
Alibaba, whose partnership with Starbucks will continue, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Shares in Meituan, whose main app also offers services such as restaurant and hotel bookings, rose as much as 5.3% in morning trading before paring back gains.
Starbucks' business in China has been hit by a resurgence of the coronavirus in the country that forced it to close stores in several major cities and led it to report a 7% fall in comparable China fourth-quarter sales.
It also faces rising competition from other coffee chains such as Italy's Lavazza, backed by restaurant chain Yum China, and Canada's Tim Horton, which have been expanding in China.
China Market Research Group Director Ben Cavender said that given concerns around COVID-19 and store traffic it made sense for Starbucks to be aggressive in promoting delivery. 
""Part of that means being available on both major aggregators,"" he said, referring to Meituan and Ele.me. ""Starbucks now has enough competition from other coffee players that if a consumer doesn't see their stores available in a chosen app that they will simply defect to another brand.""
The expansion in China comes amid a safety cloud for Starbucks. The U.S. firm carried out food safety inspections and staff training across its 5,000-plus China stores in December after a newspaper reported that two of its outlets in Wuxi had used expired ingredients in their drinks, prompting multiple local governments to launch checks on its stores.
Meituan had about 668 million paying users in China as of end-September and held an estimated 68.2% of China's food delivery market in the second quarter of 2020, according to the latest available figures from Trustdata. 
Starbucks has 5,360 stores in more than 200 Chinese cities, according to the company's most recent earnings report. 

Starbucks also said the two companies will launch a service that will allow Meituan users to make private bookings to taste and learn to make coffees at Starbucks stores. The so-called 1971 Salon service is exclusive to Meituan's platform, it added. 
It also plans to utilise Meituan's ""super store"" feature under the partnership which will see each of its stores have their own unique page on Meituan's platforms by the end of this year, from which customers can book food delivery services or check local events.

The airlines warned the new C-Band 5G service set to begin on Wednesday could render a significant number of widebody aircraft unusable, ""could potentially strand tens of thousands of Americans overseas"" and cause ""chaos"" for U.S. flights.
""Unless our major hubs are cleared to fly, the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded,"" wrote the chief executives of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and others in a letter first reported by Reuters.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned that potential interference could affect sensitive airplane instruments such as altimeters and significantly hamper low-visibility operations.
""This means that on a day like yesterday, more than 1,100 flights and 100,000 passengers would be subjected to cancellations, diversions or delays,"" the letter https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1483148794690740224?s=20 cautioned.
Airlines late on Monday were considering whether to begin canceling some international flights that are scheduled to arrive in the United States on Wednesday.
""With the proposed restrictions at selected airports, the transportation industry is preparing for some service disruption. We are optimistic that we can work across industries and with government to finalize solutions that safely mitigate as many schedule impacts as possible,"" plane maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) said on Monday.
Action is urgent, the airlines added in the letter also signed by UPS Airlines,  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK), Atlas Air (NASDAQ:AAWW), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) Express. ""To be blunt, the nation’s commerce will grind to a halt.""
The letter went to White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel.
Airlines for America, the group that organized the letter, declined to comment. The FAA said it ""will continue to ensure that the traveling public is safe as wireless companies deploy 5G. The FAA continues to work with the aviation industry and wireless companies to try to limit 5G-related flight delays and cancellations.""
The other government agencies did not comment.
'INTERVENTION IS NEEDED'
AT&T and Verizon, which won nearly all of the C-Band spectrum in an $80 billion auction last year, on Jan. 3 agreed to buffer zones around 50 airports to reduce interference risks and take other steps to cut potential interference for six months. They also agreed to delay deployment for two weeks until Wednesday, temporarily averting an aviation safety standoff, after previously delaying service by 30 days.
Verizon and AT&T declined comment on Monday. They argue C-Band 5G has been successfully deployed in about 40 other countries without aviation interference issues.
The CEOs of major airlines and Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun held a lengthy call with Buttigieg and Dickson on Sunday to warn of the looming crisis, officials told Reuters.
United Airlines late Monday separately warned the issue could affect more than 15,000 of its flights, 1.25 million passengers and snarl tons of cargo annually.
United said it faces ""significant restrictions on 787s, 777s, 737s and regional aircraft in major cities like Houston, Newark, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.""
The airlines ask ""that 5G be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate 2 miles (3.2 km) of airport runways"" at some key airports.
""Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies,"" they said.
The airlines added that flight restrictions will not be limited to poor weather operations.
""Multiple modern safety systems on aircraft will be deemed unusable causing a much larger problem than what we knew... Airplane manufacturers have informed us that there are huge swaths of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded.""
One area of concern is whether some or all Boeing 777s will be unable to land at some key U.S. airports after 5G service starts, as well as some Boeing cargo planes, airline officials told Reuters.

The airlines urged action to ensure ""5G is deployed except when towers are too close to airport runways until the FAA can determine how that can be safely accomplished without catastrophic disruption.""
The FAA said on Sunday it had cleared an estimated 45% of the U.S. commercial airplane fleet to perform low-visibility landings at many airports where 5G C-band will be deployed and they expect to issue more approvals before Wednesday. The airlines noted on Monday that the list did not include many large airports.

Hong Kong (Reuters) - Private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners is this week launching the sale of its Burger King fast-food businesses in South Korea and Japan, in a deal that could fetch more than $1 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Hong Kong-based Affinity has appointed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to run the sale, which is targeting both private equity investors and strategic buyers, said the person, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential. 
The bank declined to comment.
Affinity bought full control of Burger King South Korea in 2016 for about $170 million and a year later acquired the American fast-food brand's Japan franchise. 
The South Korean business reported 680 billion won ($572 million) in revenue in 2021, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) at 80 billion won ($67 million), said the person, adding its adjusted EBITDA in 2022 is expected to reach 100 billion won.
Burger King Japan's adjusted EBITDA in 2021 was 700 million yen ($6 million), the person said.
Global fast-food chains such as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) are trading at 20 to 30 times their EBITDA, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. Burger King India is trading at about 25 times of its EBITDA. 
Affinity and Burger King Japan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
An official at BKR Corporation, the operator of Burger King in South Korea, declined to comment. 
The Nikkei business daily first reported the sale on Monday.
It comes as the consumer and retail sector faces tremendous challenges and disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
In South Korea, businesses have adapted by relying more on deliveries, which has prompted exponential growth for its food delivery apps.
Burger King Korea said on Monday the number of monthly active users on its mobile app in December exceeded 1.4 million, the highest since the app was launched in May 2016.
Since Affinity's acquisition, Burger King has been in an expansion mode in South Korea and Japan.
Burger King runs 440 outlets in South Korea, more than its rival McDonald's. 

The Japan franchise said on Monday it would open three new outlets in January, bringing the total there to 149, with plans to open more ""aggressively"" in 2022.

(Reuters) -A winter snowstorm creeping up the East Coast of the United States into Canada on Monday was expected to dump more than two feet (60 cm) of snow in some areas, grounding planes and stranding motorists.
More than 4,200 flights in the United States were canceled or delayed on Monday, according to FlightAware. Nearly 90,000 homes and businesses between Georgia and Maine lacked electricity, according to PowerOutage.US.
Traffic was snarled in Toronto, Canada's largest city, as the snowstorm brought visibility to near zero, shut subway lines and left motorists stranded on local highways for hours.
Buses were at a standstill and passing pedestrians helped push cars up a street at a main commuter route in central Toronto. The region was predicted to get up to 2 feet of snow, and an extreme weather warning was in effect. Authorities asked residents to stay off the roads.
In neighboring Quebec, the weather caused traffic accidents, including pileups involving dozens of vehicles that forced authorities to close some highways, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC).
In the eastern United States, officials likewise urged residents to stay off snowy roads on the holiday honoring slain civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.
Ashtabula, Ohio, on Lake Erie, recorded 27 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service, while parts of New York state, Pennsylvania and North Carolina received more than 20 inches.

Atlanta saw its first snow in four years, according to the NWS, and some regions in North Carolina had record snowfalls.
As the storm swept north, northern Maine and New Hampshire were still due for another 2 to 4 inches of ice and snow Monday evening, the weather service said. Blustery conditions were predicted across much of the region into Tuesday.

(Reuters) - Jefferies Financial Group Inc is abandoning an effort to raise a $1 billion fund to buy stakes in private equity fund managers, giving up on a niche and lucrative corner of asset management, people familiar with the matter said. 
It is a blow to Jefferies' Leucadia Asset Management division, which offers alternative investment products such as private equity. The asset management business reported a 52% drop in net revenues in the three months to the end of November to $43 million, citing lower investment returns.
Leucadia Asset Management partnered in 2019 with Stonyrock Partners LP, a private equity firm founded by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc veterans, to raise the fund to invest in private equity fund manager stakes. 
Dubbed Stonyrock Alt Fund I, the fund was seeking to raise $1 billion but had amassed only $38 million as of April 2021, according to a regulatory filing at the time.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. A Jefferies spokesperson declined to comment. Stonyrock executives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Investors are becoming increasingly skeptical that there are enough attractive opportunities to acquire stakes in private equity firms to support the number of dedicated funds that have launched with a focus on this strategy.
The market for private equity fund manager stakes is dominated by a few big firms including Blue Owl Capital Inc through its Dyal franchise, Blackstone Inc and Petershill Partners, a unit of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). 
A handful of other firms, including Investcorp, Bonaccord Capital and Hunter Point Capital, compete by snapping up the interests of mostly middle-market managers.
Stonyrock and Jefferies made at least one investment together - the acquisition in 2019 of a stake in Oak Hill Capital, a Stamford, Connecticut-based private equity firm with about $9 billion in assets under management. Jefferies funded that investment through its balance sheet, one of the sources said. 
Capital that investors committed to Stonyrock Alt Fund I will be returned to them, the sources said. 

Stonyrock Partners was founded in 2018 by Craig Schortzmann, a former executive in Blackstone's private equity fund manager stakes unit, and Sean Gallary, who ran a similar division for Carlyle Group for about a year, according to his LinkedIn page. 
Leucadia Asset Management was launched in 2013 and has $37 billion in assets under management, including in hedge funds and corporate credit.

U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn said on Monday the Senate Judiciary Committee would consider the Open App Markets Act is backed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers.
Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement the bill aims to ""stop Apple and Google from crushing competitors and undercutting consumers. Breaking the ironclad grip of these two behemoths on the multi-billion dollar app market is long overdue.""
Blackburn, a Republican, said the hearing ""bring us one step closer to holding big tech companies like Apple and Google accountable."" 
""Tech giants are forcing their own app stores on users at the expense of innovative start-ups,"" she said.
Google and Apple did not immediately comment Monday.
Apple said earlier its app store was ""an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation, one that now supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states.""

Google said previously that Android devices often come preloaded with two or more app stores and that app sellers can allow downloads without using Google's Play Store.
The lawmakers have said the bill would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use their payment system and prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices or conditions through another app store or payment system.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, with investors continuing to monitor the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.93% by 9:01 PM ET (2:01 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan handing down its interest rate later in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.04% while in Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.19%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.52%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.37% while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.51%. Chinese shares were in the spotlight on Tuesday as investors continued to digest the policy rate cuts from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) from the day before. The central bank lowered the rate on its one-year policy loans by 10 basis points to 2.85% and cut the rate on the seven-day reverse repurchase agreements to 2.1% from 2.2%.
The PBOC moves triggered expectations of further monetary easing, contrasting with the series of interest-rate hikes widely expected from the U.S. Federal Reserve within 2022.
Meanwhile, central banks in Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Turkey, and Ukraine will hand down their policy decisions on Thursday.
U.S. markets will re-open later in the day after a holiday. Global shares have slipped in the year to date, thanks to a retreat in U.S. shares. Investors are now waiting to see whether company profits could improve sentiment, despite inflation and other challenges posed by the omicron COVID-19 variant.
“It will be interesting to see if investors are tempted back in now that earnings season is underway,” OANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam said in a note.
The emergence of omicron may mean that many companies don’t enjoy the kind of performance that was expected before, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be plenty of positives to take away.”
Global corporate earnings will deliver significant beats in 2022, again defying doomsayers and skeptics, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists.

After completing reviews, ""37 employees have exited the company and another 44 received written reprimands, formal warnings or other discipline,"" the company said, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.
The maker of the ""Call of Duty"" game said it was still working on an interim update and had not yet notified employees.
But Activision denied Chief Executive Bobby Kotick held back a summary of the information which had been scheduled for release ""before the winter holidays,"" as the Journal reported.
""An interim update to our employees is still being worked on and the company remains committed to continuing to provide periodic updates on its progress,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
More than 90% of the reviews launched in 2021 are done of a mix of statements ranging from general complaints that were not actionable or suggested misconduct to a small number of assertions that could be serious, the company said.
Activision had collected about 700 reports of employee concerns over misconduct and other issues since July, when a California state agency filed a lawsuit against the company over harassment claims, the Journal reported. 
Activision disputed the number, but did not provide further context. ""Although one case is one too many, there were not 700 reports of misconduct,"" a spokeswoman told Reuters.

Whether a comment about culture, an incident or suggested improvements, every report the company receives matters, Activision said.

(Reuters) - The family of an Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivery truck driver in Illinois who died in December when a warehouse was destroyed by a swarm of tornadoes that killed six people there, filed a lawsuit against the online retailer on Monday over his death.
The suit, the first against the company stemming from the disaster, was brought in state court by the Chicago firm, Clifford Law Offices, on behalf of the family of driver Austin McEwen, 26. It was filed in Third Judicial Circuit in Madison County, Illinois.
It alleges that the Amazon knew that conditions were ""highly unsafe as tornado warnings had been issued,"" but company officials ""rolled the dice with peoples' lives to put profit over safety,"" attorney Jack J. Casciato said.
""We are seeking damages in excess of multi-millions of dollars,"" Casciato said.
Kelly Nantel, an Amazon Spokesperson, said the warehouse was built in compliance with all codes and that Amazon managers followed the weather conditions closely.
""We believe our team did the right thing as soon as a warning was issued, and they worked to move people to safety as quickly as possible,"" Natel said in a statement to Reuters.
""We will defend against this lawsuit, but our focus continues to be on supporting our employees and partners, the families who lost loved ones, the surrounding community, and all those affected by the tornadoes,” she said.
On Dec. 10, a barrage of tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles (322 km).
The six workers in an Amazon delivery station were among more than 70 who died throughout the region. The site received tornado warnings between 8:06 p.m. and 8:16 p.m. before the tornado struck the building at 8:27 p.m., according to Amazon. 
Amazon managers had directed workers to shelter in bathrooms after receiving emergency alerts on mobile phones from authorities, several employees previously told Reuters.

Casciato said that the company had insufficient storm shelters and should have evacuated the warehouse when warnings were first issued a day earlier.
""We're suing because we hope companies like Amazon learn a lesson,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bain Capital is looking to bid for a stake in the benefits and rewards services unit of French food caterer Sodexo (PA:EXHO) as the Paris-listed firm is on the lookout for investors that could help fund the group's turnaround, sources told Reuters.
Sodexo, which has a market value of 12 billion euros ($13.7 billion), is looking to sell a minority stake of about 30% in the business which has been driving the group's post-COVID recovery by providing employee benefit programmes as well as meal vouchers and gift cards, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
An auction process is due to start this week, with other private equity firms expected to join the race, the source said.
Sodexo's benefits unit delivered a 7% jump in organic revenues in its latest quarterly results. Its valuation could exceed 2 billion euros, based on core earnings of about 200 million euros, the source said.
A spokesperson for Sodexo said the company would keep majority control of the benefits and rewards business, adding ""in this context we are currently studying various strategic options.""
The spokesman also ruled out plans for an initial public offering (IPO).
Bain was not immediately available to comment.
Sodexo, one of the world's biggest catering companies alongside Britain's Compass, has been hit hard by the pandemic and had to cut jobs and halt dividend payments to stay afloat.
Unlike restaurants, caterers like Sodexo – which serves businesses, government agencies, hospitals, schools and event organisers – don't have a direct relationship with consumers and have been unable to focus on home deliveries during lockdowns.
On Jan. 6 Sodexo, founded in 1966 by French billionaire Pierre Bellon, warned a prolonged return to remote working caused by the Omicron variant would affect its revenue.

The Bellon family, which holds a 42.8% stake in the company, has given the green light to the carve-out of the benefits division, which also provides fuel cards, incentive programmes and sports passes.

PARIS (Reuters) -The CEO of EDF (PA:EDF) on Monday broke with the convention that bosses of French state companies don't criticise the government to express ""real shock"" and indignation after the utility was told to sell more power to rivals at below-market prices. 
In a memo to managers seen by Reuters, Jean-Bernard Levy said he had tried to persuade ministers to adopt a different course, and was now looking at steps to defend EDF's interests.
Shares in the firm slumped as much as 25% on Friday after the government of President Emmanuel Macron - facing a re-election battle in three months and keen to head off public anger over rising power bills - ordered the utility to sell more cheap nuclear power to rivals.
""This is not what we had proposed to the government,"" Levy said in the internal memo. Instead, he said, the firm had recommended targeted help for small businesses and the most vulnerable industrial users.
""Having fought hard against it, this decision comes as a real shock,"" he said of the government move. ""Naturally, we have to deal with it. It is going to weigh very heavily on our results.""
Referring to the government measures, combined with technical problems at several nuclear plants that forced them offline, Levy wrote: ""This news is rocking the company.""
""Many of you have shared with me your support, and even your indignation, and I share your emotions. You should know that the executive committee and I remain very combative,"" he said.
""Together with the executive committee, we will study the appropriate measures to reinforce the balance sheet of the group, and all measures that protect its interests. At stake is our capacity to safeguard our strategic development. We plan to make these measures public within a month.""

The French state owns 84% of EDF's shares. The group forecast last week the government decision would knock around 8 billion euros ($9.13 billion) off its 2022 core earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

LONDON (Reuters) -Ukrainian sovereign dollar bonds tumbled into distress territory and Russian bonds suffered sharp falls on Monday as fears of another Russian military foray into Ukraine showed no sign of easing.
The premium investors demand to hold Ukraine bonds over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries as measured by the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) EMBI Global Diversified index surged past 1,000 basis points for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in March 2020.
Less than a dozen countries in the 70-plus strong index have quadruple-digit spreads, including Venezuela, Zambia, Lebanon, Sri Lanka and Ghana which are all either in default or deep debt distress.
""The market has to price in some kind of probability of Russia invading,"" said Viktor Szabo at asset manager abrdn, noting as well how the concerns had suddenly hit home for investors in recent days.
The United States said last week it feared Russia was preparing a pretext to invade Ukraine if diplomacy fails to meet its objectives, after a massive cyberattack splashed Ukrainian government websites with a warning to ""be afraid and expect the worst"". 
Talks between Moscow and Western states on Russia's deployment of tens of thousands of troops along Ukraine's border had also ended with no breakthrough.
Russia denies it plans to attack Ukraine but says it could take unspecified military action unless its demands - including a promise by the NATO alliance never to admit Ukraine - are met.
SPREADS SOAR
Ukraine's bond spreads, seen as a proxy for such risks, have already more than doubled since November and are now at levels last seen at the height of the March 2020 COVID-19 market rout. 
They are also broadly comparable to levels hit when Russia invaded and then annexed Crimea in March 2014, although spreads then blew above 4,000 bps in early 2015 when Kyiv was tipped into default in the resulting turmoil.
Monday's sell-off saw Ukraine's bonds continue to fall on international debt markets. Some were down more than 3 cents on the day at nearly 80 cents in the dollar having been at 100 cents just over a month ago. 
Many issues also saw bid-ask spreads widen to well over one cent, indicating that traders were having difficulty offloading their bonds.
""Ukraine has probably lost market access, and this could complicate financing plans this year, if sustained,"" said Stuart Culverhouse at Tellimer.
Last month the head of Ukraine's debt management department told Reuters the country was hoping to wait out the current tensions. It will need money at some point though with a $1 billion refinancing deadline in September. 
Russian sovereign bonds also felt the pain. Yields on Russia's 10-year benchmark OFZ government bonds hit their highest since April 2016 at 9.5%. Refinitiv data also showed the country's 2043-maturing dollar-denominated bond tumbling more than 5 cents at one point and again many of the bonds hit their lowest since 2020's pandemic rout. 
Russian spreads over U.S. Treasuries widened as far as 238 bps on the day which left them 71 bps up this year. The moves were then pruned slightly after German newspaper Handelsblatt reported that Western governments had taken the option of cutting Russian banks off from the crucial Swift global payment system off the table.

The rouble also edged higher on that speculation, but 5-year credit default swaps (CDS) for both countries rose again, too. Ukraine's CDS which investors use to hedge their risk were up 76 basis points from Friday close at 918 bps, data from IHS Markit showed. Russia's jumped by 34 bps to 215 bps.
Veteran Ukraine and Russia watcher at BlueBay Asset Management Tim Ash called it a ""strange day"" when markets had suddenly woken up to the risks of the situation.

SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) -China's biggest homebuilder by sales, Country Garden, scooped up $10 million of its own bonds on Monday as the country's ongoing property crisis sent then sprawling again. 
Last week was the worst on record for Country Garden's bonds and fresh falls of up to 17 points on Monday left most of its international market debt at 25-35% below its face value.
Analysts cited reports that it had dropped plans to raise $300 million last week after debt market investors had shown insufficient appetite. 
A spokesperson at Country Garden responded to the reports saying the company had no plan to sell a convertible bond at present.
""It just seems to be the fear factor playing out,"" said Seaport Global analyst Himanshu Porwal. ""People are just marking things down as much as they can"".
Well after Asian markets closed, the firm said it had bought back $5 million worth of its July 2022 notes and $5 million of its April 2026 notes from the open market. It also said it would make further repurchases ""as and when appropriate.""
Country Garden's share price had tumbled 8% in Hong Kong, though it wasn't the only one to see sharp falls.
Central China Real Estate, Yuzhou Group Holdings, KWG Group Holdings and Sunac all dropped between 2% and 5%, even as China's central bank unexpectedly cut one of its key interest rates.
Chinese developers are facing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze due to years of regulatory curbs on borrowing, leading to a string of offshore debt defaults, credit-rating downgrades and sell-offs in developers' shares and bonds.
The World Bank's economic prospects report last week warned a severe and prolonged downturn in China's real estate sector would have significant economy-wide reverberations, as developers' total liabilities amount to almost 30% of the country's GDP.
""What it has turned into is a cash crunch in the sector,"" Colm D'Rosario, a high-yield debt manager at Europe's biggest asset manager Amundi, said.

The primary concern is that many of China's big developers still have large debt payments to make this year, at time when traditional borrowing markets remained largely closed to them. 
""At some point the government will take steps as they don't want a downward spiral, but they are walking a tightrope,"" D'Rosario said.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 12:40PM ET</span>",Aeromexico shareholders back capital increase in restructuring plan,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican carrier Aeromexico said on Monday that its shareholders have approved a capital increase as part of its restructuring plan to emerge from bankruptcy.
In two meetings held on Friday, shareholders agreed to hike the share capital by $4.267 billion, which is subject to a third party making a public tender offer of its current shares.
The increase will come from the issuance of some 682 trillion common shares, which will be paid for through a $3.44 billion debt capitalization and an $828 million injection.
Aeromexico's biggest creditor in its U.S. Chapter 11 case, Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), will swap its debt into equity as part of the reorganization, becoming the airline's largest stakeholder.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), which had controlled a majority of Aeromexico before the bankruptcy, will hold roughly a fifth of its stock coming out of bankruptcy.
Aeromexico has 682.1 million shares in circulation. Existing equity shareholders will see their stakes essentially wiped out. 
Aeromexico also said shareholders had agreed to issue another 68.2 trillion shares, which will remain in the company's treasury.
A company spokesperson declined to comment on the decision.
Aeromexico, which was hit hard in 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic, declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy before a U.S. court in July 2020.
Last week, Aeromexico said creditors had approved the company's restructuring plan in a Jan. 7 vote.
The plan now faces approval of the U.S. bankruptcy court Jan. 27, according to Aeromexico. 

The company's shares have sharply fluctuated over the past month since it said it would sell its outstanding shares to an unnamed third party for 0.01 Mexican peso each.
After the announcement Monday, Aeromexico stocks rose 5.38% to 1.96 pesos.

(Reuters) -European shares closed higher on Monday, with healthcare stocks lifted by M&A activity, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) slipped after its chairman quit after an internal probe into his personal conduct. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.7% and healthcare stocks were up 1.4%, after losing more than 2% last week, as Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) jumped 4.1%.
This followed confirmation at the weekend that the British drugmaker had rejected a 50 billion pound offer from Unilever (NYSE:UL) for its consumer healthcare business.
Unilever shares slid 7.0% to touch March 2020 lows after it signalled on Monday it would pursue the deal, which it said represented a ""strong strategic fit"".
""The negative share price reaction probably reflects investor fears that Unilever is going to come back with a higher offer and potentially pay too much,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Meanwhile, Credit Suisse shares slipped 2.3% after Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio quit following an internal probe, including into breaches of COVID-19 rules.
New chairman Axel Lehmann said the Swiss bank will stick to its strategic overhaul despite Horta-Osorio's exit, which comes less than a year after he was hired to help it deal with the implosion of investment firm Archegos and the insolvency of British supply chain finance group Greensill Capital.
Europe's wider banking index gained 0.2%.
""We see the resignation as a negative outcome for Credit Suisse,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said. ""While the company indicates it will continue to execute its strategy, we believe the ongoing turnover with management changes brings further uncertainty.""
After notching up record highs at the start of the year, trading in European stocks has hit a turbulent patch in recent days as investors priced in an aggressive tightening of U.S. monetary policy, along with a possible near-term economic slowdown caused by COVID-19.

Israel's Sheba Medical Center has given second booster shots in a trial among its staff and is studying the effect of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) booster in 154 people after two weeks and the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) booster in 120 people after one week, said Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit.
These were compared to a control group that did not receive the fourth shot. Those in the Moderna group had previously received three shots of Pfizer's vaccine, the hospital said.
The vaccines led to a increase in the number of antibodies ""even a little bit higher than what we had after the third dose"", said Regev-Yochay.
""Yet, this is probably not enough for the Omicron,"" she told reporters. ""We know by now that the level of antibodies needed to protect and not to got infected from Omicron is probably too high for the vaccine, even if it's a good vaccine.""

The findings, which the hospital said were the first of its kind in the world, were preliminary and not yet published.
Israel was the fastest country to roll out initial vaccinations against COVID-19 a year ago and last month started offering a fourth shot, or a second booster, to the most vulnerable and high-risk groups.

Sales of the brandy, produced in the Cognac region of France, rose by almost 31% in value to 3.6 billion euros ($4.1 billion), industry group BNIC said on Monday.
Volumes were up 16% to 223.2 million bottles. 
""This growth reflects a real recovery of cognac, as well as new consumption habits,"" BNIC said in a statement, noting sales had also risen compared with 2019, before the pandemic struck.
The outlook should remain positive in the coming months for all destinations, BNIC added.
The news comes after France's champagne industry said last month it expected record sales in 2021, and follows strong results from several spirits companies. 
Cognac sales to its largest market, the United States, climbed 11%, with 115 million bottles shipped in 2021.
Sales to China, its second biggest, leapt 56% with 34 million bottles shipped, while European sales were up 8% to reach 37.1 million bottles.
In late November, spirits group Remy Cointreau raised its full-year profit forecast after a better-than-expected first half, driven by strong demand for its premium cognac in China, the United States and Europe.
 Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), which owns Martell cognac, also pointed to a jump in sales in China. 

The 2021 harvest, at 867,312 hectolitres, was within the 10-year average and should support further growth for the sector, BNIC said.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 10:55AM ET</span>",Dove soap maker Unilever signals pursuit of GSK consumer arm; shares fall,"By Pushkala Aripaka, Keith Weir and Pamela Barbaglia
(Reuters) -Unilever signalled on Monday it would pursue a deal for GSK's consumer business, calling it a ""strong strategic fit"", but Unilever (NYSE:UL) shares slid more than 8%, highlighting investors' doubts about its 50-billion-pound ($68.4 billion) offer.
GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) confirmed over the weekend that it had rejected nL1N2TV079 three bids from the Dove soap maker for the consumer healthcare business, which is home to brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste, Emergen-C vitamin supplement and Panadol painkiller. 
GSK, led by Emma Walmsley, has hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) to review Unilever's approach but it will not engage in talks unless Unilever bumps up its offer, sources familiar with the matter said.
GSK's shares jumped 6% to their highest level since May 2020. It said on Saturday Unilever's proposal ""fundamentally undervalued"" the consumer business, adding that it would stick to its plan of listing the division this year. 
""Initial feedback on the deal from investors over the weekend has been almost uniformly negative,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note. Others noted Unilever's share price fall indicated a lack of confidence in its management and concern over the price. 
The Marmite spread maker, however, defended the bid for the GSK consumer business, in which U.S. drugs company  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) owns a 32% stake.
""The acquisition would create scale and a growth platform for the combined portfolio in the U.S., China and India, with further opportunities in other emerging markets,"" Unilever said, pointing to synergies in the oral care and vitamin supplements business.
GSK and Pfizer would open negotiations with Unilever's boss Alan Jope if the consumer goods giant was ready to improve its bid to more than 60 billion pounds, a source familiar with Pfizer's strategy said.
The source called the business a ""legitimate standalone candidate"", adding its market value could rise to almost $100 billion once the business was spun out and listed. 
""Right now there is more value in a spin-off but if Unilever is ready to go north of 60 billion pounds then a dialogue could start,"" he said.
GSK declined to comment and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the fate of GSK's consumer business. 
EXECUTION 
GSK laid out plans nL4N2R82AU for a separate listing of the consumer arm in June last year, following pressure from investors to explore a shake-up of the company and focus on its pharmaceuticals business.
A Unilever buyout of the consumer division would be one of the largest ever on the London market, and one of the biggest deals globally since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It would also boost Unilever's growth strategy, as management has been under pressure to turn around the company's languishing stock price and cope with high costs and slim margins, but raises questions nL4N2TX2WJ about its strategy.
Some analysts expressed doubts over Unilever's ability to sweeten its offer to GSK.
""Given vocal investor concern of late and Unilever's share price reaction this morning, this could prevent a higher offer from materialising,"" said Chris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot.
Reports of buying interest in GSK's consumer arm, including from private equity players, have been doing the rounds for a while.
""It's a little surprising that (GSK and Pfizer) haven't ripped Unilever's arm off at £50bn, as it's a decent price, with the only question being as to whether it's the right one,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said in a note. 
""It might be for GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, however there is a feeling that for Unilever it could well prove to be too high a price,"" Hewson added. 

Unilever, which is set to announce an initiative later this month to strengthen its business, said on Monday it was committed to ""strict financial discipline"" for any acquisitions, adding that such deals would be accompanied by the divestment of lower margin businesses or brands.

708,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 10:40AM ET</span>","Unilever's offer for GSK's consumer health raises doubts, questions over strategy","By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Unilever (NYSE:UL) faces a dilemma after its 50 billion pound ($68 billion) offer for GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s consumer healthcare assets was rejected -- should it raise the bid and risk overpaying or seek another route to expand in healthcare?
The bid for GSK's assets, including Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil painkillers, comes as Unilever is dealing with steep inflation and sluggish growth in emerging markets, where it derives 60% of its revenues. 
Chief Executive Alan Jope, in the role since 2019, is also facing shareholder pressure over a languishing stock price, which fell as much as 8% on Monday after its bid became public.
Analysts said digesting GSK's consumer health assets at a price of over 50 billion pounds in cash and stock, would nearly triple Unilever's leverage towards 5.6 times in the first year from 2 times net debt to EBITDA currently. 
""The leverage implied by such a deal would make it less likely they turn around their core business,"" Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said, pointing to Unilever's added balance sheet pressure and limited ability to invest behind brands. 
FOOD TO GO?
Unilever on Monday also announced plans to focus more on health, beauty and hygiene products, after an extensive review of its businesses. 
This points to a potential spin off or disposal of its Foods business, at least three brokerages said. However, letting go of a cash-generative business could be detrimental at this time, they said, and it would be difficult for Unilever to sell the entire business to a single buyer.
HSBC analysts said the GSK move added to uncertainty over where Unilever was heading.
""Unilever's approach is likely to raise a number of questions over what it might do next from both an M&A standpoint and in terms of the structure of its own business,"" HSBC analyst Jeremy Fialko said in a note. 
PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE
Analysts expressed concerns about Unilever's track record with acquisitions, highlighting its purchase Dollar Shave Club for 1 billion in 2016 which they said had failed to make a major mark on its fortunes.
HSBC pointed to the company's last big acquisition - Bestfoods for $25 billion in 2000 - which saddled it with slow growth, middle of the aisle food brands, which Unilever has trimmed via the sale of tea and spreads businesses. 
""The patchy historical track record of large transactions in the sector - and indeed Unilever's last really big acquisition, Bestfoods - is also likely to be at the forefront of investors' minds,"" HSBC said.
Bernstein's Monteyne said big consumer goods deals do not pay out as it is ""impossible"" to eke out very high growth rates on such large businesses, pointing to Reckitt Beckiser's Mead Johnson deal and Danone's Whitewave foods acquisition. 
MARGIN IMPACT
Analysts also said a GSK deal could significantly erode Unilever's stable operating margins of 18-19%, a big draw for long term investors, saying it offers only a mid-single digit return on investment, when accounting for cost savings and revenue synergies.
Berenberg analyst James Targett said he doubted the deal would provide Unilever the organic growth lift it is seeking, pointing to GSK's Consumer Health business's 1% average growth over the past 20 quarters, compared with 3% for Unilever.
UNCHARTED WATERS
While GSK's consumer assets would bolster Unilever's presence in the oral care and vitamins and supplements category, it would also bring over-the-counter drugs, such as Panadol and Advil, to its roster. 
RBC Capital Markets said GSK's large portfolio of products with clinical/medical characteristics and consequently regulatory obstacles could restrict Unilever's ability to roll the acquired brands into new markets as it does with consumer brands.
""We can't imagine many things that would unnerve us more
about Unilever than acquiring GSK consumer health,"" RBC's James Targett wrote. 

""We see little justification for such a deal strategically, operationally or financially.""

LONDON (Reuters) -European shares recovered from Friday's losses on Monday as investors focused on company earnings and U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers entered a quiet period ahead of their meeting next week.
Stock market moves in Asian trading were small and economic data from China was mixed: industrial output picking up but retail sales missed expectations.
China's central bank unexpectedly eased policy by cutting rates on medium-term loans.
Analysts expect more policy easing as growth in the world's second-largest economy has shown signs of slowing from its rapid rebound after the COVID-19 slump.
At 1321 GMT, the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was flat. Europe's STOXX 600 was up 0.6%, having recovered most of Friday's losses. 
Markets in the United States are closed for a public holiday, but S&P 500 futures were up 0.2% and Nasdaq futures up 0.1%.
Expectations of central banks tightening policy to combat persistent inflation have meant that equities have generally struggled to make gains so far this year and investors are rotating from growth to value stocks.
Investors are focused on company earnings, which will need to be strong to prevent further losses. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), BofA,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) report earnings this week.
Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets, said that she would be looking to see how much the costs of higher prices and labour shortages have affected corporate profits, as well as how companies will spend the money on their balance sheets.
""One thing that was a very positive surprise for us last year, particularly towards the end of the year, was the strength of corporate margins,"" Veitmane added. 
""Corporates were able to pass higher costs to the end consumer and that was really encouraging news for us. That's exactly what we'll be looking for this time around.""
FED MEETING
The U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Jan. 25-26 and investors expect a cycle of rate hikes to begin in March. Rate hikes tend to harm riskier assets such as equities.
Speculators' net bearish bets on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures have swelled to their largest since February 2020, just before the onset of the pandemic, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a two-year high last week. The implied yield from futures rose to 1.85% early on Monday.
The U.S. dollar index was up 0.1% on the day at 95.329, clinging to its recent bounce. The euro was at $1.1396.
Ahead of a Bank of Japan policy meeting concluding on Tuesday, the dollar was up 0.3% against the yen, at 114.555.
Euro zone government bond yields edged higher, with the benchmark German 10-year yield at -0.034%.

Brent crude futures hit their highest in more than three years as investors bet supply will remain tight amid restrained output by major producers, with global demand unperturbed by the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Bitcoin was a touch lower, around $42,637.

The company, controlled by Qatari investment vehicle Mayhoola, said it had created two new roles - a chief operations and logistics officer and global chief financial officer - to be held by Giuseppe De Mori and Alberto Fasanotti, respectively.
Both areas will report directly to Chief Executive Jacopo Venturini.
De Mori will oversee the industrial strategy of the Maison, coordinating production with logistics at a global level. He will also oversee the digitalisation of internal processes and sustainability, a priority for the group, a statement said. 
""We are set on building together the next chapter of the brand, streamlining the business as well as repositioning Valentino (as) the most established Italian Maison de Couture,"" Venturini said in the statement. 

He added the luxury group was ""charting a new course for the future"".

712,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 08:10AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse faces more upheaval after chairman's sudden exit,"By Anshuman Daga and Oliver Hirt
SINGAPORE/ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) will stick to its strategic overhaul despite the abrupt departure of its mastermind Antonio Horta-Osorio following an internal probe into his personal conduct, including breaches of COVID-19 rules, the bank's new chairman said on Monday.
Horta-Osorio leaves less than nine months after he joined the bank to help it deal with the implosion of investment firm Archegos and the insolvency of British supply chain finance company Greensill Capital, while it was still reeling from the 2020 exit of CEO Tidjane Thiam over a spying scandal.
The Portuguese banker unveiled a new strategy for Switzerland's no. 2 bank in November to focus on wealth management, rein in its investment bankers and curb a freewheeling culture.
""In the years ahead the strategy will be reviewed regularly, but at the moment it's not an issue at all,"" Axel Lehmann, the Credit Suisse board member picked to replace Horta-Osorio, told Reuters in an interview, his first with the media since his appointment.
The bank's shares were down around 1.6% in early afternoon trade. 
Horta-Osorio's personal conduct has recently come under scrutiny, after he breached COVID-19 quarantine rules twice in 2021 - an embarrassment for the former Lloyds (LON:LLOY) chief executive who has said every banker needed to be a risk manager.
""I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally,"" the Portuguese banker said in a statement issued https:// by Credit Suisse on Monday.
""I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time,"" he said. 
Credit Suisse said Lehmann had taken over with immediate effect. It gave no details on an investigation commissioned by its board.
Two people familiar with the situation said that besides COVID-19 breaches the probe also looked into Horta-Osorio's use of company private jets, citing an instance when he has directed one to take him to the Maldives on his return from a business trip in Asia. 
A spokesperson for Horta-Osorio said he was not speaking to the media.
His exit marks a professional low point for the banker who spent a decade at Lloyds rebuilding the lender following its bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. Last summer he was awarded a knighthood in Britain for his contribution to financial services and mental health, winning praise for speaking publicly about the stress he experienced after taking over at Lloyds. 
Lehmann, a Swiss citizen who previously worked for rival UBS and spent nearly two decades at Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF), said no change of course was planned for Credit Suisse as it tries to steer its way back into calmer waters.
He said business remained excellent despite the latest upheaval and that no big management changes were in the works, adding that Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein was ""central to our ability to continue the transformation together"".
The board concluded that it was time for Horta-Osorio to go, he said.
""We determined over the weekend - and he also thought about it - that it's just in the best interest for him but certainly for the bank as well to put this story behind us and he resign.""
TWO STRIKES
Analysts said Horta-Osorio's departure was inevitable after it was found he had breached COVID-19 rules twice, but it could further complicate the bank's turnaround. 
""His departure leaves Credit Suisse with a lack of strong characters at the top and leadership questions will likely be raised,"" wrote analysts at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). 
In December, Reuters reported that a preliminary internal bank investigation had found that Horta-Osorio attended the Wimbledon tennis finals in London in July without following Britain's quarantine rules.
Horta-Osorio also broke Swiss COVID-19 rules in November by leaving the country during a 10-day quarantine period, the bank said last month.
The pandemic brought greater scrutiny of prominent figures, with athletes such as tennis superstar Novak Djokovic or politicians like British Prime Minister Boris Johnson drawing heat for their actions at a time when the public has to live with COVID-19 curbs. 
Investors had been hoping the bank's strategic changes would help lift the ailing Swiss bank's share price.
David Herro, portfolio manager at Harris Associates, Credit Suisse's third-biggest shareholder, told Reuters before Horta-Osorio's departure he believed the infractions were ""minor"" and that he and his turnaround plan had the institution's full backing. 
""So, that's a very important reason to invest in the company. And if that person (Horta-Osorio) leaves, that very important reason leaves"". 
'WHAT A WASTE'
Reeling from a disastrous year, Credit Suisse reported a 21% fall in its third-quarter profit last year and warned of a loss for the final three months of 2021.
UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, however reported its highest quarterly profit in six years in the third quarter and while Credit Suisse shares have shed 23% over the past year, its rival's have soared 33% to a four-year high.
Horta-Osorio's sudden exit demoralised staff at Credit Suisse, with some questioning what was next for the bank.

""What a waste and again we make the headlines for the wrong reason,"" a senior Credit Suisse private banker said on condition of anonymity as he was not allowed to speak to media. 
""In between we froze for one year waiting for the new strategy from the new man,"" he said.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, Sri Lanka is facing its most serious financial crisis in years, raising doubts about its ability to pay its creditors.
On Tuesday, the island nation will repay $500 million towards an international sovereign bond, the first tranche of a total of $4.5 billion that it needs to pay back this year, to avoid the first default in its history.
Here are the key details about Sri Lanka's mounting debt problems https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/sri-lanka-debt-pain-will-go-china-wall-st-2022-01-11. 
DEBT PROFILE
Sri Lanka, through repeated cycles of borrowing since 2007, has piled up $11.8 billion worth of debt through sovereign bonds (ISB), which makes up the largest part - or 36.4% - of its external debt.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is in second place with a 14.3% share, having lent $4.6 billion. Japan is at 10.9% and China at 10.8%, with each having lent about $3.5 billion each.
The rest of the debt is owned by countries such as India and international agencies including the World Bank and United Nations.
CHINESE LOANS 
China has lent billions of dollars to Sri Lanka, partly under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), over the past decade for infrastructure projects including highways, ports, an airport and a coal power plant. 
Critics say the funds have been used for white elephant projects with low returns. China rejects that criticism.
Sri Lanka has asked China to restructure https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/sri-lankas-president-asks-china-restructure-debt-repayments-2022-01-09 its debt repayments to help navigate the financial crisis. 
GOVERNMENT FACES MULTIPLE CHALLENGES
The government is struggling to tame retail inflation, which is running at a decade-high, amid surging commodity prices. It is also struggling to meet a fiscal deficit target of 8.9% of gross domestic product.
Since November, Moody's (NYSE:MCO), Fitch and Standard & Poor's ratings agencies have all downgraded Sri Lanka on debt default worries. Central bank governor https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/sri-lanka-meet-all-debt-repayments-while-rebuilding-fx-reserves-cenbank-chief-2022-01-12 Ajith Nivard Cabraal has said the country will meet all its debt repayments in 2022. 
SOME SAY RESTRUCTURE, DON'T REPAY
Some experts believe Sri Lanka should restructure its debt and establish a three-year repayment structure. 
Doing so would save precious dollars and lessen the burden on Sri Lankan citizens who are facing shortages of imported goods such as milk powder, gas and fuel.
""Sri Lanka is unreasonably committed to repaying its debt. It is more prudent to press pause on debt repayment and take care of critical economic needs,"" Verité Research Executive Director and Economist Dr. Nishan de Mel told Reuters. 
REBUILDING OF FOREX RESERVES 
Fitch estimates the Sri Lankan central bank will also need to arrange for $2.4 billion to help state-owned and private firms in the country honour the debt obligations they have in 2022, over and above the $4.5 billion central government debt.

The country also needs around $20 billion for essential imports such as fuel, food and intermediate goods for exports.
Reserves have been at a critical level for months but grew to $3.1 billion at the end of December boosted by a $1.5 billion yuan currency swap from China.

PARIS (Reuters) -A solid performance by  Renault  (PA:RENA)'s higher-value brands helped soften an overall drop in annual worldwide group sales at the French carmaker, as its focus on more profitable models pays off.
Renault's worldwide group sales fell for the third year in a row in 2021, due notably to problems with the supply of chips used in vehicles.
Renault, whose Chief Executive Luca de Meo has moved from a strategy of chasing volume to creating value, said sales of passenger cars and light vehicles fell 4.5% to 2,696,401 units.
Sales of the Renault brand were down 5.3% although sales of the low-cost Dacia brand increased by 3.1%, Lada's sales progressed by 0.3% while sales of the Alpine sport model jumped 74%.ts last year. Renault's shares rose around 2%.
""The sales policy initiated in the third quarter of 2020, is leading to an increase in the share of sales in the most profitable channels,"" Renault said in a statement.

Renault brand commercial boss Fabrice Cambolive said he expected the Renault brand to increase in terms of net revenue per model in 2022.
Renault said that in its five main European countries - France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom - the share of sales to retail customers now represented 58%, up 6 points compared to 2019, before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The resignation of Romolo Bardin comes after Generali's second-biggest investor, Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, quit the board and his role as deputy chairman last week.
Italian billionaires Caltagirone, 79, and Del Vecchio, 86, are opposing the reappointment of Generali CEO Philippe Donnet, in a challenge to Generali's single biggest shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
Their defections come as Generali prepares to kick off the process to draw up a list of nominees for a new board in April.
Generali's board meets on Tuesday to start examining an initial list of candidates, a person close to the matter said.
Donnet, who is backed by Mediobanca, has secured the support of a majority of board members in his bid to win a third mandate from shareholders in April. 
Caltagirone and Del Vecchio plan to present their own CEO candidate as part of a separate slate of nominees for the board, people close to the matter have previously said.
They control a combined stake of over 16% in Generali, including the stake of a third smaller investor who joined their agreement to consult over moves at Generali.
Now that Del Vecchio's representative and Caltagirone have resigned from the board, their stakebuilding is no longer subject to disclosure obligations. 
To counter their weight at the April AGM, Mediobanca has borrowed shares to complement its 12.8% holding in Generali to reach a 17% voting stake, which it may increase further if needed, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.
The AGM's outcome will likely hinge on the vote of institutional investors, which own 35% of Generali.
Caltagirone and Del Vecchio have yet to disclose their candidates for the roles of Generali CEO and chairman.
In the meantime, they are bringing onboard advisers. A person with knowledge of the matter said they were working with Fabrizio Palermo, the former head of Italian state lender CDP who is also a former executive at McKinsey. 

Like Caltagirone, Bardin also mentioned the procedures followed by Generali, in particular for the board renewal, as a reason for his departure, according to Generali's statement.
Generali Chairman Gabriele Galateri di Genola said he regretted Bardin's decision and that the group had followed ""standards of absolute transparency and rigorous fairness, in the interest of all stakeholders"".

Halkbank shares were 8.5% higher at 5.59 lira at 0727 GMT.
""The Bank plans to file a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Halkbank said in a statement to the Istanbul stock exchange. ""The proceedings in the District Court will be stayed until the process at the Supreme Court is completed,"" it said.
The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a delay, saying Halkbank's ""meritless"" claims neither raised ""substantial"" questions nor overcame the public interest in a speedy trial.
Halkbank has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and conspiracy over its alleged use of money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions.
Its alleged misconduct includes helping Iran secretly transfer $20 billion of restricted funds, including $1 billion laundered through the U.S. financial system, and converting oil revenue into gold and then cash to benefit Iranian interests.
In an Oct. 22 decision, the 2nd Circuit said Halkbank could be prosecuted because its alleged misconduct involved commercial activity that was not covered by sovereign immunity.
Halkbank said that decision conflicted with Supreme Court precedents as it ""greenlights the first criminal trial of a foreign sovereign in the nation's history.""

It also said it would suffer irreparable harm if forced to defend against ""a case from which it is immune.""
The Supreme Court denies most appeals. In its last term it received 5,307 filings and heard arguments in 72 cases.

Investing.com -- European stock markets were broadly higher on Monday, supported by action from the Chinese central bank to support a slowing economy.
The Chinese central bank cut its one-year loan rate for the first time in two years, a signal that it intends to put a safety net under an economy whose zero-Covid policy and real estate and financial sectors are under varying degrees of pressure.
Chinese fourth-quarter growth data released earlier were better than expected, but showed a sharp slowdown in retail sales growth in December as the northern hemisphere’s winter ushered in a fresh spate of local mobility restrictions. Many of Europe’s biggest consumer and industrial stocks depend to a large extent on the Chinese market for their profits.
By 5:45 AM ET (1045 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 600 index was up 0.5% at 483.58, while the German DAX index was up 0.3%, the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.6% and the French CAC 40 was up by 0.5%.
The two big outliers were in the Netherlands and Russia. The first suffered from a 6.8% drop in Unilever (NYSE:UL) stock, after the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant’s 50 billion pound ($68 billion) offer for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer health business was rejected.
Investors expressed concern at the price, and the debt that would be needed to fund the acquisition. GSK stock soared 3.7% to a two-year high on confidence that the final valuation for the unit will be substantially higher than Unilever’s offer.
The Russian RTS Index, meanwhile, fell over 1% to a new seven-month low after more threats of military action against Ukraine by the Kremlin, after the breakdown of talks last week with the U.S. where Russia had sought assurances that its neighbor would never be allowed to join NATO.
The RTS has lost nearly one-quarter of its value since October against a backdrop of simultaneous diplomatic and economic pressure on Russia’s neighbors to neutralize the supposed threat from Ukraine and start the flow of gas through a new pipeline to Germany. Germany’s new Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock will meet with her counterparts in both Ukraine and Russia over the next two days.
Elsewhere,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock slumped another 1.6% after its chairman Antonio Horta Osario, brought in less than a year ago to arrest the alarming decline in the bank's value, was forced out after repeated breaches of Covid-19 protocols. The bank is being routinely touted as a takeover target after a spectacular fall from grace that has featured embarrassingly public management feuds and some disastrous errors of judgment, most notably with the collapsed private office Archegos and with disgraced Australian financier Lex Greensill.
With the U.S. out and the Federal Reserve now in blackout period, the foreign exchange market was becalmed. The euro drifted to $1.1420, amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank will be forced to move up its timeline for tightening monetary policy. "

Reported losses from the scam amounted to at least S$8.5 million ($6.31 million) in December and ensnared at least 469 customers. 
""MAS takes a serious view of the recent phishing scams involving OCBC Bank,"" the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a statement. 
""MAS has been following up with the bank on these and broader issues relating to the incident.""
The central bank said OCBC will conduct a thorough probe to identify deficiencies in its processes and implement necessary measures, after which ""MAS will consider appropriate supervisory actions."" 
In a separate statement, OCBC said it was making goodwill payouts to customers hit by the SMS phishing scam after reviewing each case.

It said the scam was particularly aggressive and highly coordinated, and preyed on people's fear there were issues with their accounts or credit cards.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 04:31AM ET</span>","Cinda, under Beijing pressure, scraps $944 million investment in Ant unit -sources","(Reuters) - China Cinda Asset Management Co Ltd scrapped a deal to buy a 20% stake worth about $944 million in fintech giant Ant Group's consumer finance arm because of pressure from state authorities, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Cinda, one of the four biggest state-owned asset management companies (AMCs) in China, announced the scrapping of the planned Ant investment on Thursday, without elaborating on the reason.
The decision could further delay a regulatory-driven revamp of Ant, an affiliate of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), and the revival of its public market debut after its $37 billion dual-listing attempt was derailed at the last minute in November 2020.
Cinda's crucial capital injection into Ant was endorsed by its primary regulator - the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) - but it failed to secure approval from higher government authorities, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
One of the sources said China's State Council, its cabinet, was one of the authorities that questioned Cinda's bid to invest in Ant while the fintech firm's core business was still in the middle of restructuring, and finally rejected it.
The rejection was also triggered by concern that the deal could run counter to state AMC's direction of reform that requires asset managers to focus on their core business of disposal of soured loans, and the divesting of non-core assets, the second source said.
Cinda on Monday declined to elaborate beyond its Thursday statement announcing the pullback, in which it said the decision came after prudent commercial consideration and negotiation with Ant's consumer finance unit.
Ant did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Last week, the company said it respected the ""business decision"" of Cinda and that it would ""ensure the rectification work"" for the consumer finance unit was carried out.
The CBIRC and the State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Cinda, which was established in Beijing in the late 1990s to handle soured debts at state banks, counts the Ministry of Finance as its biggest shareholder. 
The withdrawn investment plan would have increased Cinda's interest in Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance Co Ltd to 24% and would have made the asset manager its second-biggest investor. 
Ant's consumer finance unit had planned to boost its registered capital to 30 billion yuan ($4.73 billion) from 8 billion yuan, with 6 billion yuan coming from Cinda, and bring in new strategic investors. 
Even after the planned capital raising, Ant would have retained a 50% stake in the unit, according to Cinda's filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late last month.

Two other investors in the Ant unit - Jiangsu Yuyue Medical Equipment & Supply Co Ltd and Sunny Optical Technology Group Co Ltd - that had previously agreed to the capital increase said on Friday that they would postpone their investments in light of Cinda's move.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Shares of Macau's top casino operators racked up as much as HK$65.53 billion ($8.42 billion) on Monday - or 15% of their market value - as the government of the world's largest gambling hub retained the limit on casino licences to six. 
By the close of the Hong Kong market, the six Macau casino operators had gained 9.9% in value, or HK$42.2 billion, putting the overall market value of the oprators at about HK$469 billion. Sands China (OTC:SCHYY) led the rally. 
Shares of Sands China Ltd, which jumped as much as 22.3%, ended the day up 14.6% in their biggest daily percentage gain since October 2011. That compared with a 0.7% decline in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.
 Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF) which jumped as much as 19.1%, closed up 11.9% in its best day since March 2020.
Macau's government announced on Friday that the number of new casino operators allowed to function in the world's largest gambling hub would be limited to six with an operating period of up to 10 years. 
The regulatory announcement provides new clarity and should remove most investors' key concerns such as dividends, government oversight, minimum shareholding by a Macau permanent resident, and gaming tax, Citi said in a research note.
The former Portuguese colony is the world's biggest gambling hub in terms of money wagered.
Macau massively tightened scrutiny of casinos in recent years, with authorities clamping down on illicit capital flows from mainland China and targeting underground lending and illegal cash transfers.
The market value of U.S. casino operators, including Sands China, Wynn Macau, MGM China (OTC:MCHVY) and Melco, gained as much as HK$43.23 billion ($5.55 billion in Hong Kong. 
Citi raised target prices on the six Macau casino operators by 8%-14% following the government's clarification on the revisions in gaming law.
Shares of Galaxy Entertainment, MGM China, SJM, and Melco finished up between 4.8% and 11.7%.
""The proposed bill would remove the current sub-concession structure, but not change to the competitive dynamics ultimately,"" Jefferies wrote in a research note.

""As the government crackdown on junkets continue, we expect long-term pressure on VIP business,"" Jefferies said, adding that the near-term gross gaming revenue outlook remains bleak amid uncertainties over timing of border reopening with recent COVID-19 outbreaks in Mainland and Hong Kong.

The FAA has warned that potential interference could affect sensitive airplane instruments such as altimeters and make an impact on low-visibility operations.

""Even with the approvals granted by the FAA today, U.S. airlines will not be able to operate the vast majority of passenger and cargo flights due to the FAA's 5G-related flight restrictions unless action is taken prior to the planned Jan. 19 rollout,"" said Airlines for America, a trade group representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Fedex and other carriers.
The FAA approved two radio altimeter models used in many Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus planes, including some Boeing 737, 747, 757, 767, MD-10/-11 and Airbus A310, A319, A320, A321, A330 and A350 models. The announcement came just days before AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) launch new 5G service on Wednesday. The FAA said it expects to issue more approvals in the coming days. 
The FAA said the aircraft and altimeter approvals open ""runways at as many as 48 of the 88 airports most directly affected by 5G C-band interference."" But the agency warned that ""even with these new approvals, flights at some airports may still be affected.""
Reuters reviewed the 36-page list of the runways covered by the approvals that has not yet been made public - and it does not include many larger U.S. airports.
The FAA told Boeing in a letter Sunday reviewed by Reuters that it was granting approvals for specific runways and planes with certain altimeters ""because the susceptibility to interference from 5G C-band emissions has been minimized.""
AT&T and Verizon, which won nearly all of the C-Band spectrum in an $80 billion auction last year, on Jan. 3 agreed to buffer zones around 50 airports to reduce interference risks and take other steps to reduce potential interference for six months. They also agreed to delay deployment for two weeks, averting an aviation safety standoff.
The FAA on Thursday issued nearly 1,500 notices detailing the extent of potential impact of 5G services.
""Passengers should check with their airlines if weather is forecast at a destination where 5G interference is possible,"" the FAA said Sunday.
On Jan. 7, the FAA disclosed the 50 U.S. airports that will have 5G buffer zones, including in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Detroit, Dallas, Philadelphia, Seattle and Miami.
But airlines warn those buffer zones may not be enough to prevent flight disruptions at those airports.

On Thursday, Airports Council International – North America urged a delay 5G implementation to avoid widespread disruption across the U.S air transportation system.
On Friday, the FAA said it would require Boeing 787 operators to take additional precautions when landing on some wet or snowy runways.

723,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 03:25AM ET</span>",Five things to know about Credit Suisse's new chairman Lehmann,"(Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned on Monday following an investigation by the Swiss bank's board into his personal conduct. 
He will be replaced by Axel Lehmann, who joined the Credit Suisse board in October to head its risk committee following a series of scandals.
Here are five facts about Lehmann. 
CROSS-TOWN JOINER
Lehmann, 62, joined Credit Suisse's board in October 2021 to become head of its Risk Committee. He moved from UBS, the Swiss lender which has enjoyed a relatively better recent history than its cross-town rival. 
Lehmann served on UBS's board from 2009 to 2015 before joining its executive ranks. In 2016 he was appointed UBS's chief operating officer, a post he held for two years before becoming jointly president of Personal and Corporate Banking and president of UBS Switzerland between 2018 and 2021.
INSURANCE CAREER
Prior to UBS Lehmann enjoyed a 20-year career in the insurance industry, working briefly at Swiss Life before holding a series of top jobs at Zurich. He was chief executive of the insurer's European and then the North American businesses before becoming Zurich's chief risk officer between 2009 and 2015. 
DIGITAL DEVELOPER
Lehmann was drafted in to Credit Suisse to get its risk management back on course, but his interest in digital may also be tapped by the bank. 
Whilst at UBS he helped establish ""digital factories"" in Zurich to develop and roll out new online platforms for its clients globally. 
He also announced early last year that UBS was to close one in five of its bank branches in Switzerland, as the pandemic shifted the acceleration to online banking. 
SWISS NATIONAL
Lehmann is a Swiss citizen, meaning the lender is breaking a tradition that either its chief executive or chairman is a foreign national, since CEO Thomas Gottstein also comes from Switzerland. 
Lehmann is an adjunct professor at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland where he also gained his PhD.
STRATEGY

Lehmann indicated he is unlikely to ask the bank to change the turnaround course set by Horta-Osorio or Gottstein. 
""The strategy is not under discussion,"" Lehmann told Reuters on Monday, adding that Gottstein was ""absolutely central"" to the bank.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 02:56AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Rate hikes on my mind,"A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni. 
It's been a turbulent start of the year for world markets with the prospect of interest rate hikes in the U.S. starting to skim the froth off global equity valuations and leaving investors wondering for how long the bull run would continue.
Talk about the Federal Reserve turning off the tap on massive stimulus is here to stay but with the earnings season kicking off on Wall Street risk sentiment could find some comfort as corporates report double digit profit increases.
And for the coming week investors will be also spared hawkish speeches from Fed officials now in blackout mode before a policy meeting on Jan 26.
S&P 500 earnings are expected to have grown 23.1% in the last three months of 2021 and STOXX 600 earnings are seen up 48.5%. Yet the bar is high and management teams might find it harder to please markets accustomed to stellar corporate growth.
Shares in most big Wall Street banks fell on disappointing numbers last week, leading to two consecutive weekly losses for the U.S.'s main equity benchmark. Today it will be quieter as Wall Street is closed for Martin Luther King Day.
Meantime, European index futures pointed to slight gains at the open. In Asia, China's central bank unexpectedly cut the borrowing costs of its medium-term loans for the first time since April 2020 to cushion an economic slowdown. And Chinese stocks advanced.

Finally,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio has quit following an internal probe into his personal conduct, raising questions over the embattled lender's new strategy. Its shares rose 2% ahead of the cash market open. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: * China's economy rebounded in 2021 from itspandemic-induced slump but the pace slowed further in Q4 off theback of weak consumption and a property downturn * GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) rejected a 50-billion-pound offer fromUnilever for its consumer goods arm, saying it undervalued thebusiness * ECB speaker: President Christine Lagarde * Davos WEF starts * EU finance ministers meet * German foreign min Baerbock visits Ukraine * UK Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) House prices Jan

727,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 01:40AM ET</span>","Factbox-Spies, lies and chairman's exit: Credit Suisse's scandals","(Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio has resigned https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-group-appoints-axel-lehmann-new-chairman-2022-01-16 after flouting COVID-19 quarantine rules, the bank said on Monday, raising questions over the embattled lender's new strategy as it tries to recover from a string of scandals.
The abrupt move comes less than a year after Horta-Osorio was brought in to clean up the bank's corporate culture marred by its involvement with collapsed investment firm Archegos and insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital.
The scandals in recent years that Switzerland's second largest bank had endured, Horta-Osorio had said after joining, were the gravest he had seen in his career.
Here are the main crises to beset the bank in recent years:
CHAIRMAN EXIT
The personal conduct of Horta-Osorio, who joined in April 2021 from Britain's Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank and was tasked with the job of fixing the bank, has come under scrutiny, with reports he breached COVID-19 quarantine rules https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-credit-suisse-finds-second-breach-covid-19-rules-by-chairman-sources-2021-12-29 twice last year.
The bank said Horta-Osorio resigned following an investigation commissioned by the board https:// 
Board member Axel Lehmann had taken over as chairman with immediate effect, Credit Suisse said.
TUNA BOND FRAUD
Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to defrauding investors https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global over an $850 million loan to Mozambique meant to pay for a tuna fishing fleet and is paying U.S. and British regulators $475 million to settle the case under a deal announced in October.
About $200 million of the loan went in kickbacks to Credit Suisse bankers and Mozambican government officials. The bank was aware of a huge shortfall between the funds raised and the value of boats bought but failed to disclose this to investors when the loan was restructured in 2016, the regulators said.
Credit Suisse also arranged a loan that was kept secret from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). When Mozambique admitted to $1.4 billion in undisclosed loans the IMF pulled its support, sending the southern African country's economy into a tailspin.
ARCHEGOS DEFAULT
Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion when U.S. family office Archegos Capital Management defaulted in March 2021. 
The hedge fund's highly leveraged bets on certain technology stocks backfired and the value of its portfolio with Credit Suisse plummeted.
An independent report https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-posts-78-q2-net-profit-decline-2021-07-29 into the incident slammed the bank's conduct, saying its losses were the result of a fundamental failure of management and control at its investment bank, and its prime brokerage division in particular.
The report said the bank was focused on maximising short-term profits and failed to rein in voracious risk-taking by Archegos, despite numerous warning signals, calling into question the competence of its risk personnel.
GREENSILL FUNDS COLLAPSE
Credit Suisse was forced to freeze $10 billion of supply chain finance funds in March 2021 when British financier Greensill Capital collapsed after losing insurance cover for debt issued against its loans to companies.
The Swiss bank had sold billions of dollars of Greensill's debt to investors, assuring them in marketing material that the high-yield notes were low risk because the underlying credit exposure was fully insured https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-greensill-credit-suisse-idCNL1N2LU0FM.
A number of investors have sued the Swiss bank over the Greensill-linked funds. The bank said on Sept. 27 it had recovered and returned about $6.3 billion to investors but has warned it may struggle to recoup $2.3 billion of the total.
SPYING SCANDAL
Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam was forced to quit https://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-spying-ceo-idUSKBN2010L3 in March 2020 after an investigation found the bank hired private detectives to spy on its former head of wealth management Iqbal Kahn after he left for arch rival UBS. 
Credit Suisse repeatedly played down the episode as an isolated incident.
In October, however, Switzerland's financial regulator (FINMA) said Credit Suisse had misled them about the scale of the spying. It said the bank planned seven different spying operations between 2016 and 2019 and carried out most of them.

In a rare rebuke, it said there were serious organisational shortcomings at Credit Suisse and that the bank had even tried to cover its tracks by doctoring an invoice for surveillance.
In response, Credit Suisse said that it condemned the spying and had taken ""decisive"" steps to improve its governance and strengthen compliance.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A major winter storm slammed much of the eastern United States with snow, ice and high winds on Sunday, causing widespread travel disruptions and power outages on a holiday weekend.
Winter weather alerts stretched more than 1,000 miles (1,609 km) from Alabama to Maine, with the governors of Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina all declaring emergencies due to the storm.
More than 200,000 homes and businesses in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia reported power outages, according to PowerOutage.US, a website tracking power outages.
In North Carolina, where some regions saw record snowfalls, two people died Sunday when they lost control of their car in Raleigh.
The highest snowfall totals were expected along the spine of the Appalachians as well as across the lower Great Lakes.
The storm made its way through the Mid-Atlantic region toward New England on Sunday night, bringing snow that is expected to change to ice, sleet and eventually rain, the National Weather Service said.
In Canada, the storm is forecast to dump between 20-40cm (8-16 inches) of snow through Monday morning over parts of southern and eastern Ontario, the Canadian province that shares part of its border with New York state, the government weather agency, Environment Canada, said.
The inclement weather hits just as Ontario schools were set to reopen for in-person classes on Monday after the winter break was extended because of the highly contagious Omicron coronavirus variant.
More than 3,000 flights within, into or out of the United States were canceled on Sunday, and over 8,000 flights were delayed, according to FlightAware data.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc saw more than 660 flight cancellations. More than 90% of the flights into and out of Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, an American Airlines hub, were canceled, the FlightAware website https://flightaware.com/live/cancelled showed.
American Airlines said it is allowing customers affected by the weather to rebook flights without a fee. 
Toronto, home of Canada's busiest airport, is set to see accumulations of 15 to 20cm of snow. 
This was a long weekend for most people in the United States as Monday is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said on Sunday people should avoid non-essential travel in areas impacted by the storm.
""If you're able tonight and tomorrow morning, stay home and off the roads,"" Kemp said on https://twitter.com/GovKemp/status/1482828779005353984Twitter. ""It's going to be treacherous in a lot of parts of our state.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, with investors digesting the latest economic data from China and what further steps the country will take to spur economic growth.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.29% by 9:28 PM ET (2:28 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.77%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the GDP grew 4% year-on-year and 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter. Industrial production grew 4.3% year-on-year and retail sales grew 1.7% year-on-year in December, while the unemployment rate was at 5.1%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.75%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.69%, with the Bank of Japan handing down its policy decision on Tuesday.
South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.12% while in Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.15%.
U.S. stock and bond markets are closed on Monday for a holiday.
However, China continues to grapple with a real estate downturn, power shortages, and the latest COVID-19 outbreaks. 
Bond yields in Australia and New Zealand climbed after a slide in U.S. Treasuries at the end of the previous week. However, the benchmark 10-year U.S. yield is back up to pre-COVID-19 levels.
China’s outlook, tighter U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy, and the omicron COVID-19 variant are all coloring investor sentiment. The Fed should raise its interest rate by a bigger-than-expected 50 basis points in March 2022 to “restore its credibility”, according to investor Bill Ackman.
Investors are also looking to the earnings season to see whether profits can help slow a retreat in global equities, partly attributable to a slide in U.S. technology shares.
“Given the record inflation backdrop and historically tight labor market, investor focus is on margins; demonstrating pricing power, passing on rising costs to the customer,” Evercore ISI chief equity and quantitative strategist Julian Emanuel said in a note.
Meanwhile, Axel P. Lehmann was named chairman at  Credit Suisse  Group AG (SIX:CSGN).  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corp.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The world's 20 best-performing hedge funds earned $65.4 billion for clients in 2021, setting a new record as stock markets marched higher despite rising prices and coronavirus cases, LCH Investments data show.
As a group, the most successful managers earned more than one third of the $176 billion that all hedge funds made last year, LCH Investments, a fund of funds firm that tracks returns and is part of Edmond de Rothschild group, reported.
The top 20, including brand-name investment firms TCI Fund Management and Citadel, returned an average 10.5% and jointly managed nearly one fifth of the industry's $3.6 trillion in assets, the data show. Their returns, however, lagged broader stock market gains.
The best performers in 2021 topped the $63.5 billion they made in 2020 and 2019's $59.3 billion, despite the Delta and Omicron coronavirus variants and fears the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon have to raise interest rates to tackle spiking prices. 
""The net gains generated by the top 20 managers for their investors ... were the highest ever,"" topping 2020's gains which also set a record, Rick Sopher, LCH's chairman said.
There was a shake-up among the very best performers in 2021 as Chris Hohn's TCI Fund Management earned $9.5 billion and Ken Griffin's Citadel made $8.2 billion for investors to rank as the top two.
2020's breakout winner, Chase Coleman's Tiger Global, which earned $10.4 billion in 2020, posted losses of $1.5 billion in 2021, the data show. Israel Englander's Millennium, which also ranked at the top of the list in 2020 with a $10.2 billion gain, posted a $6.4 billion gain in 2021.
Ray Dalio's Bridgewater, the world's biggest hedge fund, snapped back after a disappointing year of losses in 2020 with a$5.7 billion gain in 2021, the data show.
Daniel Loeb's Third Point, which pursues a range of strategies including activist investing, broke into the top twenty in 2021 with a gain of $3.3 billion.

Representatives for the hedge funds declined to comment.
Even though many firms earned billions, stock oriented hedge funds largely lagged the broader stock market S&P 500 index' 27% gain in 2021. They ""generally did not fully capture the spectacular returns available in equity markets,"" Sopher said, adding ""their low net exposure and a difficult environment for short selling limited their returns.""

Garza Calderon, founder of the organization ""Entrepreneurs for the Fourth National Transformation (E4T),"" said he was interested in inviting other business leaders to form a group of investors to analyze the possible acquisition.
""I perceive a great opportunity to rescue its historical, cultural and financial assets so that they return to the hands of Mexican businessmen,"" Garza Calderon said in a statement shared with Reuters.

Total state aid would not exceed $85 million for all of Israel's carriers and would come in the form of three-year bonds which do not accrue interest, representing a $41 million addition to a similar package in November, the ministries said in a statement.
Israel's airlines - flag carrier El Al Israel Airlines Arkia and Israir - have been hit hard during the pandemic with the country's borders largely closed to foreign tourists since March 2020.
Earlier this month, Israel began admitting vaccinated foreigners, or those who have recovered from COVID-19, from countries deemed medium-risk and ended a so-called ""red list"" of destinations it deemed off-limits to Israeli citizens.
With the Omicron variant pushing infection rates within the general population in Israel to new highs, such restrictions on travel were seen as moot. But still, Omicron has dented travel.
""The spread of Omicron in the world and in Israel has caused a significant drop in the activities of Israeli airlines,"" the statement said. ""The finance and transportation ministries have worked intensively to formulate an additional blueprint to enable those companies to weather the crisis.""

El Al requested $100 million from the government in September as compensation for its strict travel policies. The airline has reported losses for three years and racked up debt to renew its fleet.
It laid off 1,900 employees - nearly one-third of its staff - as part of a recovery plan mandated by the government to receive a $210 million aid package last year, and reduced its fleet to 29 from 45.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The largest satellite provider in the United States said late Friday it will drop One America News, a move that could financially cripple the rightwing TV network known for fueling conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.
The announcement by DirecTV, which is 70% owned by AT&T (NYSE:T), comes three months after a Reuters investigation revealed that OAN’s founder testified that AT&T inspired him to create the network. Court testimony also showed that OAN receives nearly all of its revenue from DirecTV.
To read the Reuters report, click here: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oneamerica-att
The Reuters report drew calls from some liberal groups for AT&T and DirecTV to drop OAN, a favorite of former President Donald Trump, because the network has become a key source of false claims about the election and COVID vaccinations.
On Thursday, President Joe Biden said COVID conspiracy theories are putting lives at risk. “I make a special appeal to social media companies and media outlets: Please deal with the misinformation and disinformation that’s on your shows,” Biden said. “It has to stop.”
OAN is owned by San Diego-based Herring Networks, a family of conservative tech entrepreneurs. CEO Robert Herring Sr did not respond to requests for comment by email and phone. In an interview with Reuters last year, he said his network provided an important voice. “If I think I’m right, I just go for it,” he said.
DirecTV, with approximately 15 million subscribers, is by far OAN’s largest carrier. According to testimony by OAN’s accountant reviewed by Reuters, DirecTV provided 90% of the conservative network’s revenue.
“We informed Herring Networks that, following a routine internal review, we do not plan to enter into a new contract when our current agreement expires,” DirecTV said in a statement.
The OAN-DirecTV contract is set to expire in the next several months. DirecTV began airing OAN in April 2017, a deal that began shortly after OAN and AT&T settled a lawsuit over alleged oral promises during negotiations.
Former President Trump, speaking at a rally in Florence, Arizona, said OAN was targeted because of politics and urged his supporters to think twice about using AT&T's services. ""Maybe what we should do is not use AT&T,"" he said.
On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), some conservatives expressed outrage that DirecTV and AT&T planned to drop OAN. “Corporate Media is crushing what little dissent remains,” tweeted former Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs.
The pro-Trump right, however, has powerful outlets on television and online, including Fox News, the conservative cable news outlet founded by Rupert Murdoch.
Liberals cheered the news. NAACP President Derrick Johnson called it “a victory for us and the future of democracy.” In a statement, Johnson added: “At a time when we are seeing our rights infringed upon, OAN only seeks to create further division. … We must continually choose truth over lies and common sense over hysteria.”
The news also follows a lawsuit filed on December 23 by two Georgia election workers who accused OAN and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani of spreading false vote-rigging claims about them in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. The claims were debunked by state authorities. OAN has denied it has done anything wrong.
DirecTV did not elaborate on why it planned to drop OAN. Earlier, an AT&T spokesman said the company airs “many news channels that offer viewpoints across the political spectrum.”
The Reuters investigative report in October cited sworn statements in which OAN’s founder and his son testified that the inspiration for the conservative network came from AT&T executives.

“They told us they wanted a conservative network,” the elder Herring said during a 2019 deposition. “They only had one, which was Fox News, and they had seven others on the other [leftwing] side. When they said that, I jumped to it and built one.”
During a 2020 court proceeding, a transcript shows, an OAN lawyer told the court, “If Herring Networks, for instance, was to lose or not be renewed on DirecTV, the company would go out of business tomorrow.”

The country's Authority for Consumers and Markets found in a decision published on Dec. 24 that Apple had abused its market position by requiring dating app developers, including Tinder owner  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH), to exclusively use Apple's in-app payment system.
Apple's practice of requiring developers to use its system and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases has come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world, but the Dutch ruling applies only in the Netherlands and only for dating apps.
In a post on its developers' blog on Saturday, Apple said it would comply with the decision and introduce ""two optional new entitlements exclusively applicable to dating apps on the Netherlands App Store that provide additional payment processing options for users"".

However it noted that developers were not required to use the non-Apple tools, and warned that Apple would not be able to help with safety or refunds of payments that take place outside its systems because it will ""not be directly aware of them"".
Apple is appealing the Dutch decision.

The move is part of a plan to attract fast growing technology firms to list in Britain in the wake of Brexit, the Journal said. 
Private company shares would trade publicly between one and five days in each trading window, once a month or quarter, or every six months, the report added, citing proposals seen by the Journal from the LSE to its regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority, and the U.K. Treasury.
The companies would not be subject to the same degree of regulatory oversight as a fully listed company, requirements that startup company founders say are deterrents to listing shares, the Journal said.
A spokesperson for the London Stock Exchange Group said in a statement to Reuters the company works closely with government, regulators and stakeholders on various issues.
""LSEG agree there is potential for additional routes to market to support the widest range of companies through their funding lifecycle including helping them transition from the private to the public markets and indeed back again,"" the spokesperson added. 
The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. A spokesperson for the FCA declined to comment.

The Journal said the LSE wrote in the document it sent to the FCA and Treasury on Dec. 21 that ""the new venue type would act as a stepping-stone between private and fully public markets."" It ""should be seen as improving on the current options available to companies seeking to raise capital without imposing regulation that will inhibit growth.""

743,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2022 01:21PM ET</span>",GSK rejects 50-billion-pound Unilever offer for consumer assets,"By Siddharth Cavale, Ludwig Burger and Mrinmay Dey
(Reuters) -GlaxoSmithKline on Saturday said it had rejected a 50-billion-pound offer from Unilever (NYSE:UL) for its consumer goods arm, saying it ""fundamentally undervalued"" the business and its future prospects and that it would stick to its plan of spinning off the unit.
Unilever confirmed the approach earlier on Saturday, saying the Glaxo unit would be a ""strong strategic fit"" as it continues to re-shape its portfolio spanning food, beauty and home care brands.
A deal of this size would be the biggest globally since the start of the pandemic, if it goes through. It could also transform Unilever into a formidable beauty and personal care purveyor, taking on the likes of  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) and L'Oreal, while for GSK, it could bring much needed relief from investor pressure that has been building over the past year. 
GSK said it had received three bids from Unilever, the latest on Dec. 20 comprising 41.7 billion pounds in cash and 8.3 billion pounds in Unilever shares, which failed to reflect the intrinsic value of the business and its potential.
""The Board of GSK therefore remains focused on executing its proposed demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business ... on track to be achieved in mid-2022,"" the statement said, adding that it was confident the business would beat global market growth rates in the medium term.
The group's consumer goods business is due to be spun out into a separate listing in the middle of this year.
Earlier, Britain's Sunday Times said the Unilever bid for the business made late last year was worth roughly 50 billion pounds, and had been rejected as too low by GSK and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which owns a minority stake in the division.
The approach by Unilever, which owns brands such as Dove soap and Marmite, for Glaxo's portfolio of household brands including Panadol painkillers and Sensodyne toothpaste was understood to have been unsolicited, the report added.
The bid did not include any takeover premium or recognition of synergies, the newspaper said, adding that it was not clear whether the group would make a higher offer.
Dave Lewis, who is due to head GSK's consumer health unit, declined to comment on the approach. The former boss of UK grocer Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) said the matter was for GSK's board. 
Unilever declined to comment on whether it would return with a higher bid. ""There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached."" Brokerage Jefferies last year put a valuation for the whole consumer unit at 45 billion pounds.
If a deal goes through, GSK's consumer health unit's brands would likely be incorporated into Unilever's Beauty and Personal Care business, its biggest by sales. 
Performance in the unit, which sells Dove, Lifebuoy, Axe and Vaseline, has been tepid during the pandemic as fewer people venture out or attend social occasions, while higher costs of plastics and petrochemicals have also dented margins. 
In its most recent quarter, Beauty and Personal care volumes fell 1.3% while prices rose 3.9%. 
INVESTOR PRESSURE 
Unilever's Chief Executive Alan Jope is under pressure to turn around its languishing stock price as it struggles to compete in the face of high inflationary costs, especially in emerging markets, its biggest source of revenue.
The FTSE-listed conglomerate's stock has fallen 10% over the past year compared with P&G's 18% rise and Reckitt's 1.4% decline, despite a pandemic-driven boost in shopping for groceries and household goods that has benefited all three companies. 
British fund manager Terry Smith, whose Fundsmith vehicle is a top-10 Unilever investor, this week criticized the group for promoting sustainability credentials at the expense of performance.
Since taking over from Paul Polman as CEO in 2019, Jope has laid out a vision for Unilever called ""brands with purpose"", a socially conscious strategy that would see the company focus investments and marketing on brands that ""communicate a strong environmental or social purpose"" even at the cost of profit.
""A company which feels it has to define the purpose of Hellmann’s mayonnaise has in our view clearly lost the plot. The Hellmann’s brand has existed since 1913 so we would guess that by now consumers have figured out its purpose (spoiler alert — salads and sandwiches),"" Smith said.
Smith was not immediately available to comment.
Jope, however, has kept to his promise of streamlining the company. The company sold a majority of its Tea business, including Pukka Tea and PGTips to CVC Capital partners for $5 billion late last year and has been looking to offload a portfolio of slow growing beauty brands. 
Investor activism has also reared its head at GSK.
In April last year, U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management revealed a multi-billion pound stake in GSK, putting pressure on CEO Emma Walmsley to explore a shake-up of the company after it fell behind in the COVID-19 vaccine race. 
Fledgling activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners, fresh off its success in ousting the CEO of Danone last year, also took a stake in GSK in September, making demands including asking Walmsley to re-apply for her job, citing a lack of scientific expertise. 
BIG DEAL FOR JOPE
For Unilever, the deal would be the biggest move for Jope since becoming CEO in 2019. 
He has previously shot down suggestions that Unilever was in the market for big deals, saying instead that the company would focus on smaller acquisitions in fast-growing areas such as luxury beauty, plant-based foods and health and wellness. 
If a deal with GSK does go through, it will be Unilever's second with the company after it bought its health food drinks business, including Horlicks, in India and other Asian markets for 3.3 billion euros in 2018.
The consumer remedies industry, which has traditionally been attached to the prescription drug sector, is also in a phase of major transformation as several pharma companies no longer see a benefit in a combination. 

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in November unveiled plans to spin off its consumer health division, owner of the Listerine and Baby Powder brands, to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) has said its consumer unit would become “standalone” business.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's Reliance Industries, Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group-backed Ola Electric and automaker Mahindra & Mahindra have submitted bids under the country's $2.4 billion battery scheme, the government said on Saturday. 
India last year finalised https:// an incentive program to encourage companies to invest in the local manufacturing of batteries as it looks to establish a domestic supply chain for clean transport and build storage for renewable energy.
Hyundai Global Motors, engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro, and battery makers Amara Raja and Exide have also submitted bids, the Ministry of Heavy Industries said.
""The program envisages an investment which will boost domestic manufacturing ... and foreign direct investment in the country,"" the ministry said. 
India wants to establish a total of 50 gigawatt hours (Gwh) of battery storage capacity over five years, which it expects will attract direct investment of about $6 billion.
To qualify for the incentives, companies must set up at least 5 Gwh of storage capacity and meet certain local content conditions, all of which would require a minimum investment of more than $850 million.
Ten companies have submitted bids totalling about 130 Gwh, the ministry said.
India was also encouraging global companies https://reut.rs/3ntv4K3 such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Samsung (KS:005930), LG Energy, Northvolt and Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) to invest. 

Clean auto technology is a key part of India's strategy for cutting pollution in major cities and reducing oil dependence. But electric vehicles (EVs) currently make up a fraction of total sales in the country mainly due to their high price as batteries are imported. 
The South Asian country wants electric cars to make up 30% of private car sales by 2030 and for electric motorcycles and scooters to make up 40% of such sales, driving demand for batteries which currently contribute about 35% to 40% of the total vehicle cost.

Investing.com – The rotation to value from growth stocks has staying power as the sector can count on a powerful ally: A Federal Reserve desperate to rein in inflation.
The Invesco S&P 500 Pure Value exchange-traded fund has racked up gains of about 7% this year, while S&P 500 Growth Index is down about 5% year to date fuelled by bets a rising interest rate environment will hurt sectors of the market with longer-term cash flow horizons like tech, or growth stocks.
Unlike previous rotations to value, which just last year proved to be fleeting, the current rotation has staying power as the Fed’s “narrative has changed dramatically,” Johan Grahn, Head of ETF Strategy at Allianz told Investing.com in an interview earlier this week.
In the space of a few months, the Fed has moved on from “not even thinking about thinking about raising rates,” ditched “transitory” from its inflation vocabulary, and laid out the red carpet for policy normalization.
“Last year, the Fed was talking about potentially taking a little action in 2022, but it was really thinking about only doing something in 2023. But now the Fed is signalling that we're going to do everything we can as soon as we can,” Grahn added.
“The rotation into value is more likely to stick around than it was last year, based on what the Fed is signalling and what we're seeing in the bond market,” he added.
Hot debate has broken out on Wall Street about what exactly the new normal for the Fed will look like. A rate hike in March followed by several more hikes to take the Fed funds terminal rate to 2.5% by 2024? The start of quantitative tightening, or a balance sheet runoff starting in July?
While the guessing game on “normal” will continue for some time, there is no doubt that the Fed is having to play catch up, and may have to move faster on policy tightening as its tools are blunt to combat supply-driven inflation.
“Inflation is going to be hanging over our heads for a longer period of time and I think that the Fed is going to have no choice but to continue to move their rates up,” according to Grahn.  “I happen to believe that they might move in a faster pace.”
“The consensus now is for rate hikes of about 25 basis points per quarter, but at some point, I wouldn't be surprised if they said we're going to hike by 50 basis points ... that will trigger a quick rotation in value again.”"

OAN, which rose to prominence amid the triumph and tumult of the administration of then-President Donald Trump, has been criticized for spreading conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election.
""We informed Herring Networks that, following a routine internal review, we do not plan to enter into a new contract when our current agreement expires,"" a DirecTV spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
AT&T (NYSE:T) has a 70% stake in DirecTV, after last year spinning off the satellite service, now an independently managed company. The U.S. telecommunications company entered into a deal with Herring Networks Inc in 2017, which included OAN and a little-watched lifestyle channel, AWE. DirecTV began carrying the networks in April that year.
OAN and Herring Networks could not immediately be reached for comment outside business hours.
AT&T has been a crucial source of funds for OAN, providing tens of millions of dollars in revenue, a Reuters investigation found last year. Ninety percent of OAN's revenue came from a contract with AT&T-owned television platforms, including DirecTV, according to 2020 sworn testimony by an OAN accountant.

DirecTV's contract expires in early April, according to Bloomberg News, which earlier reported the development.

In an essay in the ruling Communist Party's publication Qiushi on Saturday, Xi called for focusing on key areas including integrated circuits, displays, communications equipment and intelligent hardware.
China should ""cultivate a number of enterprises with international competitiveness, and leading ecological firms with control over industrial chains, to create world-class digital industry clusters,"" he said.
""We must see that compared with large and powerful countries in the global digital economy, China's digital economy is big but not strong, and fast but not superior.""
Xi also called for regulation and standardisation to plug regulatory loopholes and prevent ""monopolies and disorderly expansion of capital"" in the world's second largest economy. 
""In the course of rapid development, China's digital economy has also displayed some unhealthy and irregular seeds and trends that not only affect the healthy development of the digital economy, but violate laws and regulations and pose a threat to national economic and financial security,"" he said.
China should also improve its national security system, with a focus on strengthening digital economy early warning, prevention and control systems to ensure the security of key technologies, important industries and facilities, strategic resources, and leading enterprises. 

Xi's essay follows a plan issued by China's cabinet on Wednesday for the development of the digital economy, which aims to increase the sector's share of national GDP by pushing technologies like 6G and big data centers.
That plan also highlighted challenges including a lack of innovation capacity in key areas and weak governance.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India, which has among the world's deadliest roads, on Saturday proposed mandating at least six air bags in all passenger cars manufactured from Oct. 1.
The government wants automakers to provide two side air bags and two curtain air bags, to protect those seated in the rear seats, in addition to the already required two air bags for all vehicles.
The side air bags are to ""help mitigate primarily torso injury"" during a side crash, while the curtain air bags would ""deploy in a side impact crash or roll over to help mitigate primarily head injury"", the ministry of road transport said in a notification. 
The draft rules are designed to bring down the fatalities on Indian roads. In 2020, nearly 132,000 people died in more than 366,000 road accidents, according to government data.

The additional air bags would increase the cost of vehicles in India's price-sensitive market, where most cars sell for less $10,000. The low-cost car market is dominated by Maruti Suzuki, majority owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor, and Hyundai Motor. 
The government is inviting comments from companies and the public over the next 30 days, after which the draft rules will be finalised.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -AT&T Inc led bidders in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 5G spectrum auction of 3.45 GHz band spectrum, winning $9 billion in bids, the U.S. regulator said on Friday.
The auction generated proceeds of $22.5 billion in total, the FCC said. T-Mobile won $2.9 billion while Weminuche LLC won $7.3 billion, which some analysts and FCC documents suggest bid on behalf of Dish. Dish, which did not immediately comment Friday, confirmed in November it had filed to participate in the auction.
AT&T (NYSE:T) declined to comment.
U.S. Cellular won $580 million in bids.

The FCC said over one-third of the top 100 markets have at least four winning bidders, a broader ranger than a prior auction. The broader range and distribution of winning bidders ""will increase competition by providing a diversity of wireless carriers with the midband spectrum resources needed to maintain American leadership in 5G,"" it said. 
""Enabling commercial use of this spectrum is important to America’s continuing economic recovery and 5G leadership,"" FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Multiple states have begun investigating potential violations in how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), now known as Meta Platforms Inc, runs its virtual-reality Oculus business, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
Two of the sources said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was also involved in the antitrust investigation. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
New York, North Carolina and Tennessee were among the states involved in the inquiry, one source said. A group of almost 50 states also asked an appeals court on Friday to reinstate their antitrust lawsuit, filed in December 2020, against Facebook.
The inquiries into Facebook's Oculus business are part of the larger probe, one of the sources said.

""Facebook is a monopolist that has exploited its immense market power to crush competition. Through an ongoing course of conduct to 'buy or bury' nascent competitors, Facebook has maintained a monopoly that harms its users and the public at large,"" wrote lawyers for New York and other states in a filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc said the states were wrong to ask for the district court dismissal to be reversed. ""There are no grounds for overturning that decision in the court of appeals,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.
New York Attorney General Letitia James said Facebook was bad for consumers. ""Time and again, the social media giant has used its market dominance to force small companies out of business and reduce competition for millions of users,"" she said.
The group, made up of 46 states, Guam and the District of Columbia, argued that U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of the District of Columbia erred in ruling they had waited too long to file the lawsuit.
They argued that states are allowed delays that private plaintiffs are not. They also argued that if the court determined they did wait too long, states are allowed deference that others are not because of their role in protecting the public interest.
Boasberg had also thrown out a related Federal Trade Commission complaint against Facebook in June but allowed the agency to refile the case. It did so, and Boasberg said this week the case would be allowed to go forward.

Both the FTC and the states had asked the court in 2020 to order Facebook to sell Instagram, which it bought for $1 billion in 2012, and WhatsApp, which it bought for $19 billion in 2014.
The lawsuits followed years of investigation of the four biggest U.S. tech giants, as well as lawsuits against Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 06:51PM ET</span>",U.S. grocery shortages deepen as pandemic dries supplies,"By Siddharth Cavale and Christopher Walljasper
(Reuters) - High demand for groceries combined with soaring freight costs and Omicron-related labor shortages are creating a new round of backlogs at processed food and fresh produce companies, leading to empty supermarket shelves at major retailers across the United States.
Growers of perishable produce across the West Coast are paying nearly triple pre-pandemic trucking rates to ship things like lettuce and berries before they spoil. Shay Myers, CEO of Owyhee Produce, which grows onions, watermelons and asparagus along the border of Idaho and Oregon, said he has been holding off shipping onions to retail distributors until freight costs go down. 
Myers said transportation disruptions in the last three weeks, caused by a lack of truck drivers and recent highway-blocking storms, have led to a doubling of freight costs for fruit and vegetable producers, on top of already-elevated pandemic prices. ""We typically will ship, East Coast to West Coast – we used to do it for about $7,000,"" he said. ""Today it’s somewhere between $18,000 and $22,000.""
Birds Eye frozen vegetables maker Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG)' CEO Sean Connolly told investors last week that supplies from its U.S. plants could be constrained for at least the next month due to Omicron-related absences.
Earlier this week, Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said he expects the supermarket chain to confront more supply chain challenges over the next four to six weeks as Omicron has put a dent in its efforts to plug supply chain gaps. 
Shoppers on social media complained of empty pasta and meat aisles at some Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stores; a Meijer store in Indianapolis was swept bare of chicken; a Publix in Palm Beach, Florida was out of bath tissue and home hygiene products while Costco (NASDAQ:COST) reinstated purchase limits on toilet paper at some stores in Washington state. 
The situation is not expected to abate for at least a few more weeks, Katie Denis, vice president of communications and research at the Consumer Brands Association said, blaming the shortages on a scarcity of labor.
The consumer-packaged goods industry is missing around 120,000 workers out of which only 1,500 jobs were added last month, she said, while the National Grocer’s Association said that many of its grocery store members were operating with less than 50% of their workforce capacity. 
U.S. retailers are now facing roughly 12% out of stock levels on food, beverages, household cleaning and personal hygiene products compared to 7-10% in regular times. 
The problem is more acute with food products where out of stock levels are running at 15%, the Consumer Brands Association said. 
SpartanNash, a U.S. grocery distributor, last week said it has become harder to get supplies from food manufacturers, especially processed items like cereal and soup. 
Consumers have continued to stock up on groceries as they hunker down at home to curb the spread of the Omicron-variant. Denis said demand over the last five months has been as high or higher than it had been in March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic. Similar issues are being seen in other parts of the world. 
In Australia, grocery chain operator Woolworths Group, said last week that more than 20% of employees at its distribution centers are off work because of COVID-19. In the stores, the virus has put at least 10% of staff out of action. 
The company, on Thursday, reinstated a limit of two packs per customer across toilet paper and painkillers nationwide both in-store and online to deal with the staffing shortage. 
In the U.S., recent snow and ice storms that snared traffic for hours along the East Coast also hampered food deliveries bound for grocery stores and distribution hubs. Those delays rippled across the country, delaying shipment on fruit and vegetables with a limited shelf life.

While growers with perishable produce are forced to pay inflated shipping rates to attract limited trucking supplies, producers like Myers are choosing to wait for backlogs to ease.
""The canned goods, the sodas, the chips – those things sat, because they weren’t willing to pay double, triple the freight, and their stuff doesn’t go bad in four days,"" he said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Netflix Inc has raised its monthly subscription price by $1 to $2 per month in the United States depending on the plan, the company said on Friday, to help pay for new programming to compete in the crowded streaming TV market.
The standard plan, which allows for two simultaneous streams, now costs $15.49 per month, up from $13.99, in the United States. 
Prices also rose in Canada, where the standard plan climbed to C$16.49 from C$14.99.
Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) gained nearly 3% to $533.84 on Nasdaq after Reuters broke the news of the price rises. They closed 1.3% higher at $525.69.
The increases, the first in those markets since October 2020, took effect immediately for new customers. Existing members will see the new prices in the coming weeks when they receive their monthly bills. 
""We understand people have more entertainment choices than ever and we’re committed to delivering an even better experience for our members,"" a Netflix spokesperson said. 
""We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options. As always we offer a range of plans so members can pick a price that works for their budget,"" the spokesperson added.
The world's largest streaming service is facing the most competition ever from companies looking to attract viewers to online entertainment. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are among the rivals pouring billions into new programming.
Netflix has added customers despite prior price increases, which shows its members have been willing to accept higher costs, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney said.
""This is evidence that Netflix has pricing power,"" Mahaney said. 
Netflix had said it would spend $17 billion on programming in 2021. The company has not disclosed spending for 2022.
The U.S. price of Netflix's premium plan, which enables four streams at a time and streaming in ultra HD, was increased by $2 to $19.99 per month. For Netflix's basic plan, with one stream, the cost rose by $1 to $9.99 per month. 
In Canada, the premium plan rose by C$2 to C$20.99, and the basic plan was unchanged at C$9.99. 
At $15.49 per month, the standard U.S. plan from Netflix now costs more than competitors. HBO Max, owned by AT&T Inc, is currently offering an $11.99-a-month promotion for 12 months. 
The price of Walt Disney Co's Disney+ is $7.99 a month or $79.99 a year.
The United States and Canada is Netflix's largest region with 74 million streaming customers as of September 2021. The region accounted for nearly 44% of the company's revenue in 2021's third quarter, or about $3.3 billion. 
Most of the company's recent pickup in subscribers has come from overseas.

Netflix's subscriber growth slowed from a boom early in the COVID-19 pandemic but rebounded with help from global phenomenon ""Squid Game,"" a dystopian thriller from South Korea released in September. Total global subscriptions reached 213.6 million.
The company's next subscriber report is due Thursday when Netflix posts quarterly earnings. Analysts project the company will report 8.5 million new sign-ups from October through December, according to  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) I/B/E/S data, bringing its global subscriber base to 222 million.

(Reuters) - The Dow closed lower on Friday with a big drag from financial stocks as investors were disappointed by fourth quarter results from big U.S. banks, which cast a shadow over the earnings season kick-off.
The Nasdaq and the S&P regained lost ground in afternoon trading to close higher. Meanwhile the consumer discretionary stocks put pressure on the indexes throughout the session after morning data showed a December decline in retail sales and a souring of consumer sentiment.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) tumbled after reporting weaker performance at its trading arm. The bellwether lender also warned that soaring inflation, the looming threat of Omicron and trading revenues would challenge industry growth in coming months.
Along with JPMorgan, big decliners putting pressure on the Dow included financial stocks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and home improvement retailer  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD).
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) shares fell after it reported a 26% drop in fourth-quarter profit, while asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) fell 2.2% after missing quarterly revenue expectations.
The S&P 500 bank subsector, which hit an intraday high in the previous session, closed down 1.7%. The sector has been outperforming the S&P recently as investors bet the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate hikes will boost bank profits. 
""The bar was very high going into (JPMorgan) results. On the surface it was good but, under the hood, not so much,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. In the interest rate hiking cycle expected this year ""positioning was very crowded on the long side"" going into the earnings season. 
For consumer stock weakness, James pointed to ""clearly disappointing"" retail sales, which dropped 1.9% last month due to shortages of goods and an explosion of COVID-19 infections. Separate data showed soaring inflation hit U.S. consumer sentiment in January, pushing it to its second lowest level in a decade.
Retail sales and bank loan growth raised doubts about the economic outlook for the current quarter and 2022 for Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta. 
""The question is, does the economy have enough strength to get through the risk Omicron brings as fiscal and monetary stimulus is rolling off,"" Buchanan said. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 201.81 points, or 0.56%, to 35,911.81, the S&P 500 gained 3.82 points, or 0.08%, to 4,662.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 86.94 points, or 0.59%, to 14,893.75.
For the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.3% while the Dow fell 0.9% and the Nasdaq fell 0.3%. 
At the end of the session, four out of eleven S&P sectors gained ground with energy leading gains. 
An afternoon rally pushed the Nasdaq and the S&P to closing gains with help from rate-sensitive growth sectors with technology closing up 0.89% and communications services adding 0.53%.
""There's clearly some bargain hunting going on in technology today,"" said Wedbush's James. 
Analysts see S&P 500 companies earnings rising 23.1% in the fourth quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
One bright spot in the bank sector on Friday, however, was  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which rallied after posting a bigger-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter profit.
 Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) rallied 14.2% while Melco Resorts advanced 16.6% and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) closed up 8.6% after Macau's government capped the number of new casino operators allowed to operate to six with an operating period of up to 10 years. 
U.S. stock markets will remain shut on Monday for the public holiday in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 570 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges, 10.74 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.34 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

(Reuters) -Johnson & Johnson on Friday said it had agreed to pay $44 million to resolve claims that it fueled the opioid epidemic in New Mexico, a state which originally opted against participating in a nationwide settlement resolving thousands of similar cases.
The New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based drugmaker said the $44 million was consistent with the terms of a proposal for J&J (NYSE:JNJ) and drug distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) to pay up to $26 billion to resolve the cases nationally.
New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, initially declined to take part in those settlements but last month said his state would participate in the distributors' $21 billion deal. He did not join J&J's $5 billion deal at that time.
Under Friday's accord, J&J agreed to pay New Mexico its share of the nationwide settlement in 2022, rather than over several years, if all of the state's local governments signed on by May 31.
""Opioids have destroyed families in New Mexico, and local communities and addiction professionals still need vital funding to save lives and fight this ongoing tragic epidemic,"" Balderas said in a statement.
J&J did not admit wrongdoing and in a statement said it appropriately marketed its pain medications.
More than 3,300 lawsuits, largely by state and local governments, are pending, seeking to hold those and other companies responsible for an opioid abuse crisis that has led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths.
How much of the $26 billion the companies ultimately must pay and how much outstanding litigation they will face depends on state and local government participation.

Settlement supporters have extended https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-drug-distributors-extend-deadline-state-subdivisions-join-opioid-settlement-2021-12-22 to Jan. 26 a deadline for cities and counties in states that backed the proposal to opt-in to the deals, citing the potential for more states to join. 
Nevada and Georgia agreed this month https://www.reuters.com/world/us/georgia-reverses-course-joins-26-billion-us-opioid-settlement-2022-01-07 to settle with the companies. Six states have not settled with some or all of the four companies.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 06:00PM ET</span>",JPMorgan shares fall as mixed outlook sours profit beat,"By Anirban Sen and Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase & Co posted fourth-quarter profit ahead of market expectations on Friday, but its shares fell as much as 6% as analysts expressed disappointment over its forecasts for future profitability.
The country's largest bank warned that its return on tangible capital equity (ROTCE), a key metric which measures how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profit, may fall below its medium-term target of 17% this year.
A slowdown in capital markets activity, the cost of investing in the business, including new technology and branch openings, and rising expenses due in part to higher inflation and labor costs, were some of the factors the bank cited as headwinds in the coming year.
However, it retained a medium-term target for 17% ROTCE beyond 2022, saying it expected to benefit from rising interest rates and the longer-term growth of businesses resulting from its investments.
That guidance disappointed some analysts and investors. Shares in JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which had enjoyed a strong run leading up to the results, were down 5% in mid-morning trading, the biggest faller among U.S. banking stocks.
The bank reported a 14% drop in fourth quarter profit compared with a year ago, reflecting a decline in trading revenues. The previous year had benefited from increased trading activity, as the Federal Reserve's stimulus measures produced more liquidity in equity and fixed income markets.
The Fed began scaling back its asset purchases in November 2021, resulting in lower trading volumes. 
Markets revenues fell by 11% during the quarter. Fixed income markets revenue was down 16% with equity markets revenue 2% lower. 
That slowdown was only partially offset by a stellar performance at JPMorgan's investment bank, where revenue rose 28% and a 6% increase in loan growth across the firm.
Over the past year, large U.S. lenders benefited from higher consumer spending and a surge in deal-making driven by loose monetary policy, while their trading arms gained from exceptional volatility in financial markets.
However, soaring inflation, a potential Omicron-induced economic slowdown and trading revenues returning to normal levels are set to challenge the banking industry's growth in the coming months.
JPMorgan's Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum faced tough questions from analysts on a conference call after the results.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo expressed frustration that the bank was unable to achieve its ROTCE target this year and over the length of time it will take for investments to feed through to the bottom line.
""You're saying we have to wait two years for the 17% ROTCE despite the booming economy,"" Mayo said. ""You're in there for the long term but a lot of investors aren't planning to invest for a 10-year horizon.""
Dimon responded, ""I feel your pain and frustration. It is very possible in 2023 we'll have a 17% ROTCE. It depends on how we deploy our capital, on fixed income markets, a bunch of stuff.""
EXPENSES SPIRAL
Analysts also expressed concern about spiraling expenses.
During the quarter, non-interest expense jumped 11% to nearly $18 billion, driven largely by higher staff compensation.
Banks are facing cutthroat competition to hire and are being forced to pay more to recruit and keep talent. [L1N2TU1LW]
""We want to be very, very competitive on pay,"" Dimon said. ""If that squeezes margins so be it.""
During the quarter, JPMorgan maintained its position as the second-biggest provider of worldwide M&A advisory after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), according to Refinitiv. The league tables rank financial services firms by the amount of M&A fees they generate.
Barnum said JPMorgan expects a ""modest normalization"" in investment banking revenue in 2022, but added that the overall deals pipeline remains healthy. 

On the slowdown in trading, Barnum said the bank expects some normalization this year but still expects revenue to remain above 2019 levels.
Overall, the lender posted a profit of $10.4 billion, or $3.33 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts had estimated $3.01 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Anyone who comes into Google's U.S. work sites will require a negative test and be required to wear surgical-grade masks while at the office, the company said. 
""To help prevent the further spread of COVID-19 during this period of heightened risk, we’re implementing new temporary health and safety measures for anyone accessing our sites in the U.S.,"" a Google spokesperson said. 
Google provides free at-home and in-person testing options to its employees, their dependants and household members.
The temporary policy of weekly testing comes as cases of the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surge in the country.

Last month, Google said it was delaying its return-to-office plan globally from January amid growing concerns over Omicron.
Google, which was one of the first companies to ask its employees to work from home during the pandemic, had told its employees they would lose pay and eventually be fired if they do not follow its COVID-19 vaccination rules, according to a CNBC report in December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. households can order four free at-home COVID-19 tests from the website COVIDTests.gov starting on Jan. 19 with shipping expected within seven to 12 days of ordering, the White House said on Friday.
The batch of free tests are aimed at easing a shortage of COVID-19 tests across the country amid increased demand during the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.
The U.S. government has contracted already for more than 420 million tests, the White House said. 
President Joe Biden has pledged to procure 1 billion free tests for Americans, and more may be ordered in the future. ""We're not saying we're stopping there,"" one senior administration official told reporters on a conference call.
The administration also plans to launch a phone line for people who do not have access to the web to order tests.
Once ordered, the tests will ship to U.S. households by the U.S. Postal Service. Each household is limited to four masks.
American Postal Workers Union President Mark Dimondstein said the union had agreed to allow the USPS to use up to 7,000 temporary workers to label and package the test kits at 43 existing facilities. Many of those are holiday workers being held over for the project.
The kits could be mailed to as many as 160 million U.S. addresses, Dimondstein said. The USPS has already brought in some labeling machines. “We’re off and running,” Dimondstein said.
The Biden administration has contracted for more than 420 million tests and additional contracts will be awarded over the coming weeks, the White House said. It expects to pay some $4 billion to cover the first 500 million tests Biden promised, the administration official said.

Fighting the pandemic is one of Biden's top priorities and its persistence, coupled with fatigue among the public, has hurt his approval ratings roughly a year after he took office promising to do a better job of taming the virus than his predecessor, former President Donald Trump.
Critics have said that while the administration focused its attention on getting Americans vaccinated, it did not do enough to encourage mask-wearing and spur testing, a deficit the White House has seemed to try to address with the at-home test deliveries and a pledge to get more masks out to the public as well.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stock markets stumbled again on Friday and U.S. Treasury yields climbed as cautious investors worried about how imminent U.S. interest rate hikes would affect the economy.
A warning from the largest U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) that its profitability may fall below a medium-term target cast another pall on Wall Street.
By early evening, MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe had shed 0.36%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 1.01% and had its worst week since Nov. 26, weighed in part by declines in technology stocks. (EU)
In the United States, a spate of bargain hunting toward the end of the day helped stocks to narrow losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.56%, the S&P 500 ended flat, and the Nasdaq Composite flipped into the black, rising 0.59%. [.N]
""We are now entering a period where the Federal Reserve will engage in a never-before-seen experiment: raising interest rates off zero and reducing the size of its balance sheet in the same year,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. 
""The market is still left wondering what results will come from their decisions,"" Colas said.
In line with expectations of rising rates, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields jumped to 1.7859%, rebounding toward a two-year high of 1.8080% struck earlier this week. Two-year Treasury yields hit a high of 0.9730%, a level last seen in February last 2020. [US/]
European bond yields also rose in choppy trade as investors focused on monetary policy tightening by central banks, though sharp falls in Germany's benchmark 10-year yield earlier this week led it to notch its biggest weekly fall in 10 weeks. [GVD/EUR]
Meanwhile, in Asia, the five-year Japanese government bond yield jumped to its highest since January 2016 and the yen rose after a Reuters report that Bank of Japan policymakers are debating how soon they can start an eventual interest rate hike.
Such a move could come even before inflation hits the bank's 2% target, sources said.
The dollar, which has been slugged by a three-day selling spree as investors bet that expectations of rate rises are already priced into the currency, finally steadied on Friday.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, bounced 0.34% to 95.167, pulling away further from a two-month low hit this week. [USD/]
A bounce in the dollar dragged on the euro, which lost 0.34% to 1.14135.
Sterling also slipped 0.22% to 1.36780, taking a breather after this week's rally that pushed it to a 2-1/2-month high. 
GDP data on Friday showed that Britain's economy grew faster than expected in November and its output finally surpassed its level before the country went into its first COVID-19 lockdown.
Asian shares had fallen overnight after Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Thursday became the most senior central banker to indicate the Fed will hike rates in March.
Other Fed officials have shown their willingness to raise rates, after data this week showed U.S. consumer prices surged 7% year-on-year.
Bucking the weakness in equity markets, oil futures rose again, on course for a fourth weekly gain, boosted by supply constraints. [O/R]
Brent crude futures rallied 1.9% to a two-and-a-half month high of $86.44 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude jumped 2.6% to $84.28. Both Brent and U.S. futures entered overbought territory for the first time since late October.

""It’s clearly the impact of monetary policy tightening that’s being felt in markets here,"" said Guillaume Paillat, multi-asset portfolio manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.

Paillat, who is expecting at least four Fed rate hikes this year, said it was ""pretty much a done deal"" that the tightening cycle would start in March.
""What matters over the coming days is going to be more about earnings,"" he added. ""There’s still a bit of room for earnings to surprise to the upside.""

763,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 04:20PM ET</span>",Citigroup results show restructuring has its costs,"By David Henry and Niket Nishant
(Reuters) -Citigroup Inc displayed some of the financial bruises required for its current restructuring as it reported a 26% drop in fourth-quarter profit on Friday.
The bank said results were depressed by $1.1 billion in after-tax expenses for its ongoing divestitures of consumer banking businesses outside of the United States.
The lender has been shedding the last of its non-U.S. consumer businesses as part of a ""strategy refresh"" started by Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser, who took the helm in March.
Operating expenses were up 18% from a year earlier with the charges but still up 8% for its ongoing businesses.
It has also spent more in the past few quarters to fix issues regulators identified in its controls systems, leading to questions from investors on how much money and time the remedies will require. 
The bank said this week it would wind down its massive consumer bank in Mexico and earlier on Friday announced the sale of its retail arms in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam to Singapore-based lender United Overseas Bank (OTC:UOVEY).
Fraser said the decision on the Mexico business is the last big move to come from the new strategy which will focus more tightly on  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s institutional businesses. 
She said the Mexico business is ""a jewel,"" but for someone else. [L1N2TU28H]
""Our vision for Citi is to be the pre-eminent bank for institutions with cross-border needs,"" Fraser told analysts, adding that it also aims to be a ""global leader in wealth, a major player in consumer payments and lending in the home market.""
""It's simplified, more focused,"" she said.
Citigroup's costs have also risen due to a battle for talent on Wall Street that has prompted global banks to offer perks like higher pay and bonuses. 
""We have seen some pressure in what one has to pay to attract talent,"" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on a post-earnings call with reporters. 
The higher costs pushed down the bank's profit to $3.2 billion, or $1.46 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $4.3 billion, or $1.92 per share, a year earlier.
The profit drop had sent the company's shares down as much as 3.5% in early trading, but they pared losses after CFO Mason confirmed that company would resume share buybacks as planned.
The stock closed down 1.2% on Friday.
Citi had suspended buybacks in the fourth quarter to build capital ahead of charges for shutting down its Korean consumer business and the impact of a new rule on capital for derivatives risk.
Excluding the hit from Asia divestitures, the bank earned a profit of $1.99 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.38 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Its global consumer banking revenue dropped 6% as holders of Citi-branded credit cards in North America paid down card balances, denying it interest income.
""Spending rates have picked up, which is good, but we have to see that materialize into average interest-earning balances which means payment rates have to normalize,"" Mason said.
Revenue from Treasury and Trade Solutions, generally considered Citigroup's strongest corporate business, was down 1% due to low interest rates.
The bank's overall net interest income (NII) was flat year-over-year at $10.82 billion as borrowing from corporations stayed flat. But NII from the bank's basic lending business outside of markets rose 0.6%.
Net interest margin, which measures the difference between what Citigroup pays for money and earns from loans and securities, declined to 1.98% from 2.06% a year earlier. 
A bright spot during the quarter was the bank's investment banking business, which posted a 43% jump in revenue.

Total revenue increased 1% from a year earlier to $17 billion.
Wall Street peers JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co also reported results on Friday, with their profits comfortably beating consensus estimates.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 rose Friday, but suffered a second-straight losing week following a tech-rout earlier this week, while underwhelming earnings from major Wall Street banks failed to turn the tide.  
The S&P 500 gained 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.56%, or 201 points and, the Nasdaq jumped 0.6%.
A trio of major Wall Street banks including Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reported better-than-expected results, but the latter slumped 6% as fourth-quarter profit slipped, while guidance on increased costs worried investors.
JPMorgan said it expected expenses to rise by 8% this year, stoking concerns about whether the bank will meet its 17% target for return on tangible equity.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) shares reported a 26% fall in profit, paced by wider-than-expected decline in trading revenue, with fixed-income trading revenue down 20% in the fourth quarter. Its shares fell more than 1%.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) rose more than 3% after its profit jumped 86%, and the bank delivered an upbeat outlook on loan growth for 2022.
Technology was higher - but still ended the week in the red following losses earlier in this week - as a climb in big tech and semiconductor stocks underpinned the broader sector.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained 0.5% after Bloomberg reported that the company may push back the debut of its virtual reality headsets.
Casino stocks were also in focused, with  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) surged after Macau, the gambling mecca in Asia, detailed new measures for gambling operations in the region easing uncertainty around the renewal of gaming licenses.
The measures, which are yet to be approved by the Macau legislature, would limit the number of gaming licenses to six, and cut the duration of gaming licenses to 10 years from 20.
Sentiment on retail stocks were hurt by signs of wobble in consumer spending after retail spending fell by a more than expected 1.9% in December.
Still, the weakness in consumer spending could prove a sliver lining for inflation.
”On the upside, the current retail weakness will accelerate inventory rebuilding, which should help take the pressure off inflation. It doesn't necessarily soften the case for a March hike, but it reduces the tail risk of the Fed hiking more than 4 times this year,” Jefferies said in a note.
In other news, Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) trimmed its outlook on annual earnings as rising costs and supply issues weighed on growth. Its shares fell more than 8%"

Investing.com — Shares of  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) rose 1.8% Friday after the company's arthritis drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The drug, named Rinvoq, has been approved to treat adults with active psoriatic arthritis who have had an insufficient response or intolerance to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.
AbbVie said the approval was backed by two phase 3 clinical studies with the drug showing efficacy across multiple measures of disease activity.
Rinvoq is said to improve joint pain, swelling and stiffness, as well as fatigue. The approval is the second for the drug after it was approved for rheumatoid arthritis in 2019.
""This new approval underscores our mission to deliver a portfolio of therapies that can help more people with rheumatic diseases achieve disease control,"" said Michael Severino, vice chairman and president, AbbVie.
Reacting to the announcement, Piper Sandler analyst kept an overweight rating and $160 price target on the stock but told investors in a note that Rinvoq was approved with a ""better than expected"" atopic dermatitis label.
""With what seems to be benign warning language and flexibility on dosing, we think the drug is now primed to capitalize on what has been largely positive dermatologist survey feedback regarding this opportunity,"" explained the analyst."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it is proposing conditions that would allow FedEx to install a laser-based missile-defense on Airbus A321-200 airplanes.
Delivery company FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) in October 2019 applied for approval to use a feature that emits infrared laser energy outside the aircraft as a countermeasure against heat-seeking missiles, the FAA disclosed in a document.
A FedEx spokeswoman declined immediate comment about whether it is still pursuing approval for the application. FedEx does not currently operate any Airbus 321 planes.
The FAA said it is still reviewing the proposal and will consider public comments. Airbus did not immediately comment.
The airline industry and several governments have been grappling with the threat to airliners from shoulder-fired missiles known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADs, for decades. Some use infrared systems to target an aircraft's engines.
""The FedEx missile-defense system directs infrared laser energy toward an incoming missile, in an effort to interrupt 
the missile’s tracking of the aircraft’s heat,"" the FAA document said.
The FAA proposed conditions before it would consider approving the system, including ensuring it will prevent the inadvertent operation while on the ground, including during maintenance.
According to the U.S. State Department, more than 40 civil airplanes have been hit by MANPADs since the 1970s.
Efforts to combat the threat accelerated after two missiles narrowly missed an Arkia Israeli Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 757 passenger jet on take-off from Mombasa airport in November 2002.
Cargo planes have also been targeted.

In 2003, an Airbus A300 freighter flown by DHL was damaged by MANPADs and forced to make an emergency landing in Baghdad.
In 2007 and 2008, FedEx took part in a U.S. government trial of anti-missile technology for civil planes by installing  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC)'s Guardian countermeasures system on some commercial cargo flights while BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) said it had installed its JetEye system on an American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) airplane.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 03:57PM ET</span>",Investors wary on bank growth despite executives' optimism,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While big U.S. bank bosses were optimistic on the economic outlook on Friday, pointing to an uptick in some lending businesses and a jump in consumer spending, investors were skeptical on the growth outlook for the sector.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, bellwethers of the U.S. economy, reported combined profits of $19 billion for the fourth quarter, each comfortably beating analyst estimates.
However, analysts noted that the beats were helped by reserve releases and other one-off items and that underlying performances were less compelling.
Bank shares across the board were down 2.1%, with only Wells Fargo bucking the trend amongst the top six, amid worries over a decline in trading revenues and loan growth.
""Investors are concerned about where growth is going to come from,"" said Viola Risk Advisors bank analyst David Hendler. ""There doesn't seem to be much sizzle in the forward quarters.""
Bank executives said the U.S. economy is still on a healthy trajectory, despite headwinds including the wave of Omicron infections, 7% inflation, and supply chain bottlenecks. 
While loan growth, a key metric watched by analysts, was mixed, consumer lending and spending were up, they pointed out. 
""The consumer is very strong,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts. ""Despite ... Omicron, in spite of supply chains, 2021 was one of the best growth years ever,"" he said. 
Average loans at JPMorgan, the country's largest lender, rose 6% year-on-year, while combined debit and credit card spend was up 26%. At Wells Fargo, loans were down 3% year-on-year but grew 5% during the second half of 2021, boosted by its consumer and commercial portfolios.
Overall lending was flat at Citigroup partly because corporations are still flush with cash and have other financing options, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason, but loan balances on Citigroup-branded cards in North America were up 3% from a year earlier and spending was 24% higher.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), the country's other major consumer lender, reports earnings on Wednesday.
""What we are seeing across the three major banks that reported today is not only a decent environment for loan growth in the 4th quarter but management teams' optimistic this will continue into 2022,"" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer for Albion Financial Group, which holds JPMorgan shares.
Still, investors worry that rising inflation could hurt consumer spending, while loan growth may not be strong enough to outpace deposit growth, meaning banks may not fully benefit from a steepening yield curve as benchmark rates rise.
""It gives the notion the economy isn't as strong as we thought it was,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta. 
EXPENSES, TRADING 
Inflationary pressures also weighed on expenses as banks face cutthroat hiring competition and are being forced to pay more to recruit and keep talent, executives said.
""Hiring has been very competitive across the business,"" said Citigroup's Mason. ""We have seen some pressure in what one has to pay to attract talent.""
The Wall Street businesses of JPMorgan and Citigroup fared mostly as expected, with both reporting big declines in trading. That was cushioned by another stellar quarter for deals.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Wall Street's other trading giants, will report next week, offering further clues on how the trading environment may look through the remainder of the year.

Analysts expect a further normalization as the Fed slows and eventually stops its asset purchases entirely.
""You're not going to have the fixed income trading boom that you had in the lower rates environment, with corporations rushing to refinance at lower rates,"" said Hendler.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Friday it will require operators of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s to take additional precautions when landing on wet or snowy runways at airports where new wireless services are deployed from next week.
The FAA said 5G interference could prevent engine and braking systems from transitioning to landing mode, which could prevent an aircraft from stopping on the runway. 
The directive requires crews ""to be aware of this risk and to adopt specific safety procedures when landing on these runways."" It affects 137 U.S. aircraft and 1,010 planes worldwide.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which won nearly all of the C-Band spectrum in an $80 billion auction last year, on Jan. 3 agreed to buffer zones around 50 airports to reduce interference risks. They also agreed to delay deployment for two weeks.
The FAA directive prohibits operators from dispatching or releasing 787s ""to affected airports when certain braking and anti-skid functions on the airplane are inoperable.""
Boeing did not immediately comment.
The FAA is also expected to detail ""alternative"" compliance for some specific airplane types and some airports before Wednesday.
The FAA on Thursday issued nearly 1,500 notices detailing the extent of potential impact of 5G services.
The notices show where ""aircraft with untested altimeters or that need retrofitting or replacement will be unable to perform low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed.""
On Jan. 7, the FAA disclosed the 50 U.S. airports that will have 5G buffer zones, including in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Detroit, Dallas, Philadelphia, Seattle and Miami.

On Thursday, Airports Council International – North America urged a delay 5G implementation to avoid widespread disruption across the U.S air transportation system.
""More than 100 airports and heliports within 46 of the largest metropolitan areas of the country will have their low visibility approach procedures closed due to potential radio frequency,"" the airport trade group said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) Chief Executive Jane Fraser faces a struggle to convince skeptical analysts and investors that she can turn the bank around despite overseeing a radical overhaul in less than a year at the helm.
Fraser took over at the helm of the Wall Street bank in February 2021, tasked with transforming a business whose share price had lagged rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) during her predecessor Michael Corbat's eight years at the helm.
Since her appointment, she has sought to simplify the firm, overseeing its biggest revamp since the 2007-09 financial crisis. The bank announced plans to exit non-core businesses, including consumer franchises in 13 markets across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa last April. 
On Tuesday, it doubled down, saying it planned to sell or spin-off its Mexican consumer business, which Fraser had run as head of the bank's Latin American businesses, prior to becoming CEO.
The bank went further still on Thursday, announcing the sale of its consumer businesses in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
The decision to sell the Mexican business, which Fraser had previously said had the scale to succeed which the bank's Asian consumer franchises lacked, is arguably her boldest move yet in reshaping the bank.
Citi's CFO Mark Mason said on Friday that the decision to exit that business was driven by the bank's strategy to focus on its institutional business. While the Mexico consumer business had delivered good returns, it would be more valuable to another owner, Mason said.
However, Citigroup's share price continues to lag rivals, suggesting that investors are yet to be convinced that Fraser's turnaround plans will bear fruit anytime soon.
""It is a show-me situation,"" said analyst Dick Bove of Odeon Capital. ""This company has been mischaracterized, mismanaged, and poorly handled by one administration after the other for 25 years,"" he said.
Since Fraser took up her post last February, its shares have gained 3% compared to JPMorgan shares rising 14%, Bank of America shares gaining 40% and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) rising 55%.
On Friday, the shares were under further pressure, down 2.5% after Citi released earnings showing a 26% slump in fourth-quarter profit as it took a hit from higher expenses and weakness at its consumer banking unit.
Fraser was questioned by analysts on Citi's conference call on the direction of the bank, answering that she aimed for it to be ""the preeminent bank for institutions with cross-border needs"" and was focused on improving shareholder value.
To be sure, Fraser is less than a year into her mission to turn the bank's fortunes around and investors who support her strategy stress that it will take time for the changes to improve the bank's performance.
However, she must convince analysts and investors scarred by years of disappointment with previous efforts to restructure the business. Prior to handing over the reins to Fraser, Corbat had also exited dozens of non-core businesses.
The business had sprawled under the leadership of Sandy Weill, who led the bank between 1998 and 2003. Weill led the bank through an acquisition spree before its collapse and subsequent $50 billion government bailout. 
Bove cited the failed strategies of six previous CEOs before saying that Fraser's plans alone are not enough to attract investors.
The bank habitually lags the financial performance of peers and has been under enhanced supervision from regulators for many of the years since its bailout during the financial crisis.
When Citigroup last changed its leadership in 2012, its shares surged and remained elevated for months after Corbat was installed in place of Vikram Pandit.
Corbat agreed in September 2020 to give up the post to Fraser at the end of February 2021. At the time the bank faced new questions over its financial controls, including that it should have caught an erroneous payment of nearly $1 billion to holders of bonds for which it was the trustee.
Fraser's strategy is designed to simplify the company, improve its focus on its institutional businesses and put its capital to better uses. 
""The new Citi is a simpler firm that has greater focus as a global banking, payments, and investing provider to multinational firms and institutions, growing corporates, and affluent individuals,"" Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo, who has an 'overweight' rating on the stock, said in a research note.

However, the plan has not yet lifted the stock.
Bove, who applauds Fraser's moves so far and recommends the shares, blames the lousy share performance on ""investor exhaustion.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Canada's auto safety regulator said on Thursday it has opened an investigation into the heating and cooling system of Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles following 16 consumer complaints about its performance during cold weather. 
Transport Canada said it is concerned that a malfunctioning heating and air-conditioning system ""may affect windshield defogging/defrosting and therefore driver visibility.""

Redfield, who has led the U.S. grocery business for the past six years, will take up the role immediately, according to an internal memo sent to employees.
Before Walmart, Redfield had held chief merchandising roles at ASDA, a UK grocer in which the U.S. retailer owns a minority stake, and at its warehouse club offering Sam's Club, the memo sent by U.S. Chief Executive John Furner said.
The leadership change comes two months after Walmart reported better third-quarter sales in the United States than market expectations and raised its annual sales and profit forecasts. 
The upbeat outlook came amid a surge in demand of groceries and home goods items during the pandemic and a big boost from online shopping, which grew 8% in the United States, or 87% from the pre-pandemic levels. 
McCall, who has been with Walmart for nearly 30 years, will work with U.S. operations head Chris Nicholas to further drive inventory management before he retires, the memo said.

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company also said that Chief Customer Officer Janey Whiteside will leave in March ""to start her next chapter in New York with her family.""
Whiteside was the company's first chief customer officer when she was appointed in 2018.

""I saw an opportunity for a change, to reinterpret the business strategy that has characterized us as a family over time,"" the scion of the Benetton family said in a Instagram video.
He replied to a follower that the group would follow the principle of sustainability in a broad, social and global sense.
Benetton said the group had made same serious mistakes in the past due assigning tasks to the wrong people, and the collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa was a ""tragic consequence.""

In 2018 a bridge run by Atlantia's tollway unit in the northern city of Genoa collapsed, killing 43 people. The Benetton family backed the sale of Atlantia's Italian motorway assets to avoid the threatened cancellation of its lucrative concession.
Benetton, who leads Italian private equity firm 21 Invest, was appointed on Thursday as chairman of the family's holding company Edizione in a move that brings the Benettons back to the helm.

Investing.com — Shares of Acutus Medical Inc (NASDAQ:AFIB) fell more than 12.5% Friday after a downgrade by investment research firm Canaccord.
Analysts at the firm cut the stock to hold from buy with a price target of $3, above its current $2.64 level.
In a research note, Canaccord said they are downgrading Acutus because of financing and dilution risk, pointing to conversations they had with ""leading private and public company Med-Tech executives."" 
""Management teams have pointed over the past few days to the challenging macro environment existing Q4/21 and into 2022,"" said Canaccord.
""For well capitalized companies, we believe most can weather the storm. However, we strongly believe AFIB will be challenged given its sole focus and lack of strong commercial footing.""
Acutus shares have fallen almost 89% in the past 12 months, from highs of $34. The arrhythmia care company's stock declined over 45% in November after it missed revenue projections and cut its 2021 revenue forecast. 
The analysts also estimated that the company could be net cash negative in the second half of this year, based on the $145 million in cash at the end of the third quarter, its $40 million of long-term debt, and its quarterly burn rate of $25 million to $30 million. ""We believe that to fund operations at current levels, dilution to current shareholders could be significant,"" added Canaccord.
The investment firm said the stock was not downgraded to sell because Acutus ""has several unique assets including mapping, access, and therapeutic technologies."""
777,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 02:41PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo beats profit estimates on uptick in loan demand, cost cuts","By Noor Zainab Hussain and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
(Reuters) -Wells Fargo & Co on Friday beat analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit as a rebound in U.S. economic growth encouraged more customers to take loans and the bank kept a tight lid on costs.
Profit jumped 86% to $5.8 billion, or $1.38 per share, flattered by a $943 million gain from the sale of some businesses and an $875 million reserve release from pandemic-related losses that did not materialize.
Average loans were down 3% from the fourth quarter last year, although the bank noted that loans ticked up in the last six weeks of 2021. ""Period-end"" loans rose 1% from the same time last year, and were up 4% from the third quarter.
""The strong economy continues to positively impact our customers and our results,"" Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said on a call with analysts. 
The bank's shares were up 3.2% in afternoon trade on Friday and have gained 20% since the start of the year.
The other lever Wells pulled to boost its top line was expenses. Scharf has made cost cuts a cornerstone of his turnaround plan, targeting $10 billion in savings annually over the long term.
The bank cut non-interest expenses by 11% to $13.2 billion by reducing personnel costs, the number of bank branches and its office space.
Headcount across the company fell by more than 7% over last year to 249,000 employees from 269,000, as the bank let go of 20% of managers who had only a few direct reports and 40% of non-engineering technology workers.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) closed 270 branches and reduced branch staffing in some locations because overall teller transactions are down 30% from pre-pandemic levels, executives said.
With fewer workers in offices, the bank offloaded 7% of its office space real estate portfolio in 2021 and plans to cut it by another 5% this year. 
And Scharf said they are nowhere near done.
""If you go back over a decade, one of the strengths of this company was never efficiency,"" Scharf said. ""As we get the efficiencies we're starting to see, it is like peeling the onion back. The next set of opportunities become even clearer.""
ASSET CAP
The fourth-largest U.S. bank has been in regulators' penalty box since 2016 when a sales-practices scandal came to light, and it has paid billions in fines and restitution. 
Wells Fargo is also operating under a $1.95-trillion asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve in 2018, which has crimped its ability to boost interest income by improving loan and deposit growth.
""We still have a multi-year effort to satisfy our regulatory requirements – with setbacks likely to continue along the way – and we continue our work to put exposures related to our historical practices behind us,"" Scharf said.
Still, Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said Wells could see as much as an 8% increase in net interest income this year over 2021 if projections on loan growth and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes hold.
According to Refinitiv estimates, Wells Fargo earned $1.25 per share excluding items, compared with analysts' average expectation of $1.13.
Total revenue rose 13% to $20.9 billion, also topping estimates of $18.9 billion. Net interest income fell 1% in the quarter.
Meanwhile on Friday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) both beat analyst profit estimates. While profits at JPMorgan, the country's largest lender, were hurt by a slowdown in its trading arm, a stellar performance at its investment banking softened the impact.

Investors have been focused on banks benefiting from the U.S. Federal Reserve indicating it might raise interest rates sooner than expected due to unabated inflation.
“If (Wells) can maintain the momentum they have right now on expense cuts … they have some tailwinds coming into this year from higher rates and the improving economy, which should benefit loan growth and boost net interest income,"" said John Mackerey, an analyst with DBRS Morningstar.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -Boeing Co executive Michael Teal, a veteran top engineer on its 777X and 737 MAX programs, is set to retire, according to a company memo seen by Reuters on Friday.
Teal, a 35-year Boeing (NYSE:BA) veteran, held various engineering leadership roles including vice president and chief project engineer on the 777X, 747-8 Freighter and 737 programs. His long-planned retirement date is April 1, the memo said. 
Teal was a vice president and chief project engineer during development of the 737 MAX, signing of on the jet's technical configuration. The plane was grounded for nearly two years starting in 2019 after two fatal crashes. 
David Loffing, who has held engineering roles on several programs including the 747, NMA and 737, has been named as vice president 777X chief project engineer, the memo said. 
The 777X program has been hobbled for years by certification problems and weak demand for long-haul jets. 
The 737 MAX was approved to return to service in late 2020.
Teal was among a number of Boeing executives who testified at U.S. Congress during an investigation into a flawed flight control system known as MCAS linked to the 737 MAX crashes.
Teal and Keith Leverkuhn, the vice president in charge of the overall 737 MAX development program, defended the jet's development, and acknowledged flawed assumptions on how the pilots would react to the problems they encountered during the crash flights. 

Teal also told investigators from the U.S. House transportation committee that he was unaware MCAS could activate repeatedly. 
Boeing said later that Teal and Leverkuhn, who has retired, supervised hundreds of engineers and could not have been involved in every design decision.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Friday, as financials fell after quarterly earnings from major Wall Street banks failed to impress investors.
The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.1%, or 394 points, the Nasdaq lost 0.3% to trade at 14,765. Traders are watching 14,725 level, the 100-day moving average, on the NASDAQ Composite, as a key level of support.
A trio of major Wall Street banks including Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reported better-than-expected results, but the latter slumped 6% as its guidance on increased costs worried investors.
JPMorgan said it expected expenses to rise by 8% this year, stoking concerns about whether the bank will meet its 17% target for return on tangible equity.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) shares reported a 26% fall in profit, paced by wider-than-expected decline in trading revenue, with fixed-income trading revenue down 20% in the fourth quarter. Its shares fell 2%.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) rose more than 2% after its profit jumped 86%, and the bank delivered an upbeat outlook on loan growth for 2022.
Technology was flat, outperforming the broader market, as a climb in big tech and semiconductor stocks underpinned the broader sector.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was flat after Bloomberg reported that the company may push back the debut of its virtual reality headsets.
Casino stocks were also in focused, with  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) surged after Macau, the gambling mecca in Asia, detailed new measures for gambling operation in the region easing uncertainty around the renewal of gaming licenses.
The measures, which are yet to be approved by the Macau legislature, would limit the number of gaming licenses to six, and cut the duration of gaming licenses to 10 years from 20.
In other news, Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) trimmed its outlook on annual earnings as rising costs and supply issues weighed on growth. Its shares fell more than 11%.
Sentiment on stocks was also hurt by signs of wobble in consumer spending after retail spending fell by a more than expected 1.9% in December.
Still, the weakness in consumer spending could prove a sliver lining for inflation.
”On the upside, the current retail weakness will accelerate inventory rebuilding, which should help take the pressure off inflation. It doesn't necessarily soften the case for a March hike, but it reduces the tail risk of the Fed hiking more than 4 times this year,” Jefferies said in a note."
780,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 01:57PM ET</span>",Nearly 90% of big US meat plants had COVID-19 cases in pandemic’s first year - data,"By Leah Douglas
(Reuters) - Nearly 90% of processing plants owned by five big U.S. meat companies had COVID-19 cases in 2020 and early 2021, a Reuters analysis of public data found, as a congressional committee investigates how meatpackers handled the pandemic.
The U.S. House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis began its probe last year amid evidence the plants were major spreaders of COVID-19 and that workers suffered unusually severe outbreaks. It is unclear what the consequences of the investigation could be. 
“The impact of the coronavirus on the essential workers of the meatpacking industry was both terrible and avoidable,"" Subcommittee Chair Representative James Clyburn told Reuters. ""As our investigation continues, I reiterate my call for meatpacking companies to make widespread changes and immediately provide safe working conditions for their employees.”
While the spread of COVID-19 at meat plants was covered widely by media in the first year of the crisis, the percentage of major packing plants that had multiple cases has not been previously reported. 
Data from meatpackers  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), JBS, Cargill, Smithfield Foods and National Beef made public in October showed 59,000 cases of COVID-19 and 269 deaths among their workers between March 2020 and Feb. 1 2021. Both figures were around three times higher than previous estimates. 
Reuters compared that data, which included company locations with COVID-19 cases, to publicly available company filings and websites that list the companies' major processing plant locations to determine the percentage of facilities that had multiple cases.
The analysis showed multiple cases at 218 of the 247 plants owned by the five companies in the United States over the period. That represents 88.2%. For each company individually, the rates ranged from 82% of JBS’62 U.S. plants - including those owned by its subsidiary Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) - to 100% of National Beef’s eight plants. 
Mark Lauritsen of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents meatpacking workers, said the numbers were ""a reflection and confirmation of how bad the initial outbreaks in meatpacking were.""
Reports of outbreaks at meat plants have slowed since the first year of the pandemic, but infections from the Omicron variant are causing staffing issues, according to meat companies and union officials.
Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson did not comment on the percentage of company plants with cases but said the company has spent $810 million on preventative COVID-19 measures and began providing paid sick leave to vaccinated workers this month. 

Smithfield vice president of corporate affairs Jim Monroe called the Reuters analysis ""misleading"" and said one reason for the high number of cases was due to ""frequent and widespread testing"" of workers. Monroe also pointed to Smithfield's efforts to protect its workers including by providing protective equipment like face shields and by installing sanitizer stations.
National Beef, Cargill and JBS did not respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com — GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson released a research note on JinkoSolar Holding Company Limited (NYSE:JKS), outlining his bearish thesis on the stock. 
JinkoSolar is a leading solar panel manufacturer based in Shanghai, China. The analyst currently has a sell rating and $11.65 price target on the stock, which represents an approximately 75% downside on current levels.
According to TheFly, Johnson said JinoSolar shares remained ""astoundingly resilient all last year"" and so far in 2022. He attributed the resilience to the anticipation of the company's Shanghai IPO.
However, he said that with the IPO catalyst now behind and prices rising, it puts the company's margins at risk again. The backdrop for Jinko is ""in worse shape today,"" he said.
The GLJ analyst said ""now is likely a great time to aggressively short"" shares in the company. 
Despite the bearish commentary, Jinko's stock price is up % 2to just over $46 per share Friday."

The deal with Facebook, which Google dubbed ""Jedi Blue,"" was ""signed off"" by Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was on an email thread discussing it, they said in their third amended complaint.
Google said the complaint's assertion ""isn't accurate,"" and that the complaint itself is ""full of inaccuracies."" 
""We intend to file a motion to dismiss next week,"" a Google spokesperson said.
Facebook, which has since become Meta Platforms Inc, said in a statement that the deal was not exclusive to Google, and that other agreements have increased competition for ad placements. It said it was better for advertisers ""while fairly compensating publishers.""
Facebook has not been named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
The deal was allegedly struck as part of Google's effort to counter header bidding, which publishers wanted to use to make more money from advertising placed on their websites, the filing said.
""Google quickly realized that this innovation substantially threatened its exchange’s ability to demand a very large — 19 to 22 percent — cut on all advertising transactions,"" the filing said. 
Its efforts to kill header bidding included striking a deal with Facebook, which had supported header bidding, the filing said.
""Ultimately, Google and Facebook struck a deal executed at the highest levels,"" the complaint said. ""Following the agreement, Facebook curtailed its involvement with header bidding in return for Google giving Facebook information, speed, and other advantages.""
As part of the agreement, the two online platforms agreed on how often Facebook would win the publishers' auctions, the filing said.
Google had other tactics also, such as using at least three programs to manipulate ad auctions to coerce advertisers and publishers into using Google's tools, the filing said. 
The Texas lawsuit, which was joined by other states, was filed in 2020 and alleges that Google used coercive tactics and broke antitrust law in its efforts to boost its already dominant advertising business.

The document filed on Friday is a less redacted version of a second amended complaint, which was originally filed in October 2021.
The lawsuit was one of several that arose from investigations by the federal government and groups of states into online platforms.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 01:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive-U.S. bill would block defense contractors from using Chinese rare earths,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - A bipartisan piece of legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate on Friday would force defense contractors to stop buying rare earths from China by 2026 and use the Pentagon to create a permanent stockpile of the strategic minerals.
The bill, sponsored by Senators Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, and Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, is the latest in a string of U.S. legislation seeking to thwart China's near control over the sector. 
It essentially uses the Pentagon's purchase of billions of dollars worth of fighter jets, missiles and other weapons as leverage to require contractors to stop relying on China and, by extension, support the revival of U.S. rare earths production. 
Rare earths are a group of 17 metals that, after processing, are used to make magnets found in electric vehicles, weaponry and electronics. While the United States created the industry in World War Two and U.S. military scientists developed the most widely-used type of rare earth magnet, China has slowly grown to control the entire sector the past 30 years.
The United States has only one rare earths mine and has no capability to process rare earth minerals. 
""Ending American dependence on China for rare earths extraction and processing is critical to building up the U.S. defense and technology sectors,"" Cotton told Reuters. 
The senator, who sits on the Senate's Armed Forces and Intelligence committees, described China's evolution into the global rare earths leader as ""simply a policy choice that the United States made,"" adding that he hoped fresh policies would loosen Beijing's grip.
Known as the Restoring Essential Energy and Security Holdings Onshore for Rare Earths Act of 2022, the bill would codify and make permanent the Pentagon's ongoing stockpiling of the materials. China temporarily blocked rare earth exports to Japan in 2010 and has issued vague threats it could do the same to the United States. 
To build that reserve, though, the Pentagon buys supply in part from China, a paradox that Senate staffers hope will abate in time. 
The rare earths production process can be highly pollutive, part of the reason why it grew unpopular in the United States. Ongoing research is attempting to make the process cleaner.
Cotton said he has talked to various U.S. executive agencies about the bill, but declined to say if he had talked with President Joe Biden or the White House.
""This is an area in which Congress will lead, because many members have been concerned about this very topic, regardless of party,"" he said.
ENCOURAGE DOMESTIC OUTPUT
Most members of the nascent U.S. rare earths sector praised the bill, though some worried defense contractors could continue to ask for waivers to buy Chinese rare earths even after 2026.
The Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group for  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC),  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and other U.S. aerospace and defense companies, declined to comment on the bill. 
""Well placed policies such as this one get us closer to the target of onshoring this critical supply chain,"" said Marty Weems, North American president of Australia-based American Rare Earths Ltd, which is developing three U.S. rare earth projects. 
MP Materials Corp , which operates the only U.S. rare earths mine and relies on Chinese processors, said it appreciates ""ongoing efforts by the Department of Defense and broader U.S. government to secure the domestic rare earth supply chain and promote free and fair competition.""
The bill, which the sponsors expect could be folded into Pentagon funding legislation later this year, offers no direct support for U.S. rare earths miners or processors. 
Instead, it requires Pentagon contractors to stop using Chinese rare earths within four years, allowing waivers only in rare situations. Defense contractors would be required to immediately say where they source the minerals.
Those requirements ""should encourage more domestic (rare earths) development in our country,"" Cotton said. 
The Pentagon has in the past two years given grants to companies trying to resume U.S. rare earth processing and magnet production, including MP Materials, Australia's Lynas Rare Earth Ltd, TDA Magnetics Inc and Urban Mining Co. 
Kelly, a former astronaut and a member of the Senate's Armed Services and Energy committees, said the bill should ""strengthen America's position as a global leader in technology by reducing our country's reliance on adversaries like China for rare earth elements.""
The bill only applies to weapons, not other equipment the U.S. military purchases.

Additionally, the U.S. trade representative would be required to investigate whether China is distorting the rare earths market and recommend whether trade sanctions are needed.
When asked if such a step could be seen as antagonistic by Beijing, Cotton said: ""I don't think the answer to Chinese aggression or Chinese threats is to continue to subject ourselves to Chinese threats.""

784,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 01:18PM ET</span>",Nasdaq Hides Deeper Pain With Over One-Third of Stocks Down 50%,"(Bloomberg) -- The tech stock-rout, as steep as it’s been, has still only pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index down about 8% from its November high, just shy of an official correction for a benchmark that’s more than doubled in less than two years.
Yet beneath the surface it looks a lot worse. 
More than 36% of the stocks in the index are down at least 50% from their 52-week highs, an extraordinarily large number given the scale of the overall index’s drop, according to Ned Davis Research. Typically when the Nasdaq is within 10% of its peak, an average of just 12.5% of its stocks have declined that much, the firm said.
The break reflects how strongly the major equity benchmarks are being influenced by the technology industry’s mega-cap giants. And their stocks haven’t been hit as hard this year as some of the smaller, fast-growing tech companies that are reliant on financing and whose valuations depend heavily on future profits, making their shares particularly sensitive to higher interest rates. 
As a result, it’s unclear whether the market will break with previous patterns suggesting there’s more pain ahead. Ned Davis said the number of Nasdaq stocks that have fallen so deeply from their peaks would usually point to a “cyclical bear market,” which tends to be a short-term decline of at least 20% from records that lasts a few months. 
“Market breadth for Nasdaq stocks is pretty pathetic,” Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis, said in an interview. “When you’re in the middle of something like this, it’s tricky to decipher whether it’s a normal rolling correction or a bull market peak. But the longer this goes on, the harder it’s going to be to ignore.” 
Since 1972, there’s only been 39 days when the Nasdaq has held within 10% of its highs while more than 35% of its members were down more than 50% from their peaks, data from Ned Davis show. And until December 2021, all of them occurred in 1998 and 1999, during the height of the Internet bubble.
To be sure, the divergences won’t necessarily lead to a bear market. Much of the recent weakness has centered on micro-cap stocks, which have typically been more volatile and less liquid than shares of larger companies, Clissold said.
Tech stocks were under pressure again on Friday, with the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% lower in late-morning trading after staging a brief rebound at the open. 
“We’ll have to see if earnings season comes to the rescue once again,” Clissold said, explaining that technical indicators like market breadth have improved over the past few quarters as corporate-profit outlooks improved. “Still, earnings revisions over the past several weeks weren’t as strong as other pre-announcement periods last year, which leads us to believe that we may not get those fantastic beat rates.”

Investing.com — Shares of  Planet Labs PBC  (NYSE:PL) rallied after the company announced the successful launch of Flock 4x, consisting of 44 SuperDove satellites.
The company announced Thursday after the closing bell that 4x was successfully launched into orbit on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with SpaceX, which has now brought to orbit 127 Planet satellites. It was the first launch with SpaceX under the companies' new multi-year agreement signed in August. 
The satellites will join the company's existing fleet of roughly 200 satellites in orbit. Planet Labs said it was able to make contact with all of the SuperDove satellites.
The company's shares have risen 12% to $6.30 on the news. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs initiated the stock with a buy rating and an $11 price target, telling clients in a research note that the company is the market leader in commercial Earth observation.

(Reuters) -BlackRock Inc's fourth-quarter profit beat analyst estimates on Friday, as the world's largest money manager's fee income rose and assets under management topped $10 trillion, but shares dipped as revenue slightly missed Wall Street estimates. 
A strong finish to the year by global financial markets helped boost the performance of asset managers in general, with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) also benefiting from its large scale and wide reach.
Assets under management stood at $10.01 trillion at the end of the quarter, up from $8.68 trillion a year earlier. 
“It’s an impressive milestone and it just illustrates their dominance in the fastest growing areas within the industry,” said Kyle Sanders, analyst at Edward Jones. “They continue to gather assets at a remarkable clip.”
Net inflows for the quarter were at $212 billion, of which long-term net flows accounted for $169 billion, up from $116 billion a year earlier. 
""Our business is more diversified than ever before – active strategies, including alternatives, contributed over 60% of 2021 organic base fee growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in a statement. 
BlackRock's revenue from investment advisory, securities lending and administration fees, its biggest segment, rose to $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, helped by global dealmaking volumes rising to a record high in 2021, crossing $5 trillion for the first time. 
Adjusted profit rose 2.5% to $1.61 billion, or $10.42 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.57 billion, or $10.18 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average were expecting the company to report a profit of $10.16 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue rose nearly 14% to $5.11 billion, slightly below the consensus analyst estimate of $5.17 billion.
BlackRock shares were down 1.7% to $852.66 in morning trading. Markets have had a rocky start to the year as investors digest the expected move by the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates to rein in rising inflation.
""2022 is going to be a transitional year for the entire asset management space,” said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA. ""Investors need to take a little pause and examine what is sustainable and what is not.""
BlackRock said it was targeting ""record"" investment in its business in 2022, including an expected increase in headcount by as much as 10%.

""Looking forward, they are going into investment mode again,"" Sanders at Edward Jones said. ""They are going to spend a lot, and that is probably going to make it tough for them to really have meaningful profit margin and EPS growth in 2022.”
BlackRock shares rose nearly 27% last year compared with a 32% gain for the S&P 1500 asset manager and custody banks index.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court put the federal government's prosecution of Turkish state-owned lender Halkbank for allegedly helping Iran evade American sanctions on hold while the bank appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Friday's order from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan allows Halkbank to appeal without having to defend against the criminal case at the same time. It expressed no view on the merit of an appeal.
The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a delay, saying Halkbank's ""meritless"" claims neither raised ""substantial"" questions nor overcame the public interest in a speedy trial.
Halkbank has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and conspiracy over its alleged use of money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions.
Its alleged misconduct includes helping Iran secretly transfer $20 billion of restricted funds, including $1 billion laundered through the U.S. financial system, and converting oil revenue into gold and then cash to benefit Iranian interests.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan and U.S.-based lawyers for Halkbank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In an Oct. 22 decision, the 2nd Circuit said Halkbank could be prosecuted because its alleged misconduct involved commercial activity that was not covered by sovereign immunity.
Halkbank said that decision conflicted with Supreme Court precedents as it ""greenlights the first criminal trial of a foreign sovereign in the nation's history.""

It also said it would suffer irreparable harm if forced to defend against ""a case from which it is immune.""
The Supreme Court denies most appeals. In its last term it received 5,307 filings and heard arguments in 72 cases.

MADRID (Reuters) - A Madrid court has cut a compensation payout awarded to banker Andrea Orcel over Santander (MC:SAN)'s withdrawal of a CEO job offer to 51.4 million euros ($58.75 million) from an initial 67.8 million euros, a court document seen by Reuters on Friday showed.
Orcel and Santander ended up in court after Spain's largest bank dropped plans to make the former UBS investment banker its CEO as a result of a disagreement over his pay. Orcel had already left UBS to prepare for the new role.
The amended court ruling comes after both Orcel and Santander requested clarification from the judge on 35 million euros initially awarded to the Italian banker by the court on Dec. 10, the document showed. 
Neither the court nor Orcel's legal team were immediately available for comment.
It was not immediately possible to reach Orcel for comment.
A Santander spokesperson said the bank ""welcomes this clarification and will resume the appeal process in due course"".
Orcel's legal team, which originally sought as much as 112 million euros from Santander for breach of contract, filed an amended lawsuit on May 17, 2021, reducing the claim after he joined Italian lender UniCredit.
After the December ruling, Orcel's legal team asked the judge if the amount to which the banker was entitled under the buyout clause was 29 million euros or 18.6 million euros without tax equalisation.
In the court document seen on Friday Madrid judge Javier Sanchez Beltran acknowledged there was an error in the December ruling, and that Orcel was not entitled to tax equalisation as part of the buyout clause.
""The offer letter never mentioned tax equalisation,"" Sanchez Beltran added in his written ruling.
The rest of the compensation such as the 17 million euros for a sign-on bonus, the 5.8 million euros for two years' salary and 10 million euros for moral and reputational damage, plus interest, remained unchanged.
The payout in cash Orcel is entitled amounts to 32.8 million euros while the more than 18 million euros reduced buyout clause will be paid in shares. 
Following this clarification, Santander now has 20 days to file an appeal against the December ruling, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
In December, Sanchez Beltran said Santander's job offer letter to Orcel in September 2018 was a binding contract. That ruling still stands.

Appeals against the December ruling could delay a final outcome for another one or two years if legal proceedings reach Spain's Supreme Court, several court sources said.

The Mexican government launched its lawsuit in August https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-sues-several-weapons-manufacturers-us-court-2021-08-04, arguing arms makers including Smith & Wesson Brands Inc and Sturm Ruger & Company (NYSE:RGR) Inc knew their practices had encouraged illegal arms trafficking into Mexico, helping to cause thousands of gangland deaths.
The arms industry has rejected Mexico's allegations, and in November asked a U.S. judge to dismiss https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-gun-makers-say-mexicos-lawsuit-represents-clash-national-values-2021-11-23 the lawsuit.
The Arms Control Association said Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won from a field of eight nominees in an online poll that drew thousands of participants from dozens of countries.
""The Mexican foreign ministry's lawsuit against the U.S. firearms companies represents an important new way to hold rogue actors accountable for their role in the violence caused by small arms trafficking across international borders,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association.
The various nominees for the annual contest were put forward by the Arms Control Association.

Ebrard celebrated the award on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and paid tribute to the work of his ministry's legal team.

Investing.com –  Wells Fargo  stock (NYSE:WFC) rose 2.7% on Friday after the lender’s profit and revenue came in ahead of estimates, driven by the CEO’s focus on cutting costs. 
Lower provisioning, higher non-interest income, one-off gains on sale of businesses and higher investment banking fees in a booming market for advisory services also boosted profits.
Net profit soared 86% to $5.8 billion, aided by a $943 million gain from the sale of the bank's corporate trust and asset management units. It was also boosted by lower provisioning because of improving credit quality.
Non-interest expenses fell 11%, to $13 billion, driven by lower personnel costs, as well as smaller restructuring charges and operating losses, capping a year of austerity at the bank under Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf’s ambitious plan of $10 billion annual cost savings in the long term.
According to Reuters, Wells Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said the bank is aiming for an additional $3.3 billion in cost cuts in 2022, as it attempts to have more consumers bank online while reducing its own real estate presence.
Wells Fargo has been operating under a $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve in 2018, which has limited its ability to boost interest income.
""We also remain cognizant that we still have a multiyear effort to satisfy our regulatory requirements – with setbacks likely to continue along the way – and we continue our work to put exposures related to our historical practices behind us,"" Scharf said.
The lender has found itself boxed by the regulators after a sales practices scandal came to light in 2016. It has since paid billions in fines.
Net interest income decreased 1%, primarily because of lower yields on earning assets and lower loan balances reflecting soft demand and elevated prepayments by consumers.
Noninterest income increased 27%, driven by strong results in the bank’s affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. Investment banking fees improved on higher debt underwriting and advisory fees.
Home lending was down 8% primarily due to weaker mortgage banking income driven by lower gain on sale margins and fewer originations. Vehicle loans business did well, revenue rising 17% there.
Loans issued late in the year were up 1% from a year earlier and 4% higher than the prior quarter. 
Total revenue rose 13%, to $21 billion."
794,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 12:15PM ET</span>",Earnings to test growth stocks after rocky start to year,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rough start to 2022 for U.S. tech and growth stocks is raising stakes for upcoming earnings reports, as investors seek reasons to keep faith in the shares while bracing for U.S. interest rate hikes.
The S&P 500 information technology sector, which accounts for nearly 29% of the broader index’s weight, is down 5.5% year-to-date, including steep declines in shares of heavyweights such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), both off roughly 9%. The overall S&P 500 has fallen 2.7%.
Tech bulls hope a strong earnings season can blunt some of the pain, which many pin on rising Treasury yields and expectations that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy and hike rates aggressively to fight inflation. 
As the Fed increases short-term rates, investors will keep an eye on how high longer-term U.S. Treasury yields rise. Higher yields more steeply discount the value of future profits, which can especially pressure growth stocks.
""Given the performance of these tech names here recently, will earnings be a savior for them?"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. ""Over the next month, seeing how some of these tech names respond to their numbers ... will be interesting.""
Fourth-quarter results season kicks into high gear next week, with overall S&P 500 earnings expected to climb 23.1%, according to Refinitiv IBES. Technology sector earnings are expected to rise by 15.6%, as other groups have benefited more from the economy's rebound from pandemic lockdowns in 2020.
Companies in the S&P 500 growth index, which is replete with tech stocks, are expected to increase earnings 16%, compared to a 26% rise for the S&P 500 value index, more heavily weighted in banks, industrials and other economically sensitive companies, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Higher interest rates could pressure the stretched valuations of tech stocks, so companies need to deliver impressive numbers in coming weeks, said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. 
""To have the (stock) price go up even in a rising rate/falling multiple environment, you have to show demand for the product,"" she said.
The tech sector is trading at about 27 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, near its highest in 18 years, compared to 21 times for the overall S&P 500, according to Refinitiv Datstream.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), whose shares have slumped over 14% to start the year, reports on Thursday, the first results from the closely watched ""FAANG"" group of large growth companies. Investors will watch the streaming giant's plans for generating content and its outlook for subscribers.
“If they can surprise to the upside on the number of subscribers, I think that is going to be great for the stock price,” said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management, which owns Netflix shares.
Among the tech and growth names that have struggled in January are Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), both down about 9%, and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), which has dropped about 15%. 
The ARK Innovation ETF, which is filled with growth stocks and was the top-performing U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar in 2020, is down over 16% so far this year.
Yet not everyone is convinced Treasury yields will rise much more, or that investors should flee tech shares as the Fed raises rates. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) see the 10-year Treasury yield rising to 2% by the end of the year, ""suggesting only a modest further move in longer-term yields,"" while ""the likelihood of slowing economic growth in 2022 is an argument in favor of growth stocks.""
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stood at 1.76% on Friday, after topping 1.8% earlier in the week.
A study by the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, meanwhile, found the tech sector appreciated an average of 48.1% during five periods of rising interest rates since the 1990s.

The Wells Fargo institute has a favorable rating on the tech sector, along with communication services, industrials and financials.
""This is all a very recent thing where people have almost talked themselves into tech as being rate sensitive,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo institute.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 12:12PM ET</span>","Burned by COVID supply crunch, hospitals invest in U.S. mask-making","By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Two days before Christmas, a cargo ship left Mumbai with a mask-making machine bound for Illinois-based OSF HealthCare, which will use the equipment to make its own N95 masks. 
It isn't the hospital group's first foray into manufacturing. After COVID-19 border closures in early 2020 choked shipments from Asia, producer of about 80% of the world's medical masks and protective gear, OSF and some other hospital groups started investing in U.S. production of key supplies including masks, gowns and critical pharmaceuticals.
The goal: Avoid a repeat of the early pandemic's life-threatening shortages of essential protective gear - an effort that has become vitally important as schools, employers, consumers and the federal government are snapping up high-quality N95s and other masks to shield against the highly contagious Omicron variant. 
Over the last eight months, OSF has turned out about a million surgical masks for staff and patients at its facilities, which serve nearly 3 million people in Illinois and Michigan, said Pinak Shah, OSF's chief supply chain officer. 
The new equipment is due to arrive in February, and once approved by the Food and Drug Administration, will produce around 1 million N95s annually. OSF's two mask manufacturing projects will make it 100% self-reliant, Shah said. 
OSF declined to disclose the machinery cost. It is expected to pay for itself in two years, versus 18 months for the surgical mask machine - a difference largely due to freight costs being nearly four times higher than usual, said Salvatore, Stile, president of logistics company Alba Wheels Up, who handled the N95 machinery shipment. 
The investment is a hedge against uncertainties, said Shah.
""The manufacturing cost is a little higher than sourcing with a lower-cost competitor. However, it allows control of the market risk factor and spot shortage/back orders,"" he said.
Beyond that, participants say such projects help support and stabilize domestic manufacturing and downstream domestic supply chains, both of which are vulnerable to boom-and-bust demand cycles and the threat of China's flooding the U.S. with very low-cost, and at times low-quality, alternatives. 
LESSONS LEARNED
Michael Alkire, chief executive of hospital group purchasing organization Premier, told Reuters he doubled down on efforts to strengthen U.S. suppliers after January 2020, when China diverted Premier-bound N95 shipments from Taiwan for its own use. 
For more than 18 months, Premier and rival Vizient have bolstered U.S. manufacturers via strategic partnerships, expansion funding, minority-stake investments and joint ventures. While Premier declined to reveal the value of its investments, Vizient put the total at more than $12 million. 
Prestige Ameritech is a beneficiary of such dealmaking. Premier and 15 of its hospital members took an undisclosed minority stake in the Texas-based company in May 2020. The hospitals also pledged to buy a portion of their surgical masks and N95s from Prestige for up to six years. Vizient separately committed to buying 9 million N95 masks over a 12-month period. 
""That's what a company needs. It needs steady revenue,"" said Prestige Ameritech founder and CEO Dan Reese, who added that his and other vetted U.S. mask makers ""prioritize and support healthcare providers.""  
  Prestige now supplies 100% of surgical masks and up to 80% of N95s at Baptist Health South Florida, said George Godfrey, the Miami-based group's vice president of supply chain. 
""It certainly reduces the risk profile of obtaining those goods during times when everyone is trying to source them,"" Godfrey said of the Premier deal. 
Hospital executives said the projects build clout in an industry where no single operator has the power of a ""big three"" U.S. automaker or a leading retailer like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) or Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to wield significant sway over suppliers. 
""We're not just customers, we have a seat at the table,"" said Bruce Radcliff, system vice president for supply chain at Advocate Aurora Health, a participant in several Premier production projects.
""The healthcare sector is trying to take control of its supply chain,"" said Luis Arguello, president of DemeTECH, a Florida-based manufacturer of medical masks, sutures, COVID tests and other supplies. DemeTECH is talking with ""several"" hospital groups seeking to invest, he said. 
With ample production capacity at the ready, members of the American Mask Manufacturer's Association (AMMA) believe domestic hospital supplies will remain secure throughout the Omicron surge. 

Texas mask producer Armbrust American said demand from consumers and school districts virtually cleared its 32,000-square-foot distribution center that just a few days ago was packed with unsold masks for adults and children. 
""It's great because I'm not gonna have to go bankrupt,"" said AMMA president and company CEO Lloyd Armbrust, who is again ramping up production.

(Reuters) - Petershill Partners Plc, the London-listed subsidiary of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)'s asset management division, is nearing a deal to acquire a stake in private equity firm Arsenal Capital Partners, people familiar with the matter said.
Petershill, which acquires minority stakes in alternative asset managers, has prevailed in an auction process to invest in Arsenal Capital, the sources said. 
The size of the stake and the valuation being discussed could not be confirmed. It is not clear what Arsenal Capital will do with the proceeds and if its founders will use the opportunity to sell down part of their stakes.
Spokespeople for Goldman Sachs and Arsenal Capital declined to comment.
The sources said the negotiations could still end without a deal and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 
Private equity firms typically sell stakes to raise capital to fund growth initiatives, such as seeding new funds.
New York-based Arsenal Capital makes buyout and growth equity investments in businesses primarily in the industrials and healthcare sectors. The firm was founded in 2000 and has about $5.8 billion in assets under management.
Launched by Goldman Sachs in 2007, Petershill is one of the pioneers of the so-called general partner stake-investing business. It competes with a handful of big firms, including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc and Dyal, a unit of Blue Owl.

Petershill listed in London in September in an initial public offering. Its shares have lost close to a third of their value since then. 
Petershill said earlier this week it had completed fundraising for its fourth flagship fund after amassing $5 billion from investors. The firm's previous investments in private equity fund managers include Accel-KKR, Francisco Partners and Riverstone Holdings.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 11:30AM ET</span>",Musk says Tesla to accept dogecoin for merchandise,"(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will accept meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin as payment for its merchandise such as the ""Giga Texas"" belt buckle and mini models of electric vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in a tweet on Friday.
The move, which sent dogecoin prices 14% higher, comes a month after Musk said Tesla would test out the digital token as a payment option.
Musk, a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, has heavily influenced prices of dogecoin and bitcoin, and at one point had said the company would accept bitcoin for purchasing its cars before axing plans.
Tesla's merchandise, which also include the recently launched ""Cyberwhistle"" and ""Cyberquad for Kids"", are a hit with its fans, and usually sell out within a few hours of listing.
""Some have noted that goods for doge are selling out even faster than for dollars. This news is a good illustration of crypto's continued penetration of corporate culture,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro.
Musk's tweets on dogecoin, including the one where he called it the ""people's crypto"", have turned the once-obscure digital currency, which began as a social media joke, into a speculator's dream. The token's price surged by about 4,000% in 2021.
Tesla disclosed last year it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, and Musk has also said he owns some bitcoin and dogecoin.

Tesla is facing intense competition as legacy automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co as well as startups including Rivian Automotive are set to launch their electric cars this year.
Tesla's much-awaited Cybertruck will begin production in the first quarter of 2023, pushing back its plan to start production in late 2022, Reuters reported.

802,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 11:23AM ET</span>","Citigroup Slips as Expenses Surge, Consumer Banking Revenue Falls","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Citigroup  stock (NYSE:C) fell 2.2% on Friday as higher expenses and weakness at its consumer banking unit pushed fourth-quarter profit to fall short of estimates while revenue just about beat expectations.
Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser took over the reins of the Wall Street bank in March and has since embarked on a strategy refresh that will eventually see the lender exit consumer banking operations in as many as 13 countries, mostly in Asia. It has so far sewn up deals with buyers for that business in seven countries.
As per the latest announcement, not part of the previous plan, the bank said it will exit consumer, small business and middle market banking in Mexico.
Total revenue increased 1% from a year earlier to $17 billion. On the other hand, expenses soared 18% to top $13 billion owing to charges related to the withdrawals and the bank's higher investments in technology and efforts to improve its control systems.
Net income of $3.2 billion decreased 26% from the prior-year period, reflecting higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenue and a lower cost of credit. Results for the quarter included a pre-tax impact of approximately $1.1 billion (after taxes) related to those divestitures, the bank said.
Including the impact of costs stemming from Asia divestitures, the bank’s earnings per share were 24% lower at $1.46. Excluding that, EPS rose 4% to $1.99, reflecting the reduction in share count because of buybacks.
The bank's global consumer banking revenue dropped 6% to $7 billion, hurt by a 3% drop in revenue from Citi credit cards in North America as more customers opted to pay their outstanding balances.
Investment banking stood out as revenue from the operations, riding on heightened capital market activity, soared 43% to $1.8 billion. More customers sought the bank’s advice on IPOs and M&As.
Markets revenue fell 11% to $4 billion after a record 2021 for equities. Fixed income markets revenue fell 20%, pulled down by rising government bond yields and volatility in credit and currency markets."

According to Refinitiv Lipper data, investors offloaded U.S. bond funds of $3.15 billion, marking the first weekly outflow since Dec. 15.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enthusiasm around ""meme stocks"" has eased for young investors a year on from the  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) trading frenzy, with Gen Z's attention shifting to companies in areas like electric vehicles and the ""metaverse,"" according to a report released on Friday.
The top stock holding among the Gen Z cohort - people born after 1996 - in the fourth quarter was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, according to the quarterly investor outlook from Apex Fintech Solutions, which provides custody and clearing services for brokers like SoFi, Stash, WeBull, and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS)'s Marcus.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) slipped from the No. 1 spot in the top 100 ranking of stocks for the first time in several quarters, to No. 3, said the report, which analyzed more than 1 million Gen Z accounts held by Apex's clearing arm.
GameStop, which retail investors piled in to last January in a social media-fueled attempt to punish short sellers, dropped five spots to No. 11, the report showed. Meme stocks with less mainstream buzz fell more, with e-commerce platform Wish's owner, ContextLogic, down 35 spots at No. 56 and biopharmaceutical company Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN) Inc dropping 41 spots to No. 91.
Electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive Inc, which went public in November, debuted at No. 44, while Chinese EV maker NIO held the No. 8 spot and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co was No. 19.
Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms Inc rose a couple of notches to No. 12, while Roblox rose 36 spots to No. 36.
""There's a lot more interest in metaverse,"" Apex Chief Executive Officer Bill Capuzzi said in an interview. ""As more NFT companies become public, we'll probably see them move in to the top 100.""

The metaverse generally refers to shared virtual world environments which people can access via the internet, often making use of virtual reality or augmented reality.
Payment companies were also popular with young investors, with Paypal Inc jumping 9 spots from the third quarter to No. 19, while Block, formerly called Square, was steady at No. 25.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 10:40AM ET</span>",Factbox-Women's quotas on company boards: The EU's frontrunners and laggards,"By Sabine Siebold
(Reuters) - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is making a new push at boosting women's representation on company boards, trying to unblock European legislation for a women's quota that has been stuck since 2012.
Germany has been among those EU countries resisting a quota, arguing the matter should be settled at a national level, but the new government in Berlin is now taking a fresh look at it.
Following are some facts on the proposed legislation and the state of play in the bloc regarding gender balance in top corporate positions.
WHAT IS THE LEGAL PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE?
In 2012, the European Union's executive proposed that listed companies in the bloc must fill at least 40% of non-executive board seats with women. The target would be reached by giving priority to the candidate of the under-represented sex when equally qualified persons apply for the same job. 
The proposed directive does not set out sanctions, but companies not achieving the goal would have to explain why and spell out what steps they will take to meet the target.
The proposed directive does not apply to firms with fewer than 250 employees or to unlisted companies. It would affect some 2,300 companies in the EU, according to estimates.
WHAT'S HOLDING UP THE LEGISLATION?
A majority of 18 of the 27 EU countries support the directive, but that is not enough for the super majority needed for approval. 
Eight countries - Denmark, Estonia, Croatia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and Slovakia - have opposed the proposal, arguing the issue should be regulated at a national level.
Under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany sided with this group, but the new government says it will take a fresh look at the issue. Should Berlin drop its opposition, it would tip the balance in favour of the legislation, experts say.
NATIONAL QUOTAS SO FAR
Eight EU countries have adopted national mandatory gender quotas for listed companies (Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Portugal, Greece, the Netherlands).
Ten have taken a softer approach, using a range of measures and initiatives (Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Spain, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden).
Nine countries have not taken substantial action (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Slovakia). 
FRONTRUNNER FRANCE
France has the strongest representation of women in the boardrooms of the biggest listed companies at 45.3%, according to the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), against a 30.6% average for the EU as a whole.
THE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS
Starting from a similar level of around 13% in 2011 across the EU member states, the share of women on company boards has risen 
- to 36.4% in countries that adopted laws to promote more women to top positions

- to 30.3% in countries taking soft measures
- to 16.6% in countries that have taken no action, according to the EIGE.

Analyst Michael Morris downgraded Walt Disney shares to neutral from buy, setting a price target of $165, down from $205.
Morris explained the downgrade resulted from their updated view of the ""pace of profit growth at the company's direct-to-consumer and parks businesses, which is now below consensus through fiscal 2024.""
The analyst also cited Disney's digital growth challenges, parks trend volatility and cost inflation as further reasons for the lower rating.
""We do see positive business signs, including ahead of consensus F1Q22 Disney+ subscriber additions (our 10mm versus consensus 6.8mm) bolstered by Hulu + Live bundling. However, broader business pressure has us revisit our target 12-month valuation, now at $165 as detailed within,"" Morris said.

Investing.com – BlackRock stock (NYSE:BLK) fell 2.4% on Friday on concerns the fund giant is likely to get into investment mode again, a move that could keep its profit margin under pressure.
""Looking forward, they are going into investment mode again,"" Reuters quoted Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders as saying. ""They are going to spend a lot, and that is probably going to make it tough for them to really have meaningful profit margin and EPS growth in 2022,” he said, as quoted by the agency.  
For the fourth quarter ended December 31, Blackrock’s 14% gain in revenue, to $5.10 billion, just met expectations while adjusted profit per share of $10.42 topped estimates.
Performance fees, the sole revenue stream to erode in the fourth quarter, fell by $90 million, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative products.
Assets under management at the world's largest money manager scaled a new peak of $10 trillion by the end of December, up from $8.68 trillion a year earlier.
""Our business is more diversified than ever before – active strategies, including alternatives, contributed over 60% of 2021 organic base fee growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in a statement. 
Net inflows for the quarter were at $212 billion, of which long-term net flows accounted for $169 billion.
ETFs attracted a net $104 billion, 11% higher than a year ago and a record for the company, Blackrock said.
BlackRock now manages $2.6 trillion in actively-managed funds that include ETFs and mutual funds. The firm’s alternatives business, which includes hedge funds, saw $5.5 billion of inflows, taking total assets to $265 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Friday, after disappointing retail sales and industrial production data both pointed to the effects of sustained inflation on both consumers and industry. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 285 points, or 0.8%, at 35,829 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite meanwhile eked out a gain of 0.2%, outperforming on perceptions that any slowdown in the economy would reduce the need for interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
There was no such hint, however, in comments made later by Minnesota Fed President Neel Kaskhari, habitually the most 'dovish' of all the policymakers at the top of the Fed. Wire reports quoted Kashkari as saying the Fed was ""surprised"" by how persistent inflation had become.  
Earlier, official data showed retail sales fell by 1.9% in December, their biggest monthly drop since February. While some factors made the figures look worse than they actually were - shoppers afraid of product shortages appear to have moved up their purchases to October and November last year - the figures still indicated a broad weakening in consumer spending. Core retail sales, which exclude some volatile items like automobiles, fell an especially sharp 2.3%.
Marc Ostwald, chief economist for ADM ISI in London, warned that the figures were even worse when considering that they were not adjusted for inflation.
""It may be that rising prices are also taking their toll,"" Ostwald said via Twitter. The figures still need to be taken in the context of a banner year for U.S. consumer spending, reflected overnight in another record annual trade surplus for China of over $670 billion. Even now, U.S. consumers are still sitting on substantial savings accumulated during the pandemic. 
Elsewhere, industrial production also fell 0.1% in the month, in contrast to expectations of a 0.2% increase. 
The mood also suffered somewhat from some disappointing earnings from the U.S.'s biggest banks. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 5.0% after its quarterly update pointed to a struggling performance by its lending and markets divisions, although its dealmakers and capital markets divisions enjoyed another solid quarter.   Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock also fell 2.4% after similar weakness in the consumer-facing divisions. The two reports made for an underwhelming start to the fourth-quarter earnings season, although earnings from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), up 1.8%, were better received. 
Elsewhere, casino operators soared after reports indicated that they will be able to carry on doing business as usual in Macau, the gambling center of China.  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) stock rose 15% while Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock rose 8.8%. The news removes a long-standing concern about the companies' prospects.
Covid vaccine stocks continued to suffer after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the Biden administration's efforts to impose a test-or-vaccine mandate on large private-sector employers.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 2.9% while  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock fell 5.9%.

Google, which employs 6,400 people in Britain, plans a multi-million pound refurbishment of its offices within the Central Saint Giles development it is buying, close to Covent Garden in central London.
""We have been privileged to operate in the UK for nearly 20 years, and our purchase of the Central Saint Giles development reflects our continued commitment to the country's growth and success,"" said Ruth Porat, CFO of Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Google said it would eventually have capacity for 10,000 workers at its UK sites, including one being developed in the nearby King's Cross area of London.

813,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 09:46AM ET</span>",Analysis-Marooned: Risk of catching Omicron abroad delays airline recovery,"By Jamie Freed and Alexander Cornwell
SYDNEY/ABU DHABI (Reuters) -Before the Omicron variant of coronavirus burst onto the scene in November, retired Australian Glenn Turnley was looking forward to a three-week trip to Japan, Britain and France in March - his first overseas jaunt since the pandemic began.
Even though he is fully vaccinated and boosted, Turnley says the high transmissibility of Omicron means he is likely to cancel - even if Japan opens its borders to foreigners.
""I was worried less with Delta because the vaccines that were available, they seemed to be doing the trick,"" he said. 
""I don't want to spend any part of a holiday in quarantine or anything like that anywhere, especially in a foreign country.""
While the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 infection is potentially less severe, for many airlines it is proving as disruptive as the Delta variant and has dampened the first quarter outlook.
Its high transmissibility has led to tighter border rules in many countries and heightened the risk of even fully vaccinated travellers testing positive after they arrive and then being stranded at the destination for weeks, denting confidence.
""Clearly there are uncertainties so if you catch COVID you may get stuck in a country which is quite unpredictable to you,"" said Jozsef Varadi, chief executive of European low-cost airline Wizz Air, which also operates in Abu Dhabi. 
""So I don't think that demand is fully back but we are certainly seeing some people who might be prepared to take more risk in life in general coming back to travel.""
Omicron's speed of spread leading to staff shortages and shortened COVID-19 test timeframes makes it a major concern, said Olivier Ponti, vice president of insights at travel trends firm ForwardKeys. 
ForwardKeys data shows international flight bookings are running at 38% of 2019 levels, well below an October peak of 58%, though up from an early December low.
FRESH TRAVEL HURDLES
Even people willing to take the risk of travelling as Omicron spreads face hurdles from fast-changing rules.
Brisbane-based business development executive Greg Lauer said he and three colleagues were planning to visit his firm's headquarters in Hyderabad, India, next week, having booked in mid-December.
Two pulled out nearly immediately over the Omicron risks, though he and another colleague were willing to continue.
""The biggest risk was getting stuck,"" Lauer said. ""I have comprehensive insurance and am vaxxed and boosted.""
But then India last week reintroduced mandatory quarantine for foreign arrivals, so he cancelled the trip.
A recent survey of U.S. travellers by broker Jefferies found Omicron had led 20% Of respondents to cancel plans due to case counts and another 20% due to restrictions at the destination.
Omicron also poses a threat to recovery in the lucrative business travel segment. Major companies are further delaying the return to offices and some big events like the World Economic Forum https://www.reuters.com/business/world-economic-forum-defers-davos-meeting-amid-pandemic-2021-12-20 in Davos have been postponed. 
""The impact from Omicron for the first quarter is significant and in some markets more significant than the impact from Delta,"" said Singapore-based analyst Brendan Sobie.
PAUSE IN BOOKINGS
Even where demand exists, serving it has become harder.
Airlines from the United States https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/united-airlines-ceo-says-about-3000-employees-test-positive-covid-19-2022-01-11, Australia https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/virgin-australia-cut-capacity-by-25-covid-19-cases-rise-2022-01-10 and Finland are among those struggling to find enough crew to staff flights given that so many are infected or isolating as close contacts of COVID-19 cases. 
Global carriers this week slashed capacity by 7.2%, one of the largest week-on-week drops in the last six months, travel data firm OAGs said. That includes a 44% cut at Europe's Ryanair and 17% at Lufthansa.
""International ticket sales made in December and early January fell sharply compared to 2019, suggesting a more difficult first quarter than had been expected,"" International Air Transport Association Director General Willie Walsh said.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian said international bookings had ""paused"" due to border restrictions but he expected a strong spring and summer on trans-Atlantic routes once rules eased due to pent-up demand.
In a potential positive over the medium term, the huge wave of Omicron cases globally has spurred some hopes that COVID-19 could be on its way to becoming endemic like the flu, which did not complicate international travel.
Yet for now, travellers will have to weigh the risks of each trip, said Irene Lai, global medical director at International SOS, which advises companies on health and security.

""Travel is just very complicated,"" said Sydney-based Lai, who does not plan to take overseas holidays until at least 2023. 
""We see this all the time: that a country's entry requirements can just change with no notice,"" she said. ""So potentially you can get stuck.""

Although Waymo and other companies have been developing autonomous driver technology for over a decade, large-scale commercial operations of such services for moving freight or everyday commute have not come to fruition yet.
U.S. trucking and delivery firms are already struggling with driver shortages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, difficult working conditions and an aging workforce.

Investing.com – Peloton stock (NASDAQ:PTON) stock fell 4% in premarket trading on news that Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) will replace the stock in the Nasdaq 100.
Old Dominion will replace the maker of fitness equipment in other indices as well, including the Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index and the Nasdaq 100 Ex-Technology Index. All the changes are effective Jan. 24.
Much as the tweak is an acknowledgement of Old Dominion’s growing business in a boom time for logistic businesses, it also reflects the fall of Peloton, one of the biggest winners of the pandemic because shut-in people used its machines to exercise at home.
As the pandemic waned, the company struggled to retain its clients as people returned to their walks and runs and to gyms.
Its attempts to tap the mass market by lowering the price of its flagship exercise bike fell flat.
The company also struggled with the recall of its treadmill machine. The stock now trades around $32 a share, less than one-fifth of its high of $166.5 struck less than a year ago.
On the other hand, Old Dominion’s stock has almost doubled in a year and trades about 15% off its high. The stock was up 3% in premarket.
Late last month, Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler drew attention to another soft quarter for the company amid increasing costs and supply chain bottlenecks.
For the second quarter ended December, Peloton expects revenue to come in between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. For the full year, the company has guided for revenue of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion."

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) says its fast electric vehicle chargers are on the cusp of becoming more profitable than filling up a petrol car. 
The milestone will mark a significant moment for BP which wants to shift away from oil and expand operations in power markets and around electric vehicles (EV).
EV charging has for years been a loss-making business as a whole for BP and rivals as they invest heavily in its expansion. The division is not expected to turn profitable before 2025 but on a margin basis, BP's fast battery charging points, which can replenish a battery within minutes, are nearing levels they see from filling up with petrol.
""If I think about a tank of fuel versus a fast charge, we are nearing a place where the business fundamentals on the fast charge are better than they are on the fuel,"" BP's head of customers and products Emma Delaney told Reuters.
Strong and rising demand for rapid battery chargers in Britain and Europe, has already brought profit margins close to those for traditional petrol filling, she said.
Delaney did not disclose profit and loss for EV charging or when overall profit from the business could eclipse traditional fuel. In 2020 BP reported a gross margins for retail fuel sales of $3.5 billion. Its customers and products division made $2.6 billion in net profit in the first nine months of 2021, around 17% of the company's total profit.
The company also said that electricity sales for EV charging grew 45% in the third quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter.
According to consultancy Thunder Said Energy, the traditional fuel retail margin at petrol stations is about 17 cents per gallon, roughly 0.4 cents per kilowatt hour.
London-based BP plans to grow its EV charging business in the coming years to 70,000 charging points by 2030 from 11,000 now.
Like rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), BP's retail business, which includes fuel sales and convenience stores, is highly profitable and central in its energy transition strategy.
""Overall, we see a huge opportunity in fast charging for consumers and businesses, as well as fleet services more generally - that's where we see the growth, and where we see the margins,"" Delaney said.
Shell aims to have 500,000 charging points globally by 2025. On Thursday it opened its first ultra-fast EV charging station in London, which can charge 80% of a car battery in 10 minutes. 
While rivals like Shell are investing in a range of charging technologies including tens of thousands of slower, low voltage, on-street charging points in Britain and elsewhere, BP is focusing on fast and ultra-fast charging technology.
""We've made a choice to really go after high speed, on the go charging - rather than slow lamppost charging for example,"" Delaney said.
Fast charging, defined as more than 50 kilowatt, and super-fast charging at more than 150 kilowatt, are however expensive to install as they require large investment in heavy-duty power infrastructure.
""Historically, many operators have struggled to make money out of EV charging, that's been like the worst kept secret in the industry,"" said Adrian Del Maestro, director at PwC Strategy&.

The drive to expand EV charging points also aims at keeping a strong stream of customers at BP's petrol stations and their adjacent convenience stores.
""There has been a land grab by charge point operators, including the oil majors, to buy real estate and build infrastructure, with a view to generating growth revenues in the future,"" Del Maestro said.

One of the offers, which first came in June from USR Parent Inc, the parent of Staples and a portfolio company of private equity firm Sycamore Partners, had quoted $1 billion in cash for the division.
ODP, the parent of  Office Depot  (NASDAQ:ODP) and OfficeMax brands, said it received a second offer in December, without disclosing the terms of the non-binding proposal or the name of the party. 
""(The company) has determined to delay further work on the separation in order to avoid incurring potentially unnecessary separation costs while it focuses on a potential sale of the consumer business,"" ODP said in a statement.
ODP said in May it expected to complete a spin off its distribution platform, which schools, offices and other businesses use to buy supplies, into a separate company in the first half of this year.

The company said it still remains in talks with Sycamore, which reiterated its interested in November in the unit that includes the Office Depot and OfficeMax retail store businesses, while evaluating the regulatory risk of a potential deal.
ODP on New Year's Eve said it had sold its CompuCom Systems division, which provides technology support and services to companies, to an affiliate of private equity firm Variant Equity in a deal valued up to $305 million.

MILAN (Reuters) -A boardroom battle at Generali (MI:GASI) has escalated after the No.2 investor in Italy's biggest insurer resigned from the board in a challenge to the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet.
Donnet's bid for a new term as chief executive is at the centre of a struggle among Generali's biggest investors, including construction and newspaper magnate Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who stepped down from the board on Thursday.
""It seems we may be reaching some 'crunch point',"" Autonomous Research said. 
Caltagirone has teamed up with eyewear billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio to challenge the influence of investment bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Generali's biggest investor.
Caltagirone holds 8.04% of Generali, trailing Mediobanca's 12.8% stake. Del Vecchio is the No.3 investor with nearly 7%. 
The two tycoons blame Mediobanca, which reaps a sizeable share of its income from Generali, for holding back the insurer's expansion, people close to the matter have said.
Donnet, who is backed by Mediobanca and a majority of board members, in December announced Generali's first buyback in 15 years and higher dividends.
With Italy's financial sector in consolidation mode, the shareholder tensions are fuelling speculation about possible M&A moves involving both Generali and Mediobanca. 
Del Vecchio, 86, became Mediobanca's biggest shareholder in 2019. Caltagirone has also recently built a stake in the Milanese investment bank that used to pull the strings of Italy's biggest companies thanks to its extensive shareholdings. 
GROWING HOSTILITY
Caltagirone and Del Vecchio are set to present their own CEO candidate next month, along with an alternative strategy for the insurer, a person close to the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Caltagirone's offensive began in April when he snubbed a general meeting to approve Generali's results.
In a sign of growing hostility, he voted against Donnet's new strategy in December and has not attended board meetings lately, a second person with knowledge of the matter said.
He tendered his resignation in a three-page letter addressed to the Generali chairman, the source said.
Generali said on Thursday that Caltagirone had complained he had been prevented from giving his ""critical contribution"" to matters such as the group's new business plan or board nominees.
The company's current board could begin the selection process for its renewal as early as next week.
Caltagirone and Del Vecchio in September struck a pact to consult over moves at Generali. After increasing their respective stakes and bringing smaller investor CRT on board, they control a combined holding of a little more than 16%.
The pact is intact after Caltagirone's decision, a third source close to Del Vecchio said.

To carry more weight at a shareholder meeting in April to name the new board, Mediobanca has borrowed shares to reach a 17% voting stake. 
But about 35% of Generali's share capital is in the hands of institutional investors and small savers hold another 23%, meaning their votes are likely to decide the outcome.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 08:46AM ET</span>","Reliance, Hyundai, Mahindra bid for incentives under India's $2.4 billion battery scheme","By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries, South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co and automaker Mahindra & Mahindra are among companies that have submitted bids under the country's $2.4 billion battery scheme, two sources told Reuters.
India last year finalised an incentive program to encourage companies to invest in the local manufacturing of batteries as it looks to establish a domestic supply chain for clean transport and build storage for renewable energy.
Friday is the last day to submit technical bids. 
Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group-backed Ola Electric, engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro and battery makers Amara Raja and Exide have also submitted bids, the sources said.
None of the companies named by the sources immediately responded to requests for comment.
India wants to establish a total of 50 gigawatt hours (Gwh) of battery storage capacity over five years, which it expects will attract direct investment of about $6 billion.
To qualify for the incentives, companies must set up at least 5 Gwh of storage capacity and meet certain local content conditions, all of which would require a minimum investment of more than $850 million.
Around 10 companies have submitted bids totalling close to 100 Gwh, the sources said. 
India was also encouraging global companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Samsung (KS:005930), LG Energy, Northvolt and Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) to invest. 

Clean auto technology is a key part of India's strategy for cutting pollution in major cities and reducing oil dependence. But electric vehicles (EVs) currently make up a fraction of total sales in the country mainly due to their high price as batteries are imported. 
The South Asian country wants electric cars to make up 30% of private car sales by 2030 and for electric motorcycles and scooters to make up 40% of such sales, driving demand for batteries which currently contribute about 35% to 40% of the total vehicle cost.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",Five things we learnt from UK retailers' Christmas updates,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the biggest names in British retail have published Christmas trading updates over the past few days. What have we learnt from the flood of announcements?
1) CHRISTMAS WAS MERRIER THAN EXPECTED
Expectations going into Christmas weren't great as the supply chain crisis meant stock levels were lower than planned in some areas such as clothing.
In the event sales have proved pretty robust, which was testament to the strength of consumer demand with spending power boosted by a lack of alternatives.
Supermarket groups, such as market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury's, got a boost in sales as more customers avoided bars and restaurants due to the Omicron variant of coronavirus and celebrated at home instead.
Britons also indulged themselves with champagne and other more expensive foods.
2) BRITONS ARE BRAVING SUPERMARKET AISLES
December saw the largest number of in-store supermarket visits since March 202O, according to market researcher Kantar, as consumers appeared more confident about visiting stores despite rising COVID-19 case numbers.
Conversely, online grocery sales fell in December by 3.7% against 2020 and accounted for 12.2% of sales, down from a February peak of over 15%.
Some of the cost benefits of having a physical presence as well as online also emerged, with clothing retailer Next for example handling online product returns at its stores.
3) AT LAST! MARKS & SPENCER'S REVIVAL APPEARS REAL
After over a decade of false dawns investors are beginning to believe that one of Britain's most elusive retail recoveries could finally materialise.
Another strong trading update from the 138-year old food and clothing retailer, still one of the biggest names in British business, showed that better trading in the first half of last year wasn't a flash in the pan.
M&S, which has a partnership with online retailer Ocado (LON:OCDO), is now Britain's fastest growing food retailer, while full price sales in clothing have been strong, which is boosting its profit margins.
In contrast online fast fashion retailers ASOS (LON:ASOS) and Boohoo are showing growing pains and their combined market capitalisation is now less than M&S's.
4) TRACKSUITS AND SPORTS SHOES IN DEMAND
Britons may not be the fittest but they love a tracksuit and a pair of trainers as evidenced by the phenomenal growth of JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion, which has driven a market capitalisation of over 10 billion pounds ($13.7 billion).
A trading update showing 10% sales growth and a chunky upgrade to its earnings outlook mean the group is now challenging Next as Britain's most profitable clothing retailer.
It has exported the formula with brands such as Finish Line and Shoe Palace in the United States.
5) HOLD TIGHT, 2022 COULD BE A BUMPY YEAR
While Christmas trading exceeded hopes, retailers have warned that 2022 is looking to be a tough year shaped by the spectre of inflation.
This is a global issue, with Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo warning it will have to raise prices of some products due to higher costs for raw materials and shipping.
British consumers are facing a cost of living crisis due to fast-rising inflation, surging energy bills and tax increases, leaving retailers, already battling issues from labour shortages to rising transport and logistics costs, looking at a tougher trading environment.

Retailers could also be hit by consumers shifting their spending to overseas holidays and other leisure attractions as more COVID-19 restrictions ease.

Investing.com – Shares of companies making Covid vaccines were taking a knock in premarket trading a day after the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration’s workplace vaccine-or-test mandate for larger private employers.
 Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock took the biggest hit, losing more than 10%. The company is more than a year behind bringing a vaccine to the market and is yet to seek FDA’s nod for emergency use. It has secured the nod from WHO and in U.K., the E.U., India and in a few more countries.
BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) lost 5% while its partner,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), fell 1.6%.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) was down 5.4% while Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the least affected since it draws only  minuscule revenue from the vaccines, shed 0.6%.
The conditions for businesses with 100 or more employees would have applied to an estimated 84 million workers. The court ruled the administration didn’t have the unilateral power to impose a mandate that employers ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested every week to detect coronavirus.
The ruling comes at a time when omicron, the most contagious of the coronavirus variants, has led to record infections in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. According to New York Times, an average of more than 803,000 coronavirus cases have been reported each of the last seven days in the U.S., an increase of 133% from two weeks ago.
Corporates, after keeping offices shut for almost two years, are beginning to reopen workplaces while a large number of their workers remain reluctant to get the vaccine."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Employees at 40 branches of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Postbank are staging brief, warning strikes on Friday and Saturday as they cite rising inflation to demand higher wages, a union official said.
The strikes precede a week of separate wage negotiations for the broader banking industry in Germany.
For months, unions and management at Germany's private and public sector banks have held multiple rounds of wage talks. The outcome so far has been deadlock, punctuated by brief labour stoppages. Negotiations for both sectors, affecting some 200,000 workers, resume next week.
Meanwhile, inflation in Europe's largest economy has gathered pace. In December, the national consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.3% year-on-year, the highest since June 1992 and an acceleration in price pressures after 5.2% in November.
Unions are using inflation as an argument for higher wages when German banks, faced with stiff competition, are trying to cut costs and reduce headcount. Central banks worry that higher wages could further entrench inflation.
Roman Eberle from the Verdi labour union said this week's Postbank strikes involve around 300 employees and inflation is a major concern for the 15,000 staff affected by the outcome of talks that began earlier this week.
Labour unions went into those talks seeking a 6% wage increase. They resume in February.
""Deutsche Bank regrets the union's early call for warning strikes after the first round of negotiations and will do everything to minimise the impact of the warning strikes on Postbank's customers,"" the bank said in a statement.
Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing has warned about inflation, saying it would ""persist for longer"" and central banks needed to act ""sooner rather than later"" to counter it.
Separately from the Postbank talks, Germany's private sector bank wage negotiations resume on Monday. Unions have wanted a 4.5% increase for the 140,000 staff represented in the talks.
On Friday, Sabine Schmittroth, a Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) board member who is representing management in those talks, said that after six months, workers and banks need clarity.

""Now is the time for serious negotiations and pragmatic solutions. We are ready for that,"" she said.
Thursday marks the resumption of negotiations for 60,000 public sector bank employees, such as those who work for Germany's state-owned Landesbanken and development banks such as KfW. They are also seeking a 4.5% pay increase.

Currently in China's equity market, stocks are settled on the day they are traded but cash settles the next day.

Global investors have long hoped that China can reform its settlement system. The differences create additional costs and risks for overseas investors and their brokers, ASIFMA, the financial industry body, has said.

Investing.com – JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock slipped 3.2% in Friday’s premarket trading after the Wall Street giant’s fourth-quarter revenue fell short of expectations.
The financial services giant, along with rivals like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), has had a record run for more than a year as the pandemic fueled demand for consumer loans and their advisory services in a booming capital market. Part of that business, mostly the consumer banking segment for JPMorgan, had a tough quarter as a supply crunch and elevated prices hit home.
Home lending revenue was down by more than a quarter as revenue from mortgage fees and related income more than halved. The company closed December with fewer home loan accounts on a year-on-year basis.
The card business suffered due to higher acquisition costs while lower operating lease income dealt a hit to the auto business. A tight automobile market, which manufacturers were unable to supply fully with new output, slowed auto loan originations to $8.5 billion, down 23%.
Combined debit and credit card spending was up 26% but average loans in both consumer and commercial banking businesses fell.
The bank’s investment banking continued to shine as its advisory services were sought for public offerings as well as M&A. Investment banking revenue soared 28% to $3.2 billion.
Markets revenue fell 11% after a record 2021 for equities but was up compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Fixed income markets revenue fell 16%, driven by rising government bond yields as well as lower revenue in credit, currency and emerging markets.
Overall, revenue fell a tad but still topped $29 billion. Net profit fell 14% but stayed above the $10-billion mark.

NEW YORK, NY (Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and computer software firm SAS are among major companies bowing out of what is billed as the retail industry's biggest annual trade show, slated to start Sunday in New York City's Javits Center. 
Target, which had at least five executives slated to attend, said it has reduced team travel and its execs including President of the Target Foundation Amanda Nusz would now host virtual sessions. SAS, which sponsored at least eight sessions, announced on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) it was also participating virtually. 
As the Omicron variant of COVID-19 has been ripping through New York, the National Retail Federation's (NRF) Big Show is the latest major convention to push forward with plans that could lead to a potential super spreader event.
At last week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES), nearly 70 attendees, including some Samsung (KS:005930) executives, tested positive for the virus. It was unclear whether they contracted the virus at the convention. 
One Twitter user said he canceled his NRF plans after contracting COVID-19 at the consumer electronics event. 
NRF is requiring conference attendees to show proof of vaccination and to wear masks. N95 and KN95 masks will be distributed along with COVID-19 rapid tests. 
""As we move from pandemic to endemic — a new environment in which we say life can and should go on — there’s going to be friction as we adjust. This year’s show is a step forward, and we believe it’s a necessary and meaningful one,"" NRF chief executive Matthew Shay said in a LinkedIn post. 
Executives from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), Best Buy and cloud-based retail platform NewStore are pressing on with plans to attend the 15,000-person retail trade show.
NewStore is hosting a booth but dialing back external activities for the retail show, according to chief marketing officer Phil Granof. The company is canceling networking dinners, one-on-one meetings and halving the number of employees at the conference to 20 from 40 in previous years. 
Granof said that as larger companies pull out, there is less competition for attention. Still, big corporations are not the only ones canceling plans. Gaming platform Unity said it dropped out ""after taking into account the current case numbers and employee and vendor comfort level.""
""I cancelled my plans last week. Missing it two years in a row after 15 yrs. [This year] would have been my 17th,"" ShiSh Shridhar, global retail head of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for Startups, said on Twitter. 

NRF in December released its updated COVID protocols, ensuring the conference had the green light to go on with 25,000 planned attendees and 900 exhibitors. By Jan. 12, the NRF said there were 15,000 confirmed attendees and 750 vendors. 
""The irony, of course, is as the attendance drops, the conference becomes safer,"" Granof said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening in a muted fashion Friday, with investors turning their attention to quarterly earnings from the major U.S. banks after the previous session’s sharp selloff.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded largely flat, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 15 points, or 0.1%.
The major indices on Wall Street closed sharply lower Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the decline. The tech-heavy index fell 2.5%, ending a three-day winning streak, as expectations of higher interest rates on the back of surging inflation and hawkish Fed-speak prompted investors to rotate out of growth and into value stocks..
However, attention is likely to shift Friday towards the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season for real, with the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) releasing results before the market opens.
The big banks are expected to benefit in the environment of rising bond yields, and investors will also be listening to what executives have to say about business and consumer borrowing and the health of the economy.

(Reuters) - U.S. railroad operator  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) said it was encouraging employees to work from home until Jan. 30, as the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus forces companies to rethink bringing employees back to office.
""We are still encouraging employees to report their vaccination status and get vaccinated,"" Union Pacific said in an emailed statement on Thursday.
The company, which operates in 23 states and connects East Coast ports to key terminals like Chicago, had suspended its COVID-19 vaccine mandate for employees last month after a judge blocked the Biden administration's inoculation rule for federal contractors.

About 73% of its 31,000 employees were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Dec. 8, the U.S. railroad operator had said.
Some U.S. companies are asking employees to work from home in a bid to prevent infection among staff as the Omicron variant rages through the country. 779,588 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States on average over the past week, a Reuters tally showed https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb.

Investing.com – Virgin Galactic stock (NYSE:SPCE) edged 1.5% higher in Friday’s premarket following the company’s pricing of a convertible debt issue that sent its stock tumbling on Thursday. 
The shares had lost almost a fifth of their value Thursday to a hit a two-year low on worries the convertible debt will dilute existing shareholders upon conversion and reduce earnings per share.
Debtors usually convert their debt into equity when the prevailing market price is above the conversion price. The space travel firm has set the conversion price of the debt at $12.79 per share, implying an appreciation of 27% from the stock’s Thursday close of $10.03. 
The company, which is yet to make its first profit, said Thursday it will raise $425 million through a convertible note due 2027 and take on another $75 million of debt under certain conditions. Interest at a rate of 2.5% per annum will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2022.

836,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 06:09AM ET</span>",Europe Energy Crisis Worsens With War Risk Compounding Gas Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s energy crisis intensified as the risk of war pushed up gas prices, power-plant halts were extended and the French government asked its biggest utility to take a $8.8 billion hit to protect consumers.
Power and gas prices surged on Friday with the prospect of military action in Ukraine increasing as geopolitical tensions escalated. Meanwhile nuclear giant Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF) sank the most on record after the government said it must sell power at a steep discount, and several reactors faced long outages.
“The risk of a potential new war in Ukraine and the effects this could have on the gas market continue to cause a lot of uncertainty,” analysts at Energi Danmark said. “German power climbs due to the news about reduced nuclear power production in France.”
German electricity for the third quarter soared as much as 25%, while benchmark European gas prices added as much as 13%.
Europe’s energy prices are extremely volatile. The region’s gas storage is draining faster than expected, increasing the focus on imports from Russia and raising concern that supplies will fall short in the event of a severe cold snap.
Pressure on the market extends beyond this winter. French and German power prices from April onward jumped Friday, with fewer nuclear reactors available to supply electricity.
Crippling Costs
The impact on household energy bills across the continent has left governments scrambling to find ways to help shield consumers from higher costs.
In France, the government is asking EDF to sell more power at a discount to market prices. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the increase in electricity bills for households and very small businesses will be capped at 4% this year, including 8 billion euros ($9.2 billion) of tax cuts on electricity consumption. Without the moves, prices would rise by 35% from Feb. 1.
And EDF’s troubles go further. During once-a-decade maintenance at its Civaux and Penly reactors, the company found defaults near welds on piping. Checking and repairing these is taking longer than expected, leaving the market short on supply and EDF without revenue from those units. The hit to earnings is likely to be about 6 billion euros, according to Jefferies International Ltd.
EDF shares tumbled as much as 25% on Friday, the biggest drop since they started trading in Paris in 2005.
“The longer nuclear outages will deepen and extend the ongoing energy crisis in Europe,” said Arne Bergvik, chief analyst at Swedish utility Jamtkraft AB. “The news is having such a big impact due to the strained situation for other fuels like gas or coal that will have to compensate for the lost nuclear output.”
In the European gas market, all eyes are on Russian flows, with fears mounting over possible conflict in Ukraine -- a key transit country. The U.S. is putting pressure on European allies to agree on potential sanctions against Russia, worried that the country might soon invade its neighbor -- though Russia has repeatedly said that is not its plan. Talks between the U.S. and Moscow this week failed to ease tensions.
At the center of supply concerns lies the newly built Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which won’t ship Russian gas to Germany before regulatory approvals are completed. On Thursday, the U.S. Senate blocked a measure to impose fresh sanctions on the link after the Biden administration warned it could disrupt allied unity in the confrontation over Ukraine.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 05:55AM ET</span>","S.Korea court exempts teens, supermarkets from vaccine passes","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Friday ruled that large shops and teenagers should be temporarily excluded from COVID-19 vaccine pass mandates in the capital Seoul, part of an intensifying legal fight over one of Asia's strictest vaccination policies. 
A group of more than 1,000 doctors, professors and ordinary citizens filed for an injunction last week against Seoul's mayor to suspend the mandates, which require vaccination passes or testing for entry to most public facilities except for schools.
An administrative court in the capital said department stores, supermarkets and shops in Seoul that have 3,000 square meters (32,300 square feet) or more of space should be exempted.
The court said the mandate should not apply to teenagers using any Seoul-based facilities. 
The health ministry said it regretted the decision and would provide a formal response after an intra-agency meeting on Monday. Officials have said the policy was intended to protect unimmunised people, not force vaccination or discriminate against them.
The ruling marks an increasingly heated legal battle over South Korea's vaccine mandates. Last week, the court ordered https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-appeal-court-order-exempting-private-schools-vaccine-passes-2022-01-05 private education facilities such as cram schools, tuition centres and study cafes be exempted. The government then appealed the decision. 
The mandate at large grocery stores is ""excessive,"" the court said in the ruling, citing their necessity in daily lives and relatively low chances of coronavirus transmission.
It also said the mandate for teenagers lacked ""reasonable grounds"" given their significantly low rates of serious illness and deaths from COVID-19. 
Earlier on Friday, the government extended tougher social distancing rules for three more weeks amid concerns about the highly contagious Omicron coronavirus variant ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays. 
The curbs were restored a month ago just six weeks after being eased under a ""living with COVID-19"" scheme, as new cases and critically ill patients threatened to saturate the medical system. 
Daily tallies have dropped since, with 4,542 new cases for Thursday from a peak of almost 8,000 in mid-December, but the downward trend appeared to bottom out this week. Total infections rose to 683,566, with 6,259 deaths. 
The extended curbs include a 9 p.m. curfew for restaurants, cafes and bars.
Omicron's share of domestically transmitted infections has reached 20% in just two weeks, and it will become dominant within two weeks, possibly sending daily tallies up to an unprecedented 20,000 in February and 30,000 in March without stricter curbs, officials said. 

The Lunar New Year break begins on Jan. 29, and normally tens of millions of Koreans would travel country-wide for family gatherings during one of the country's main holidays.
Nearly 95% of South Korean adults have been fully vaccinated and more than 50% have received a booster shot.

Investing.com – Stocks of casino operators jumped in Friday’s premarket trading following new proposals from the Macau administration suggesting business continuity for the current licensees on the island.
Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), Melco Resorts (NASDAQ:MLCO) and  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) were up over 5% each while MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) was up 3% premarket. In Hong Kong trading, Sands China (HK:1928) closed 7.1% higher while Galaxy Entertainment (HK:0027) rose 3.4%.
The shares had been under pressure as the companies, with licenses expiring in June, feared they might not be renewed. The proposals do suggest tighter oversight and stricter conditions for operating but rule out an abrupt end to the existing operations, thus removing a key overhang for the stocks.
According to Reuters, the Macau government will issue licenses to six concessionaires with permission to operate for up to 10 years. The government said all existing or potential operators need to apply through a new tender process.
The administration also wants to increase the proportion of local ownership in casino firms to 15% from the current 10%.
Macau lies off Hong Kong and is part of China. Local authorities have earlier called for tighter supervision of casino operators and higher local ownership in gaming companies operating in the region.
China has been clamping down on high-stakes betting in Macau which takes place in convertible Hong Kong dollars. It is believed the gambling trades enable illicit outflow of currency and money-laundering efforts."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The world's top condom maker, Malaysia's Karex Bhd, expects demand to top pre-pandemic levels this year on consumer buying of premium products and restocking by federal health agencies.
Sales to brands such as Durex rose 30% in fiscal 2021 and accounted for 60% of its revenue, up from 49% a year earlier.
""When there was a 40% drop in terms of global consumption, Karex's ... consumer segment has continued to grow,"" CEO Goh Miah Kiat told Reuters on Friday. 
""This year, I expect the demand to recover to pre-pandemic times. Sales value could increase even more as consumers are buying more premium products."" 
Sales are increasing particularly at the company's consumer business, after the pandemic triggered lockdowns, shutting factories and hampering social activities, Goh told Reuters. 
He declined to provide outlook numbers.
In the year ended June 2021, the company's sales grew 6%, versus 4% in the previous year, though it logged its first annual loss since listing in 2013. 
For fiscal 2022, analysts expect sales to grow 9%, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.
Goh said demand would be buoyed by restocking by distributors and government departments which have been depleted over the past two years. 
""We're starting to see a lot of orders coming in on an emergency basis,"" Goh said.
The company is also planning to launch new products this year, including a condom made of synthetic material, and is looking to diversify into medical glove manufacturing, Goh said.

It will start out with a target to produce 500 million gloves at its plant in Thailand by March and aims to increase production to a full capacity of 2.5 billion in three years, Goh said.

(Reuters) - Experian (OTC:EXPGF) sees growing demand for its services in the booming buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) sector as it adds more clients to the unit, the world's largest credit data firm said on Friday after a strong third quarter.
BNPL is a segment that is becoming more mainstream and Experian's clients are demanding the company's services to know whether an applicant is real or fraudulent, Chief Communication Officer Nadia Ridout-Jamieson told Reuters. 
""The interesting thing about buy now pay later, is that more people want to know what it means for the total indebtedness of the consumer, or how is the consumer handling debts,"" Jamieson said. 
Jamieson said the company has added a lot of clients in the past year in its new BNPL segment.
Buy-now-pay-later services have exploded in popularity. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Inc recorded five times higher volumes on its BNPL platform on Black Friday 2021 compared to 2020.
Experian reported a 14% jump in its third-quarter revenue on Friday, fuelled by robust demand for its services to consumers and businesses in North America. 
Demand for credit reports and scores has been rising in Experian's main markets following the lifting of coronavirus restrictions, flexible lending criteria and low interest rates that have helped revive lending and marketing activities by clients.
The Ireland-based company benefited from U.S. consumers showing strong demand for credit in 2021, while applications for credit overall rebounded to 2019 levels, according to a survey released by the New York Federal Reserve November.
Experian said it expects its annual revenue to grow between 16% and 17%, above an earlier forecast of a 15% to 17% jump. The London-listed firm, however, narrowed its organic revenue forecast for the year, dented by weakness in its Europe, Middle East and Africa markets. 

Its shares are down 1.7% in early morning trading.
The company said it expects strong growth in its fourth quarter, and that weakness in its Europe, Middle East and Africa markets would subside.

The company raised both its total revenue growth as well as organic revenue growth estimates, but changes were made only to the lower end of the guidance range in either case.
Experian (LON:EXPN) said it is expecting its annual revenue to grow between 16% and 17%, above an earlier forecast of 15% to 17%. Similarly, the organic revenue growth forecast has been revised to 12%-13%, as against 11%-13% estimated earlier.
North America, Experian’s largest market grew a strong 16%, but other key geographies like Latin America, the U.K., Europe and Asia Pacific were sluggish.
The company benefited from U.S. consumers’ appetite for credit in the second year of the pandemic. Demand for Experian’s credit scores and reports that contain key data on consumers was strong as its clients reached out to more of them to expand their business.
Total revenue grew 14% in the third quarter ended December 31. Organic revenue rose 11%. The company’s verification services won new clients in North America. A spike in short-term lending during the holiday season also helped volumes, according to the company.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) has agreed to sell its consumer business in four Southeast Asian markets to United Overseas Bank (OTC:UOVEY) (UOB) for about S$5 billion ($3.7 billion), bringing the U.S. bank closer to its goal of exiting retail operations in 13 markets.
The proposed acquisition by Singapore's UOB will be its biggest in two decades and double its retail customer base in the four markets in Southeast Asia, where the bank already has a substantial presence and competes with larger rivals including DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) and OCBC.
""From the integration standpoint, acquiring from a single, reputable seller with a uniform franchise will reduce complexity. One bank, one platform, one model,"" Wee Ee Cheong, UOB's deputy chairman and chief executive, told reporters and analysts at a briefing on Friday.
UOB, Southeast Asia's third-largest bank, is acquiring Citi's unsecured and secured lending portfolios, wealth management and retail deposit businesses in the four countries. This includes 24 branches.
Citi's consumer business in the markets employs about 5,000 employees, who will be transferred to UOB.
Kevin Kwek, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the deal will help UOB to ""play a bit of catch-up on scale"".
""It's good in that it is small and affordable, and at 1.2 times book, not too bad for Citi's assets which are known to be high quality.""
UOB shares rose 2.4% to a four-year high, outperforming in the Singapore market.
Citi's exit from Southeast Asia comes after CEO Jane Fraser said last year the bank would close retail operations in 13 markets, including 10 in Asia, to refocus on its more lucrative institutional and wealth management businesses.
""Focusing our business through these actions will facilitate additional investment in our strategic focus areas, including our institutional network across Asia Pacific, driving optimal returns for Citi,"" Peter Babej, Citi's Asia Pacific CEO, said in a statement.
Sources said local banks in Southeast Asia were also interested in Citi's assets but UOB clinched the deal after agreeing to buy all the four retail units.
UOB, which has a market value of about $$50 billion, has been keen to grow outside its core Singapore market, like its bigger Singapore peers, who are all building on a recovery from pandemic-hit markets.
Last year, Citi agreed to sell its Philippines' consumer banking franchise, wound down its South Korean consumer bank and sold its Australian consumer banking business. Earlier this week, it announced plans to sell its Mexican consumer banking business.
Citigroup had said it would also exit retail operations in India, Taiwan and China.
DEAL FINANCING
UOB is financing the deal through its excess capital, and said it remains comfortable maintaining its dividend policy of a 50% payout ratio.
The purchase price includes net asset value of about S$4 billion of the businesses being sold and a premium of S$915 million paid by UOB.
Excluding one-off transaction costs, UOB expects the deal to immediately boost its earnings per share and return on equity.
UOB said Citigroup's consumer business in the four markets had a customer base of 2.4 million as at June 30, 2021 and the operations generated income of S$500 million in the first half of 2021.
The acquisition will propel UOB to among the top 10 retail bank rankings in Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest economy, and place it among the top five retail banks in Malaysia.
Subject to regulatory approvals, UOB is targeting completing the deal in phases until the first quarter of 2024.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) (Singapore) is the financial adviser to UOB on the latest deal, while Allen & Overy LLP (Singapore) is the legal adviser.

846,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 03:45AM ET</span>","Analysis-With Evergrande debt relief deal, China signals stability trumps austerity","By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - If this week's developments at China's most indebted property developer are anything to go by, 2022 might see Beijing soften its attempts to purge the sector and make more allowances for economic stability.
China Evergrande Group, whose rocky financial situation has roiled Chinese property firms and global financial markets over the past year, got a reprieve this week after investors agreed to extend a payment date on a yuan bond.
The extension proposal, which a source familiar with the situation said had been implicitly greenlighted by regulators, offered investors a glimpse of what to expect from other property firms scrambling to service their debts. 
The sector has been at the fore of Beijing's attack on bloated industries, high debt levels and over-investment as it strives for common prosperity and higher-quality growth. 
But no one's quite sure how far the Communist Party is prepared to go to sacrifice the heavy contribution that real estate makes to the economy, or dispel unhealthy investor expectations of state bailouts.
Analysts said regulators seem to favour market-based debt workouts while trying to shore up investor and homebuyer confidence and soften the economic impact at a time of renewed focus on stability. It is a difficult balance.
""The concern seems to be primarily focused on homebuyers, secondarily on workers and contractor counterparties,"" said Charles Chang, senior director and China Country Lead at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. ""...the government is demonstrating that it would like the market to function.""
""Market discipline will continue to be a theme, but it won't just be for the real estate sector, it will be for other sectors as well. The government's view on this seems to be pretty clear.""
The stakes are high in a year in which President Xi Jinping is expected to secure an unprecedented third five-year term as president at the 20th Party Congress this fall. 
In a recent note, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts flagged the property market slowdown as the biggest threat to economic stability, noting that a 5 percentage point slowdown in investment could directly and indirectly lower GDP growth by as much as 0.7 percentage points. 
Analysts surveyed by Reuters this week expect China's economic growth to slow to 5.2% this year.
GROWTH WINNING 
The deal between Evergrande's Hengda Real Estate Group and holders of its 4.5 billion yuan ($707.60 million) bonds allowed the firm to avoid a technical default that could have complicated its restructuring.
The company has been struggling to repay more than $300 billion in liabilities, including nearly $20 billion of offshore bonds deemed in cross-default by ratings agencies last month after it missed payments.
It is not alone, with Chinese developers facing $116 billion in maturing debt this year, according to Refinitiv.
Graphic: Evergrande contagion, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xmvjonjgbpr/Pasted%20image%201639112002384.png Growing stress in the property sector has prompted Beijing to soften its clampdown at the margins, relaxing debt ratio rules dubbed the ""three red lines"" to ease acquisitions by state-owned developers. 
""For developments to continue and to limit contagion risks, it is important to avoid a large number of distressed firms. This is why policy support should arrive, be it through increased lending by state banks or through facilitating asset acquisitions by state-owned developers,"" said Wei-Liang Chang, an FX and credit strategist at DBS Bank in Singapore. 
At the same time, forcing some leveraged developers into debt restructurings could reinforce the message of credit discipline for developers and investors, he said.
Michael Pettis, a non-resident senior fellow at the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, expressed scepticism that Beijing would make significant progress in addressing property sector debt risks this year, noting that moves such as relaxing the three red lines have simply allowed the shifting of debt burdens to state-owned firms from the more constrained private sector.

""China hasn't really resolved the fundamental issue ... You can't have less debt and the same amount of growth. There's just no way. And because this is a politically important year, my guess is growth is going to win over yet again.""

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Friday, continuing the global selloff with hawkish comments from Fed policymakers pointing to imminent interest rate hikes, while strong growth data helped the U.K. market outperform.
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.8% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.2%.
The U.K. economy grew by a much stronger-than-expected 0.9% in November, with the world’s fifth-largest economy finally growing above its size just before the country went into its first Covid-19 lockdown in February 2020.
This positive news helped the FTSE 100 outperform its main European peers, but despite November's growth acceleration, the country’s GDP probably took a hit in December when the Omicron coronavirus variant first arrived in force.
Still, the overall tone in Europe is negative with Germany, the region’s growth driver, reporting Thursday another record of more than 81,000 Covid-19 infections in a day, Hungary announcing plans to make a fourth Covid shot available as cases soar, and the French Senate approving the government's latest measures to tackle the virus, including a controversial vaccine pass.
The main indices on Wall Street closed sharply lower Thursday and Asia followed suit as hawkish comments from a number of Federal Reserve policy makers pointed to early interest rate hikes in the U.S., the largest economy in the world.
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard became the latest U.S. central banker, during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, to state that interest rates will have to rise to combat sky-high inflation.
In corporate news, Electricite de France (PA:EDF) stock slumped over 20% after the energy giant issued a massive profit warning late Thursday, saying new measures by the French government to cap retail electricity prices will hit it hard in 2022. Problems at its reactors also led it to cut its output forecast by nearly 10%. Elsewhere in energy markets, benchmark gas futures in north-west Europe jumped 10% as talks between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine broke down, followed by a widespread cyberattack on Ukrainian government websites.
SAP (DE:SAPG) stock rose 1.3% after the German business software group said fourth-quarter revenue from its cloud computing business jumped 28% as more customers shifted their IT operations to its cloud business database.
Experian (OTC:EXPGF) stock fell 1.7% despite the world's largest credit data firm reporting on Friday a 14% jump in its third-quarter revenue as robust demand in North America compensated for weakness in its Europe, Middle East and Africa markets.
Assicurazioni Generali (MI:GASI) stock rose 0.5% after Europe’s third-insurer announced that director Francesco Caltagirone has resigned from the board amid a boardroom disagreement regarding the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet.
Oil prices pushed higher Friday and are still on course to end the week higher for the fourth consecutive week on the back of a tight supply market and a drop in U.S. crude inventories to 2018 lows.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $82.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1% to $85.29.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely lower Friday with investors digesting a selloff on Wall Street, although the U.K. surprised with strong growth data.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, but CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
Wall Street's major indexes closed sharply lower on Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite bearing the brunt of the selling, closing 2.5% lower, as hawkish comments from a number of Federal Reserve policy makers ended a three-day rally.
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard became the latest U.S. central banker, during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, to state that interest rates will have to rise to combat sky-high inflation.
Asian markets largely followed suit overnight, not helped by growth in China’s exports and imports ebbing in December, a sign of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.
Back in Europe, Germany, the region’s growth driver, reported Thursday another record of more than 81,000 Covid-19 infections in a day, Hungary announced plans to make a fourth Covid shot available as cases soar, and the French Senate approved the government's latest measures to tackle the virus, including a controversial vaccine pass.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc aims to start initial production of its much-anticipated Cybertruck by the end of the first quarter of 2023, pushing back its plan to begin production late this year, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
The person said the delay comes as Tesla is changing features and functions of the electric pickup to make a compelling product as competition heats up in the segment. 
Tesla is expected to make limited production of the Cybertruck in the first quarter of 2023 before increasing output, the source said. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla, the world's top electric car maker, makes electric sedans and sport utility vehicles but has missed out on the pickup truck segment, which is profitable and hugely popular in America.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Rivian Automotive are ahead of Tesla in launching electric pickups.
Ford said early this month it will nearly double annual production capacity for its red-hot F-150 Lightning electric pickup to 150,000 vehicles ahead of its arrival this spring at U.S. dealers.
Ford's market value breached $100 billion for the first time on Thursday when Tesla shares fell 6.7% and Rivian slumped 7.1%. 
CEO Elon Musk, who unveiled the futuristic vehicle in 2019, had already delayed its production from late 2021 to late 2022. 
Musk has said he will provide an updated product road map on Tesla's Jan. 26 earnings call. 
""Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare & it's not over!,"" he tweeted in late November, when asked about the Cybertruck. 

Tesla recently removed a reference to its production schedule from its Cybertruck order website. Last month, the website said, ""You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022."" Now ""in 2022"" has been omitted.
Tesla plans to produce the Cybertruck at its factory in Texas, which is expected to start production of Model Y cars early this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), now known as Meta Platforms, faces a 2.3 billion pound plus ($3.2 billion plus) class action in Britain over allegations it abused its market dominance by exploiting the personal data of 44 million users.
Liza Lovdahl Gormsen, a senior adviser to Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) watchdog and a competition law academic, said she was bringing the case on behalf of people in Britain who had used Facebook between 2015 and 2019.
The lawsuit, which will be heard by London's Competition Appeal Tribubal, alleges Facebook made billions of pounds by imposing unfair terms and conditions that demanded consumers surrender valuable personal data to access the network.
Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, the law firm representing Lovdahl Gormsen, has notified Facebook of the claim.
Facebook said people used its services because it delivered value for them and ""they have meaningful control of what information they share on Meta's platforms and who with."" 
The case comes days after Facebook lost an attempt to strike out an antitrust lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), one of the biggest challenges by the U.S. government against a tech company in decades as Washington attempts to tackle Big Tech's extensive market power.
""In the 17 years since it was created, Facebook became the sole social network in the UK where you could be sure to connect with friends and family in one place,"" Lovdahl Gornsen said. 
""Yet, there was a dark side to Facebook; it abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on ordinary Britons, giving it the power to exploit their personal data.""
Lovdahl Gormsen alleges Facebook collected data within its platform and through mechanisms like the Facebook Pixel, allowing it to build an ""all-seeing picture"" of Internet usage and generate valuable, deep data profiles of users. 

Opt-out class actions, like Lovdahl Gormsen's, bind a defined group automatically into a lawsuit unless individuals opt out.

The sector has been plagued by a slew of regulatory inquiries in Australia and the development highlights casino firms' shortcomings in managing strict oversight of alleged money laundering at their gambling hotspots.
The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) launched a probe in June into Star's casino in Sydney amid concerns over ongoing customer due diligence and compliance with laws.
Local media later reported on a confidential review that accused Star of failure to curb fraud and money laundering at its two resorts.
The investigation into Star will now include multiple entities under the company, AUSTRAC said on Friday, declining to comment further as the probe was ongoing.
The company said earlier in the day that it would fully co-operate with AUSTRAC's investigation.
Star's larger rival Crown Resorts has also faced misconduct inquiries in every state it operates in.

Crown on Thursday received a $6.5 billion buyout proposal from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc. Star itself had approached Crown for a deal last year before backing out over regulatory concerns.
Star's shares fell as much as 1.7% by afternoon trading, while the broader market was down about 1%.

Venture capital firms ramped up bets on technology, biotech, healthcare and fintech sectors, announcing a record 17,054 deals in the year.
It was also the best year on record for VC fundraising, which hit $128.3 billion across 730 funds. The figure, which breached the $100 billion-mark for the first time, was $40 billion higher than the previous record in 2020.

The frenetic pace of fund raising is expected to continue this year, as cash with venture capital firms remains at an all-time high, and returns outpace all other assets classes, the report added.
VC-backed companies going public or being bought out led to exits worth $774.1 billion in 2021, nearly 88% of which was realized through public listings.

The producer of magnetic rare-earth materials slid to as low as HK$28 on Friday. That’s versus an offer price of HK$33.80 apiece in the sale that raised HK$4.24 billion ($544 million). The Chinese company is already listed in Shenzhen.
JL MAG’s is the first offering to raise more than $500 million in Hong Kong this year as China’s crack down on several private enterprises plus the prospect of rising interest rates cast a shadow over deals in the Asian financial hub. The slow 2022 start contrasts with a busy kickoff in 2021, when 16 companies priced near $8 billion worth of shares last January, Bloomberg data show.
Shares of the 19 companies that debuted in Hong Kong over the past year after raising at least $500 million rose by an average 18% on the first day of trade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average gain among those that debuted over the past six months, though, was just 4%.
At the intraday low, LG MAG Rare-Earth was headed for the worst performance since Feb. 2018 for a Hong Kong listing bigger than $500 million. A-Living Smart City Services Co. declined 23% in its first session on Feb. 8, 2018. 
LG MAG Rare-Earth has said it aims to use proceeds of the share sale for construction of a production base in Ningbo, potential acquisitions through 2023 and expansion of a global industry-chain layout. Profit for the six months ending June 2021 was 220.6 million yuan ($35 million), a 141% jump over same period a year earlier, according to the company’s prospectus.

The potential battery JV between LGES and Honda could cost as much as 4 trillion won ($3.4 billion) and have an annual production capacity of up to 40 gigawatt hours (GWh) of batteries, enough to power 600,000 electric vehicles (EVs), the newspaper reported. The report did not have details, such as the timeline of when the JV would be built and begin operations. 
LGES, LG Chem Ltd's battery subsidiary, commands more than 20% of the global EV battery market and supplies Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) among others.
""We are discussing various ways to cooperate with automakers, including establishing joint ventures, but nothing has been decided,"" LGES said in a statement.
A Honda USA spokeswoman declined to comment on the story. 
""This is not something that Honda has announced. We cannot comment on speculation,"" said a spokesperson at Honda in Tokyo. 
Honda and its alliance partner GM plan to introduce two jointly developed large-sized EV models in North America, using GM's Ultium batteries, in 2024. GM will make Ultium batteries under a JV with LG. 
Honda Motor's chief executive, Toshihiro Mibe, said last year the Japanese automaker was willing to form new alliances to make electrification profitable. 
LGES, which has battery production sites in the United States, China, South Korea, Poland and Indonesia, plans to invest a total of 5.6 trillion won in North America by 2024 to secure production capacity of over 160 GWh by 2025 in the region, according to a company filing.

The investment would have increased Cinda's interest in Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance Co Ltd to 24%, making the asset manager its second-biggest investor. 
Cinda effectively owns a 15% stake in the Ant-affiliated firm through Nanyang Commercial Bank Ltd, a Cinda subsidiary. The stake would have been diluted to 4% after the investment.
""After further prudent commercial consideration and negotiation with (Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance), the company proposed not to participate in the share subscription,"" Cinda said in a filing to the stock exchange. 
Ant Group's consumer finance arm is under regulatory pressure to fold Ant's two lucrative micro-loan businesses Jiebei and Huabei into it, which would make it subject to rules and capital requirements similar to those for banks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Thursday failed to pass a bill to slap sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline sponsored by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, a day after Democrats unveiled their own legislation.
The tally was 55 in favor and 44 against the bill that needed 60 votes to pass, a major hurdle in the 50-50 Senate. The vote spanned nearly seven hours as Majority Leader Chuck Schumer considered options on voting rights legislation. 
Senator Robert Menendez won the support of many of his fellow Democrats, including President Joe Biden, for an alternative bill he introduced on Wednesday. His legislation would impose sweeping sanctions on top Russian government and military officials and banking institutions if Moscow engages in hostilities against Ukraine. 
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who had originally co-sponsored Nord Stream 2 sanctions legislation with Cruz, voted against his bill saying it risked breaking unity in Washington and in Europe over Russian aggression against Ukraine. 
She said Cruz's legislation would ""drive a wedge"" between the United States and its allies, particularly Germany. 
The United States, as well as some European countries including Ukraine and Poland, oppose the pipeline, which would deprive Kyiv of transit fees as well as increase Moscow's leverage over Europe, where gas prices have been soaring.
Cruz said the vote showed a Senate majority supports fast action on the pipeline which is touted by Russian President Vladimir Putin and led by state energy company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
""Only immediately imposing sanctions can change Putin's calculation, stop a Ukrainian invasion, and lift the existential threat posed by Nord Stream 2,"" Cruz said. 
A handful of Democrats, including Senators Tammy Baldwin, Mark Kelly and Raphael Warnock, supported the Cruz bill which would have put sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company building the project, within 15 days of passage. Cruz's bill would have also allowed Congress to vote to overturn any waiver of sanctions by the president. 

The Menendez bill, which does not yet have a date for a vote, would put sanctions on the pipeline, and Russian officials and entities after any aggression on Ukraine by Moscow. 
The $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline would send Russian gas under the Baltic Sea to Europe via Germany. It was completed late last year but is pending approvals by Germany and the EU that may not come until the middle of the year.

Interest rate hikes could push investors toward value stocks, which tend to be more cyclical and offer near-term cash flows.
“We are in a position where much that has been positive for equities is maybe moving to neutral or negative, and while there are still few alternatives, it makes the equity market ripe for more fluctuations over the next few months as we see how the data shake out and how the Fed reacts,” Alpine Woods Capital Investors portfolio manager Sarah Hunt told Bloomberg.

San Francisco (Reuters) - Canada's auto safety regulator said on Thursday it has opened an investigation into the heating system of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 and Model Y vehicles following 16 consumer complaints about its performance during cold weather. 
Transport Canada said it is concerned that a malfunctioning heating and air-conditioning system ""may affect windshield defogging/defrosting and therefore driver visibility.""
""A company is required to notify Transport Canada and all current owners when they become aware of a defect that could affect the safety of a person. ... These notices are commonly referred to as ‘safety recalls,’"" it said. 
The regulator said it has informed Tesla of the investigation.
Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. In 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted, ""Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while.""

A number of Tesla owners complained that the heat pumps are failing in extreme cold temperatures, according to Drive Tesla Canada, a Tesla news provider. The report said the heating problems happened even after Tesla early last year replaced faulty sensors in heat pumps in some 2020-2021 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to address the issue. 
The U.S. safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, did not have an immediate comment on the issue.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol on Thursday subpoenaed Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Reddit, seeking information about how their platforms were used to help spread misinformation and violent extremism in the failed bid to overturn the 2020 presidential election.
""We cannot allow our important work to be delayed any further,"" the House Select Committee's chairman, Bennie Thompson, said in a statement.
The subpoenas are the latest development in the panel's investigation into the causes of the attack on the Capitol by then-President Donald Trump's supporters, and the role played by Trump, who has pushed false claims that he lost a rigged election to Joe Biden. 
""Two key questions for the Select Committee are how the spread of misinformation and violent extremism contributed to the violent attack on our democracy, and what steps - if any -social media companies took to prevent their platforms from being breeding grounds for radicalizing people to violence,"" Representative Thompson said. 
""It's disappointing that after months of engagement, we still do not have the documents and information necessary to answer those basic questions."" 
The companies have until Jan. 27 to comply. Meta said it has turned over documents on ""a schedule committee staff requested - and we will continue to do so."" 
Google said it has been cooperating with the committee by ""responding substantively to their requests for documents"" and will continue to do so. 
""We have strict policies prohibiting content that incites violence or undermines trust in elections across YouTube and Google's products, and we enforced these policies in the run-up to January 6 and continue to do so today,"" Google said.
Reddit said it would continue to work with the committee on their requests. Twitter declined to comment. 
The committee has issued more than 50 subpoenas and heard from more than 300 witnesses. It is expected to release an interim report in the summer and a final report in the fall.
Social media platforms were widely blamed for amplifying calls to violence and spreading misinformation that contributed to the Jan. 6 attempt to violently overturn the election results. 
In August, the panel asked 15 tech companies, including the ones subpoenaed on Thursday as well as TikTok, Snapchat, Parler, 4chan and others, for records related to the riot.

In a letter sent this week to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Thompson said that ""despite repeated and specific requests for documents"" related to Facebook's practices on election misinformation and violent content, the committee had still not received these materials. Letters to the other three CEOs contained similar criticisms.
Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Zuckerberg were also grilled by lawmakers last March in a hearing on misinformation about the role of their platforms in the Capitol riot.

A construction and newspaper magnate, Caltagirone is Generali's second-biggest investor with an 8.04% stake. He has opposed the reappointment of Donnet, who is backed by Generali's leading investor Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) and a majority of board members.
Generali said in a statement Caltagirone felt thwarted by the board's working methods, particularly its handling of a strategic plan, treatment of privileged information and relations with the media and other shareholders. 
Generali Group's Chairman Gabriele Galateri di Genola rejected the reasons given by Caltagirone and said that the company has always conducted its business with absolute transparency and rigorous fairness.
Caltagirone began his offensive in April when he snubbed a general meeting to approve Generali's results. In September, he struck an accord with Leonardo Del Vecchio, the eyewear billionaire who is the third-largest investor in Generali, to consult on decisions about the company.
Smaller Generali investor CRT later joined the consultation pact which represents a combined stake of more than 16% after Caltagirone and Del Vecchio upped their holdings in recent months.

To counter their influence, Mediobanca has borrowed shares to reach a 17% voting stake. The two fronts will face off at an April general meeting to appoint a new board.
Caltagirone and Del Vecchio are ready to back an alternative CEO candidate and present their own slate of candidates for the board, people close to the matter have told Reuters.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Stock-picking hedge funds globally outperformed the broader sector with double-digit returns in 2021, despite a year beset by volatility and a new force of unpredictable retail traders flooding into the market to support ""meme stocks.""
On average, equities hedge funds made gains of 12.3% in 2021, compared with 10% for peers more generally, according to data from industry tracker eVestment.
Last year, thousands of retail investors congregated on social media websites to share information on stocks and short-sellers, making the stock-picking process much more hazardous.
""There were just so many different pot holes that managers could have fallen in to,"" said Darren Wolf, global head of Investments, Alternative Investment Strategies at Aberdeen.
""In long-short equity land, you had to deal with a whole bunch of issues throughout the year, starting with the meme short squeezes in January and that had implications throughout the rest of the year.""
Wolf said long-short hedge fund managers navigated last year by reducing their gross exposure and single-name shorts - bets that a stock will fall - and moving into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a substitute for those bets.
For Toronto-based $1.5 billion long-short firm Anson Funds, which made 45.5% in its main $950 million hedge fund in 2021, adjusting for retail investors has become crucial to trading. 
""People have always had this assumption that retail traders aren't a market force, but retail became more active recently,” Moez Kassam, chief investment officer at the Anson Investments Master Fund, told Reuters. 
    ""This is the new investor crowd and it's here to stay.""
Hedge funds also faced several bursts of volatility where markets took a shock tumble, such as during the sudden emergence of the Omicron variant in November.

Some equities hedge funds, like $2.7 billion UK-based Gladstone Capital (NASDAQ:GLAD) Management, benefited from investments in global TMT, consumer and financial sectors in 2021.
Gladstone made 7% in 2021, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. (This story corrects to remove reference to Gladstone's return over 5 years in final paragraph)

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) on Thursday reported higher quarterly earnings on the back of strong holiday travel demand and predicted a swift recovery from turbulence caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant, driving its shares higher.
The company said surging COVID-19 cases will likely result in losses in January and February, resulting in a loss for the quarter through March. But it expects the recovery in travel demand to resume around late February, putting the carrier in a position to generate profit in the June, September and December quarters.
Overall, it expects a ""meaningful"" profit in 2022 and backed its target to exceed the company's pre-pandemic financial performance by 2024.
""If we could pick a period of time for an Omicron variant to surge, we would probably pick this time of year,"" Delta's President Glen Hauenstein told investors on a call.
Air travel demand tends to be the weakest in the first quarter. 
The company said bookings for international travel were down, but Delta believes the transatlantic market will have a strong spring and summer once Omicron-driven border restrictions are lifted.
Chief Executive Ed Bastian expects business travel to pick up by the middle of February.
The Atlanta-based carrier's adjusted profit for the quarter through December came in at 22 cents a share, beating analysts' average estimate of 14 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, marking the second profitable quarter in a row.
The company estimates revenue in the March quarter will recover to 72% to 76% of 2019 levels. It expects to restore 83% to 85% of pre-pandemic capacity in the current quarter.
Its capital expenditure in the quarter is projected to increase by about 69% from the December quarter to $1.6 billion.
Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrials, materials and energy at research firm Third Bridge, said the airline is ""managing well"" despite the challenges facing the industry.
Delta's shares were up 3.4% at $41.98 in mid-day trade.
OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS 
A surge in COVID-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant, has caused havoc for the airline industry. An increase in daily employee sick calls as well as a series of winter storms have led to mass cancellations of flights.
Since Christmas Eve, U.S. airlines have canceled more than 31,300 flights, or about 7% of the scheduled total, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. 
Delta had to cancel more than 2,000 flights. The airline, however, said its operation has stabilized over the past week, with cancellations declining to less than 20 flights a day.
Yet, operational disruptions are projected to add to cost pressures in the current quarter.
Bastian said 8,000 Delta employees have contracted the virus since Omicron became the dominant variant. The case counts, however, have been declining over the last week, he said.

""We have more and more people coming back into the operation than new people getting impacted by the virus,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Bastian said the U.S. government shortening quarantine guidelines to five days helped get people out of isolation and back to work. He said the company is encouraging its employees at day five to get tested and not to come back until they are confident they are well.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes closed lower on Thursday with Nasdaq's 2.5% drop leading the losses as investors took profits, particularly in technology stocks after a three-day rally, while multiple Federal Reserve officials were out talking about inflation and interest rate hikes.
Interest-rate sensitive growth stocks such as technology lagged the broader market in the last session before the fourth-quarter earnings season starts in earnest. The S&P's technology index fell 2.7% while consumer discretionary fell 2%.
Several Fed officials spoke publicly about battling high inflation with Lael Brainard the latest, and most senior, U.S. central banker signaling that the Fed was getting ready to start raising rates in March.
Other officials, including Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, talked about the need for tighter policy while Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker also discussed a March rate hike after San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly had mentioned a March lift-off late on Wednesday.
""When Brainard says we've got to do something, they're going do something,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, an independent broker-dealer in Waltham, Mass. He said Brainard's comments were particularly striking coming from one of the Fed's most dovish officials. 
""There doesn’t seem to be much debate left within the Fed about what direction they’re going, and not even much about how fast they should get there,"" he added.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 176.7 points, or 0.49%, to 36,113.62, the S&P 500 lost 67.32 points, or 1.42%, to 4,659.03 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 381.58 points to 14,806.81.
Nasdaq's decline its biggest one-day percentage loss since Jan. 5 when it fell 3.4% in a single session after hawkish Fed minutes were released for the December meeting. It did not help that Thursday's rate hike talk had followed the technology-laden Nasdaq's 1.7% advance in this week's first three sessions. 
Even though U.S. Treasury 10-year yields fell on Thursday, investors focused on profit taking, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis.
""We had a pretty nice rebound in the Nasdaq the last few days, so there might just be some lingering nervousness around rates the Fed and some profit taking, especially ahead of earnings,"" said the strategist. 
Samana described Brainard's comments as ""a psychological hit to those hoping that there was some dissent to starting rate hikes sooner rather than later.""
Wells Fargo followed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in forecasting that the Fed might raise interest rates four times this year.
Adding some anxiety for investors, U.S. companies are due to report results on the final quarter of 2021 in the coming weeks with banks JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo set to start the ball rolling on Friday, while big technology companies report next week. 
Year-over-year earnings growth from S&P 500 companies were expected to be lower in the fourth quarter compared with the first three quarters but still strong at 22.4%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Retail investors have also raised their exposure to bank stocks ahead of the earnings announcements, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research's weekly report on retail flows.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) closed up 2% at $41.47 after beating estimates for fourth-quarter earnings. Its chief executive also predicted a swift recovery from turbulence caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant, also helping to lift the S&P 1500 Airlines index 2.6% for the day.
Earlier Data showed the producer price index (PPI) rose 0.2% last month after advancing 0.8% in November while in the 12 months through December, the PPI rose 9.7% versus the 9.8% forecast of economists polled by Reuters.
The PPI figures come a day after Wall Street indexes cheered consumer inflation numbers that hit a 40-year high but largely met market expectations.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 44 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 75 new highs and 360 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges 10.43 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.39 billion average over the last 20 sessions.

A shareholder rights plan, popularly known as a ""poison pill"", is a defensive strategy to avert hostile takeovers. The plan, usually triggered when a party buys a certain percentage of a firm, lets existing investors purchase more shares at a discount.
Starboard owns about 7.33% of Mercury and has asked the company to raise the ownership threshold which triggers the rights plan to 15% from the current 7.5%, if it cannot fully remove the rights plan.

Fed Governor Lael Brainard became the latest and most senior U.S. central banker to signal that rates will rise in March to fight inflation, saying that the Fed ""has projected several rate hikes over the course of the year"".

""We have had a tremendous acceleration in the Fed's tightening,"" he added. Theoret pointed out that when the U.S. central bank raised interest rates in 2015, it waited two years before shrinking its balance sheet, whereas this time it could begin by the end of the year.
""The challenge from here is how the global economy responds to this normalization.""
In bond markets, where borrowing costs have raced to keep up with rate hike expectations this year, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields edged down to 1.7006%, though analysts say they are almost certain to climb higher this year against a backdrop of rising rates. Germany's 10-year yield bobbed near -0.086% having approached positive yield territory for the first time since May 2019.
European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos became the latest to warn that the current spike in inflation was not going to be as transitory as originally expected. Upmarket Swiss bathroom goods giant Geberit had seen its shares slide too as it warned it was now impossible to predict how much raw materials prices would rise this year.
It is a busy period for bond issuance as countries and companies look to beat the rise in rates. Italy was due to sell up to 7 billion euros of three- and seven-year bonds later, and Ireland was eyeing a bumper sale. The week is also set to be a record one for emerging market corporate debt sales with nearly 30 taking place.
""It is a record in my time,"" said Omotunde Lawal, head of emerging markets corporate debt at Barings. ""Most people are swamped, but you can see why with as many as four Fed hikes now priced in."" (Graphic: global cbanks, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzykbekvw/cbank%20sheet.JPG) 
DOLLAR DOLDRUMS
In the currency markets, the dollar continued to slip toward a two-month low against a basket of currencies, with the dollar index down 0.139% at 94.873.
The euro was a big beneficiary of the move and was steady at $1.14530, up 0.1% on the day, while sterling and the yen also extended recent gains. [/FRX]
The pound is up more than 4% from December lows and traders have so far shrugged off a political crisis enveloping Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who apologized on Wednesday for attending a party at his official Downing Street residence in May 2020 during a coronavirus lockdown.
The central bank of New Zealand has begun hiking rates too, and the New Zealand dollar climbed 0.2% to $0.68625, the highest in almost two months.
""The (U.S.) dollar does not have to increase because the Fed is readying a tightening cycle,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Joe Capurso.
""It is not a simple equation of Fed hikes equals dollar increases. The dollar is a counter-cyclical currency which decreases as the world economy recovers.""
In Asia, Chinese blue-chips dropped 1.6% after data showing mainland bank lending fell more than expected in December, causing property and consumption sectors to sink.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat after recording its biggest daily gain in a month on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei lost nearly 1% after surging nearly 2% a day earlier.
Oil prices ticked lower in commodity markets too, a day after hitting their highest in nearly two months. [O/R]

U.S. crude fell 1.36% to $81.52 per barrel and Brent was at $83.86, down 0.96% on the day.
A softer dollar did not bolster bullion prices, which were instead weighed down by the prospect of rising rates. Spot gold dropped 0.2% to $1,822.08 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.65% to $1,821.20 an ounce. [GOL/]

Pontegadea, the family office of the main shareholder of fashion group  Inditex  (MC:ITX), confirmed the deal to buy the landmark Canadian skyscraper, famed for a series of windows with a 24-karat-gold coating, on Thursday. It was first reported by Bloomberg News in Canada.
Current owners Oxford Properties Group and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) hired RBC Capital Markets to explore a potential sale last September. It was expected to fetch more than C$1 billion ($799.17 million).
Despite the pandemic and an expectation that the work-from-home trend is here for the long haul, demand for office space in downtown Toronto remains strong, with a 9.7% vacancy rate in the office market in the fourth quarter of 2021, below the national average of 15.7%, according to CBRE data.
Royal Bank Plaza, home to leading banks, law firms and technology companies, is located in the heart of Toronto’s financial core, across the street from Union Station, Canada’s busiest transit hub, and covers some 1.5 million square feet (139,350 square metres) across its two towers.
Oxford Properties did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Pontegadea has focused on investing in real-estate assets and textile distribution but recently became the largest private investor in Spain's electricity grid operator Red Electrica, with a 5% stake, and also bought a 49% stake in a wind farm operated by Spanish energy group Repsol (OTC:REPYY).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Clothing retailer Uniqlo will have to raise prices of some products due to higher costs for raw materials and shipping, its owner said on Thursday, becoming a high-profile example of Japanese firms throwing off a decades-old deflationary trend.
The comments from Fast Retailing, which reported a near 6% rise in quarterly operating profit thanks to a strong showing in overseas markets outside of China, come as more Japanese firms say they can no longer offset soaring costs with belt-tightening.
Years of stagnant prices and wages have made Japan Inc nervous about charging more for fear of alienating shoppers and losing market share. But the weakening yen is further driving up costs adding to the inflationary pain following the pandemic.
""We have reached a point where we have no choice but to raise the prices of some products,"" Chief Financial Officer Takeshi Okazaki told reporters in Tokyo, citing weakness in the yen that is driving up the cost of raw materials and shipping.
The currency recently hit its weakest in five years against the dollar.
Japanese firms' reluctance to raise prices - and wages - has long been a headache for policymakers who want to see a virtuous spending cycle that drives economic growth as the country ages and the population declines.
A Reuters poll in November showed that while only 14% of Japanese firms had passed on costs to customers, another 40% planned to do so. 
Still, Okazaki noted that hiking prices was not an easy issue, especially for a company that competes on price.
""Our basic policy is to avoid raising prices as much as possible, recognising that our customers have strict cost expectations,"" he said.
HIGHER PROFIT
Operating profit rose 5.6% to 119.4 billion yen ($1.04 billion) in the three months ended Nov. 30. That beat the market's consensus of 102.6 billion yen, according to the average of analysts' forecasts from Refinitiv.
It maintained its forecast for operating profit to climb 8.4% to 270 billion yen in the fiscal year ending in August.
Uniqlo's international business reported record first-quarter results, driven by sales from South Asia, North America, and Europe. The pandemic weighed on results in China, while warm weather in Japan depressed sales of fall and winter clothes.
The results marked a reversal from the past few years when China and Japan were the big sales and profit growth drivers.
The company said in October it expects a gradual recovery to pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 vaccinations progress and as it makes further inroads in the Chinese market. 
Fast Retailing opened a flagship store in Beijing in November, its third megastore in mainland China, and plans to open 100 locations in the country each year going forward.
But it also flagged the risk of continued production and logistic delays that have plagued major clothing groups 

Fast Retailing's shares have fallen 9.5% year-to-date, compared with a 1.1% drop in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 04:16PM ET</span>","Analysis-U.S. energy shares on fire again to start 2022, stoked by inflation","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. energy companies are soaring in the early days of 2022, driven by a shift to so-called value stocks and assets that stand to benefit from the steepest inflation in nearly four decades.
The energy sector is up over 14% this year, against a 0.8% drop for the overall S&P 500. Energy also posted the biggest gains of any S&P 500 sector last year, rising nearly 48%.
Several factors are behind the sector’s performance. Brent crude has surged about 23% since early December and is near its highest level since late 2018. 
Rising energy prices have been a key factor over the past year in pushing up overall inflation. Consumer prices last month had their largest annual gain since June 1982.
“If oil is on the rise and natgas is on the rise, it is going to mean an increase in earnings for those companies that are involved in the energy sector,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. Pavlik is overweight the energy sector in his portfolios, owning shares of  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD).
S&P 500 energy companies overall are expected to increase revenue by 72.7% for the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period, according to Refinitiv IBES. Oilfield firms Baker Hughes and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) report next week.
Energy's 12.2% spread over the median sector performance in the first week of 2022 ranked as the second-biggest weekly outperformance of any sector over the past decade, according to Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist with market research firm All Star Charts. 
“The group has a pretty good record of outperforming the market in inflationary periods and we are in an inflationary period,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel Corp. The wealth management firm's energy stock holdings include Chevron, Baker Hughes and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL).
The sector’s outperformance also reflects a broader shift from tech and high-growth stocks that jumped last year to companies that stand to benefit from higher Treasury yields, as surging inflation increases expectations the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in normalizing monetary policy.
The S&P 500 growth index is down nearly 3% so far this year, while the S&P 500 value index, which is more heavily weighted in shares of energy firms, banks and other economically sensitive and comparatively cheap companies, has risen 1.5%.
The relatively small size of the 21-company energy sector, which has a 3% weight in the S&P 500 compared to a nearly 7% weight for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone, means that even small shifts in investors’ portfolios could buoy energy stocks.
“When you see all the selling that is going on in the megacap tech stocks, if even a fraction of that money finds its way into the energy sector, the stocks ought to do well,” Tuz said.
The energy sector’s robust gains follow years of underperformance amid volatile commodity prices, company struggles with capital discipline and investor wariness of fossil fuel investments. The sector remains down about 7% since the end of 2011 against a 620% gain for the technology sector over that time.
Signs the Fed may not be as aggressive as expected in raising rates could raise the allure of tech companies, which tend to be particularly sensitive to higher yields, and sap some demand for energy stocks. Concerns over slowing global growth also could weigh on crude prices.

For now, however, analysts appear confident oil prices will remain strong.
Energy stocks are ""well placed"" for 2022, analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management wrote on Wednesday, pointing to their expectations of Brent remaining between $80 to $90 a barrel this year and the sector's above-market dividend yields.

(Reuters) -TPG shares rose nearly 12% in their stock market debut on Thursday, valuing the 30-year-old private equity firm at more than $10 billion, after the company went public to cash in on a pandemic-driven boost to the buyout industry's profits.
TPG will be looking at expanding its franchise into other areas such as credit and infrastructure, Chief Executive Officer Jon Winkelried told Reuters in an interview.
""We will continue to build on the business in the way we have historically - organic growth, seeing opportunities and building into it,"" he said.
TPG's stock market debut comes a decade after most of its major peers went public. The firm spent years recovering from a string of poor investments in the 2000s and diversifying its private-equity platform into growth and social impact investing.
The buyout giant expects to continue generating its targeted returns notwithstanding the prospects of interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year, which could result in choppy markets and falling valuations, co-founder Jim Coulter told Reuters.
""Our experience has been that if you choose the right company in the right sectors, they will grow through the market perturbations that you see at times like these,"" he said.
NAVIGATING CHOPPY WATERS
TPG has nearly $109 billion in assets under management, with investments across a range of industries including in companies such as Airbnb Inc,  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT), Burger King, and McAfee Corp. 
Founded in 1992 by David Bonderman and Coulter, TPG was launched as Texas Pacific Group in Mill valley, California. Its first major investment was in the then-bankrupt Continental Airlines in 1993. Known for its leveraged buyouts, TPG has invested across sectors from retail to healthcare. 
TPG's net income jumped more than fivefold to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 2021. Its revenue surged to $3.89 billion, from $564.4 million a year earlier, driven by growth in income from asset sales across its portfolio.
The Fort Worth, Texas-based company's shares opened at $33. TPG and its selling shareholders sold 33.9 million shares priced at $29.50 each, the midpoint of its target price range of $28 and $31 apiece announced earlier, raising about $1 billion.

The firm's move to go public comes amid a recent sell-off in stocks. Three other IPOs, including that of apparel chain operator Authentic Brands and TypTap Insurance Group, have been canceled since the beginning of the year, as investor concerns about surging inflation and higher interest rates fueled market volatility. 
J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), TPG Capital BD LLC and BofA Securities are the lead underwriters for the offering.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 04:07PM ET</span>","Navient to cancel 66,000 loans worth $1.7 billion to resolve predatory lending claims","By Jonathan Stempel and Chris Prentice
(Reuters) - U.S. student loan giant Navient (NASDAQ:NAVI) Corp will cancel $1.7 billion in debt owed by 66,000 borrowers and recompense 350,000 others to resolve allegations by 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia that the company preyed on customers and steered many to costly repayment plans.
Thursday's nationwide settlement ends probes and lawsuits into Navient practices dating back to 2009, when the company was known as Sallie Mae.
Navient will pay an additional $142.5 million to the states, including $95 million to harmed borrowers, making the total settlement about $1.85 billion, according to the states.
In a statement, Navient denied breaking any laws or causing harm to borrowers, saying the matter was ""based on unfounded claims.""
The states alleged Navient steered struggling student loan borrowers into costly long-term repayment suspensions instead of counseling them on the benefits of more affordable income-driven repayment plans, the states said. 
The firm also made predatory loans to private borrowers they knew would struggle to repay them, they said.
Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, whose state was among those to settle, said Navient impeded thousands of borrowers from buying homes, starting businesses and raising families.
""Navient knew that people relied on their loans to make a better life for themselves and for their children,"" Shapiro said at a news conference. ""Instead of helping them, they ran a multibillion-dollar scam.""
Navient will cancel about $1.7 billion of subprime private student loan balances owed by about 66,000 borrowers. It will also give more than 350,000 borrowers who were placed in long-term repayment suspensions $260 each.
Navient will notify borrowers whose private loans are being canceled by July, and refund payments after June 30, the states said. Borrowers eligible for restitution will be notified by mail this spring.
""For many borrowers, removing this debt will be life-changing,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said at the press conference.
The settlement comes as President Joe Biden's Democratic administration aims to get a grip on the country's student loan crisis and ramp up scrutiny of private loan providers.
The settling states accused Navient of encouraging struggling student loan borrowers to delay payments instead of counseling them on the benefits of affordable, income-driven repayment plans. This caused interest to accrue on borrowers' loan balances, pushing them further into debt, the states said.
Navient was also accused of making predatory subprime private loans, often to attend for-profit schools with low graduation rates, that the Wilmington, Delaware-based company knew borrowers would have trouble repaying.
The states said Navient used these practices to induce colleges and universities to treat it as a ""preferred"" lender for profitable federal and ""prime"" private loans.
In a statement, Navient Chief Legal Officer Mark Heleen said the settlement would spare the company the time, cost and distraction of further litigation.

Sallie Mae in 2014 split off Navient from its private education lending business, which is now known as SLM (NASDAQ:SLM) Corp.
In late afternoon trading, Navient shares were up 0.09% at $21.91.

While much trading is already electronic, the curbs led to the New York Stock Exchange and London Metal Exchange temporarily closing their floors at a time when trading in markets was at its most volatile since Black Monday in 1987 in the United States.
Current resilience requirements for exchanges, clearing houses and settlement systems worked well, but there are opportunities for further improvements, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) said in a statement.
There is a need for greater automation and less dependence on physical documents and manual processes to better accommodate people working from home, said IOSCO, which groups market regulators from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America.
Business continuity plans of some firms did not anticipate how to deal with access to primary and back up sites not being available for a prolonged period, IOSCO added in a paper out to public consultation.
Many businesses are expected to return to a ""hybrid"" mix of employees splitting their time between the office and home, which raises similar challenges as full time remote working, IOSCO said.

""As large scale remote and hybrid working are new for many regulated entities, the risks and controls are still being evaluated and tested,"" it said.
Market infrastructure firms should re-evaluate and update their business continuity plans, IOSCO said.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Energy Department said on Thursday it had sold 18 million barrels of strategic crude oil reserves to six companies, including  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and a unit of refiner  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO), after saying last year it would sell reserves to try to tamp down rising oil prices.
The Biden administration said last year that it would accelerate a previously approved sale of barrels - and loan out another 32 million barrels of crude - to try to lower oil prices that had reached multiyear highs. After a brief sell-off, the oil market's rally has resumed its upward path.
The largest bidder was Valero Marketing and Supply, which bought more than 8 million barrels, the Energy Department said in a statement on Thursday.
The other buyers were refiners Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), Motiva Enterprises and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), along with merchant firm Gunvor USA and Exxon Mobil, the department said.
The U.S. strategic reserve was established in the 1970s after the 1973 Arab oil embargo. It currently holds nearly 600 million barrels of crude in caverns in Louisiana and Texas, enough for several months of supply. 
In 2018, Congress mandated through the bipartisan Budget Act a total sale of 30 million barrels during fiscal years 2022 to 2025. 
A total of 14 companies submitted 111 bids for evaluation.
The SPR plans to schedule deliveries between Feb. 1 and March 31, with early deliveries available in January if arrangements can be made, the department said.
The Energy Department has also already approved four exchanges of crude oil as part of the 32 million it has committed for loans. Companies that receive SPR crude oil through the exchange agree to return the amount of crude oil received, as well as an additional amount, depending on the length of time they hold the oil.

(Reuters) - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is investing $50 million in a LanzaJet facility in Georgia that will produce jet fuel from ethanol next year, LanzaJet said.
The airline industry is considered one of the hardest to decarbonize. Renewable aviation fuel accounted for less than 0.1% of current global jet fuel demand of about 330 million tonnes in 2019, investment bank Jefferies said last year. Governments and investors are trying to boost incentives to produce lower-carbon emitting jet fuel. 
LanzaJet, based in Chicago, said it has nearly completed on-site engineering at its Freedom Pines Fuels Biorefinery, with plans to start producing 10 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel per year from sustainable ethanol, including from waste-based feedstocks, in 2023. 
Oil majors, airlines and other petroleum trading companies including Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) Inc., British Airways and Shell (LON:RDSa) are also funding the company.
The White House said last year that it wants to lower aviation emissions by 20% by 2030, as airlines face pressure from environmental groups to lower their carbon footprint.
The Biden Administration has touted tax credits for production of sustainable jet fuel as part of its Build Back Better legislation, which is currently stalled in Congress.
The European Union is aiming to increase the amount of SAF blended in petroleum jet fuel to 63% by 2050. 

Microsoft created the Climate Innovation Fund in 2020 to invest $1 billion over the next four years to speed up the development of carbon removal technology.

The report said the company's board had warmed to the idea of acquisitions amid the turmoil surrounding its controversial Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm.
Biogen did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment on the report.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) said it would cover Aduhelm, and similar treatments, only for patients enrolled in approved clinical trials, threatening sales of the drug.
In a conference call with analysts on Thursday, Biogen Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos said the management was engaging with the board on ""tactical, short-term measures, but also strategic options"".

Vounatsos was replying to a query on whether the company would consider any strategic options to protect shareholder value, especially in light of the Aduhelm controversy.
Aduhelm was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June despite a vote by the agency's outside advisers that the treatment's clinical benefits had not been proven.

The company's shares, which have more than doubled in value last year, were up 3.7% in afternoon trade after hitting a more than two-decade high earlier.
Ford is now worth more than its century-old rival General Motors (NYSE:GM), whose market cap stands at about $88.61 billion and EV start-up Rivian Automotive, whose value is about $77.8 billion.
But, the automakers are still dwarfed by EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which has a market cap of over $1 trillion. 
Shares of Tesla were down 4.7% on Thursday after a report said the company updated its Cybertruck model webpage to remove references to the year 2022. (Graphic: Ford's stock market value surpasses $100 billion, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/FORD/myvmnbqodpr/chart.png) 
Ford's gains come amid its plans to double production capacity for the electric version of its hugely popular F-150 pickup truck to 150,000 vehicles as part of Chief Executive Jim Farley's aggressive electrification strategy.
Demand for the F-150 Lightning electric pickup has been red hot and Ford has had to stop taking reservations for the truck ahead of its arrival this spring at U.S. dealers.
Ford's Farley, who took over as CEO in 2020, has pledged to invest more than $30 billion on EVs, including battery development, by 2030.
The EV strategy has buoyed Wall Street brokerages, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) the latest to raise its price target on Ford.

""We see room for Ford's fourth quarter performance to come in above consensus expectations, based on continued strong pricing offsetting growing raw materials headwinds,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner said in a research note, while raising its price target to $24 from $18.
The median Wall Street price target is $21.85.

 Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) has also launched NFT versions of its Barbie and Hot Wheels lines.
NFTs, a type of digital asset, have exploded in popularity this year with artworks selling for millions of dollars.
Gap said its NFTs will be priced in tiers ranging from about $8.30 to $415 for a collectible that comes with a physical hoodie. Prices can fluctuate with the value of the cryptocurrency used for making purchases.

The company is collaborating with Brandon Sines, the artist behind the Frank Ape cartoon, on the NFT collection that is being hosted on the Tezos blockchain.
Gap said Tezos uses an energy-efficient approach to secure its network. The crytpocurrencies needed to buy NFTs have been criticized for their large carbon footprint.

The share of small firms that reported a decrease in revenue rose to 33% in the week ended Jan. 9, according the U.S. Census Small Business Pulse Survey. That’s the highest since February last year.
Economists anticipate a sharp but short-lived drop in activity due to the fast-spreading omicron. The variant, a seemingly milder form of Covid-19, is so contagious that the sheer volume of sick days has constrained output in many industries.
An increasing number of small businesses have shut locations at least temporarily as the number of virus cases surged last week, the Census survey shows. Seattle, New York City and Washington, D.C., saw a spike in closures.

The impact on activity appears particularly acute in cities such as Detroit, Baltimore and San Antonio, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, and Virginia Beach, Virgina. In these cities, at least 40% of small firms saw a drop in revenue in the Census survey.
In Phoenix and Jacksonville, Florida, the share is closer to 20%.

MILAN (Reuters) -Alessandro Benetton is set to become the chairman of the family's holding company Edizione, it said on Thursday, in a move that brings the Benettons back to the helm.
The appointment comes as Edizione looks to turn a page following the deadly collapse in 2018 of a bridge operated by the Italian motorway unit of its Atlantia infrastructure arm.
Atlantia has since sold that business in a deal which is due to be finalised by the end of March. Edizione said it had slightly increased its Atlantia stake to 33.1%.
It also holds stakes in airport and motorway caterer Autogrill, telecom masts group Cellnex, insurer Generali (MI:GASI) and investment bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
Edizione said it deemed strategic its investments in Atlantia, Autogrill and Benetton Group, the unlisted clothing retailer famous for its colourful sweaters which is now struggling due to competitors such as  Inditex  (MC:ITX)'s Zara. 
With Generali and Mediobanca both caught in shareholder battles, the Benettons' stakes in the two companies could become of interest to other investors. 
Alessandro Benetton, 57, has led Italian private equity firm 21 Invest since its foundation in the 1990s. He also sits on the board of Autogrill and last year helped to organise the World Ski Championships as chairman of the 2021 Cortina Foundation.
He is the son of Luciano, one of four Benetton siblings who built the family's fortunes on a clothing business created in the 1960s, which then grew to diversify into transportation and catering.
Alessandro Benetton replaces Italian academic and former Alitalia special administrator Enrico Laghi, who is moving from the chairman role at Edizione to become chief executive.
New governance rules approved on Thursday envisage a lock-up period of five years and mechanisms, including pre-emption rights, to ensure that control of Edizione remains in the hands of the Benettons through the generational transition.
Control of Edizione is equally divided among four holding companies, each relating to one of the four founders. 

Two of the four siblings, including former Edizione head Gilberto Benetton, died in 2018. 
The family holding will appoint nine board directors, of which five members will be independent and the others will represent the family, it said.

Investing.com — Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) shares fell 3.5% on Thursday despite an optimistic research note from Northland analyst Mike Grondahl, who initiated coverage of the Bitcoin mining firm with an outperform rating.
The analyst set a $30 price target on the stock, telling investors Riot is an ""energy-efficient, high-capacity, low-cost crypto asset mining company.""
Riot has the largest Bitcoin mining facility in the U.S., the analyst noted. It's located on 100 acres in Rockdale, Texas, with a total current capacity of 300 MW and 750 MW total when complete. It ""has an industry leading power rate of 2.4c/kWh which has resulted in high developed capacity, robust outlook for future capacity, leading hash rates and number of Bitcoin mined, and low cost of production,"" explained Grondahl.
The analyst cited the company's deployment of miners and purchase agreements for new miners, which will give it an expected hash rate of 12.8 EH/s, as being significant.
In addition, Grondahl pointed to Riot creating an industrial-scale immersion-cooled mining operation that he says will result in increased hash rates and more significant financial output than traditional mining. 
""We believe Riot is a thought leader in the space and is well-positioned for robust growth in the near future,"" he concluded."

Elbers, 51, is a 30-year veteran of the company who oversaw restructurings at KLM before and during the coronavirus pandemic. The company said he will step down as of May 1, 2023.
KLM has been part of the Air France-KLM group since 2004, but relations between the Dutch subsidiary and its French-dominated parent have been strained in recent years by KLM's relatively stronger financial performance.
""The Air France-KLM Board of Directors has approved that the Supervisory Board of KLM, after close consultation with CEO Pieter Elbers, has established that (he) will not enter into a third term,"" the company said in a statement on the group website.
Air France CEO Ben Smith and Chairwoman Anne-Marie Couderc thanked Elbers for his service.
In a separate statement on KLM's website, Elbers said he was proud of his time at the company and would continue to ""support KLM in this transition toward new leadership.""

In 2019, the Dutch state purchased a 14% stake in Air France-KLM in a surprise move it said it hoped would help it gain more influence and protect the Netherlands' interests in the company.
Elbers is known as a strong advocate for KLM interests within the group, but has always rejected the idea - sometimes mooted by Dutch politicians - that KLM should split from the group.

By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) on Thursday said a trio of chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc will power the ""Ultra Cruise"" driver-assistance feature on a luxury Cadillac sedan next year.
The Qualcomm chips will provide the computing power for the all-electric Celestiq, the company's planned flagship sedan. The automaker says that Ultra Cruise will allow for hands-free driving on both surface streets and freeways to account for up to 95% of driving scenarios in the United States and Canada, going beyond GM's current Super Cruise feature that only works on highways.
""It's a supervised system, so you still have to pay attention. But essentially what we're doing is giving the driver a hands-free experience in a much larger domain,"" said Jason Ditman, chief engineer for Ultra Cruise.
At the heart of the system will be a computer about the size of two laptops sandwiched together. GM will provide the software to make the system work, and Qualcomm is providing key chips - two processor chips and then one chip designed to speed up specific functions. 
The deal is a milestone for Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones and has been diversifying its business. While it Qualcomm has numerous deals with automakers to provide chips for infotainment centers and 5G connectivity, but GM is the first automaker to use Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon Ride"" chips for self-driving features.
Qualcomm is competing against rivals like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Mobileye (F:0ME) to win deals with automakers for self-driving chips. The energy efficiency of the chips is a key requirement for automakers in electric vehicles, where computers must compete for limited battery life with the drive train.

Qualcomm has aimed to use its history making chips for phones, where battery life is a key selling point, to lure automakers. GM's Ditman would not disclose how much power the Ultra Cruise computer uses, but the device is air-cooled, meaning the chips likely consume less power and generate less heat than rival offerings that need liquid cooling.
""We're very conscious of what our power consumption is,"" Ditman said.

(Reuters) - ArcLight Capital Partners has hired one of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc's most senior oil and gas dealmakers, according to people familiar with the matter, an example of a specialized buyout firm seeking to capitalize on a major peer throwing in the towel on the sector.
Many of the world's biggest private equity firms such as Blackstone have retrenched from investments in the U.S. oil patch after a boom in shale production in the mid-2010s fizzled, eviscerating their returns. The shift to environmentally sustainable investing, as climate change became a grave concern, also contributed.
This has left the U.S. oil and gas sector to energy-focused money managers and a handful of other private capital providers, who are now taking advantage of diminished competition to strike deals and hire talent as energy prices rebound.
Angelo Acconcia will join ArcLight, a Boston-based private equity firm that focuses on pipelines, utility infrastructure and the energy transition, in the spring as a senior managing director, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the appointment has not been made public.
ArcLight did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Blackstone said: ""We appreciate Angelo's many contributions to the firm and wish him well in his future endeavors.""
The run-up in energy prices in the last 12 months has raised valuations of oil and gas assets, allowing buyout firms to sell longstanding investments and focus on other areas. Among Blackstone's exits in 2021 were listing and then selling gas producer Vine Energy to Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) for $615 million, and divesting natural gas-focused GEP Haynesville to Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN) Co for $1.85 billion.
Acconcia is the most senior energy-dedicated private equity executive to move since Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc's Greg Beard left in June 2020. Having led Apollo's natural resources group for almost a decade, he joined oil and gas investment firm Andros Capital Partners.
Acconcia is on gardening leave, after leaving his role as a senior managing director at Blackstone in November, the sources said. That ended a 17-year career at the alternative investment manager where he played a significant role in shaping the firm's energy investments in the previous decade.
Since its founding in 2001, ArcLight has deployed about $25 billion of capital across 113 investments in the energy space, according to its website.

Among its recent deals was agreeing in February 2021 to acquire for $830 million a 25% stake in Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, one of the largest interstate pipeline systems in the country.
It is currently deploying its $3.4 billion seventh flagship fund, and has separate funds targeting renewables and energy transition investments. It also backs a blank-check acquisition vehicle, ArcLight Clean Transition Corp II.

AMSTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) - The Dutch wing of environmental group Friends of the Earth, which won a landmark court case against Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) last year, demanded 30 corporations publish plans for big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in a campaign launched on Thursday.
Milieudefensie has set its sights on large companies with legal bases in the Netherlands, where a court ruled in May that Shell must reduce its environmental footprint.
The heads of the companies were being sent letters demanding that they provide plans outlining how they will trim emissions of the heat-trapping gases by 45% from 2019 levels by 2030. A failure to do so may result in legal action, said Peer de Rijk, policy officer at Milieudefensie.
Fourteen of the 29 groups to receive a letter replied to a Reuters request for comment and all said they were acting to reduce emissions. Shell did not receive a letter but is also part of the campaign, Milieudefensie said, referring to its court victory against the oil giant.
""We are very clear that in the end, if needed, we are willing to go to court. But of course we are hoping these companies will be moving by themselves,"" De Rijk told Reuters in an interview.
""We are willing to engage in talks, but we are in a hurry as well, so we won't accept talks for the sake of talks themselves,"" he said. ""Climate science is very clear. This is exactly what is needed.""
Shell is appealing against The Hague district court order to cut emissions in line with the 2015 Paris agreement.
Among leaders in finance, retailers, oil and energy majors, builders and industrial manufacturers on the list are KLM, the Dutch arm of airline Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY), ABN Amro bank and supermarket operator Ahold Delhaize.
""You lead an enterprise with control over and influence on a substantial amount of CO2 emissions. An enterprise that can and must contribute to the system change necessary to prevent dangerous climate change,"" a draft letter seen by Reuters said, asking: ""Are you a frontrunner or a straggler?""
Some of the businesses are ""small in the Netherlands itself, but they have a very large, international, global impact and the Shell verdict very clearly states that it is ...possible to hold them accountable for their global emissions via the Dutch law,"" he said.
MID-APRIL DEADLINE
The move by Milieudefensie follows a commitment by countries to accelerate their emissions reductions at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow in November, with investors managing $130 trillion in assets signing up to net-zero and pressuring companies to ensure their plans are good enough.
The broadening out of Milieudefensie's campaign also comes against a backdrop of increased climate-related litigation globally, with more than 1,000 cases brought since 2015, research from the London School of Economics showed.
Milieudefensie set a three-month deadline until April 15 for the companies to present a climate plan. They will be used to set an emissions baseline against which progress in cutting climate-heating gasses can be measured, the group said.
Other companies receiving a letter were: Pension fund ABP, insurer Aegon (NYSE:AEG), paint maker AkzoNobel, insurer Atradius, builder BAM Groep, dredger Boskalis Westminster, oil company BP (NYSE:BP), Dow Chemical, nutrition maker DSM, oil company ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), dairy group FrieslandCampina, bank  ING Groep  (AS:INGA), airline KLM, chemical manufacturer LyondellBasell, insurer  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Group, pension fund PfZW, Rabobank, energy company RWE, Schiphol airport, oil major Shell, car producer Stellantis, Tata Steel, products group Unilever (NYSE:UL), Uniper energy, food group Vion, commodities trader Vitol, Vopak storage and Yara chemical.
KLM said it has committed to aligning its net-zero pathway with climate science, and planned to use more sustainable aviation fuel.
An ABN spokesperson said the bank supported efforts to limit global warming and was working to reduce emissions from its lending.

Ahold Delhaize said late on Wednesday it had not yet received the official letter and could not comment.
Others to respond to Reuters, pointing to their climate efforts, included FrieslandCampina, Rabobank, ING, Aegon, DSM, Yara, Tata Steel, Schiphol, RWE, Akzo Nobel (OTC:AKZOY), NN, Unilever, ABP and PFZW.

904,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 12:31PM ET</span>",U.S. oil and gas M&A activity slows in fourth quarter - Enverus,"(Reuters) - Dealmaking in the U.S. oil and gas industry halved in value in the fourth quarter from the third, with the annual total falling short of the pre-pandemic average, according to data published by analytics firm Enverus on Thursday.
Oil producers struck deals worth just $9 billion in the final three months of 2021, a 50% slump from the third quarter's $18.5 billion. But the full year totaled $66 billion, a jump of 25% thanks to a two-year peak in the second quarter.
M&A activity in the industry took a hit in 2020 from the pandemic pushing oil and gas prices to record lows, although commodity prices made a strong rebound last year, sparking a wave of consolidation.
That has, however, also pushed up valuations, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to agree on a price and leading to fewer but larger deals.
Upstream deals signed in 2020 and 2021 totaled 172 and 179, respectively, compared with an average of nearly 400 deals per year before COVID, according to Enverus data.
The slow end to the ""second year of a COVID-influenced market"" held total deal values below the $72 billion average from 2015 to 2019, Enverus said in a press release.
Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) Inc's $3.25 billion purchase of Delaware assets from  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) topped the charts for oil M&A in the fourth quarter, followed by Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN) Co's takeover of Blackstone-backed GeoSouthern's assets in the Haynesville for about $1.85 billion.

The Delaware part of the Permian basin and Haynesville were the two most active plays, accounting for 80% of total deal value in the fourth quarter, Enverus data showed.
""Overall, the M&A market should be set for an active 2022. Pricing on inventory in areas like the Delaware Basin and Haynesville is still attractive for buyers and additional assets should be available on the market,"" Enverus director Andrew Dittmar said.

The all-cash deal, announced on Thursday, extends the trend of soft-drink companies branching out to the alcohol space as traditional boundaries between the categories rapidly blur.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co has tied up with brewer Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ) to launch Fresca-branded ready-to-drink cocktails, while rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc has partnered with Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) Co to launch a Mountain Dew-branded alcoholic beverage.
Monster said the deal would add craft beer brands Cigar City, Oskar Blues, Deep Ellum, Perrin Brewing, Squatters and Wasatch to its portfolio but would exclude CANarchy's restaurants.
Monster, whose biggest shareholder is Coca-Cola, currently develops and markets energy drinks brands like Monster Energy, Burn Energy Drink and Full Throttle Energy Drink.
The deal is a ""springboard"" for Monster into the alcoholic beverage space, its co-Chief Executive Officer Hilton Schlosberg said in a statement.
""The acquisition will provide us with a fully in-place infrastructure, including people, distribution and licenses, along with alcoholic beverage development expertise and manufacturing capabilities in this industry,"" Schlosberg said.
CANarchy supplies craft beverages throughout the United States and 20 countries and U.S. territories and has seven manufacturing locations and 900 employees, according to its website.
The deal is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of this year. 

A source told Reuters in November that Monster was discussing a merger with Constellation, but the Corona Extra and Modelo Especial maker's top boss said in a conference that the company would only engage in small bolt-on acquisitions.
""The CANarchy Craft Brewery acquisition may imply that MNST decided to go on its own in terms of alcoholic beverage manufacturing, but it may still need a larger scale alcohol distribution network,"" RBC Capital Markets Nik Modi said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - BMW won't scale up its own battery cell production for electric cars until the technology has developed further, the German company said on Thursday, taking a more cautious approach than some rivals despite record brand sales in 2021. 
The automaker, which was also upbeat about hitting the top end of its 9.5%-10.5% profit margin estimate for 2021, currently buys battery cells from CATL, Samsung (KS:005930) and Northvolt among others, but is building its own pilot plant.
""We have secured our needs for the next few years very well with the partners we have,"" finance chief Nicolas Peter told Reuters, adding BMW wouldn't rush to scale up its own cell production.
""We are not yet at the point where we can say what technology will accompany us for the next 10-15 years,"" he said. ""That's why it's important to invest a lot of resources with worldwide partners in battery cell development.""
Works council chief Manfred Schoch has pushed for BMW to ramp up battery output to secure supplies and create jobs.
German rivals Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) both have direct stakes in battery cell makers.
Daimler, which holds 33% of Automotive Cells Company, said in July it planned to build eight gigafactories to make battery cells with partners.
Volkswagen plans to build six cell plants in Europe by the end of the decade with partners such as China's Gotion High-Tech and Northvolt, in which it has a 20% stake.
BMW is working to build battery assembly sites at every factory but will rely on partners for cells, Peter said.
OUTPUT VS MARGIN
Shares in BMW rose to a fresh-six year high of 99.3 euros after Reuters reported Peter's comments, settling back to 98.9 shortly after, still slightly above the day's opening of 97.7.
The carmaker unseated Daimler for the first time in five years as the premium manufacturer with the highest number of vehicles sold in 2021, delivering 2.21 million vehicles compared to Daimler's 2.05 million.
Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius has said high deliveries were not the priority under his watch, preferring to raise prices and boost margins rather than maximise the number of vehicles sold.
BMW, which has kept output high amid a global chip shortage in part because of its close ties with suppliers, is slightly more cautious on margins than rivals including Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi, which expects a 9%-11% margin for 2021.

Still, Peter said the transition to electric vehicles was moving faster than BMW had expected two to three years ago, with sales more than doubling last year and order books fuller than ever.
BMW, which made an early entry into electric vehicles but whose portfolio now lags some competitors, plans to add an extra Saturday shift at its Munich plant from April to meet demand, a spokesperson said.

(Reuters) -European stocks were muted on Thursday as losses in defensive sectors were matched by gains in automakers and technology stocks on hopes of improving semiconductor supply. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 ended largely unchanged at 486.05 points, with shares in healthcare, and personal and household goods falling the most, down 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. 
A recent rise in bond yields weighed on most defensive sectors as investors expected rising inflation to prompt monetary policy tightening across the developed world this year. 
The STOXX 600, which hit a record high at the start of the year, has struggled to maintain gains as concerns over the impact of higher inflation, the Omicron variant and supply pressures also dulled sentiment.
European stocks could struggle to see major rallies with the looming prospects of higher rates, said Equiti Capital analyst David Madden.
""We're going to see some companies particularly in the retail space, manufacturing sectors start talking about lower margins.""
Geberit slipped 4.1%, taking the construction sector lower after it said increased uncertainty made it impossible to provide outlook for 2022, and that the construction market remained fragile.
Automakers were the best performers for the day, up 1.8% after TMSC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted a record quarterly profit and flagged plans to ramp up production. 
A chip shortage had forced several carmakers to cut production through last year, weighing on auto sales.
Tech stocks rose 0.7%, supported by gains in major chipmakers, including BE Semiconductors, ASM International (OTC:ASMIY) and Soitec. 
STMicro added 2.3%, while Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) rose 2.2%.
Still, gains in the tech sector were constrained by rising yields. 
European bank stocks rose 1.4%, reaching a more-than three-year high on the prospect of higher lending rates. 
Meanwhile, investors continued to watch any developments on the COVID front, as Omicron-related infections shot up across the continent. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for all adults, while the French Senate approved new measures to tackle the virus, including a vaccine pass.

Among other stocks, Germany's largest solar group SMA Solar Technology dropped 8.1% after a second forecast cut for 2021.
Food ingredients maker Chr Hansen rose 6.7% after reporting quarterly organic revenue growth well above forecasts.

The Silver Spring, Maryland-based company has seen its stock value more than double since Jan. 5, when it proposed to pay $0.05 per share in bitcoin to those who opt for it. Its first bitcoin dividend, or ""bividend"" as BTCS calls it, is due on March 16.
Shares of BTCS climbed 20% to a six-week high of $7.80 in early trading on Thursday as the online buzz over its plan grew in forums such as Reddit and stocktwits.com, which were instrumental in the ""meme stock"" frenzy last year.
Nearly 9 million BTCS shares changed hands within the first few minutes of trading, more than double the company's public float of 4.2 million shares. A smaller number of free float shares makes the stock vulnerable to sharp moves.
""This is a moment we have long anticipated since the Company purchased the domain, bividend.com, in February 2015,"" CEO Charles Allen said in a statement last Wednesday.

BTCS, last valued at $69 million, claims to be the first Nasdaq-listed firm to offer dividends in bitcoin. Video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) on Friday jumped as much as 22% on plans to launch a division to develop a marketplace for nonfungible tokens (NFTs).
Meanwhile, prices of highly-volatile cryptocurrencies have tumbled since hitting all-time highs late last year. Bitcoin was last trading at $44,306.29 on Thursday, about 36% below its all-time peak.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's use it or lose it airport slot rule has not created issues for airlines during the COVID-19 pandemic nor is there any evidence of carriers operating ghost flights because of the rule, a senior European Commission official said on Thursday.
""From our perspective, it is an unnecessary fuss. We actually have no evidence from any airline including Lufthansa on any amount of empty flights being operated,"" the official told reporters.
""Travel has been relatively unrestricted. Net bookings is still quite stable,"" the official said.
""For the current winter scheduling season, the Eurocontrol air traffic has been so far in the range of 73-78% of 2019 and the annual 2022 air traffic is forecast to be at 88% of 2019 levels,"" Commission spokesperson Stefan De Keersmaecker told reporters.
The EU executive's comments came a day after a spat between Lufthansa and Ryanair over the rule, which the Commission has relaxed to allow major carriers to preserve airport access during the crisis despite a sharp drop in traffic.
Budget rivals, keen to expand into once-congested airports, have criticised the move.
Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told a newspaper last month that the airline still had to operate tens of thousands of additional flights in the winter to comply with the slot rule, resulting in surplus emissions.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary on Wednesday hit out at Lufthansa, saying it was hampering rivals.
For this winter season, the EU says airlines will only have to use 50% of their slot rights. The figure will go up to 64% for the summer season from March to October.

(Reuters) - Adler Group, one of Germany's biggest landlords, hopes to extend repayment of 600 million euros of debt to German banks, after selling roughly 30,000 apartments and other property, its co-chief executive told Reuters.
The two giant sales this month mark the latest attempt by the embattled company, whose shares have crashed since it was targeted last year by short sellers critical of its business transparency and finances, to strengthen its standing. 
Maximilian Rienecker, co-CEO of Adler Group told Reuters that the property sales meant it had cut its debt but that it would nonetheless seek to extend repayment on bank loans due in the coming two years.
""We have mainly local banks with whom we have extended debts with in the past,"" said Rienecker, referring to an extension of repayment on 600 million euros ($688 million) of debt. ""We are in talks about this.""
He said that alongside this bank debt, 1.1 billion euros of bonds will be due over the coming two years and that these could be settled by issuing new bonds or be otherwise repaid.
Earlier on Thursday, Adler announced the sale of roughly 14,400 homes and commercial properties, its second such sell-off in as many weeks.
In December, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's flagged concerns that such sales trimmed its portfolio of rental property, increasing dependence on longer-term development projects that are typically risky.
It then assessed Adler's rating outlook as negative, indicating a heightened risk of a rating downgrade, because the company's development projects were uncertain. It is unclear whether this stance could change following the sale. 
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) withdrew its rating for the company early last year but did not say why.
Rienecker rejected Standard & Poor's criticism. 
""We will not have the net rent but, on the other hand, we are reducing our debts,"" he said.
He said the group would still have 30,000 apartments, two thirds of which are in Berlin, as well as property development projects.
Rienecker said he expected that a special audit of the company's affairs by KPMG, following the allegations of fraud by a short-seller, would be concluded and announced during the first six months of this year.
Adler Group said it would receive net cash proceeds of 600 million euros ($686 million) from the sale announced on Thursday to private-equity firm KKR.
The company said the sale would help it reach a goal of having a loan-to-value ratio, an important yardstick of its debt burden, of about 45%.
Earlier this month, Adler announced a similar sale of more than 15,500 properties to LEG Immobilien.

Investing.com – Virgin Galactic stock (NYSE:SPCE) plunged 16% Thursday on concerns about possible equity dilution connected to the $500 million of convertible debt the company is raising.
Debtors usually convert their debt into equity when the prevailing market price is above the conversion price.
The company said it will raise $425 million through a convertible note due 2027, and may take on another $75 million of debt under certain conditions.
The interest on the debt will be payable semi-annually on Feb. 1 and Aug. 1 of each year, beginning this August.
The space company said it will use the capital to “fund working capital, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures to accelerate the development of its spacecraft fleet in order to facilitate high-volume commercial service.”
The stock slid even as the company attempted to cushion the impact of any dilution by entering into a deal for capped call transactions. The company said it may use part of the proceeds to fund that purpose.
Capped call transactions will come to offset any potential payment the company may have to make in excess of the principal of converted notes."
915,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 11:27AM ET</span>",Bank Stocks Are Booming Ahead of Earnings Despite Inflation Fear,"(Bloomberg) -- Banks stocks are raging into earning season as their upcoming results are expected to show the U.S. economy continuing to roll even in the face of inflation. 
Of course, loan growth is a key part of this. The 25 largest banks posted a 3.5% increase in lending at the end of December compared with a year ago. Intuitively, a booming economy should mean more loans to businesses and individuals, which at higher interest rates should be a boon for banks. Lending also serves as a wider indicator of economic prosperity and recovery. The risk here is what happens when economic growth decelerates. 
Market volatility is also playing a role in banks’ strength. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the VIX jumped to a 31 handle and commodities dropped 1.6% after rallying 7% in the prior quarter. That’s likely to show up in healthy trading revenue. Wall Street posted record trading profits after the never-before-seen volatility in March 2020 during the onset of the pandemic. Looking at 2021,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., recorded its best commodities trading revenue in a decade. 
From a macro perspective, it’s worth watching financials as early bets on a turnaround in value emerge. Value stocks are in the midst of a 15-year downtrend relative to their growth counterparts. But now investors may be positioning for a reversal. It’s the same story in cross-asset trading. Investors are selling the dollar, favoring riskier bets like commodities and emerging markets instead. With global central-bank policies in flux, investors are seeing some distortions in trusted correlations.
For example, the S&P 500 financials index, which includes regional banks and insurance companies, tends to be positively correlated with the yield curve between 2- and 10-year Treasuries. A steepening curve signals increasing bets on a strengthening economy, which also usually means thriving financial stocks. But the two have been diverging for the last few weeks. If the old adage holds true that the bond market is a better guide to economic health than the stock market, those bank stocks may not be able to maintain this rally for long.

(Reuters) -More than 8,000 workers at nearly 80 King Soopers stores went on strike for better wages on Wednesday as negotiations stalled, but the stores stayed open as the Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co-owned Colorado chain hired temporary staff and promoted online ordering.
The strike started at 7:00 a.m. ET and would go on for three weeks, the UFCW Local 7 union said. The striking workers are employed at King Soopers stores in the Denver metropolitan area, Boulder, Parker and Broomfield cities of Colorado, among others. 
The strike is the latest of its kind in the United States, following similar demonstrations at Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co's cereal plants and Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co as rising Omicron infections and inflation push workers to demand better working conditions and higher pay.
At King Soopers, workers have sought an increase in wages of at least $6 per hour for all. The company's ""last, best and final offer"", made on Tuesday, proposed raises of up to $4.50 per hour based on job classification and tenure.
The proposal, which came after the union rejected two previous offers, provides for investment of $170 million in wages over the next three years, more healthcare benefits and a starting pay of $16 per hour.
That was lower than the $18 per hour King Soopers advertised for replacement workers at various locations including Denver, Evergreen, Golden and Littleton.
UFCW Local 7 President Kim Cordova said the latest offer was ""worse than the previous offers in many ways"", noting the new base pay was still only pennies above Denver's minimum wage and asked for more concessions.
To limit the impact of the strike, Kroger said the grocery chain has brought in workers from across the country and hired temporary staff.
It also encouraged customers to shop online by reducing delivery fees to $1 for orders worth over $35 for a limited time, while also opening up alternative ""offsite"" pickup locations such as a parking lot in Lakewood, Colorado.
POLITICIANS SUPPORT STRIKE
The strike has received support from politicians, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Colorado State Senators Chris Kolker and Jessie Danielson, according to their social media comments.
""Huge grocery chains like @Kroger have made billions by jacking up consumer prices. And they're using those profits to reward executives instead of raising wages so workers can make ends meet. I stand with Kroger workers in their fight for a fair contract,"" Warren tweeted.
A Kroger spokesperson said wages have grown before and during the pandemic with the grocer raising its average hourly rate of pay to $16.68 from $13.66 since 2017.
While many customers have also called for a boycott of Kroger, several others worried that increased wages could lead to higher product prices.
""I've been a King Soopers customer since 1962. I join striking union workers by not shopping there until they agree to the new contract which satisfies the workers,"" Denver resident Mark Simmons said.
IMPLICATIONS
King Soopers operates more than 110 stores and is the No. 1 grocer in Colorado by market share, but its parent Kroger does not disclose its sales. 
According to investment research firm CFRA, the King Soopers/City Market stores in Colorado accounted for about 5% of Kroger's annual sales of $132.5 billion.
The strike will affect product availability and market share as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Albertsons Cos Inc are the top rivals in Colorado, CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram said. 

""We've already been seeing more out-of-stocks across supermarkets due to worker absenteeism and supply chain constraints caused by the Omicron variant,"" he said.
""The strike will make it even more difficult for Kroger to replenish inventory on the shelves.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers plan to scrutinise increases in the fees Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) charge businesses after the country's payments regulator found no evidence to justify the rises, a parliamentary committee said on Thursday.
Parliament's Treasury Select Committee said the companies, whose networks account for 99% of card transactions in Britain, had increased the scheme and interchange fees paid by businesses to card issuers when a card is used.
""Given that Visa and Mastercard currently dominate this space, it's vital to ensure that there is sufficient regulation and competition in the market so that businesses are not subject to ever-increasing servicing costs,"" the chair of the committee, Mel Stride, said in a statement.
Mastercard said Britain benefited from a highly competitive and advanced payments system with Mastercard at its core. 
""We note the interest of the Treasury Select Committee and look forward to working with the PSR (Payment Systems Regulator) as it conducts its review,"" Mastercard said.
Visa had no immediate comment.
Businesses pay scheme fees to be part of a payments network and interchange fees that are based on individual transactions. Increases in fees merchants pay to card issuers are typically passed on to consumers, regulators have said.
Britain's PSR said in November that card services did not work well for smaller businesses.
It told Stride in a letter on Thursday that it will propose ""remedies"" this month to tackle rising scheme fees, which have doubled between 2014 and 2018.
""Our analysis indicates a substantial proportion of these increases were not explained by changes in the volume, value or mix of transactions,"" the PSR said. ""Our ongoing engagement with merchants suggests that they have continued to significantly increase since then.""
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) said in November it would stop taking payments from Visa credit cards in Britain from mid-January due to rising fees. 
Graphic: PSR Interchange Fees Graphic- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klvykqbywvg/PSR%20Graphic%20on%20Interchange%20Fees.PNG
Interchange fees for purchases by British consumers from the European Union rose last year after an EU cap ended due to Britain's full departure from the bloc at the end of 2020. Fees for purchases in Britain, however, remain capped under UK rules.
The PSR said it was closely monitoring the increases in cross-border interchange fees in October by Visa and Mastercard, saying it had seen no significant changes in costs for issuers.
""Our proposed work will be looking more closely at the reasoning behind the recent increases and whether this indicates any themes or concerns that warrant action from us,"" it said. 

Stride said the Treasury committee would discuss the regulator's plans at a hearing in March.

Investing.com – Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock fell 1% Thursday after somewhat somber reports on the streaming giant by Credit Suisse and MoffettNathanson.
While he reiterated his outperform and $740 target for the stock,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Douglas Mitchelson said investor sentiment is as low as they have seen in the last eight years. He said the sentiment around the company’s fourth-quarter additions have faded.
MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson lowered his target by $5 to $460 while continuing to be neutral on the stock. The stock currently trades at $533.
According to StreetInsider, the analyst notes Netflix penetration of U.S. streaming homes is close to the top of the S-Curve level at 78% and the company is facing increasing competition from a slew of new entrants.
He sees Peacock and Paramount+ posting the most net additions in the U.S. while Netflix, despite its wide content and the hype of shows such as Squid Game, will likely add around 550,000 subscribers in U.S. and Canada, lower from the company's estimates.

The bank's employees were told they could delay returning to office to Feb. 1, a spokesperson said, after having previously allowed workers to work from home until Jan. 18. 
Goldman, which had been one of the most aggressive banks in bringing staff back into offices, has been forced to alter plans because of the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The plans were first reported by Bloomberg News.
The bank has also mandated vaccines and booster shots for eligible employees, effective Feb. 1. 

Big Wall Street firms continue to grapple with how to bring workers back to offices safely, with coronavirus cases rising rapidly again. 
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said last week U.S. employees who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 14 will be placed on unpaid leave and fired at the end of the month unless they are granted an exemption and accommodation.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers enjoyed a blowout Christmas, results from the country's biggest retailers show, treating themselves to upmarket food, drink and clothes before the sober reality of surging prices hits home in 2022. 
Retailers Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) and Next performed better than expected in the final weeks of 2021, as a surge in COVID cases left pubs and restaurants deserted, and consumers crowding supermarket aisles for tempura prawns, novelty bottles of gin and turkeys. 
But they warned of pain to come as pressure built across their operations, from higher freight costs, wage hikes for warehouse workers and more expensive raw materials. 
Retailers also saw no immediate relief from supply-chain disruption, with the online fast-fashion retailer ASOS (LON:ASOS) flying in more of its stock from Asia, at greater cost, to guarantee delivery for Christmas.
The trading updates give an early indication of how retailers globally may have fared during the festive season, with earnings from the major U.S. and European groups expected later this month and next. 
Britain's most famous retailer M&S, a provider of food, clothes and homewares, said it had largely held the line against price rises, but with inflationary pressures building in the pipeline that would have to give in 2022.
""We have to just try and make sure we get that balance and do what's right for the consumer,"" M&S finance chief Eoin Tonge told reporters. 
He said inflation in the food market in the 12 weeks to December was 2.7%, rising to 3.5% in December, but M&S had not passed that much on to its shoppers.
British consumers have already seen food prices rise, with post-Brexit economic barriers pushing up the cost of trade, and hikes in taxes and energy bills are set for April. The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to hit 6% in April, its highest since 1992, before easing.
Official economic surveys show household spending, which accounts for nearly two thirds of the UK economy, held up well to the end of December, but a lack of spending firepower in the spring will hit retailers hard while their costs remain high.
SOARING COSTS 
Britain's biggest retailer Tesco said it was seeing operating cost inflation of about 5%, up from the normal levels or 2-3%. 
""There's no doubt that there are inflationary pressures, (it’s) very hard for us to predict what those are going to look like over the coming months but we'll do our very best to manage them,"" CEO Ken Murphy told reporters.
Fast fashion groups have struggled as supply chain disruption limits their ability to deliver new ranges from factories in Asia to customers at speed. ASOS said it had already introduced low to mid-single digit price increases to offset the cost inflation. 
That fitted with comments from Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo which said it would raise some prices due to higher shipping and raw materials costs.
ASOS noted that despite the pressures it expected demand to hold up as it is cheaper than many rivals and some shoppers will not have spent on holidays or weddings for two years. The retailer added that factories producing spring-summer ranges were closer to home, unlike winter coats which come from China. 
""I do think there is a lot more demand to run,"" Chief Operating Officer Mat Dunn told reporters. He said that freight costs, while high, had plateaued, and that recent wage rises for warehouse workers had filled the staffing gaps. 
For Christmas, the supermarkets said the arrival of the Omicron variant of coronavirus had prompted many Britons to stay at home, even though restrictions were not as tough as 2020 when a last-minute December lockdown hit hospitality and boosted supermarket sales. That provided tough comparatives. 

For Christmas 2021, Tesco sold more than 8 million bottles of champagne and sparkling wine and highlighted smoked salmon as one of its best sellers. In comparison, sales at pubs group Mitchells & Butlers fell 10.2% in the four weeks over Christmas compared with pre-pandemic times.
M&S said it had sold one in four of the country's fresh turkeys, along with more than 1 million light-up snow globe bottles of gin. M&S and Tesco both upgraded their profit outlooks.

Europe's fifth-largest insurer set out ambitious three-year targets in Nov 2019, including raising its target for business operating profit after tax return on equity (BOPAT ROE) to more than 14% from the previous goal of more than 12%. 
""We're fully in the race to deliver to shareholders all our targets for 2022... we can even exceed those targets,"" Greco told Reuters Breakingviews in an interview.
Insurers were gloomy about the outlook for the industry when the coronavirus outbreak took hold in early 2020. But they have remained profitable after excluding COVID-19 from many policies and raising premiums.
Greco said the commercial insurance business in particular was likely to see strong growth this year, helped both by rising premium rates and by increasing demand for cover. 
Traditional markets such as Germany and Switzerland as well as emerging markets such as Brazil and Indonesia provided growth opportunities, he said.
But growth would not necessarily come via acquisition, he added.

""If you need to transform yourself, acquiring a business which needs transformation is not a great solution. In general, we don't think the solution to this is acquisition, it's providing the customers with what they need.""

(Reuters) -Poundland owner Pepco Group is betting on a fast expansion of its network of stores and tight cost control to boost its results, its chief executive told Reuters on Thursday after the company posted a jump in quarterly revenue.
The owner of PEPCO and Dealz discount retailer brands, posted a 12% rise in its quarterly total revenue on a constant currency basis and like-for-like sales up 0.7%.
At 1348 GMT the shares were down 3.8% at 42.58 zlotys ($10.77) apiece, nearing their debut price and all time low, impacted by worries over consumer demand and supply chain disruption according to mBank BM analyst Janusz Pięta.
Pepco Group said that having navigated its most important trading quarter it remained confident of achieving profit growth in line with historic levels.
Despite retailers increasingly shifting towards online sales, the group is betting on its bricks and mortar store roll-out and sticking to its current prices amid rising inflation in its bid to attract customers and gain market share.
""Simple math says lots of other things our customers spend money on have gone up in price. From that point of view it is significantly illogical in my view to put our prices up because people actually have less to spend with us rather than more,"" said Andy Bond.
Bond, who is stepping down at the end of March due to health reasons, noted that such an approach requires cost discipline, pointing to distribution, running of shops and supply chain efficiencies as areas to find savings.
Pepco Group reported a record quarter for store openings with 161 new branches, 146 under the PEPCO brand, many of which were in the strategically important Western European markets of Italy, Austria and Spain.
""We do anticipate over the year as a whole opening more stores than the market expects,"" Bond said.
""I wouldn't like to give an exact number, but it will certainly be significantly more than 400,"" he said.

In addition, Blackledge lowered his price target to $45 from $75. Snap shares are currently trading around the $41 mark.
The analyst told investors in a note that there are near-term concerns, driven by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iOS 14.5 changes that could impact the company's analytics, such as measurement, targeting and attribution, in relation to ad units. 
The company faces difficult comparisons in the first half of this year with its current valuation remaining elevated.
Blackledge told investors that the primary reason for the firm's January 2020 upgrade to outperform was its ""multi-year proprietary checks showing rising adoption of SNAP's direct response (DR) advertising units, which now comprise >50% of ad revenue.""
However, he added that ""the 3Q21 print showed that SNAP DR was not immune to negative impacts of iOS 14.5 / IDFA changes and we are concerned SNAP may have to continue to navigate through them in the coming quarters based on our recent ad buyer survey.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday after producer prices data for December encouraged hopes that the trend in inflation may be starting to turn.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 107 points, or 0.3%, at 36,397 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%. 
Earlier, official figures for December showed that producers had raised their prices by less than feared in the final month of the year, December's 0.2% increase being the smallest monthly gain since November 2020.  Even so, Oxford Economics analyst warned that it's too early to claim victory over inflation.
""Persistent supply disruptions will pin producer prices near record levels in the near term, especially given a rapidly spreading Omicron variant that will fan inflation pressures,"" Rasheed said in a note to clients. ""The PPI data adds to a growing body of evidence that the Fed will commence rate lift off in March and undergo balance sheet reduction mid-year.""
High disposable income, supported by windfall profits on financial assets and by fiscal transfers, has led to surging demand across many sectors, allowing companies to increase their prices markedly over the last two years. Two examples illustrated that trend in sharp focus in early trading, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock rising by 8.4% after it reported another record quarter for sales and better-than-expected profit. The company's result and bullish outlook indicate that the squeeze on silicon chips, a defining market trend of 2021, isn't set to ease up much in the near term. 
Elsewhere,  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) stock rose 3.0% after the home builder raised its annual dividend by 50%, reflecting the windfall it has enjoyed from a surge in demand for housing with more space for working and exercising since the pandemic started. In the same sector, KB Home (NYSE:KBH) stock also rose 13% as it rode a wave of upgrades after its own strong quarterly results.
Less encouragingly, figures released earlier also showed that initial jobless claims rose to a four-week high of 230,000 as the surge in Omicron-variant Covid-19 started to bite into the travel and hospitality sectors, among others. The U.S. has posted record hospital admissions this week as the new and highly-contagious dominant strain has spread across the country. Delta Air Lines warned that its revenue in the current quarter is unlikely to improve, measured against the comparable quarter two years ago, but still struck an upbeat note about recovery later in the year. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock rose 4.3% as the company also managed to report a better fourth quarter than expected. 
Elsewhere in aviation, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rose 3.0% after Bloomberg reported that China's regulators may approve the 737 MAX to start flying again as early as this month. That would end a ban that has lasted since two fatal crashes involving the model nearly three years ago.

Investing.com –  Lennar  stock (NYSE:LEN) rose 3% on Thursday after the company said it would hike its annual dividend by 50%.
The company will now pay an annual dividend of $1.50 per share, resulting in a quarterly cash dividend of 37 cents per share for both class A and B stocks. The next quarterly dividend is payable on February 10 to those whose names appear in the company’s books as of January 27.
The yield on the new dividend is 1.4% based on the stock’s Wednesday closing price of $107.94.
The company declared its fourth-quarter results last month. Lennar’s revenue for the quarter ended November 30 rose 24% to $8.4 billion. An increase in revenue per square foot was offset by an increase in costs per square foot as the majority of homes delivered during the fourth quarter had higher costs from lumber purchases made earlier in the year.
Lumber prices, a key cost item for homebuilders like Lennar, have stayed elevated for more than year as demand for housing has boomed. They topped $1,500 per thousand board feet in spring last year. Prices crashed subsequently but only to strengthen again later. Lumber futures for January are again ruling around $1,200.

(Reuters) - Europe's airport slot rules should not be changed to protect legacy airlines, the head of European low cost carrier Wizz Air said on Thursday, adding that if a company could not operate its slots they should be made available to rivals.
An easing of the ""use it or lose it"" rule has allowed legacy carriers to preserve airport access during the coronavirus crisis despite a sharp drop in traffic, sparking protests from low-cost rivals keen to expand into once-congested airports.
""Leave the slot rules as they used to be prior to the pandemic and the market will sort it out,"" Wizz Air CEO Jozsef Varadi told Reuters in an interview in Abu Dhabi.
""We would be able to operate those slots at constrained airports so why are they protected for the benefit of legacy carriers who are incapable of operating them because they are inefficient?""
Varadi said easing the rules was, in a way, ""distorting the market"" because it protected legacy carriers struggling to fill planes from lower cost rivals that could sell all their seats. 
Under European Union airport rules, airlines must use at least 80% of their take-off and landing slots in order to keep them for the following year.
The EU suspended those rules at the start of the COVID-19 crisis, but has started partially restoring them, rekindling concerns over empty flights as the pandemic continues. 

Varadi, head of Wizz Air since its inception in 2003, said access to airports should be prioritised as a public interest.
Ireland's Ryanair this week accused Lufthansa of exploiting climate concerns to stifle competition after the German carrier complained it had to operate tens of thousands of additional flights to comply with slot rules.

Investing.com – TSMC stock (NYSE:TSM) jumped 8.7% Thursday as the world’s largest chipmaker laid out an ambitious capital spending plan for 2022 to meet surging demand for its chips.
The company said it expects to lift capital spending to between $40 billion and $44 billion this year as demand for chips that go into mobiles, laptops, cameras and other electronic gadgets refuses to abate. The company spent $30 billion last year and has committed $100 billion in investments over the next few years to set up new plants and expand capacities.
High demand, abetted by shortages in a pandemic-struck world, is seen keeping TSMC’s gross profit margin in the current quarter at 54% at the center of its guidance range. Revenue for January through March is seen at $17.2 billion at the top end of the guidance range. For the year, it expects revenue to grow by 15%-20%.

Struggling with more than $300 billion in liabilities, sector giant Evergrande was seeking more time for bond coupon and redemption payments to avoid a technical default that would have complicated its politically sensitive restructuring.
The deadline to vote on the six-month delay to payments of the 4.5 billion-yuan ($157 million), 6.98% January 2023 bond ended earlier on Thursday. The bond terms gave holders the right to sell it back early to the issuer on Jan. 8.
In a statement late on Thursday, the developer's main unit Hengda Real Estate Group said that it had reached an agreement with bondholders to delay payments. 
Of those who voted, 72.3% approved the proposal to extend the redemption and coupon payments, the statement said, adding that trading in the bond, suspended since Jan. 6, will resume on Monday.
Evergrande, the world's most indebted property company, has so far met payments on onshore bonds that make up the vast majority of its debt, though it has defaulted on some offshore bonds.
Chinese developers are facing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze due to years of regulatory curbs on borrowing, leading to a string of offshore debt defaults, credit-rating downgrades and sell-offs in developers' shares and bonds.
The World Bank's economic prospects report said earlier this week a severe and prolonged downturn in China's real estate sector would have significant economy-wide reverberations, as its developers' combined onshore and offshore liabilities amount to almost 30% of the country's GDP.
Shanghai-based Shimao Group will hold online meetings with creditors in two asset-backed securities (ABS) on Jan. 17, to vote on payment extension proposals, according to documents seen by Reuters on Thursday.
The two onshore ABS products - worth 1.17 billion yuan in total - mature later this month but Shimao is seeking to extend this to the end of 2022 while making some payments in stages before the new deadline.
Shimao last week said it has missed payment on a $101 million trust loan. Rating agency S&P, which downgraded the firm again to ""B-"" this week, said on Thursday it has withdrawn the rating at the firm's request.
Shimao's onshore subsidiary Shanghai Shimao co confirmed on Thursday evening it has transferred funds to repay its 4.65% yuan bond with an outstanding principal of 1.9 billion yuan maturing on Saturday. 
But the firm has yet to say anything on an offshore coupon payment worth $28 million due on the same day. Shimao has another offshore coupon of $13 million due on Sunday and an onshore coupon of 22.5 million yuan due next Wednesday.
Separately, Yuzhou Group, founded in the eastern coastal city of Xiamen, announced an exchange offer for two of its 2022 dollar bonds due later this month - worth a total of $582 million - to extend the maturities by one year to avoid default.
It expects a delay in coupon payments totalling $110 million that are due in January and February, Yuzhou said in a filing. It is also seeking consent from holders of all of its other $4.5 billion dollar bonds to amend the terms that would help it avoid cross defaults if other bondholders seek repayment.
MORE MAY COME
Nomura estimates the sector's cash crunch could intensify with firms needing to meet onshore and offshore maturities totalling around 210 billion yuan each in the first and second quarter, up from 191 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Developers are also desperately raising funds to repay debt. 
Major player Sunac China Holdings Ltd said on Thursday it would raise $580.1 million from a share sale.
A source close to Sunac told Reuters the company has no further plan in the near term to place its shares or shares in unit Sunac Services to raise capital, adding it has sufficient funds to meet debt payment obligations due in the short term and for project development.
Guangzhou R&F Properties, which has a number of projects in global cities such as London, had its Hong Kong unit declared in 'selective default' on Thursday after it pushed through a bond payment delay. [L1N2TT102]
Smaller developer Agile Group pledged 65.6 million shares of its property management unit, A-Living Smart City Services, on Jan. 6 for an unspecified amount, a stock exchange filing showed. 
Shares of Chinese developers generally closed down on Thursday, with Sunac and Agile tumbling 22.6% and 13.3%, respectively. Shimao fell 9.4% while Yuzhou shed 6.9%. Evergrande dropped 3.6%.
One of Yuzhou's yuan-denominated bonds tumbled 21.8% in the morning before trading was temporarily halted. 

Two Shanghai-traded bonds of Shanghai Shimao were also suspended but after surging over 30%.

Credit rating agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) took the step after the struggling firm got approval from lenders to delay a $725 million senior unsecured note payment that had been due on Thursday. 
""We view the transaction as distressed restructuring tantamount to a default because R&F HK has insufficient resources and limited funding options to repay the maturing notes in whole in the absence of the transaction,"" S&P said.
""Also, investors are being paid less than originally promised due to the six-month maturity extension and the tender price being 17% below par for one of the offer options."" 
S&P said it was keeping the rating R&F's main parent company, Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. Ltd, unchanged at 'CC', because it was not a guarantor of the bond in question, although it warned it could cut it. 
""We will further review the credit profiles of Guangzhou R&F and subsidiary R&F HK after we reassess the companies' financial and liquidity positions,"" S&P said.
""The group faces several hurdles to substantially improve its weak liquidity.""
R&F is latest Chinese builder to be facing turmoil. The country's property market has been pushed into crisis by efforts to curb overborrowing and the woes of China Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, which defaulted late last year.

R&F's struggles are being watched just as closely though in some of the global cities as it has a number of unfinished mega projects including one on the Thames in London which it bought for 59 million pounds ($80.96 million)in 2018 from another Chinese firm that was facing difficulties at the time.

FairX, which was launched last year, is the operating name of LMX Labs. It sells futures products and is regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
Coinbase said it wants to make trading of regulated crypto derivatives accessible to retail and institutional customers.
""The development of a transparent derivatives market is a critical inflection point for any asset class and we believe it will unlock further participation in the cryptoeconomy for retail and institutional investors alike,"" it said in a blog post on Wednesday.
Trading of cryptocurrency derivatives has grown rapidly since institutional investors have over the past 18 months begun to embrace digital coin trading, presenting big opportunities for platforms that offer future and options.
Crypto derivatives volumes totalled $3.3 trillion in November, according to UK research CryptoCompare, accounting for almost 55% of the total crypto market.
Crypto futures and options products, especially those offered by regulated platforms, are widely seen as less risky than buying and selling cash trading. 
That likely makes them more appealing for institutional investors seeking to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, many of whom are balancing the lure of fast gains with the lingering risks in the emerging industry. 
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter, the company said.
Shares in Coinbase ended 1% lower on Wednesday after registering its first day of net gains this year on Tuesday reaching above $246 though it remains down around 39% since it went public in April last year.

Shares were up nearly 3% at $241.20 in premarket trading.
Shares of blockchain-related firms fell earlier this week as bitcoin slid below $40,000. It remains significantly below the all-time high of $69,000 it reached in November last year.

Investing.com – Boeing stock (NYSE:BA) stock rose 2.5% in Thursday’s premarket trading following a Bloomberg report that Chinese airlines could begin to fly its 737 MAX planes again this month onward.
Regulators in the world’s largest aviation market have kept the planes grounded following two fatal crashes, one each in 2018 and 2019. Boeing has since made computer fixes to the narrow-body planes, the company's biggest money-spinner prior to the crashes. A separate electrical issue in April last year had led the company to halt its deliveries of the same planes for a brief period.
China's Civil Aviation Authority gave its airworthiness certificate to the planes last month while telling the country’s carriers to comment on the changes made by the manufacturer. Those comments came in November.
U.S. regulators gave their approval to fly the planes again more than a year back.
Boeing said Tuesday it booked net orders of 535 aircraft overall in 2021, edging out arch-rival Airbus' (PA:AIR) bookings of 507 units.
According to a forecast given by Boeing in September, the market is likely to take delivery of 19,330 planes over the next ten years, short of the estimate it gave in 2019.

(Reuters) -AstraZeneca said on Thursday that preliminary data from a trial showed that its COVID-19 shot, Vaxzevria, generated an increase in antibodies against the Omicron and other variants when given as a third booster dose. 
The increased response, also against the Delta variant, was seen in a blood analysis of people who were previously vaccinated with either Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine, the drugmaker said, adding that it would submit this data to regulators worldwide given the urgent need https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/why-you-should-still-try-avoid-catching-omicron-2022-01-12 for boosters.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has developed the vaccine with researchers from the University of Oxford, and lab studies conducted by the university last month https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-shot-third-dose-works-against-omicron-study-2021-12-23 already found a three-dose course of Vaxzevria boosted antibody levels in the blood against the rapidly spreading Omicron variant.
The brief statement on Thursday, which did not include specific data, was the first by AstraZeneca on the protective potential of Vaxzevria as a booster shot following a two shot-course of either an mRNA based vaccine or Vaxzevria. Vaccines base on mRNA technology are made by BioNTech-Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
The company said the findings ""add to the growing body of evidence supporting Vaxzevria as a third dose booster irrespective of the primary vaccination schedules tested"".
The data on Vaxzevria's potential as a booster came from a comparative analysis in a trial testing a redesigned vaccine which uses the vector technology behind Vaxzevria but targeting the now-superseded Beta variant. AstraZeneca is trying to show the Beta-specific vaccine has potential also against other variants and more trial data is expected during the first half of the year. 
Separately, Oxford University and AstraZeneca last month started work on a vaccine specifically targeting Omicron though Astra - as well as other vaccine makers in similar development projects - have said it was not yet clear whether such an upgrade was needed.
A major British trial in December found that AstraZeneca's shot increased antibodies when given as a booster after initial vaccination with its own shot or  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s, but that was before the explosive spread of the Omicron variant.

However, the study at the time concluded that mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna gave a biggest boost to antibodies when given as a third dose.
AstraZeneca and its contract manufacturing partners have supplied over 2.5 billion doses globally of its vaccine, even though it is not approved in the United States, while BioNTech-Pfizer have shipped about 2.6 billion doses.

(Reuters) -Countryside Properties' shares slumped nearly 28% on Thursday after the British housebuilder said its first-quarter performance was below expectations and Chief Executive Iain McPherson was stepping down immediately.
The company forecast adjusted operating profit for the quarter more than halved, contrasting with upbeat news from rivals. Britain's undersupplied housing market has stayed resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic, helped by low mortgage rates and government support measures for buyers.
Countryside said Chairman John Martin would conduct a review of the company's developments, without elaborating.
The company's shares, listed on London's midcap index, hit their lowest in more than a year.
Peel Hunt analysts said in a note the review could find internal operational problems, since the company reported robust market conditions and said the supply of materials and labour had not gotten worse.
Martin will stand in as interim CEO until a replacement for McPherson is found. The outgoing CEO joined the firm in late 2014 and became CEO at the beginning of 2020.
The homebuilder's shares have fallen 12% in the two years since, with Martin taking over as chairman from David Howell last year, following pressure from U.S.-based investor Browning West..
On Thursday, Countryside also appointed Browning West partner Peter Lee to its board, while reporting adjusted operating profit of 16.5 million pounds ($22.7 million) for the first quarter, compared with 36.6 million pounds a year earlier.
Britain's No.2 housebuilder  Persimmon  (LON:PSN) forecast higher profit margins for the 2021 fiscal year on Thursday, and smaller rivals MJ Gleeson and Vistry both reported healthy trading figures this week on robust demand.
Countryside, which last year had flagged delays to the start of work at its sites after coronavirus-induced lockdowns, has projects across London, north and central England among other areas, and is a key player in the affordable housing sector.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has filed five insurance claims related to $1.17 billion in exposure across two of its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds, the bank said on Thursday.
As of Dec. 31, it had filed five claims related to $846 million in exposure for its Luxembourg-based supply chain finance fund, the bank said in a document published on its website, while it has filed two claims for its high-income supply chain finance fund related to $326 million in exposure. 
The bank said some of the claims were submitted in relation to both funds. It did not say with whom it had filed the claims.
Switzerland's second-largest bank has been working to recover assets from the collapse of some $10 billion in funds linked to insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill.
It has so far recovered some $7.2 billion of the funds.
The bank has been focusing on some $2.3 billion in loans provided by Greensill, which imploded in March, to three counterparties including commodities tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, SoftBank-backed Katerra, and coal miner Bluestone, for which late payments have accrued.
In December, it filed applications seeking information through U.S. courts which could lead to it taking legal action in Britain against SoftBank to recover funds it says are owed in relation to Katerra, which filed for bankruptcy in June. SoftBank has denied https://www.ft.com/content/0014a450-081b-4a8d-b3f5-6bc121bc1212 any wrongdoing.

Along with an application filed in California, the Swiss bank also filed for document discovery in an Arizona federal court, Credit Suisse said on Thursday.
As of Dec. 31, it said a total $2.5 billion in late payments had accrued across its four supply chain finance funds, $2.2 billion of which were related to the three companies.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hyundai Heavy Industries' proposed takeover of rival Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co Ltd to create the world's biggest shipbuilder was hit with an EU veto on Thursday on concerns that the deal would hurt competition.
Hyundai, one of the largest shipbuilders in the world, announced the deal in 2019 in part to tackle overcapacity in the sector. 
The shipyard, which sought EU antitrust approval for the takeover in November 2019, said it may challenge the EU prohibition and criticised the regulator's focus on market shares.
The South Korean industry ministry said it regretted the EU decision on a deal already cleared by China, Singapore and Kazakhstan. 
The European Commission said the deal would create the world's largest shipbuilder with a combined market share of at least 60%, leaving few alternative suppliers for customers.
The EU competition enforcer said the tie-up would reduce competition in the global market for the construction of large liquefied gas (LNG) carriers.
It also said the companies did not make a formal offer of remedies to address competition concerns. It said demand for large LNG carriers was not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic while the future demand outlook was very positive.
Reuters reported on Dec. 10 that the deal would be blocked by the EU executive.

""Given that no remedies were submitted, the merger would have led to fewer suppliers and higher prices for large vessels transporting LNG. This is why we prohibited the merger,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
This is the Commission's first merger veto since it blocked Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and Tata Steel's plan to form a landmark joint venture in 2019, on worries that the deal would have pushed up prices and reduced competition.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 07:40AM ET</span>",Life insurers adapt pandemic risk models after claims jump,"By Carolyn Cohn and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON (Reuters) - A coronavirus pandemic which lasts five years, another pandemic in a decade, and ever more transmissible variants are among the scenarios life insurers are predicting after COVID-19 claims jumped more than expected in 2021.
The global life insurance industry was hit with reported claims due to COVID-19 of $5.5 billion in the first nine months of 2021 versus $3.5 billion for the whole of 2020, according to insurance broker Howden in a report on Jan 4, while the industry had expected lower payouts due to the rollout of vaccines.
""We definitely paid out more than I had anticipated at the beginning of last year,"" said Hannover Re board member Klaus Miller.
The increase in claims was largely down to the emergence of the Delta variant, twice as transmissible, and more likely to cause hospitalisation than the original coronavirus strain. 
Claims rose most in the United States, India and South Africa due to the more lethal variants and a rise in fatalities or illness among younger and unvaccinated groups.
Dutch insurer Aegon (NYSE:AEG), which does two-thirds of its business in the United States, said its claims in the Americas in the third quarter were $111 million, up from $31 million a year earlier. U.S. insurers MetLife (NYSE:MET) and Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) also said life insurance claims rose. South Africa's Old Mutual used up more of its pandemic provisions to pay claims and reinsurer Munich Re raised its 2021 estimate of COVID-19 life and health claims to 600 million euros from 400 million. The long-term nature of life insurance products – often lasting 20 years or more – means premiums are not yet capturing the risk that deaths or long-term illness from COVID-19 will likely remain higher than previously estimated. Competition in the industry is also keeping a lid on premiums.
Actuaries say rising claims will be eating into the capital which insurers set aside to ensure solvency.
In the initial ""shock"" period of the pandemic in 2020, the insured U.S. population suffered 12% more deaths than average, according to research from life insurance trade association LIMRA shared with Reuters. ""For the insurance industry, that's not huge because we have reserves,"" said Marianne Purushotham, LIMRA's chief actuary.
""We're always trying to compare the new variant to the initial shock,"" she said.
The impact for insurers in 2020 was more muted because deaths were mainly among older people who typically do not take out life insurance.
CRYSTAL BALL-GAZING As the pandemic continues to surprise with the Omicron variant now becoming dominant, insurers, reinsurers and specialist risk modelling firms are looking to the future. 
""We take into account the possibilities of more transmissible and less transmissible (variants),"" Narges Dorratoltaj, scientist at modelling firm AIR said. ""We cannot say specifically which path we are going to follow but we are trying to come up with the possible ranges to at least narrow down the possible outcomes."" 
AIR is factoring in periodic lockdowns around the world and is also considering factoring in more uncertainty over whether governments will continue to impose restrictions to keep transmission rates low, and over individuals' willingness to obey them, Narges said.
Risk modelling firm RMS said its updated COVID-19 projection model allowed for variants, such as Omicron, which show elements of vaccine escape, as well as for variants which might evade vaccines. 
Reinsurer Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) said its pandemic model takes more than 20,000 different scenarios into account. It has been updating its risk model regularly with the latest data on testing, vaccination, infection, hospitalisation and fatality rates.
HOW LONG, WHAT'S NEXT? With the emergence of the even more transmissible Omicron, COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) has said it does not expect the pandemic to subside to an endemic state globally until 2024.
AIR's model anticipates that the pandemic, caused by a virus first identified in China in December 2019, could last five years.
Excess deaths could continue as the virus becomes endemic, similar to influenza which causes many deaths each year despite vaccines. 
""We would expect to see some medium-term (impact on claims) of five to 10 years,"" LIMRA’s Purushotham said.
More deaths or long-term illnesses will require insurers to set aside more reserves to pay claims, and may force them to raise premiums. 
Insurance risk experts also say the opportunities for transmission between humans and animals, high levels of global travel, increased urbanisation and climate change impacts such as deforestation and disease-carrying mosquitoes mean pandemics could become more frequent. ""A new coronavirus outbreak is indeed likely in the near future -- within the next 10 years,"" said Brice Jabo, principal modeller, life risks, at RMS, referring to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in the last two decades as early warnings.

The potential for any future corovanirus outbreak to again become a pandemic would depend on its transmissibility and the strength of measures to fight it, Jabo said.
Bruno Latourrette, chief knowledge officer of reinsurer SCOR Global Life, said he did not expect the next pandemic to be as devastating as COVID-19. ""COVID is...the perfect storm with pre-symptomatic contagiousness, a lethality that is not too high to lead to super-strong zero tolerance measures, a waning of immunity and high transmissibility"".

(Reuters) - NBCUniversal is partnering with TV measurement firm iSpot.tv in a multi-year deal to measure its audience in new ways, the company said on Thursday, the latest move among media companies dissatisfied with how video content is measured. 
The deal comes as Nielsen, the leader in TV measurement, faces fierce criticism from its TV industry clients, many of which say it has insufficiently captured consumers' shift to streaming. Nielsen measures TV audiences through a sample set of panelists who use special devices in their homes.
Through the partnership, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp-owned NBCU will measure traditional linear, streaming and time-shifted viewing on a second-by-second basis, a method the media giant believes will more accurately capture changing viewing habits. 
NBCU is launching the partnership in time to measure audiences of the Beijing Olympic Games and Super Bowl LVI, both of which will be broadcast on NBC and streamed on its Peacock streaming service.
TV ratings are the backbone of the industry's business model, enabling advertisers to track viewers and helping networks set the price for ad slots. TV advertising is expected to total $171 billion this year, according to a forecast from ad agency GroupM.

In April the trade group representing the major television networks said Nielsen undercounted TV viewers during the pandemic when the company's technicians were unable to get into panelists' homes to fix devices. That charge was later confirmed by the Media Ratings Council (MRC), which enforces measurement standards in media, and which in September stripped Nielsen of its accreditation for both local and national TV measurement.
On Aug. 23, weeks after its broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics, which drew a record-low audience, NBCU issued a call for ""measurement independence."" It issued a request for proposals to 54 companies, including Nielsen, inviting them to participate in a new set of measurement tools to help ""modernize the industry's approach.""

Investing.com – Delta Air Lines stock (NYSE:DAL) traded 2.7% higher in Thursday’s premarket as the carrier delivered on its promise of reporting an adjusted pretax profit in the fourth quarter, albeit a smaller one than it forecast less than a month ago.
Adjusted pre-tax income was $170 million in October-December, less than the company’s forecast of around $200 million but a sharp reversal of fortunes from the $2.1 billion adjusted pre-tax loss it booked in the same period a year ago.
It also gave a resilient outlook for the spring and summer seasons, forecasting that total revenue in the quarter through March will stay between 72% and 76% of 2019 levels, roughly on a level with the 74% seen in the December quarter, despite the airline having to cancel thousands of flights so far this month due to staff absences and other Covid-related problems.
“Omicron is expected to temporarily delay the demand recovery 60 days, but as we look past the peak, we are confident in a strong spring and summer travel season with significant pent-up demand for consumer and business travel,” a company release quoted Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian as saying.
Domestic passenger revenue was 78% restored compared to the final quarter of 2019 while international passenger revenue only recovered to 50% of pre-pandemic volumes.
Total operating revenue for the quarter was $9.47 billion, up almost 139% from a year earlier.
The airline expects to operate 83%-85% of its 2019 capacity in the current quarter despite ongoing problems with the Omicron variant of Covid-19, while it is now factoring in slightly higher fuel costs than what it estimated last month.  "

""It's highly emotive but we have to balance the needs of the business with those of workers and shareholders,"" said a spokesperson for the group.
He said unvaccinated workers who test positive will still receive Next's full rate of sick pay.
Next's move follows a similar one by furniture retailer Ikea.
Last month COVID rules in England were relaxed for people who have been vaccinated so they did not need to isolate if they were exposed to a positive case.
However, there was no change to the guidance for unvaccinated contacts of positive COVID-19 cases, who were still required to self-isolate for 10 days after their date of exposure to the virus.
Next's policy shift means unvaccinated workers required to isolate after being identified as a close contact of someone with COVID could receive as little as the Statutory Sick Pay minimum of 96.35 pounds ($132.43) a week. 
British companies have so far steered clear of the tough stance taken by companies in the United States on their workers' vaccination status.
An increasing number of U.S. companies have been using vaccine requirements to protect employees and avoid operations being disrupted by mass staff absences.

The major indices closed higher on Wall Street Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbing for the third day on the trot despite inflation data showing prices rose the most in 40 years last month.
While the headline annual CPI figure climbed 7.0% in December, expectations of a high figure were already reflected in the market and investors judged that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to act any more aggressively than it had already signaled.
There’s more inflation data on the slate Thursday, with wholesale prices expected to have risen by 0.4% in December on a month-on-month basis, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), a slowdown from November’s 0.8% rise. 
U.S. jobless claims, due at the same time, are expected to have stayed near last week’s post-pandemic lows, while Fed Governor Lael Brainard appears at a hearing on Capitol Hill for her confirmation as deputy chair.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian investigators may need another year to determine the cause of last year's crash of a Sriwijaya Air jet that killed all 62 people on board, according to an interim report released on Thursday.
Under international standards, a final report would normally be issued within a year of the Jan. 9, 2021 crash, but Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said the pandemic had made it harder for its team to travel.
""Because data has just been gathered, we're compiling a final report, including an analysis and a conclusion,"" KNKT investigator Nurcahyo Utomo told Reuters.
The Sriwijaya accident was Indonesia's third major airline crash in just over six years and shone a spotlight on the country's poor air safety record.
The 26-year-old Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-500 had an imbalance in engine thrust that eventually led the plane into a sharp roll and then a final dive into the sea, the interim report said.
That was in line with a preliminary report issued last year.
When the plane reached 8,150 feet (2,484 metres) after take-off from Jakarta, the left engine throttle lever moved back while the right lever stayed in its original position, the reports said, citing the flight data recorder.
There had been two prior problems reported with the autothrottle system that automatically controls engine power based on maintenance logs, but the issue was rectified four days before the crash, KNKT said last year.
The cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the Java Sea in March, after the preliminary report was released.

The interim report said the first officer's communications had been recorded but the captain's voice was only recorded when loud enough to be heard from the first officer's headset microphone. It did not provide details of the communications.

The group said UK like-for-like sales rose 0.2% year-on-year in its third quarter to Nov. 27 and were up 0.3% over the six weeks to Jan. 8.
As a result of stronger than expected sales to date Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) now expects a full-year 2021-22 retail operating ""slightly above"" the top-end of its previous 2.5-2.6 billion pound ($3.43-$3.57 billion) range.
Tesco's profit upgrade follows one from rival Sainsbury's on Wednesday and bullish updates this week from the UK arms of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. 
UK supermarkets faced tough comparisons against Christmas 2020 when a lockdown meant food and drink sales boomed.
While restrictions for Christmas 2021 were less severe, supermarkets still benefited from consumer nervousness over the spread of the Omicron variant which kept them away from bars and restaurants.
Tesco, which has a near 28% share of Britain's grocery market, said third-quarter UK like-for-like sales were up 6.9% against the same period in 2019-20, before the pandemic impacted trading. Sales over the six week Christmas period were up 8.8% on the same basis.
The group said it outperformed the market and grew market share.

Tesco forecast full-year operating profit for its bank to be between 160 million pounds and 200 million pounds, due to the effect of more favourable economic forecasts on its provision for expected credit losses.

950,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 06:16AM ET</span>","Betting on hydrogen hype, Thyssenkrupp eyes $687 million in IPO cash","By Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) -Thyssenkrupp's electrolysis business is aiming for proceeds of up to 600 million euros ($687 million) by selling new shares in a possible initial public offering this year, betting on the $130 billion hydrogen sector it supplies.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) plans to keep a majority in the business - which is being rebranded as Thyssenkrupp Nucera - following any IPO and aims to maintain the current shareholding ratio with its Italian co-owner De Nora, said Volkmar Dinstuhl, who leads the conglomerate's Multi Tracks division.
This implies a free-float of up to 25%.
Nucera's electrolysis technology uses power to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, allowing CO2 heavy sectors, including steelmaking, refining and fertilisers, to decarbonise using ""green"" hydrogen.
Hydrogen production, a market Precedence Research says was worth $130 billion in 2020, is benefiting from Europe's efforts to become a world leader in this technology, which could play a big role in attempts to cut emissions and decarbonise economies.
The 500 million-600 million in potential IPO proceeds would correspond to a stake sale of roughly 10-20% based on a valuation range of 3 billion to 6 billion euros that analysts have put on the division, which could be listed in the spring.
Thyssenkrupp Nucera is the world's top supplier of chlor-alkali membrane technologies needed to produce hydrogen, competing with Japan's Asahi Kasei, China's Bluestar Beijing Chemical Machinery and Britain's chemicals group Ineos.
It is also active in alkaline water electrolysis, a key requirement for the generation of hydrogen produced via renewable energy, pitting it against Norway's Nel ASA, UK's ITM Power and France's McPhy Energy SAS.
HUGE DEMAND
""Demand is huge. We want to use that opportunity,"" Denis Krude, CEO of Thyssenkrupp Nucera, told Reuters ahead of a capital markets on Thursday where investors are getting more detail on the business for the first time.
""We are a technology leader for electrolysis and have been in the business for decades,"" Krude, who has led the division since October 2016, added.
So far green hydrogen has been far more expensive than versions produced using fossil fuel, including the dominant ""grey"" hydrogen that relies on natural gas, but rising gas prices have started to change the economics. 
In the fiscal year to end-September, Thyssenkrupp Nucera posted earnings before interest and tax of 27 million euros, while sales came in at 319 million, a level expected to triple to 900 million to 1 billion by 2025/26.
The potential proceeds from selling new shares do not factor in the sale of existing stakes by current owners Thyssenkrupp and De Nora, which own Thyssenkrupp Nucera in a 66/34 split.
Thyssenkrupp, which first floated the idea of an IPO of its hydrogen business in May last year, declined to say how much it would sell as part of a secondary offering in case of an IPO.
""The market has enormous potential,"" Krude said, adding Nucera would invest 200 million to 300 million by 2024/25, of which 150 million-200 million will be spent on strategic moves including partnerships, production and smaller deals.
Thyssenkrupp, which makes everything from steel and submarines to car parts and fertiliser plants, sees an IPO as the preferred option for Nucera but has not made a final decision.

""For the Thyssenkrupp group the most important thing in a possible IPO is the so-called value crystallisation,"" said Dinstuhl.

Investing.com – Volkswagen stock (DE:VOWG) traded 1.3% lower in Germany after Covid outbreaks forced the company to suspend production at two of its plants in Chinese port city of Tianjin.
One plant is jointly run by the company with China’s FAW Group while the other is an automatic transmission component factory.
The decision by the German company follows a similar move by  Toyota  (NYSE:TM) which Monday halted production at its factory in the port city, which is around 62 miles from Beijing. The Chinese capital is scheduled to host the Winter Olympics February 4 onward. 
Authorities in Tianjin have clamped down on people’s movement, asking citizens to stay indoors. They began mass testing its 14 million residents last Wednesday to contain the Omicron variant, Reuters said.
Volkswagen will be looking at a quick resumption of output at the plants as it tries to make up for missing its sales targets in 2021. It aims to double sales of its ID battery electric vehicles in the world’s largest market for automobiles.
The ID series, which Volkswagen produces under joint ventures with China’s SAIC Motor (SS:600104) and FAW, is at the heart of its EV ambitions in China. The automaker sold 70,625 of its ID electric vehicles in China last year, missing its goal of selling 80,000-100,000 cars, according to Reuters.
The Group, which also sells luxury brands like Audi, Lamborghini and Porsche, sold 3.3 million cars in China last year, down 14%.

(Reuters) - The White House will meet executives from leading tech firms, including Alphabet-owned Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), on Thursday to discuss software security after the United States suffered several major cyberattacks last year.
In December, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent a letter to chief executives of tech firms after the discovery of a security vulnerability in open-source software called Log4j that organizations around the world use to log data in their applications.
In the letter, Sullivan noted that such open source software is broadly used and maintained by volunteers and is a "" key national security concern.""
Thursday's meeting, which will be hosted by deputy national security advisor for cyber & emerging technology, Anne Neuberger, will discuss concerns around the security of open-source software and how it can be improved, the White House said in a statement.
Other top tech companies in attendance at the meeting will include  IBM  (NYSE:IBM),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc which owns Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). Government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense and the Commerce Department, will also be in attendance.
Cybersecurity has been a top priority for the Biden administration after several major cyberattacks last year, which exposed thousands of records held by companies and government agencies to hackers.

One hack, which the U.S. government has said was likely orchestrated by Russia, breached software made by SolarWinds and gave hackers access to thousands of companies and government offices that used its products. The hackers got access to emails at the U.S. Treasury, Justice and Commerce departments, and other agencies.
The growing frequency and impact of such attacks prompted the administration to issue an executive order last year that created a review board and new software standards for government agencies.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwanese chip firm TSMC expects strong growth to accelerate in coming years due to booming semiconductor demand, as the tech giant on Thursday reported a record quarterly profit and said it plans to spend at least a third more than last year.
Soaring demand for semiconductors used in smartphones, laptops and other gadgets during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an acute chip crunch, forcing automakers and electronics manufacturers to cut production but keeping order books full at TSMC and other chipmakers.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), a major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier that also has customers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, posted a 16.4% rise in fourth-quarter profit.
The company said it expects to lift capital spending to between $40 billion and $44 billion this year. Last year it spent $30 billion.
TSMC announced in 2021 a $100 billion expansion plan over the next few years, as new technologies such as fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications technology and artificial intelligence applications also drive chip demand.
The company is entering ""a period of higher structural growth"", Chief Executive C. C. Wei told an online earnings briefing.
TSMC, Asia's most valuable listed firm and globally the largest contract chipmaker, expects capacity to remain tight this year and demand to be sustained in the long term, Wei said. 
""With fully-loaded foundry capacity, TSMC's near-term order outlook remains healthy,"" analysts at Taipei-based Fubon Research wrote in a note in early January. 
(Graphic on, TSMC and rivals' shares: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znvnelnoxpl/image-1642054328978.png)  
With what it calls a ""multi-year industry megatrend"" of strong chip demand boosted by new technologies, TSMC raised its compound annual growth rate targets for revenue over the next several years to 15%-20% from 10%-15%.
Wei shrugged off market concerns about chip oversupply in the coming years and said a substantial increase of ""silicon content"" in tech gadgets such as electric cars would help TSMC weather market corrections. 
""Even if a correction were to occur, we believe it could be less volatile for TSMC due to our technology leadership position and the structural megatrend,"" Wei said.
The company set a long-term target of ""53% and higher"" for its gross margins, up from a previous target of ""50% and higher"".
TSMC forecast first-quarter revenue to be in the range of $16.6 billion to $17.2 billion, compared with $12.92 billion in the same period a year earlier. For the year, it expects to grow in the mid -to-high 20% range in U.S. dollar terms.
In the October-December quarter, revenue climbed 24.1% to $15.74 billion. Net profit rose to T$166.2 billion ($6.01 billion) from T$142.8 billion a year earlier. 
That was higher than the T$161.6 billion average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.

TSMC shares have gained about 7% so far this year, giving it a market value of $618 billion. The stock closed 0.15% higher on Thursday before the financial results were released, slightly underperforming the broader market which finished up 0.33%.

1MDB raised billions of dollars in bonds, ostensibly for investment projects and joint ventures, between 2009 and 2013.
Authorities, however, believe more than $4.5 billion were allegedly misappropriated from the fund by high-level officials and their associates in an elaborate globe-spanning criminal scheme. 
Malaysia's finance ministry in a statement said a trust account set up to collect recovered 1MDB funds has received 19.1 billion ringgit ($4.58 billion), including $80 million from audit firm KPMG paid to settle a lawsuit filed against it by 1MDB.
The government has repaid 13.3 billion ringgit of 1MDB's debt so far, with 38.81 billion ringgit still outstanding as of Dec. 31, the ministry said. 
""The current balance of the trust account is sufficient to pay off only the principal amount of the bonds for 2022,"" it said. 
""Once all the trust account funds are utilised, the government will continue to bear the obligation to pay the balance of 1MDB's debts.""
The ministry said it remained committed to 1MDB asset recovery efforts and to ensure enough funds to manage the national financial burden created by the scandal. 
At least six countries have launched investigations into 1MDB, co-founded by former Prime Minister Najib Razak, in a scandal that has implicated high-level officials, banks and financial institutions around the world.

A Malaysian court last month upheld a conviction against Najib, who has been sentenced to 12 years in prison and millions in fines over corruption and money laundering linked to funds misappropriated from a 1MDB unit. 
He denies wrongdoing and remains out on bail pending another appeal.

957,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 04:40AM ET</span>",Most of Last Year’s First-Time Investors Will Invest Again in 2022,"By James Fattal
Investing.com -- 86% of those who delved into the investment arena for the first time in 2021 plan to invest more in the stock market during 2022, a new survey of U.S. investors has revealed.
According to the survey of 1,646 respondents (479 of whom invested for the first time in 2021), first-time investors are younger (63% from Generations X, Y, and Z, compared to 45% of other investors); earn less personal income (24% above $100,000, as opposed to 49% of more experienced investors); and are more likely to be female (37% versus 17%). They are about twice as likely (42%) as other investors (19%) to use Reddit or other social media platforms to inform their investment decisions. Further, they are less likely (16%) than their more experienced counterparts (32%) to consult with a financial advisor.
“A new generation of retail investors, which entered the stock market during the pandemic, is turning it on its head,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. “This group is more upbeat than the older generation and they're doing their own research on social media platforms, like Reddit, TikTok, and Twitter, instead of paying attention to the Wall Street analysts.”
First-time investors are also far more likely to take perceived risks. 58% include cryptocurrencies in their portfolio, compared to 37% for experienced investors. Similarly, they are more inclined to purchase meme stocks such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) (29% for first-timers versus 10% for other investors) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) (15% for first-timers versus 8% for others). Significantly more first-time investors (37%) than others (21%) also report that they trade for short-term gain.
“The rise of the first-time retail investor has changed the entire character of the market,” said Cohen. “They’re much more inclined to invest in risky meme stocks and cryptocurrencies than the older generation, so the professionals are no longer the only force that matters.”
In terms of trading platforms, 36% of first-time investors use Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), the financial services company which generated significant buzz over meme stock investing in 2021. Only 15% of more seasoned investors use Robinhood, compared to 32% who use TD Ameritrade and 28% who use Fidelity. At the same time, 26% of first-time investors also use TD Ameritrade, while just 15% use Fidelity.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, a greater number of experienced investors (87%) than first-timers (67%) reported a profit from their investments in 2021. Yet looking ahead, it's first-time investors who are the more optimistic about the future of the markets - with 84% expecting the stock market to increase in value during 2022, compared to 75% of other investors.
“After wrapping up another strong year of gains in 2021, there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about the stock market in 2022,” Cohen added. “Looking ahead, stocks look set for a volatile year amid risks related to the Federal Reserve’s tightening plans and the ongoing coronavirus health crisis.”"

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, with investors digesting the latest red-hot U.S. inflation release while festive trading statements placed the spotlight on the U.K. retail sector.
At 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.2%.
Global markets are still studying the release of the December U.S. consumer price index, which posted the biggest annual increase since 1982. This release cemented expectations for repeated interest rate hikes in the coming 12 months, and followed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell pledging to curb inflation without derailing the economic recovery in his renomination testimony on Capitol Hill earlier this week.
Back in Europe, there are a number of ECB policy makers due to speak later Thursday, but this central bank is not seen as being close to raising interest rates due to the Eurozone's different labor market conditions and the greater fragility of recoveries in countries such as Italy.
In corporate news, the U.K. retail sector is in focus Thursday after a number of important players released trading statements that took in the important festive period. 
Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) stock fell 5% despite the British retailer nudging up its profit outlook after it reported a strong Christmas performance. The group is recovering after a decade of decline, and its stock has nearly doubled over the past year.
Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) stock fell 2.1%, but remained close to its highest level since 2014, despite the U.K.'s biggest supermarket raising its full-year profit forecast, claiming its highest market share in four years. 
On the flip side, ASOS (LON:ASOS) stock climbed 6.4% after the online fashion retailer was able to reiterate its - admittedly already downgraded - outlook despite supply chain problems hitting sales growth in the four months to the end of its year.
Elsewhere, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock fell 1.7% after the German auto giant was forced to close two plants in the Chinese city of Tianjin due to recent Covid-19 outbreaks there. Toyota has already suspended production at its Tianjin plant. 
The coronavirus continues to affect life in Europe. Germany reported over 80,000 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, a new daily record, prompting Chancellor Olaf Scholz to suggest compulsory injections for all adults. Greece is set to extend some restrictions, Denmark is to offer a fourth vaccination to vulnerable citizens, while U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is struggling to maintain his position after admitting that he broke his own restrictions, claiming that he didn't realize that a gathering of over 40 people with drinks and snacks in his garden was a party (the invitation sent to over 100 people by his private secretary had invited guests to bring their alcoholic drinks).
Oil prices stabilized after mixed data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Wednesday’s release showed a drawdown of 4.5 million barrels in crude inventories last week, much larger than expected, with stockpiles at their lowest since October 2018. However, gasoline stockpiles increased by a hefty 8 million barrels, suggesting fuel demand has taken a hit from Omicron.
By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures edged higher to $82.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $84.76. Both contracts jumped well over 1% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,819.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher to 1.1465, a two-month high.

It posted total sales growth of 5%, following a 22% rise in the year to end August, and said gross margin decreased by 400 basis points to 43.0% driven by a need to discount goods and higher freight costs. 
For the full year it reiterated its outlook of revenue growth in the range of 10%-15% and adjusted profit before tax of 110 million pounds to 140 million pounds. That hit its shares when it was published in October, and would represent a more than 40% drop on the year before. 
""ASOS has delivered a robust start to the year, in line with the guidance we set out at full-year results, despite challenging market conditions,"" Chief Operating Officer Mat Dunn said. 
ASOS, once a darling of the stockmarket, was hit by a difficult end to 2021, when it cut its annual profit forecast and parted ways with its CEO following supply chain pressures and a return by shoppers to pre-pandemic ways. 
While shoppers often return partywear clothing and fashion, incurring a cost for the company, they retained the athleisure wear bought during the pandemic to use at home, giving the company a boost to its finances during lockdowns. 

Its shares are down 56% this year, prior to Thursday's update, mirroring similar falls seen at rival Boohoo which has also been hit by high product return rates, disruption to international deliveries and inbound freight costs.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 03:06AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Business as usual,"A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni. 
It's business as usual on Wall Street it seems, in a show of confidence the Federal Reserve can smoothly turn off the tap on stimulus with little damage to the economy and company profits.
A U.S. inflation headline print at its highest since the 1980s at 7% came as no shock on Wednesday and risks the macro cycle faces from the upcoming rate-hike round, starting as early as March, look to be tomorrow's problem.
The Nasdaq has clawed back more than half of this year's losses caused by the spike in real yields paid by bonds, with the retail crowd jumping back in to buy the dip. This time they have concentrated on the megacaps they see as safer. 
And following an initial jolt, the TINA argument that ""there is no alternative"" to the equity market staged a comeback, while 10-year U.S. government bond yields are down more than 5 basis points from this week's peak just above 1.8%.
The day ahead could be less lively, though. 
World stocks flat-lined in Asian trading hours after jumping 3% from Monday's lows, and futures point to slight declines across European equity markets and in the U.S. later on. 
Still, China's short-term money rates jumped to four-month highs, on rising seasonal cash demand, as the market's focus shifts to whether the central bank will trim policy rates to cushion the economic slowdown.
Oil is also set for a break after reclaiming pre-Omicron highs this week, in a blistering recovery that saw Brent prices jump 30% from December lows to near $85 a barrel.

The data calendar is light, but there is plenty of central bank speakers to focus on. Fed Governor Lael Brainard appears at Congress for a hearing into her nomination as deputy chair.

M&S, Britain's most famous stores group which is recovering from a decade of decline, said it now expected full-year profit before tax and adjusted items to be at least 500 million pounds ($686 million) compared to previous guidance of about 500 million pounds.
It said food sales increased 12.4% against its pre-pandemic performance two years ago in the 13 weeks to Jan. 1, beating market forecasts of 10% growth. 
Clothing and home sales rose 3.2% on the same basis, also surprising on the upside. The market had expected a 0.9% fall.
Chief Executive Steve Rowe said: ""Trading over the Christmas period has been strong, demonstrating the continued improvements we've made to product and value.""
He said food had outperformed the market over both 12 and 24 months, while clothing & home had delivered growth for the second successive quarter, supported by more full-price sales.

The update provides evidence that one of Britain's most elusive turnarounds could finally materialise. M&S's shares have nearly doubled over the past year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began publishing notices early on Thursday that detailed the extent of potential impact of new 5G wireless service on sensitive aircraft electronics.
The FAA has been in talks with airplane makers, airlines and wireless carriers to reduce the impact of new wireless service set to begin on Jan. 19.
The FAA has warned that potential interference could affect sensitive airplane instruments like altimeters but on Wednesday reported progress.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ), which won nearly all of the C-Band spectrum in an $80-billion auction last year, on Jan. 3 agreed to buffer zones around 50 airports to reduce the risk of interference. They also agreed to delaydeployment for two weeks, averting an aviation safety standoff.
The FAA began publishing what are known as 'Notices to Air Missions' at midnight Thursday local time offering details on ""aircraft with untested altimeters or that need retrofitting or replacement will be unable to perform low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed.""
More than 300 notices had been posted by 01:00 ET, including many around major airports and hospitals where medical helicopters are used. The FAA did not respond to a question about how many in total were to be published.
Many of the notices https://notams.aim.faa.gov/notamSearch/nsapp.html#/details say certain procedures are unavailable unless the FAA approves alternative methods of compliance ""due to 5G C-Band interference."" 
The wireless industry provided additional transmitter location data and the FAA said it was able to determine that in the initial 5G deployment, aircraft will be able to safely land in low-visibility conditions on some runways without restrictions.
Some notices include details of how instrument approaches at major airports are impacted. The FAA has determined that some GPS-guided approaches will continue to be possible at certain airports like Miami and Phoenix. 
The FAA said Wednesday that it ""expects to provide updates soon about the estimated percentage of commercial aircraft equipped with altimeters that can operate reliably and accurately in the 5G C-Band environment.""

The FAA is still ""working to determine which radar altimeters will be reliable and accurate with 5G C-Band deployed in the United States.""
On Friday, the FAA picked 50 U.S. airports that will have buffer zones when wireless carriers turn on new 5G C-band service.

The Hong Kong-listed developer plans to sell 452 million new shares, or 8.3% of the enlarged share capital, to controlling shareholder Sunac International Investment Holdings, it said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse.
The new shares will be issued at HK$10 apiece, representing a 15.3% discount to Wednesday's closing price of HK$11.80 each. 
Shares of Sunac tumbled 22% in afternoon trade to HK$9.2, versus a 0.2% decline in the broader market
A source close to Sunac told Reuters the company has no more plan in the near term to place its shares or shares in unit Sunac Services to raise capital, adding it has sufficient funds to meet debt payment obligations due in the short term and for project development.
Sunac China did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sunac last issued new shares and sold a stake in Sunac Services in November to raise a total of $948 million. 
Sunac Services told investors on Tuesday it also had no share placement plan nor new connected-party transactions scheduled and it would resume share buybacks, according to a report by brokerage Jefferies.
In the latest share placement, the controlling shareholder will buy the new shares after selling the same amount of existing shares at the same price to third-party investors.

The group, which offers administrative services for companies setting up branches and entities in various jurisdictions, blamed a decline in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands over the fourth quarter.
""This was mainly due to lower productivity as a result of elevated employee attrition, which continued through the end of December,"" Intertrust said in a pre-released earnings update.
The group's underlying revenue growth came in at around 1.5% for the full year, against an initial estimate of 2% to 4%.
Its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and amortisation (EBITA) margin reached about 30%, slightly below guidance of 31% to 32%.
Intertrust confirmed the around 1.8 billion euro ($2.06 billion) public offer for the firm by U.S.-based corporate services firm CSC was progressing as planned.
In November, it said it had received multiple expressions of interest from third parties, having earlier announced exclusive discussions with British private equity firm CVC Capital Partners.

The maker of ceramics, shower toilets and other construction supplies reported annual sales rising 16% to 3.46 billion Swiss francs ($3.78 billion). The sales growth was the strongest since the company went public in 1999.
The company attributed the increase to people improving their homes during the pandemic, as well as customers in the construction industry rebuilding inventories.
The sales growth was helped by favourable comparisons when compared with 2020, although the annual figures were still 16.4% above the pre-pandemic sales levels in 2019.
""The exceptionally good results seen since the second half of 2020 show that Geberit has emerged stronger from this COVID-19-related challenging conditions and has gained market share,"" the company said.
""Despite the considerable challenges arising along the supply chains, the group was able to safeguard product availability.""
Geberit, whose products are used in new build and refurbishment projects, is seen as a bellwether for the health of the broader construction market.
During the fourth quarter sales rose 6.7% to 773 million Swiss francs. The Swiss company, which is due to publish its full-year earnings on March 9, said it expects an operating cashflow margin (EBITDA) of around 31%, the same level as a year earlier.
The construction sector has enjoyed an upswing during 2021, helped by the return of demand that was suppressed last year, reopening of building sites and low interest rates supporting many schemes.

Geberit is also wresting with higher raw materials costs and introduced two additional price rises last year to deal with it. The company uses metals like aluminium and copper, plastics and ceramics in its products.

970,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 02:04AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Edge Lower; Investors Digest U.S. Inflation Surge,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a cautious manner Thursday, as investors digest the latest red-hot U.S. inflation release, cementing interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year,
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
The U.S. consumer price index rose 7% in the 12 months through December, the biggest annual increase since 1982, influenced by supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and strong stimulus-boosted household balance sheets.
This release cemented expectations for repeated interest rate hikes in the coming 12 months, and followed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell pledging to curb inflation without derailing the economic recovery in his renomination testimony on Capitol Hill earlier this week.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to hike interest rates at least three times this year, perhaps as soon as March, and the inflation news did little to change that narrative.
Back in Europe, there are a number of ECB policy makers due to speak later Thursday, but this central bank is not seen as being close to raising interest rates due to the Eurozone's different labor market conditions and the greater fragility of recoveries in countries such as Italy.
Germany reported over 80,000 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, a new daily record, prompting new Chancellor Olaf Scholz to suggest compulsory injections for all adults. Greece is set to extend some restrictions, Denmark is to offer a fourth vaccination to vulnerable citizens, while U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is struggling to maintain his position after admitting that he broke his own restrictions.
In corporate news, Swiss plumbing parts manufacturer  Geberit  (SIX:GEBN) reported a rise of 6.7% in fourth-quarter sales, as the construction market continued its recovery towards the end of 2021.
Additionally, the U.K. retail sector is likely to be in focus, with Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) and ASOS (LON:ASOS) all releasing trading statements covering the important festive period. 
Oil prices edged lower, with traders pocketing some of the recent gains amid uncertainty over the impact of the surge in Omicron Covid cases on overall global demand.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released on Wednesday, showed a drawdown of 4.5 million barrels in crude inventories last week, much larger than expected, with stockpiles at their lowest since October 2018.
However, that bullish news has been tempered by gasoline stockpiles increasing by a hefty 8 million barrels, suggesting fuel demand has taken a hit from Omicron.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $82.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $84.22. Both contracts jumped well over 1% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,824.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1443.

Operating profit in the three months to Nov. 30 rose to 127 million euros ($145.30 million) while sales increased 17.4% to 2.04 billion euros. The company made an advance release of earnings on Dec. 15.
The company repeated its December forecast of full-year group operating profit of between 320 million and 380 million euros, up from the previous year's 236 million.
Suedzucker, whose operations range from pizza and processed foods to food ingredients and bioethanol, said its sugar business swung to a quarterly operating profit of about 10 million euros from a 28 million euro loss in the same period last year.
""With a further deficit in the world sugar balance in the 2021/22 marketing year, the world market environment is expected to remain positive,"" Suedzucker said. 
Sugar futures hit 4-1/2-year highs in October with high energy prices generating more demand for sugar-based ethanol fuel amid tightening global sugar supplies, although prices pulled back from peaks in January. 
The EU is expected to produce more sugar this season if beet yields normalise but Europe is still expected to need extra supplies, Suedzucker said.
The company expects to produce 4.2 million tonnes of sugar this season, up from 3.5 million tonnes last year.
""Since the EU will remain a net importer in the 2021/22 sugar marketing year, Suedzucker will enjoy a positive market environment,"" it said.

Since October 2021, Suedzucker's sugar business has benefited from rising sales revenues and cost savings from a recent corporate restructuring programme which saw several factory closures.
This will be offset by significantly higher energy and packaging material costs and additional charges could arise from the fourth coronavirus wave, it said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is ""still working through a lot of challenges with the government"" in India, its billionaire chief executive Elon Musk said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Thursday, responding to a question on when it would launch its electric cars in the country. 
Tesla had plans to begin selling imported cars in India last year and has been lobbying the government to slash import taxes on electric vehicles (EVs) before it enters the market. In October, it took its demands to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office.
Musk didn't identify the ""challenges"" being worked on in his Twitter post.
The Indian market for premium EVs is still in its infancy and charging infrastructure is scarce. Just 5,000 of the 2.4 million cars sold in India last year were electric, of which a handful were luxury models.
India levies an import duty of as high as 100% on imported cars, including EVs, which Musk has previously said are among the highest in the world. Analysts have said that at these rates Tesla cars would become too costly for many buyers, crimping sales.
Tesla's demands for tax cuts - first reported by Reuters in July - have prompted objections from several local players, who say such a move would deter investment in domestic manufacturing.

Indian government officials are also divided over the U.S. automaker's demands. Some officials want the company to commit to local manufacturing before considering any tax breaks, but Tesla has indicated it first wants to experiment with imports.
Even as Tesla is holding out for a cut in import duties, luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz will start assembling the electric version of its flagship S-Class sedan, the EQS, in India later this year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd has pared about a third of planned domestic and international capacity in the March quarter to better match travel demand after a rise in COVID-19 infections, it said on Thursday.
The airline, which ends its financial year in June, said it would provide more details on the impact of the changes when it issues half-year results in late February. 
Qantas has not made material capacity adjustments for the fourth quarter, it added.
The Australian carrier is the latest airline globally to make major March quarter capacity cuts as the highly infectious Omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads globally, dampening travel demand and leading to rising sick calls among staff.

Qantas said it would run 70% of its pre-COVID-19 domestic capacity in the third quarter, down from a prior forecast of 102%, at a time when Australia is reporting record numbers https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/australia-covid-19-infections-hit-record-amid-runaway-omicron-outbreak-2022-01-13 of COVID-19 cases due to a runaway Omicron outbreak.
International capacity will fall to 20% of pre-COVID-19 levels from 30% due to tighter travel restrictions in countries including Japan, Indonesia and Thailand, Qantas added.

""We have the flexibility to add capacity back if demand improves earlier than expected, but 70% still represents a lot of domestic flying and it's a quantum improvement on the levels we faced only a few months ago,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in a statement.
He said early bookings for the Easter holidays in April were promising for domestic and international flights.

Investing.com – China’s third-largest developer Sunac China Holdings Ltd. raised $580 million through a top-up share sale after a liquidity crisis led to a tumble on the developer’s dollar bonds on Wednesday.
However, Sunac’s Hong Kong shares dived 16.27% to HK$9.88 ($1.27) by 11:00 PM ET (4:00 AM GMT).
Sunac sold 452 million shares at HK$10 per share, a 15% discount on their Wednesday close, according to the deal terms obtained by Bloomberg. The company said half of the approximately 50% of the net proceeds from the sale will be used for loan repayment, while another 50% will be used for operations.
This is the second shares sale within two months. The company raised around $953 million through the sales of new shares and a stake in its property management unit, Sunac Services Holdings Ltd., in November 2021.
A court-ordered asset freeze on one of the company’s units earlier in the week triggered worries about the company’s financial health. Sunac has resolved the issue with a business partner and is now working to withdraw the court orders, it told Bloomberg on Wednesday.
The “panic” selling by bondholders, as described by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Daniel Fan, dragged Sunac’s 2024 notes to about 47 cents on the dollar during Wednesday’s session.
To deal with its debt woes, Sunac raised $2 billion in late 2021 via measures including selling office and hotel projects in Shanghai and Hangzhou, placing shares, borrowing from its controlling shareholder and the Sunac Services Holdings Ltd. stake sale. It is also exploring selling its culture and tourism portfolio, which it acquired over the past four years for about CNY65 billion ($10.21 billion)."

(Reuters) -Private-equity firm TPG said on Wednesday it raised $1 billion in its U.S. initial public offering (IPO) at a valuation of $9.1 billion. 
TPG's stock market debut comes a decade after most of its major peers went public. The firm spent years recovering from a string of poor investments in the 2000s and diversifying its private-equity platform into growth and social impact investing.
With the shares of many publicly listed private-equity firms hovering near all-time highs, and peers such as EQT (NYSE:EQT) AB and Bridgepoint Group Plc having launched IPOs in the last three years that were well-received by the market, TPG decided now was the time to follow suit.
It braved a choppy market. Three other IPOs, including that of TypTap Insurance Group, were canceled this week, as investor concerns about raging inflation and higher interest rates fueled market volatility.
TPG said on Wednesday it priced its IPO at $29.50 per share. The buyout firm had said this week it planned to sell the shares at between $28 and $31 apiece. 
The Fort Worth, Texas-based firm has nearly $109 billion in assets under management, with investments in companies including Airbnb Inc,  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT), Burger King and McAfee Corp. 
TPG said in a regulatory filing it intends to use the proceeds from the offering to fund growth initiatives and expenses.
About 40% of the capital raised would go to TPG shareholders who are looking to cash out. That excludes its founders, who plan to keep their holdings for now.
Founded in 1992 by David Bonderman and Jim Coulter, TPG was launched as Texas Pacific Group in Mill Valley, California. Its first major investment was in the then bankrupt Continental Airlines in 1993.
J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), TPG Capital BD LLC and BofA Securities are the lead underwriters for TPG's offering.

979,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 11:06PM ET</span>",Crown says likely to back improved $6.5 billion Blackstone buyout offer,"By Scott Murdoch and Sameer Manekar
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's biggest casino operator, Crown Resorts Ltd, said on Thursday its board was likely to back an improved A$8.87 billion ($6.46 billion) buyout proposal from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc unless a higher offer emerged.
Crown received a fourth non-binding offer of A$13.10 a share, having dismissed Blackstone's previous bid of A$12.50 as not ""compelling https://www.reuters.com/business/australias-crown-says-blackstones-62-bln-buyout-offer-not-compelling-2021-12-01/#:~:text=N)%20%246.2%20billion%20buyout%20offer,inquiries%20for%20a%20revised%20proposal"".
The revised offer puts Blackstone in the box seat to win control of Crown, which has faced devastating misconduct inquiries https://www.reuters.com/business/australias-crown-branded-disgraceful-gets-two-years-fix-melbourne-casino-2021-10-25 in every state it operates in, while protracted COVID-19 lockdown measures has caused a drop in visitors.
A person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the near 5% price rise agreed after initial due diligence was supported by major investors, including founder James Packer, who collectively own around 60% of Crown stock.
There are hopes of signing a deal by January-end, said the person, who was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified.
Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), a vehicle owned by Packer with a 37% stake in Crown, said it was encouraged by the announcement of the proposal and awaited further developments.
""CPH will review all documents released to the market by Crown Resorts relating to a binding control transaction prior to making a decision regarding its shareholding,"" it said.
Investment manager Perpetual, Crown's third-largest shareholder with a 9.2% stake, said it was in favour of the revised proposal in the absence of a better offer.
Blackstone, which owns 9.9%, declined to comment. 
The deal, which requires approval from casino regulators in three Australian states and a shareholder vote, could be completed by the end of June, said a second person familiar with the matter.
Crown shares jumped as much as 9% to A$12.68 on Thursday morning, their highest price since June 4, but still well below Blackstone's offer indicating market doubt about a rival bid.
Following the latest offer, the casino operator said https://events.miraqle.com/DownloadFile.axd?file=/Report/ComNews/20220113/02475175.pdf it will engage with Blackstone on a non-exclusive basis and give the investment manager the opportunity to finalise due diligence.
Crown said if Blackstone makes a binding offer of at least A$13.10 per share and if there are no superior offers, its board intends to recommend shareholders vote in favour of the proposal.
""It is likely that a deal will get done,"" said Steve Johnson, chief investment officer at Forager Funds Management, which owns Crown shares.
""The increase in offer price is a welcome step in the right direction and we are supportive of the board continuing a push for an appropriate firm offer for shareholders,"" he said.
After an inquiry in July last year urged Crown be stripped of its gambling licence for its main Melbourne resort https://www.reuters.com/business/australia-inquiry-urged-strip-crown-resorts-licence-main-casino-2021-07-20, Australia's second-biggest casino operator Star Entertainment Group Ltd withdrew https://www.reuters.com/business/australias-star-entertainment-abandons-66-bln-bid-crown-resorts-2021-07-22/#:~:text=July%2023%20(Reuters)%20-%20Australian,licence%2C%20sending%20its%20shares%20lower a A$9 billion mostly scrip buyout proposal.
Star, subject to a separate regulatory inquiry over its actions to counter money laundering, has left open the possibility of re-entering the fray. In an emailed response to Reuters on Thursday, it reiterated it ""remains open to exploring potential value enhancing opportunities with Crown"".
Crown remains open to talks with Star and expects its peer to have more room to manoeuvre after the regulatory inquiry wraps up, said a third person familiar with the matter.

Public hearings on Star are due to begin in March.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Infosys raised its revenue forecast and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) predicted robust demand on Wednesday as the Indian IT giants said they expect tech spending to continue, particularly for digital services such as the cloud.
Often seen as a bellwether for India's more than $190 billion software services industry, Infosys (NYSE:INFY) said large deal wins worth $2.53 billion in the three months to the end of December had boosted its confidence.
Mumbai-based TCS and Bengaluru-headquartered Infosys came to prominence by giving Western clients low-cost solutions to problems such as the Y2K bug and have become global giants in international business as outsourcing grew.
Infosys expects 19.5%-20% revenue growth for the financial year to end-March 2022, compared with a previous 16.5%-17.5% prediction, while retaining its operating margin guidance.
""We had a strong set of large deals and the pricing environment remains stable ... the amount clients want to spend on technology is going up,"" Chief Executive Salil Parekh told a virtual news briefing.
India's software services sector has won more business during the COVID-19 pandemic as companies globally look to boost their digital presence and demand IT services ranging from cloud-computing, digital payment infrastructure to cybersecurity.
Infosys, India's No.2 IT company, reported a near 12% rise in its consolidated net profit to 58.09 billion rupees ($786 million) in the third quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of 57.05 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv Eikon.
Announcing its earnings for the December quarter, the larger TCS said its consolidated net profit rose 12.3% to 97.69 billion rupees, slightly below an average analyst forecast of 98.44 billion rupees, Refinitiv data showed.
""It's a very broad-based growth that we are experiencing and very broad-based demand environment and we are participating strongly across the full spectrum of demand,"" TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan told reporters. ""That gives us quite a lot of confidence in terms of outlook for the future...""
The quarter saw clients invest in technology for long-term growth, TCS said, adding that its growth was across all services including cloud, cyber security, consulting and services integration, ""internet of things"" and digital engineering.
Consolidated revenue from operations at TCS jumped 16.4% to 488.85 billion rupees, while Infosys posted revenue of 318.67 billion rupees.
""The large deal wins and the (Infosys) CEO's statement on large digital transformation pipeline gives (a) good amount of confidence that the Indian (IT) companies are on a strong footing,"" Saurabh Jain, assistant vice president at SMC Securities, said.

Another Indian IT major  Wipro  (NYSE:WIT), which reported earnings earlier in the day, said its December quarter revenue climbed 30%, while net profit remained nearly flat.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Thursday morning, with the fastest U.S. inflation print in over three decades fueling expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates as early as March 2022.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.96% by 9:03 PM ET (2:03 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.07%, with the Bank of Korea handing down its policy decision on Friday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.43% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.24%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.02% and the Shenzhen Componentwas down 0.23%.
U.S. shares, including the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 ended on a high note on Wednesday. Data released in the U.S. showed that the core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month and 5.5% year-on-year in December. The CPI grew 7% year-on-year and 0.5% month-on-month, the fastest pace since 1982.
In its Beige Book survey, the Fed said that the U.S. economy grew at a modest pace in the final weeks of 2021, but businesses’ expectations for growth over the next several months have cooled in some places.
The U.S. inflation data came after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pledged to curb inflation without derailing the economic recovery from COVID-19.
Fed St. Louis President James Bullard told the Wall Street Journal that four rate increases may be justified in 2022 amid high inflation. Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester and Atlanta Fed leader Raphael Bostic separately backed interest rate hikes as soon as March 2022.
Other Fed officials, including Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, will speak later in the day. New York Fed President John Williams will speak on Friday.
Inflation continues to remain a big concern for some investors as well.
“Inflation is going to be with us no matter if they increase rates and the challenges of the economy here are just going to build on that,” Strategic Wealth Partners chief market strategist Shana Sissel told Bloomberg.
“I am concerned that there is going to be quite a bit of volatility in the market and our economy is going to slow down considerably.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing for Fed vice-chair nominee Lael Brainard will take place later in the day and investors also await the U.S. producer price index."

The nation’s third-largest property developer by sales sold 452 million shares at HK$10 apiece, a 15% discount to Wednesday’s close, according to terms of the deal obtained by Bloomberg News. Shares of Sunac opened 15% lower in Hong Kong trading Thursday. 
The placement comes just two months after Sunac raised about $953 million through the sale of new shares as well as a stake in its property management unit.
Sunac is among the largest Chinese developers racing to avert a cash crunch after a government crackdown all but closed off the industry’s access to the dollar-bond market, triggering a record surge in defaults and heightening concerns about a slowdown in Asia’s largest economy. Sunac is considered a higher-quality borrower among junk-rated developers by international credit risk assessors, with the equivalent of a BB rating.
Worries about the company’s financial health escalated this week after one of its units was hit by a court-ordered asset freeze. The developer told Bloomberg News on Wednesday that the issue with a business partner has been resolved and they are now working to withdraw the court orders. 
Sunac’s statement helped ease what Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Daniel Fan described as “panic” selling by bondholders, which dragged prices on the developer’s 2024 notes to about 47 cents on the dollar at one point on Wednesday. The bonds rallied to about 50 cents by day’s end, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Sunac raised $2 billion late last year by selling office and hotel projects in Shanghai and Hangzhou, placing shares, borrowing from its controlling shareholder and selling the stake in its property management unit, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The developer is exploring a sale of its culture and tourism business, people familiar with the matter said in November. It acquired the assets, which include hotels, resorts and amusement parks, over the past four years for about 65 billion yuan ($10 billion). 
While China’s government has signaled a reluctance to abandon its clampdown on excessive borrowing by developers, regulators have been dialing back the intensity of restrictions in recent months as they try to prevent a liquidity crunch at weaker builders from destabilizing the financial system and economy. In window guidance issued last month, authorities told banks to step up lending to developers after at least two quarters of consecutive declines, according to people familiar with the matter.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 08:50PM ET</span>","Mexico eyes antitrust implications of Citi sale, expects robust bidder interest","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government on Wednesday signaled it would be alert to possible antitrust implications of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s sale of its consumer banking operations in Mexico, and said it expected plenty of bidders to emerge for the assets.
In a statement, the finance ministry said the departure from Mexico of the country's no. 3 consumer bank ""raises delicate matters for the finance and regulatory authorities, which will receive rigorous and strict attention from the finance ministry, including a fundamental issue regarding concentration.""
Finance Minister Rogelio Ramirez de la O said the government had ""no bias"" about who could acquire the Citibanamex assets and that domestic and foreign bidders were welcome to compete.
""In due course, as the process matures, the Mexican government will be observing and looking at the different offers,"" Ramirez told Reuters in an interview.
His ministry said Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser came personally to Mexico ""to explain the decision, and stressed the bank will maintain its wholesale corporate banking activities in our country, which will involve new investments.""
A finance ministry spokesperson said Fraser was in Mexico 10 days ago and met Ramirez. The minister told Reuters he had briefed President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on her visit.
Ramirez stressed that the government wanted the Citibanamex assets up for grabs to preserve their value.
""And that the bank retains its magnitude so that savers and account holders of the bank don't feel any kind of uncertainty,"" he said, underlining that Mexico's government itself did not have any interest in acquiring the assets. 
Citigroup did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas said on Tuesday evening he had asked his team to study the possibility of buying the Citigroup assets, and Mexican Interior Minister Adan Augusto Lopez said he expected plenty more bids to emerge.
""There are sure to be various business groups interested in putting forward a purchase offer,"" Lopez told a regular news conference, standing in for Lopez Obrador after the president said he had contracted COVID-19 for a second time this week.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government has ""no bias"" on potential buyers for the assets of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) that the U.S. bank is selling in Mexico, with both international and domestic bidders welcome, Finance Minister Rogelio Ramirez de la O said on Wednesday.
Citigroup said on Tuesday it was selling its consumer banking operations in Mexico, and Ramirez told Reuters in an interview the process would be open to all.
""Both national and foreign (bidders) with a presence in Mexico and outside of Mexico,"" he said. The government did not want to influence or negatively affect the sale, he said.
""It would be improper for the government to give a signal at this point,"" he said, adding Mexico had ""no bias.""
As the process matured, the government and regulators would give careful consideration to the different bids, said Ramirez, who was emphatic in underlining that Mexico wanted the Citibanamex assets up for sale to retain their value.
""This interest is because we don't want account holders of Citibanamex feeling they need to go to another bank,"" he said.
The finance ministry earlier said it would be paying close attention to what implications the deal had for concentration of market power, though Ramirez stressed this was a task for antitrust authority the Federal Economic Competition Commission.

Citibanamex is already Mexico's no. 3 consumer bank, and when asked if the antitrust concerns could make a bid tougher by Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), a top player in Mexico, Ramirez said it was not up to him to make determinations on market concentration.
The two together have much of the market. The government had no interest in acquiring the Citigroup assets and the process of the sale would take time, Ramirez said. He declined to forecast how long that could be.

BOSTON (Reuters) -  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN) Corp reacted to Starboard Value's decision to nominate four directors to its board on Wednesday, saying the two sides had consulted on key matters but that the activist investor is forcing it into an ""unnecessary"" board room fight.
Chemicals maker Huntsman said investment firm Starboard did not act constructively to help decide who will serve as a director. 
""Starboard is more concerned with installing their handpicked candidates on Huntsman's Board than allowing the Board and management team to create shareholder value, through our multiple initiatives that Starboard supports,"" the Texas-headquartered company said in a statement.
Huntsman said it welcomes constructive insights from shareholders but said Starboard is forcing it into a costly and distracting ""unnecessary proxy contest.""
Huntsman reacted hours after Starboard nominated four directors, including its chief executive Jeffrey Smith, to the 14-member board earlier in the day and released a detailed timeline of who did what when to try and find new board members.
Only a few days ago Huntsman appointed new directors and made other changes, moves it said were part of a long-running plan to refresh the board. The company said it had kept Starboard informed about its plans and had asked for the names of Starboard's director candidates in early December. Starboard came back with names only in early January, Huntsman said.
Starboard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
While the two sides failed to see eye to eye on directors, Huntsman said they interacted more constructively on other issues. 
""There was, and continued to be, no misalignment with Starboard on the Company's objectives and strategic initiatives,"" the Huntsman statement said.
Huntsman, which is valued at $8.2 billion, makes chemical products for uses ranging from construction materials to plastics.
It set its annual meeting for March 25 when investors will have a chance to decide who should serve on the board unless the two sides settle the matter beforehand.

The seven-year notes, its second U.S. dollar bond offering, have a coupon of 3.375%. A year ago, it raised $500 million in a five-year issue with a 3% coupon.
The airline was aiming to raise between $500 million and $750 million, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
The Singapore government last month froze the sale of tickets for arriving flights under its quarantine-free travel programme for four weeks, citing the risk from the fast-spreading Omicron COVID-19 variant.
Before this offering, the airline had raised S$21.6 billion ($16 billion) of liquidity during the pandemic and had untapped debt facilities of S$2.1 billion as of Sept. 30, according to its latest financial results presentation.

Despite the fall in demand, it has been spending billions of dollars renewing its fleet to help lower fuel burn and carbon emissions.

LONDON (Reuters) - A third of the 350 companies most exposed to commodities such as palm oil, beef and timber have no policies to ensure their products are not fuelling deforestation, a report by NGO Global Canopy showed on Thursday.
Protecting the world's forests is central to efforts to limit man-made global warming by mid-century, and at the COP26 climate talks in November, 141 countries pledged to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030.
At the same time, more than 30 financial institutions with nearly $9 trillion in assets said they would aim to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation from their portfolios by 2025.
Britain has already made it a legal responsibility for companies to ensure they have no illegal deforestation in their supply chains, and the European Union and United States are looking at similar legislation.
Companies also face direct threats from deforestation, as it exacerbates climate impacts, drives biodiversity loss and affects water supplies, potentially affecting growing conditions for commodity crops, supplies and prices. 
In its annual 'Forest 500' report, Global Canopy said just 28% of companies that produce, use, trade or sell commodities had comprehensive policies covering all those they were exposed to. 
Among 150 of the world's leading financial institutions that finance the companies to the tune of $5.5 trillion, just 38% had a clear policy on addressing deforestation, it added.
""Last year saw unprecedented political action as more than 140 governments recognised the urgent need to protect forests, yet most companies and financial institutions with the greatest ability to halt deforestation are doing little or nothing,"" said Niki Mardas, executive director of Global Canopy.
""As major consumer governments start to translate these commitments into hard and fast legislation, businesses which have not taken deforestation seriously are woefully unprepared and face real risks.""
Among the companies flagged as having no policy were TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), owner of the T.J. Maxx stores, and Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI), which owns the Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors fashion brands, the report said. 

TJX said while it does not currently have a formal deforestation policy, it has work underway on the subject as part of its environmental sustainability program. 
Capri Holdings did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bernard Adams, a retired police sergeant of the New York Police Department, will serve as executive director of mayoral security, a job with a typical salary of $210,000, the Times reported. He was most recently a parking administrator at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, it added. 
The 56-year-old could have made $240,000 as an NYPD deputy commissioner. The security director role falls within the structure of the department, from which he retired after two decades on the force, the Times said.
The mayor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The hiring will require a waiver from the Conflicts of Interest Board, the city agency tasked with enforcing government ethics.
Mayor Adams, a former police captain who took office on Jan. 1, on Sunday fended off concerns of nepotism, saying his office had started the process to clear his brother's appointment with the ethics board.

He said a rise in anarchy and issues of white supremacy in the country required that his security operations be ""extremely unique"" as he plans to travel by subway and stay in the public eye.
""My brother knows me. My brother, I trust him. He's a 20-year veteran. He was an extremely successful community affairs police officer,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jayme White expressed Washington's ongoing concern about Canada's proposed digital services tax in talks on Wednesday with Canada's deputy trade minister, David Morrison, USTR said in a statement.
White spoke with Morrison ahead of the first meeting of trade deputies under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement enacted in 2020.
White also stressed the importance of Canada's fully meeting its USMCA commitments, including its allocation of dairy tariff-rate quotas and home-shopping, USTR said.
Washington said in December it would consider ""all options"" under its trade agreements and domestic statutes if Canada proceeds with its proposed tax on corporations providing digital services, but gave no details.
The United States in October withdrew its threat of tariffs against five European countries over their digital services taxes as part of a deal to manage the transition to a new global tax regime for large highly profitable corporations such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
But it remains at odds with Canada over the issue.
Canada unveiled the proposed measure in April, saying it would stay in place until major nations come up with a coordinated approach on taxing the big digital companies.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has since agreed on a common approach to ensure such companies pay their share of taxes, but a treaty to enforce this has yet to be implemented.
USTR said White and Morrison agreed to continue stay in touch on the various issues, including bilateral steel trade, but there was no sign of progress on the digital tax dispute.
The leaders of the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday urged chief trade negotiator Katherine Tai to press both Mexico and Canada to live up to their commitments under a new trade pact in areas ranging from potatoes to telecommunications.
Democratic Committee Chairman Ron Wyden and the top Republican on the panel, Mike Crapo, said it was preferable to resolve the disputes through negotiation, but USTR ""must be prepared to use the strong and innovative enforcement tools"" included in the UMSCA trade deal.
On the digital trade issue, the senators said efforts by Canada to proceed with a tax that would discriminate against U.S. firms would risk ""setting a troubling precedent that could undermine years of work by negotiators at the OECD.""

990,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 06:25PM ET</span>",Wall Street closes higher as inflation data supports Fed bets,"By Bansari Mayur Kamdar, Shreyashi Sanyal and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose on Wednesday after data showed that while U.S. inflation was at its highest in decades, it largely met economists' expectations, cooling some fears that the Federal Reserve would have to pull back support even more forcibly than already expected.
Ten out of the 11 major S&P sectors finished higher after the news with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq outperforming the Dow as growth stocks outperformed value. 
Data from the Labor Department showed the consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.5% last month after rising 0.8% in November, while in the 12 months through December, the CPI surged 7.0% to its highest year-on-year rise in nearly four decades.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a CPI gain of 0.4% for December and 7.0% on a year-on-year basis.
""Investors were bracing for even hotter in inflation than what we actually saw. As bad as the number is and as much inflationary pressure that's in the economy there was a little relief in that,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP)'s global market strategist in Troy, Michigan. 
""Today's inflation report validates the Fed trajectory and means they don't have to be any more aggressive than is already priced in.""
The central bank's plan for easing accommodation to fight inflation includes raising interest rates, which analysts expect to start as soon as March, as well as tapering its bond buying program and reducing its asset holdings. 
For most stock sectors it also helped that longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields dipped on Wednesday. In recent weeks, sharp gains in the U.S. 10-year yield had weighed on stocks, particularly in rate-sensitive growth sectors like technology. 
""The fact that bond market yields are standing down is probably a signal for equity investors to take on a little more risk today,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. 
But with the small cap Russell 2000 index underperforming to end down 0.82%, Ablin saw some caution. 
""Equity investors still want quality. It's not a free-for-all,"" Ablin said. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38.3 points, or 0.11%, to 36,290.32, the S&P 500 gained 13.28 points, or 0.28%, to 4,726.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 34.94 points, or 0.23%, to 15,188.39. 
The S&P's top sector gainers of the day were materials, up almost 1%, consumer discretionary, up 0.6% and technology which rose 0.4%.
Growth and technology stocks have been staging a comeback this week, with investors watching a variety of metrics to decide whether to buy the rally or brace for more declines. 
Also on the watchlist for this week is the unofficial kick-off of the fourth quarter earnings season with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) due to report their results on Friday.
The Dow's biggest drag for the day was Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which fell 3% and Morgan Stanley fell 2.7% on the day as their smaller rival Jefferies fell 9% after it missed quarterly earnings expectations. 
Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, like Jefferies depend heavily on their capital markets business. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman were also in the top five biggest drags on the S&P 500 on the day. However, the broader banking sector, which includes more traditional lenders, rose 0.3% on Wednesday.
In sectors like air travel, however, surging cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus could dampen earnings expectations, with analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reckoning that the pandemic's impact on corporate travel is the biggest risk to the airline industry.
The healthcare index, was weighed down by shares of drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), which closed down 2.4% and was the biggest single weight on the S&P, and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), which lost 6.7%. 
The U.S. government Medicare program said that while it plans to cover Biogen's Aduhelm Alzheimer treatment it will require patients to be enrolled in a clinical trial, limiting access to the medication. This could also impact Eli Lilly, which is developing similar drugs. 
The biggest boosts to the S&P on the day were Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) up 3.9% ahead of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which both rose more than 1%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 60 new highs and 137 new lows.

(Reuters) -The White House said on Wednesday it was encouraged by a U.S. judge's decision not to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""Certainly we are encouraged by the district court's decision"", White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. ""We've been clear and he (President Joe Biden) has been clear we need more competition in the tech industry.""
Facebook, now Meta Platforms, had asked Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., federal court to dismiss the lawsuit in which the government asked the court to demand that Facebook sell Instagram and WhatsApp. 
The judge said the FTC had a plausible case that should be allowed to proceed. It represents one of the biggest challenges the government has brought against Big Tech in decades.

Meta said that it was confident the company would prevail in court, adding that the judge's decision on Tuesday narrowed ""the scope of the FTC's case"".
The judge said the FTC could not press allegations that Facebook refused to allow interoperability permissions with competing apps as a way to maintain its dominance, saying those policies had been abandoned in 2018 and Facebook's most recent enforcement of the policy was even older.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 05:13PM ET</span>",Investors ready for U.S. earnings as inflation worries run high,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies will post results in the coming weeks on the final quarter of 2021 as investors worry about inflation's impact on earnings and pressure on the Federal Reserve to speed up the timeline for kicking off interest rate hikes.
The concerns, along with caution tied to the fast-spreading COVID-19 Omicron variant, have driven a recent market sell-off, led by Nasdaq and shares of technology and other big growth companies that have benefited from low interest rates.
Year-over-year profit growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to be lower in the fourth quarter than it was in first three quarters of 2021 but still strong at 22.4%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Huge profit gains earlier in 2021 were fueled by a rebound from the economic downturn in the early stages of the pandemic.
It's ""nearing the end of the very easy comparisons that we had relative to 2020,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Those easy comparisons will begin to wane as we move into 2022.""
Last year's strong market performance - with the S&P 500 gaining 26.9% for the year - was on the back of massive profit growth, so corporate outlooks for 2022 will be key this earnings period, Northey said. 
Earnings growth for all of 2021 is estimated at about 50% compared with 8.6% for 2022, while the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 was last at 21.7, compared with its long-term average of 15.5, according to Refinitiv DataStream.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is due to report Friday and will kick off the reporting period along with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
Heading into earnings season, bank shares have rallied with U.S. Treasury yields as focus has turned to rate hike expectations.
Analysts expect big U.S. banks to show an increase in fourth-quarter core revenues, thanks to new lending and rising Treasury yields.
Both the S&P 500 bank index and financial index hit record highs last week. Minutes released last week from the Fed's December meeting showed some policymakers want to tighten policy even faster. 
With inflation among their top worries, investors will also watch for signs supply chain bottlenecks may be easing. U.S. economic reports have offered some hope on that front. 
Last week's report on U.S. services industry activity included tentative signs the supply logjam in that sector is starting to break up.
Transportation snags at ports and other areas have led to bigger expenses for companies and higher costs for consumers.
Bottlenecks have hit retailers especially hard, and investors will watch for how they affected holiday sales. 
S&P 500 companies have been maintaining record profit margins, with many able to pass on higher expenses to customers, but that may not continue.
""We expect margins not to be a record this quarter"" but still high, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices in New York.
The stock market has seen investors rotating out of technology-heavy growth shares and into more value-oriented stocks that tend to do better in a higher interest-rate environment. Still, some investors say technology company results could be much better than Wall Street expects.
Results from big tech and other mega-cap companies start next week, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) due to report on Jan 20.
Recent results from some chip companies including Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) were upbeat, said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust in Atlanta, Georgia. 
""That gives me confidence we should get good reports out of the chips sector,"" he said. ""I'm optimistic.""
Energy, materials and industrials sectors are expected to post the biggest year-over-year earnings gains in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
Energy has been by far the strongest S&P 500 sector performer in early 2022, with the S&P 500 energy index up about 14% since Dec. 31, supported by tight supply, following a whopping 48% gain in 2021.

Results from oil majors ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) are due in a couple of weeks.
But all 11 of the S&P 500 sectors are slated to show profit growth for the fourth quarter of 2021, while revenue growth for the period is seen at 12.1%. That growth level would also be lower than in recent quarters, based on Refinitiv data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Wednesday while U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar fell, after the latest U.S. inflation data showed price pressures surging but within expectations, apparently suggesting the Federal Reserve will not have to hike interest rates too aggressively.
Oil prices hit two-month highs, lifted by tight supply and easing concerns over the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Data showed the U.S. consumer price index leaping a whopping 7% in the 12 months through December, the biggest annual increase since June 1982. But it was within forecasts, which appeared to reassure investors.
""Today's inflation report continued to reinforce the theme that gaudy price gains are not standing in the way of demand,"" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income and Head of the BlackRock Global Allocation Investment Team.
""We don't think the Fed will overreact to this condition,"" Rieder said, adding that he expected the Fed to raise rates in March.
The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 0.28%, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.23%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.11%. Gains were stronger for European and Asian shares.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.65%. Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 0.81% to one-year highs, lifted by mining and oil giants. (L)
Japan's Nikkei rose 1.9% overnight, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed up 1.95%.
Buoyant global equity markets lifted MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe up by 0.8%.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields edged down to 1.7481% after falling as far as 1.7269% -- more than seven basis points from an almost two-year high hit on Monday. [US/]
Fed fund futures are predicting nearly four rate hikes this year, a seismic change from a few months ago. Long-term rates have been relatively steady. 
U.S. interest rate pricing is peaking at 1.5% by the third quarter of 2024, far lower than previous U.S. rate tightening cycles.
""It seems to be a fait accompli that the Fed will hike interest rates quickly, even if inflation comes in a little below expectations,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a client note.
""In a worst-case scenario, lift-off will not be in March, but in May or June.""
The dollar hit a two-year low on the inflation report, with the dollar index falling 0.666% to 94.97 against a basket of six major currencies. A struggling dollar lifted the euro up 0.66% to a near two-month high of $1.14430, and boosted spot gold by 0.2% to $1,825.40 an ounce.
The prospect of rate hikes by the Bank of England also boosted sterling. The pound leapt 0.52% to $1.37045, its highest in more than two months against the dollar. 
In oil markets, U.S. crude jumped 1.92% to $82.78 per barrel and Brent was at $84.76, up 1.24%. [O/R]
""Omicron is yesterday's story now,"" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. ""The market isn't moving on Omicron but on earnings, Fed and economic data."" (Graphic: US CPI expected to hit 7%, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjpqknabypx/USCPI1201.PNG) 

Not all major central banks are tightening policy though. In China, a softer than expected reading on prices has drawn bets on policy easing.
Five-year Chinese government bond futures rose eight ticks to an 18-month high before trimming gains. Yuan gains were also capped. [CNY/]

995,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 05:06PM ET</span>",State Street calls for women on corporate boards worldwide,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) -Asset manager  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) will expect all portfolio companies worldwide to have at least one woman on their boards, executives said, expanding a policy previously focused on developed markets.
In a letter to directors released on Wednesday, Cyrus Taraporevala, CEO of State Street Global Advisors, said the new policy effective this year builds on previous actions to push boardroom diversity. These include its backing for the well-known ""Fearless Girl"" statue in Manhattan, installed 2017 ahead of International Women's Day.
Ben Colton, a stewardship leader for the division, said while many companies claim they cannot find qualified female director candidates, they actually just need to broaden their board nomination processes.
""We think it's not a pipeline issue, it's an access issue,"" Colton said in an interview.
State Street said it is prepared to cast proxy votes against board leaders where companies do not meet its diversity expectations.
Data from executive search firm Spencer Stuart shows women account for 28% of directors at U.S. companies and, at the high end, 45% at French companies. But the figure drops to 16% for Indian companies and 11% for companies in Japan, showing the challenge State Street faces with its new policy.
With $3.9 trillion under management State Street is among a select group of influential index fund firms emphasizing environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) matters. 

State Street's Taraporevala also said the company expects boards in most developed countries to have women represent at least 30% of their directors by next year, and said companies should take other steps on diversity including disclosing details about directors' racial or ethnic backgrounds.
Separately, State Street will expect companies in developed economies to offer details as outlined by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, as other top asset managers have done.

KB Home (NYSE:KBH) gained more than 3% in after-hours trading after ending the day 0.6% higher.
For the fourth quarter, EPS was $1.91, up from $1.12 a year ago, beating estimates of $1.77. Revenue rose 41.2% to $1.68 billion, but that was short of estimates of $1.71 billion.
Homes delivered rose 28% to 3,679 on higher average selling price of $451,100, up 9%.

Investing.com — Oppenheimer analyst Ian Zaffino initiated coverage on Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ) Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) with an outperform rating and a $31 price target Wednesday.
The analyst was quoted by StreetInsider as saying Hertz's ""bankruptcy is in the rearview mirror.""
Following the rating, Hertz shares have moved 2.22% higher in after-hours trading after closing Wednesday's session at $24.43. 
""With a meaningfully improved cost structure, an under-levered balance sheet and newfound competitive discipline, we believe Hertz is an interesting post-bankruptcy equity,"" said Zaffino.
The analyst cited three reasons for the rating. These include the potential to approximately double its pre-Covid earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margins, forward-looking management, and its $2 billion share buyback program.
""Management has been very forward-looking, and we point to recently signed agreements with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Carvana, and Uber (NYSE:UBER).""
""We believe our target can be achieved, as Hertz remains rational, enjoys its structurally higher margins, and repurchases stock and as demand returns,"" concluded the Oppenheimer analyst."

Investing.com -- Stocks rose on Wednesday after inflation data showing prices rose the most in 40 years last month failed to rattle investors.
For the most part, the inflation expectations are already reflected in the market. The Federal Reserve is unlikely to act any more aggressively than it has already signaled given the number for December, which largely met forecasts.
Inflation even slowed a bit from November, when South Africa scientists first told the world about the Omicron variant of Covid, which has since created a record-smashing surge of cases around the world, especially in the U.S.
Data from the Labor Department showed its consumer price index increased 0.5% last month after rising 0.8% in November.
""I don't see this disturbing the markets because higher inflation was expected,"" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, told Reuters.
Nasdaq rose 0.2% while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3% and 1%, respectively.
Earnings season officially kicks off on Thursday, with a bunch of big banks ready to report their results on Friday. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. TSMC earnings
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) will declare its fourth-quarter numbers Thursday. The chipmaker is expected to report a profit per share of $1.12 on revenue of $15.65 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Analysts will be listening for its comments on the outlook for the chip sector after a global shortage gummed up manufacturing last year.
2. Delta profits
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) is seen clocking a fourth-quarter revenue of $8.85 billion and a profit per share of 11 cents. Analysts will be listening to hear the company’s outlook for travel amid a surge in coronavirus cases that has put a damper on the reopening. Weather events also curtailed some flights in the last few weeks.
3. Producer inflation
Wholesale price inflation is expected to have risen by 0.4% in December on a month-on-month basis. It had risen 0.8% in November, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. The data comes out at 8:30 AM ET.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed higher Wednesday, as data showing inflation hitting the fastest pace in decades, which was largely expected, failed to spook investors.
S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, or 39 points, the Nasdaq added 0.2%.
The consumer price index rose 0.6% in December, just above expectations for a 0.5% increase, taking the year-on-year consumer prices through December to 7%, in-line with expectations and the fastest rate since 1982.
A deeper look into the report, however, showed sticker areas of price pressures, particularly from the services sector, rose by less than expected, stoking early hopes that inflation may cool in the months ahead.
“[C]ore services rose by just 0.3%, the slowest since September. Housing inflation did not accelerate as we expected, and price increases slowed in travel categories,” {0|{Jefferies said in a note}}.  
But even if price pressures ease in “three months, or six months from now that’s not going to move the dial in time for the Fed to start making changes to how they're thinking about tapering or rate hikes,” Johan Grahn, head of ETF Strategy at Allianz (DE:ALVG) told Investing.com in an interview on Wednesday.
Following the inflation report, Treasury yields continued to slip, with the 10-year backing further away from 1.8%, paving the way for an ongoing recovery in tech.
Big tech was mostly higher, led by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), though Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) was the exception, down about 0.3%.              
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, jumped about 4% a day after receiving a price upgrade from Morgan Stanley to $1,300 per share from $1,200.
A fall in health care kept a lid on gains in the broader market following a more than 7% slump in Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) after Medicare said it planned to only cover the company’s Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm, for patients enrolled in approved clinical trials.
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), meanwhile, slipped 2% after {{0|Jefferies downgraded the company to a hold from buy and cut its price target on the stock  to $200 From $255, citing a cautious fundamental backdrop in 2022.

In a research note, the analyst told investors that the company's investment in NFT Trader — announced Tuesday — offers upside potential.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles had said that Tesla’s “full self-driving,” or FSD, beta requires human intervention and therefore is not subject to its regulations on autonomous vehicles.
But the agency is ""revisiting that decision following recent software updates, videos showing a dangerous use of that technology, open investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the opinions of other experts,"" the department said in a letter on Friday to Lena Gonzalez, chair of the state Senate Transportation Committee.
The Los Angeles Times first reported the letter. 
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. 
The electric car company has been expanding the rollout of what it describes as the ""beta"" of its advanced driver assistant software, FSD, sparking safety concerns by effectively allowing untrained drivers to test how well the technology works on public roads. 
Critics say Tesla was able to avoid state regulatory oversight by telling the Department of Motor Vehicles that its FSD features do not make its cars autonomous. 
The department said it has notified Tesla that it ""will be initiating further review of the technology of their vehicles, including any expansion of the current programs or features.""
""If the capabilities of the features meet the definition of an autonomous vehicle according to California law and regulations, DMV will take steps to make certain that Tesla operates under the appropriate autonomous vehicle permits,"" the agency said in a statement. 
Under the regulation, Tesla would need to report crashes and traffic tickets specific to the FSD, said Phil Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania. 
This would also ""trigger a driver background check to ensure (a) good driving record,"" he said. 
Currently, regulations cover companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which are testing autonomous vehicle technology on public roads in California. 
The FSD allows vehicles to perform some driving tasks such as lane changes, but Tesla says the features ""require a fully attentive driver."" Still, Tesla markets the technology as ""full self-driving"" and charges up to $10,000 for the software. 

The DMV also said its review of Tesla’s use of the term “full self-driving” is continuing.
""The DMV shares the concern held by many other safety stakeholders about the potential for driver inattention, misunderstanding, or misuse as these systems become more prevalent,"" it said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A surge in options trading by individual investors helped lift market volumes to record highs in 2021, but it also made trading the derivatives more difficult for many institutional investors, according to a Coalition Greenwich study released on Wednesday. 
Options volumes soared to a record 9.87 billion contracts last year, a 32.2% increase over 2020, which was itself a record-setting year for volumes, Options Clearing Corp data showed.
The number of individual options account holders grew to the highest levels ever last year, and the amount of smaller trades, which are indicative of retail trades, increased to significant levels of market share, said Shane Swanson, senior market structure and technology analyst at Coalition Greenwich. 
""Whether driven by the meme stock phenomenon, zero-commission trading or simply by retail investors looking to get heightened exposure to the market, retail trading in options grew by leaps and bounds in 2021,"" said Swanson, who led the study.
But the increase in smaller trade sizes affected the ability of many investing firms to achieve their trading objectives, the study said.
Out of 24 investing firms interviewed by Coalition Greenwich between June and September, 13% said the growth of retail trading had a ""fair amount of negative impact"" on their trading, while another 42% said it had ""some negative impact."" 

That was because one of the main objectives of investment firms is to execute their trading deals with minimal market impact, and when a large amount of contra-side flow is in small and single lots, that makes executing larger institutional-sized orders more challenging, Swanson said. 
""The longer an order has to work, the more likely it is to have market impact,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - After  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) on Tuesday announced plans to sell its Mexican consumer banking business, analysts said homegrown billionaires such as Carlos Slim and Ricardo Salinas Pliego were among front-runners to buy the Citibanamex assets.
With the finance ministry saying it is watching the sale at Citibanamex, Mexico's No. 3 consumer bank, for signs of undue market concentration, the most established players in the country appear to be less favored in the carve-up.
Alejandra Marcos, an equity analyst at Intercam Banco, said Slim's Inbursa, now Mexico's seventh-largest bank, has the means to present a strong offer and would not face the same obstacles as peer Grupo Financiero Banorte from antitrust regulators due to the latter's market share.
""The only Mexican bank with the financial capacity for this is Inbursa, but of course other groups of entrepreneurs could join to make an attractive offer,"" Marcos said.
A spokesman for Slim did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Banorte did not respond to a request for comment.
Meanwhile tycoon Salinas, who controls the supermarket and banking chain Elektra that includes Banco Azteca, said on Tuesday evening he had asked his team to study the purchase of the Citigroup unit, which analysts said would likely carry a price tag between $4 billion and $8 billion.
Foreign banks from Canada's Scotiabank - now Mexico's No. 6 bank by assets - to Brazil's Itau Unibanco Holding SA may also be in the mix, analysts said.
""We would expect (Scotiabank) to at least kick the tires on (Citibanamex),"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Canadian financials analyst John Aiken. ""We do not know if Mexico is necessarily where it would like to deploy all of its excess capital.""
Financial sector sources said Mexico's left-leaning government was likely to want a buyer that did not increase the market power of the top banks in the country, such as Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), which currently has over a fifth of the market.
It also appeared probable that a Mexican successor to Citi would be preferred, opening up the possibility that a consortium of buyers could club together for the assets, they said.
The finance ministry pointed to its earlier comment.
Interior Minister Adan Augusto Lopez observed on Wednesday the bank's brand was ""one of the most important in the country"" and said he expected ""various business groups"" to signal an interest in launching an offer for Citibanamex.
Lopez said the government was not interested in the assets.
Citigroup's acquisition of Banamex for $12.5 billion in 2001 was the largest ever in Mexico at the time and was part of a wave of foreign purchases after an economic crisis devastated the bank sector in the mid-1990s.
Some analysts said the door could still be open to some of BBVA's nearest rivals, including Santander (MC:SAN) Mexico and Banorte, respectively Mexico's No. 2 and No. 4 players.
A banking source with knowledge of the matter said Santander was among potential bidders for Citibanamex. Santander declined to comment.
Banorte shares were up 3.4% while Santander Mexico shares fell 0.8% on Wednesday.
Brazil's Itau, which bought Citi's consumer operations in that country in 2016, could also be a bidder, said Eduardo Rosman of BTG Pactual Equities.
Itau declined to comment.

Brazil-based online lender Nubank could also be interested, Rosman added. Nubank has been stepping up efforts in Mexico recently and has a massive valuation, though the purchase would go against Nubank's strategy of building verticals from scratch, he said.
""For an international bank just looking to enter the (Mexican) market, they'd gain 10% of the market share just through the purchase. That's a great start. For a bank that's already established in Mexico, that may be hard to justify to regulators,"" said Carlos Alberto Gonzalez, director of analysis and stock market strategy at Monex.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 was marginally higher Wednesday, as data showing inflation hitting the fastest pace in decades, which was largely expected, failed to spook investors.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, or 44 points, the Nasdaq added 0.2%.
The consumer price index rose 0.5% in December, just above expectations for a 0.4% increase, taking the year-on-year consumer prices through December to 7%, in-line with expectations and the fastest rate since 1982.
A deeper look into the report, however, showed sticker areas of price pressures, particularly from the services sector, rose by less than expected, stoking early hopes that inflation may cool in the months ahead.
“[C]ore services rose by just 0.3%, the slowest since September. Housing inflation did not accelerate as we expected, and price increases slowed in travel categories,” Jefferies said in a note.  
But even if price pressures ease in “three months, or six months from now that’s not going to move the dial in time for the Fed to start making changes to how they're thinking about tapering or rate hikes,” Johan Grahn, head of ETF Strategy at Allianz (DE:ALVG) told Investing.com in an interview on Wednesday.
Following the inflation report, Treasury yields continued to slip, with the 10-year backing further away from 1.8%, paving the way for an ongoing recovery in tech.
Big tech was mostly higher, led by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), though Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) was the exception, down more than 1%.              
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, jumped 4% a day after receiving a price upgrade from Morgan Stanley to $1,300 per share from $1,200.
A fall in health care kept a lid on gains in the broader market following a more than 7% slump in Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) after Medicare said it planned to only cover the company’s Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm, for patients enrolled in approved clinical trials.
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), meanwhile, slipped 2% after {{0|Jefferies downgraded the company to a hold from buy and cut its price target on the stock  to $200 From $255, citing a cautious fundamental backdrop in 2022.
Energy was flat even as oil prices neared two-month highs following a larger-than-expected draw in weekly crude inventories. Energy prices will likely ""continue to surge- as demand from economic reopening and reflation collides with a cold snap and tight supply in the Northeast region,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. ""We remain bullish on crude oil prices- and expect targets toward the $85-90 range in 2022."""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Shares in Brazilian shopping mall operators soared on Wednesday as Multiplan reported figures above pre-pandemic levels for the fourth quarter of 2021 and a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) survey pointed to expectations of a solid recovery in the sector.
Multiplan said in its operational preview that quarterly same store rent jumped 41.4% from the same period of 2019, while same store sales rose 10.3%.
Sales were up 8.1% when compared with the last quarter of 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic struck in Brazil, supported by a strong performance during the holiday season.
""December was a major highlight, as sales reached 110.1% of the sales seen in the same period of 2019 ... In the fourth quarter, sales were above 2019 levels for the first time in the year, totaling 5.6 billion reais ($1.01 billion),"" Multiplan said.
Multiplan's figures were backed by a Bank of America survey showing a K-shaped recovery in the sector, with 92% of Brazilian consumers back at the malls, although visiting less often, it said.
BofA also noted that high-income consumers are spending more than before, while low-income individuals reduced spending on a tight budget.
The survey of 1,000 Brazilian consumers during Christmas suggested online shopping habits acquired during the pandemic might be sticky but not deterrent to mall visits, BofA said.
""Our findings support our expectations for a continued solid recovery in 4Q results. With a faster recovery in sales, malls focused on the high-end consumer are more likely to be able to charge higher rents (above pre-COVID) this year,"" it said.
Mall operators were among the biggest gainers on Brazil's stock index Bovespa on Wednesday.
Shares in Multiplan soared 6.7% to 18.10 reais in late afternoon, while rival Iguatemi jumped 7.8% and BR Malls rose 5.8%. The Bovespa was up 1.7%.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 03:05PM ET</span>",Biogen shares slide as Medicare proposal restricts coverage of Alzheimer's treatments,"By Ankur Banerjee and Amruta Khandekar
(Reuters) - The U.S. Medicare program's proposal to severely limit coverage of new Alzheimer's treatments including Biogen's Aduhelm threatens to hurt sales of the controversial drug and dim prospects for similar medicines in development by other companies.
In a draft decision on Tuesday, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), which runs the government health plan for people over age 65, said it would cover Aduhelm, and similar treatments, only for patients enrolled in approved clinical trials.
Shares of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) were down more than 7% at $223.77 in afternoon trading, while shares of drugmakers developing similar treatments such as Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd fell between 2% and 5%.
""It would appear that what is occurring is that cost is being put before the needs of Alzheimer's patients,"" Harry Johns, chief executive at the Alzheimer's Association patient advocacy group, told Reuters. 
He estimated that out of the one million or so Alzheimer's patients who might now be eligible for Aduhelm, a few thousand at best could be enrolled in future CMS-approved trials, which will take years to conduct. 
Aduhelm's high price has raised concerns over the toll it might take on the Medicare program since Alzheimer's is an age-related disease and around 85% of people who might use the drug are in the government plan.
Other health insurers have also questioned whether Aduhelm's benefits are worth the cost.
""We agree with CMS there is a need to obtain more clinical data on efficacy, which will be essential to ensuring these new medications deliver real value to patients before broadening access,"" Matt Eyles, president and CEO of trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, said.
Sales so far have been weak and Biogen last month cut the medication's list price by about half to $28,200 per year. 
Biogen had been banking on the government's coverage decision to help drive sales of Aduhelm, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June, despite a vote by the agency's outside advisers that the treatment's clinical benefits had not been proven. 
Only one of Biogen's two pivotal trials showed Aduhelm can slow the rate of cognitive decline for Alzheimer's patients. 
Medicare's draft decision essentially crushes any hopes of Aduhelm gaining traction any time soon, J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said. 
Analysts said the decision, if left in place, could result in negligible Aduhelm sales in 2022 and 2023. The treatment brought in sales of $300,000 in the third quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate of $10.8 million. 
""It is imperative to change this draft decision to be aligned with reimbursement for other therapies for progressive diseases, where patients have immediate and equal access to medicines approved by the FDA,"" Biogen said in a statement.
Aduhelm, given as a monthly infusion, is a monoclonal antibody designed to remove a type of brain plaque associated with Alzheimer's Disease. Patients need to be monitored for potential side effects including brain swelling.
The agency's final coverage terms, due by April 12, are expected to apply to all drugs in the class.

Eli Lilly is conducting a head-to-head study comparing its experimental drug donanemab to Aduhelm and suggested it would not face similar restrictions if it demonstrates clear benefit.
""We expect that for drugs with established efficacy CMS will ensure access for all appropriate patients without creating further health inequities,"" Lilly said in an emailed statement.

The once-a-day online word game, originally created in October by former Reddit software engineer Josh Wardle, can only be played on his website and does not have a mobile app. 
However, several developers have created identical app versions to cash in on surging demand for the game, with unsuspecting users driving up downloads of the clone apps. 
As of Wednesday, the only remaining product on the App Store with that title was Wordle!, a time-based game created by Steven Cravotta more than four years ago. 
Josh Wardle's game has flooded Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) timelines in recent weeks as players posted their scores. It gives a player six chances to guess the day's secret word, which has five letters, and the aim is to figure out the secret word with the fewest guesses. 

The game is a free-to-use, ad-less experience on a simple website that does not have to be downloaded from Apple's App Store or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s PlayStore.

PARIS (Reuters) - Tereos, the French sugar and ethanol group, has sealed an agreement with grain cooperative Axereal to sell its stake in their malt business and is consulting unions on a plan to close its sugar activities in Romania, it said in a document to investors.
Tereos, the world's second largest sugar producer by volume, has undertaken a wide ranging review of its businesses after a top management reshuffle in late 2020. The new team, which had expressed concern about the group's high debts, made deleveraging one of its top priorities. 
In September, Tereos announced it was to sell its minority stake in two starch joint ventures in China as part of the reorganisation.
In the document, published as part of a bond launch this week, Tereos said it had sealed a deal with Axereal, France's leading grain collector, to exit their partnership started in 2014, when Tereos' current Chief Executive Philippe de Raynal was leading Axereal.
Tereos will sell its 11.7% stake in Copagest, the holding of Axereal's malt business Boortmalt, and buy Axereal’s 2.8% stake in Tereos Agro-Industries, it said.
Tereos Agro-Industries is the holding for the starch and sweeteners operations and part of its international sugar business, a spokesperson said. She declined to give financial details of the agreement.
Tereos estimated that its stake in Copagest was worth 62.2 million euros ($71.08 million) as of March 31, the end of its 2020/21 fiscal year. Boortmalt became the world's largest malt producer after it purchased Cargill's malt business in 2019.
""Following this transaction, we will have terminated our partnership with Axereal and fully exited the malt business,"" Tereos said in the document.
In addition, Tereos said it was ""in the process of consulting employees' representative bodies with a view to present the project of a potential shutdown of its Romanian sugar activities in the context of a pessimistic outlook.""
""Since its acquisition by Tereos, the Ludus sugar plant in Romania has been facing difficulties mainly due to constant reduction in sugar beet surfaces despite several mitigating actions and has accumulated substantial losses,"" Tereos said.
Reuters reported in June last year that the cooperative group was seeking to exit its loss-making Romanian sugar activities.
The Romanian business had 153 permanent employees at the end of September, out of a total 15,000 for the whole group.
Tereos has said it aims to focus on its activities in Europe and Brazil. It is the second largest sugar and ethanol producer in Brazil and also has operations in Reunion Island, Mozambique, Indonesia, Tanzania and Kenya. 
It could sell other operations and exit partnerships deemed non-strategic in the future, it said in the document.
DEBT CONTINUES TO RISE
Tereos on Monday announced plans for a 300 million euro ($340 million) issue of senior unsecured notes due in 2027, which it said it would use to repay existing debt. The investor roadshow was due to last through Wednesday.
The group eventually raised 350 million euros with a yield set at 4.75%, IFR said later on Wednesday. 
Tereos' net debt stood at 2.63 billion as of Nov. 30 last year, up 263 million euros, or 11.1%, on Sept. 30, but earnings were strong, it said in the document. 
For the two-months ended Nov. 30, 2021, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) stood at 173.0 million euros, up 59% on the two-month period ended Nov. 30, 2020. It is the highest adjusted EBITDA for a two-month period since March 2017, it said.
In the eight months to Nov. 30, adjusted EBITDA stood at 373.4 million euros, up from 346.2 million euros on a year earlier.
It confirmed its objective to reach a full-year EBITDA of between 600 and 700 million euros by the end of September 2022.

The group is due to publish its third quarter results up to the end of December early February.

The subject will be discussed at a supervisory council meeting at the end of February but a decision will not be made until later, the source said, declining to be named.
German newspaper F.A.Z. reported on Wednesday that Volkswagen's supervisory board would decide at the end of February whether both Audi and luxury brand Porsche would join F1.
Volkswagen declined to comment. A spokesperson for Porsche said the decision was still being evaluated and no further comment could be made.

Sources told Reuters at the end of last year that the deciding factor for Volkswagen on whether or not to enter F1 was whether it follows through on its plans to switch to synthetic fuels by 2026.
Media reports at the time claimed that Audi had bought British luxury sportscar maker McLaren, which both companies denied. Sources told Reuters at the time that a possible partnership was on the table, but not yet decided.

By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has appointed heads of its new investment banking advisory in Britain and France, the bank said on Tuesday, a business the lender is aiming to boost as part of a wider restructuring announced in November.
Oliver Tucker will be joining the bank as head of its Investment Banking Advisory in Britain from Thursday, a spokesperson told Reuters, while Philippe Guez took up the equivalent role in France earlier in January. 
Switzerland's second-largest lender announced a restructuring in November which involved paring back its investment bank and all but shuttering its prime brokerage business - a part of the division blamed for racking up $5.5 billion in losses when a client defaulted in March.
As part of the overhaul, the group said it would focus more resources within the investment bank on advisory services for entrepreneurs and the ultra-wealthy clientele of its flagship wealth management business.
The investment banking advisory (IBA) business was launched in summer 2020 to boost such services, with a focus on advising and executing smaller deals than those typically handled by an investment bank.
Tucker and Guez will report to IBA European co-heads Stefan Gratzer and Vincenzo De Falco.

Tucker will join Credit Suisse from Nomura, where he served as a managing director in the UK investment banking team, the bank said, while Guez joined from Atlas Financial (OTC:AFHIF) Solutions, where he served as a partner for independent M&A advisory.

SYDNEY/HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will raise its annual bonus for top-performing staff on Thursday by more than 20%, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, with a dealmaking boom to usher in bumper payouts by banks this year.
Bankers in equity underwriting and M&A advisory businesses are expected to receive some of the highest increases at the Wall Street firm due to the strong performances of those divisions over the past year, said two of the sources.
Investment banks globally adjust their bonus pools according to business momentum. Higher bonuses help them to retain talent in a cutthroat competitive business environment. 
Staff at Morgan Stanley will be informed of their bonus payouts on Thursday, kicking off the busy and much-awaited annual bonus season, and then receive the cash in early February, the two sources said.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
The sources could not be named as the information was not yet made public.
Staff within M&A and equity capital market (ECM) divisions are anticipating bonuses up at least 15% on the previous year and, in some cases, up 20% or more, two separate sources within those businesses said.
Other businesses whose performance was less stellar will likely see flat or single-digit increases in their bonus pool, said one of the sources.
Top performers in M&A advisory and equities divisions will reap the rewards when the bank holds its ""communications day"" on Thursday, where staff are informed about 2021 bonuses and promotions, the first two sources said.
The bonus payouts at Morgan Stanley are, however, likely to be lower than those at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), which, according to a Bloomberg News report last week, is planning to increase the bonus pool for investment bankers by more than 40%.
Sales and trading operations at Bank of America could see a rise of more than 30% in bonuses on average, according to the report.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), another beneficiary of the record wave of M&A activity and initial public offerings, will inform staff of their 2021 bonuses next Wednesday, according to sources familiar with the matter.
LEAGUE TABLES
Morgan Stanley's equity underwriting business has been one of its brightest spots over the past year. 
Revenue at the division has surged on the back of bumper stock market listings and due to companies taking advantage of heightened market liquidity by issuing new shares.
Morgan Stanley ranks third in the global investment banking league table for fees, having earned $9.1 billion, up 28% in 2021 compared with the prior year, according to Refinitiv data.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs topped the table, the data showed.
M&A advisory revenue has benefitted from global merger and acquisitions activity shattering all-time records during 2021. 

Morgan Stanley topped Asia Pacific's M&A league table for announced deals and was No.3 globally, Refinitiv data showed.
In Asia Pacific, including Japan, the bank was third in the ECM league table, behind CITIC and Goldman, according to the data.

(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP has nominated four directors, including its own chief executive, to  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN) Corp's board, arguing that new members would help maximize the chemical maker's potential.
According to a letter sent by Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith on Wednesday, the fund, one of Huntsman's largest investors with a more than 5% stake, has nominated two women and two men with experience on public company boards and in the chemical and refining industry to the 14-member board.
""We believe shareholders deserve a board that is unburdened by past loyalties, welcomes fresh viewpoints, and demands accountability so that the company can maximize its incredible potential,"" Smith, who is one of the nominees, wrote to board chairman and CEO Peter Huntsman.
Its move comes only days after Huntsman added two new board members, appointed Cynthia Egan as its new lead independent director, and named Sonia Dula to the compensation committee with an eye to having her become chair, steps Starboard criticized.
Starboard said it is concerned that the new faces are ""perpetuating old shareholder-unfriendly tendencies"".
""Rather than engage constructively with us, the board inexplicably chose to react in a highly defensive manner, taking three distinct actions over the past two weeks that we believe were intended to disenfranchise shareholders,"" Smith wrote in the letter posted to the fund's website.
Huntsman's stock price climbed 2.3% in early trading after Starboard made its announcement. The company will report fourth-quarter earnings next month.
""The Huntsman board... is fully engaged in the active oversight of Huntsman’s continuing portfolio transformation, and the company is delivering the strongest profit and margin performance for the current businesses,"" a Huntsman spokesperson said. 
""We value the views of all shareholders, including Starboard, and maintain an open dialogue with them.""
Huntsman, which is valued at $7.8 billion, is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, and makes chemical products for use in products ranging from construction materials to plastics.

Starboard has criticized the company's stock price performance, blaming management and the board for poor returns that it says have left long-term shareholders ""significantly worse off"" than if they had invested in broader indices.
The fund is one of the industry's busiest activists and won six board seats in listed companies in the first three quarters of 2021, according industry data.

Investing.com –  Crocs  stock (NASDAQ:CROX) rose 4.6% Wednesday as Piper Sandler named the company as its top idea for 2022, raising the target to $246.
The new target is 88% higher than the stock’s current level of $131 and over 14% more than the brokerage’s previous target of $215.
According to analyst Erinn Murphy, the company will be one of the most impressive consumer growth stories for several years to come. The brokerage met the footwear-maker’s management and said its tone was bullish on both the trajectory of Crocs and the significant opportunity of Heydude, a privately-owned company it agreed to acquire last month.
Upon completion of the transaction, which is expected to happen by March, the casual footwear brand will operate as a standalone division of Crocs.
Murphy said the company didn’t see notable impacts from Omicron during the holidays and saw strong full-price selling and healthy traffic. Europe, Middle East and Africa also performed much better than expectations, the company told the brokerage, according to the report.
Crocs shares more than doubled last year, a reflection of its comeback from a near bankruptcy a few years ago. The company expects to hit $5 billion in revenue by 2026. According to Bloomberg, analysts project current-year sales to be $2.27 billion.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 11:15AM ET</span>",Investor group warns EU against labelling gas investments as green,"By Kate Abnett and Simon Jessop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -A coalition of investors managing 50 trillion euros ($56.81 trillion) has warned the European Union not to label natural gas investments as sustainable, saying Brussels' draft plan to do so would weaken its global leadership on green finance.
The European Commission drafted a plan late last year to label some gas and nuclear investments as green in the EU's ""taxonomy,"" a long-awaited rule book to define which investments can be labelled as climate-friendly in Europe.
The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), whose 370 members include most of the world's biggest asset managers such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard, on Wednesday said doing so would undermine the EU's attempts to lead international efforts to set credible, science-based standards for green investments.
""We remain strongly opposed to any inclusion of gas within the scope of the Taxonomy,"" IIGCC Chief Executive Stephanie Pfeifer said in an open letter to European Union member states and the bloc's policymakers.
""It is our view that the proposals... would seriously compromise Europe’s status as a global leader in sustainable finance, potentially triggering a 'race to the bottom' which could dilute the level of climate ambition within emerging jurisdictional taxonomies.""
Natural gas emits roughly half the CO2 emissions of coal when burned in power plants, and some EU states see it as key to curbing their reliance on coal. But gas infrastructure is also associated with leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas.
EU countries' debate over gas has intensified in recent months, as gas prices soared to record highs and amid tensions with Russia, the EU's biggest gas supplier. 
Experts had advised the Commission not to label gas plants as green investments unless they met a 100g CO2e/kWh emissions limit. The Commission's initial proposal for the rules had included that limit, but it faced opposition from countries including Poland and Hungary. 
The latest draft proposal, seen by Reuters, would set conditions including a 270g CO2e/kwh limit for gas plants until 2030.
IIGCC said that would allow energy companies to use the taxonomy's green label despite not being on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050 - the target scientists say the world must reach to avoid disastrous climate change. 
""This in turn hinders the capacity of our members to align their portfolios with net zero, undermining the whole purpose of the Taxonomy,"" it said.
The letter cited the International Energy Agency's calculation that to reach net zero emissions by 2050 globally, natural gas demand must drop 8% below 2019 levels by 2030.
A Commission official said it had taken scientific advice into consideration with feedback from member states and that, ultimately, what mattered was that the bloc hit its climate goals.

""The inclusion of nuclear or natural gas comes with clear and tight conditions associated with its use in line with our climate targets and with safeguards against significant environmental harm,"" the official said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Sainsbury's raised its full-year profit forecast by at least 9% after grocery sales over the Christmas quarter beat its expectations, even though they fell short of its stellar 2020 festive performance.
Sainsbury's said on Wednesday the upgrade reflected cost savings and stronger-than-expected grocery volumes, driven in part by increased in-home food consumption, which offset investment spending and higher operating cost inflation.
The group's Argos general merchandise business also continued to benefit from stronger margins supported by cost savings, while profit expectations in Sainsbury's financial services business exceeded analysts' consensus with bad debts lower than expected and lending volumes starting to recover.
UK supermarkets faced tough comparisons against Christmas 2020 when a lockdown meant food and drink sales boomed.
While restrictions for Christmas 2021 were less severe, supermarkets still benefited from consumer nervousness over the spread of the Omicron variant which kept them away from bars and restaurants. 
Sainsbury's, Britain's No. 2 supermarket group, is now forecasting a full-year 2021-22 underlying profit before tax of ""at least"" 720 million pounds ($981.5 million) compared with previous guidance of ""at least"" 660 million pounds and 356 million pounds made in 2020-21.
Sainsbury's shares were up 1.6% at 1000 GMT, extending year-on-year gains to 21% that have been partly buoyed by bid speculation.
Shares in market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) were up 0.3% on hopes it will also upgrade its profit outlook when it updates on Thursday. 
Sainsbury's said like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, fell 4.5% year-on-year in its third quarter to Jan. 8, having fallen 1.4% in the second quarter.
While grocery sales fell 1.1% in the third quarter year-on-year they were up 6.6% against the same period in 2019-20, before the pandemic impacted trading.
""I am really pleased with how we delivered for customers this Christmas. More people ate at home and our significant investment in value, innovation and service led to market share growth,"" said CEO Simon Roberts.
Sainsbury's said general merchandise sales fell 16% year-on-year, reflecting a strong performance last year, limited availability in key product areas and a focus on profitable sales. Clothing sales fell 2.7%.
Roberts said that with Britain facing a cost of living squeeze this year, Sainsbury's was focused on providing the best value it could.

""Delivering great value for customers is at the heart of our strategy and we've sharpened our price positioning against our key competitors,"" he said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian consumers could see another round of stiff rises in food prices this year as meatpackers grapple with higher costs due to a drought hurting the crops used to feed livestock.
Meat industry group ABPA says there is no relief in sight before Brazil starts harvesting its mid-year corn crop. 
""We see the need for companies to continue to pass on costs,"" Ricardo Santin, the head of ABPA, said in an interview.
Given a weaker outlook for the domestic harvest, companies such as BRF SA (NYSE:BRFS) and  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) may have to import cereal, as they did in 2021, he said.
Private analysts are slashing their crop forecasts due to hot, dry weather in Brazil's southern states, while state crop agency Conab has been conservative, trimming its outlook but projecting a larger soy and corn crop than last year.
Meat prices in Brazil rose 8.45% in 2021, according to government statistics agency IBGE, contributing to overall food inflation of 7.94% and fuelling a 10.06% rise in the benchmark consumer price index, the highest for a calendar year since 2015. 
Marcos Zordan, an executive at meat processor Aurora, said a rise of more than 10% in Brazilian corn prices at the start of the year is startling buyers. If that keeps up, companies such as Aurora may resort to importing corn from Argentina or Paraguay, where the La Nina weather pattern has also hurt crop forecasts. ""I don't believe there will be a shortage, but it will be an expensive product, no doubt,"" Zordan said. In the last two weeks, the price of domestic corn jumped to 94 reais per 60-kg bag, compared to 84 reais previously, on news of the drought hammering southern Brazil, Zordan noted.
Cesar Alves, analyst with Itaú BBA Agribusiness, said meatpackers were initially expected to save on input costs as planting of Brazil's summer crops fell within the ideal climate window in key states.

Now, the first corn crop will be smaller than anticipated, by around four million tonnes, according to government estimates.
""Corn is on the rise again,"" Alves said. ""At least in the first quarter of the year, it will be much tighter for the meat industry.""

The subpoena is about the production of documents and information relating to allegations made by Blue Orca Capital. 
Blue Orca is an investment firm focused on short selling.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers nervous about the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant may have kept away from bars and restaurants this Christmas, but they made up for it at home, splashing out on champagne, upmarket food and sportswear.
Following a difficult 2020 that ended with restrictions being tightened again, Britons spent big in December 2021, with supermarkets and retailers of clothing and homewares reporting better than expected results so far.
""Customers really wanted to trade-up this year,"" Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts told reporters on Wednesday, after Britain's second largest supermarket group upgraded its full-year profit outlook.
The chain saw its highest ever sales of champagne and sparkling wines, while sales of its ""Taste the Difference"" premium range of food and drink were up 13% over Christmas on a two-year basis.
Roberts' comments chimed with those of the British arms of German discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Aldi said on Monday its premium ""Specially Selected"" range notched up its highest ever sales in December, while it sold over 5.5 million bottles of champagne, sparkling wine and prosecco.
On Tuesday, Lidl reported sparkling wine sales in December up 24% year-on-year.
Market researcher Kantar estimated that across the sector, some 627 million pounds ($855 million) was spent on supermarkets' own upmarket ranges in the four weeks to Dec. 26, up 6.8% on 2020.
AVAILABILITY
Sainsbury's Roberts said the group had ""planned big."" 
""So on the key Christmas lines we bought volume substantially to reflect the fact that we thought customers would want to celebrate Christmas in a big way,"" he said, noting that groceries availability in the week before Christmas was ""where we wanted it to be"" despite supply chain challenges.
Sainsbury's general merchandise business, which includes the Argos chain, was hit by limited availability of technology, gaming and toys, which dented sales. However, a focus on more profitable sales boosted its profit margins. 
That theme echoed comments from fashion retailer Next last week.
Next said its stock levels in the run up to Christmas were much lower than planned. But the strength of underlying consumer demand still enabled the group to beat its expectations and upgrade its annual profit forecast.
Similarly on Wednesday, sportswear retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion raised its profit outlook following strong Christmas sales, despite supply chain disruption for some of its key brand suppliers.
Homewares and furniture retailer Dunelm reported record sales, helped by shoppers buying festive items when in store, something they do not tend to do online.
Despite the upbeat mood there are still worrying signs on the horizon. 
UK consumers are facing a cost of living crisis due to fast-rising inflation, surging energy bills and tax increases which could upset discretionary spending.

Kantar noted that December sales of indigestion remedies rose by 8%.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 10:56AM ET</span>",Ryanair and Lufthansa clash over EU's airport slot rules,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Two of Europe's largest airlines have revived a spat over the environmental impact of Europe's take-off slot rules, with Ryanair accusing Germany's Lufthansa of exploiting climate concerns to stifle competition.
The easing of the ""use-it-or-lose-it"" rule has allowed major carriers to preserve airport access during the coronavirus crisis despite a sharp drop in traffic, sparking protests from low-cost rivals keen to expand into once-congested airports.
Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told a newspaper last month that the airline still had to operate tens of thousands of additional flights in the winter to comply with European Union rules on slot usage, resulting in surplus emissions.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget carrier, hit back at the claims on Wednesday, saying Lufthansa was trying to hamper rivals in the months-old dispute over so-called ghost flights.
""Instead of operating empty flights just so they can block slots, Lufthansa should release the seats on these flights for sale at low fares to reward the German and European taxpayers who have subsidized it with billions of euros during the COVID crisis,"" Ryanair Group CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
A spokesperson for Lufthansa said the German airline had never spoken about ghost flights. Spohr told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung in December that the airline would have cut even more flights if it had not been for EU measures.
""What we are talking about is harmonisation of European exemptions for the use of take-off and landing rights in the current winter flight plans,"" the spokesperson said.

Under EU airport rules, airlines must use at least 80% of their take-off and landing slots in order to keep them the following year. The EU suspended these rules at the start of the COVID-19 crisis but has started partially restoring them, rekindling concerns over empty flights as the pandemic lingers.
Lufthansa has criticised budget carriers like Ireland's Ryanair in the past for selling seats at unreasonably low prices, artificially driving up demand and emissions. Ryanair has in turn challenged legacy carriers to be more competitive.

Philips recalled upto 4 million of its breathing-aid machines last year amid concerns that a type of foam used in the devices could degrade and become toxic. It has now raised that estimate by 1 million and hiked its provision for the recall by 45% to 725 million euros.
""The extended recall is a major negative as this also extends the litigation risk"", ING analyst Marc Hesselink said.
The current provision does not cover the possible costs of litigation, with Philips facing more than a hundred class action suits. Fears of a large claims bill had already lopped around 15 billion euros off Philips' market value in the past nine months.
In addition to the expanded recall, Philips also cut its estimate for adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) by almost 40% in the fourth quarter to about 650 million euros ($739 million), as it continued to scramble for memory chips and other parts.
The double whammy of bad news saw it lose over 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion) of its market value, its worst day on the stock market since 1998, when it was still a sprawling conglomerate selling lightbulbs, televisions and CD-players.
Now specializing in medical equipment and other health products, Philips initially benefited from a jump in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic but a global shortage of semiconductors and other electronic components has left it exposed.
Chief Executive Frans van Houten said those shortages had put a serious brake on sales in recent months.
""We had shortages of several components and saw port congestion, sometimes up to 2 or 3 weeks. All of this meant our manufactured goods couldn't reach customers in time"", he said.

Comparable sales fell 10% on a yearly basis to 4.9 billion euros, Philips said, as hospitals had to postpone the installation of equipment due to a lack of parts.

Investing.com – DoorDash stock (NYSE:DASH) traded 2.7% higher Wednesday after Evercore upgraded it to outperform with a price target of $256, a climb of more than 74% from its current level of $147.
The brokerage cited strong growth drivers and robust fundamentals at the company for its optimism. According to analyst Mark Mahaney, DoorDash is a proven structural Covid winner, having grown third-quarter revenue 45% year-on-year.
DoorDash’s platform is beginning to expand dramatically with non-food delivery, white label logistics and international expansion, the analyst wrote in a note.
The analyst said the brokerage is reasonably confident that there’s an upside to the company’s fourth-quarter 2021 and first-quarter 2022 street estimates.
In a 7-billion-euro deal (around $8 billion) announced Nov. 9, DoorDash said it will buy Wolt, a Finnish technology company that makes it easy to discover and get items from local restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to homes and offices. Wolt is present in 23 countries.
Over the last six months or so, DoorDash has partnered with companies such as Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) to deliver to customers their choice of products from these places.

LONDON (Reuters) - Corporate leaders are prepared to pay lip service to integrity standards, overlook internal vetting processes and rationalise unethical behaviour in a battle for survival as the COVID-19 pandemic enters its third year, a global EY report says.
In a warning to corporate legal and compliance departments, EY said 18% of board members told the survey they would mislead auditors or regulators to improve their pay or bonuses, up from 14% in a 2020 report. 
In addition, 17% would ignore unethical behaviour by third parties and 15% would falsify financial records.
More than half of those quizzed for the EY 2022 Global Integrity Report said they believed standards of integrity had either stayed the same or fallen over the last 18 months. 
Just over two in five said the pandemic had made it harder to do business with integrity. Authorities have long warned that the turmoil caused by COVID-19 could lead to major fraud or corruption.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has had a serious impact on integrity standards for companies around the world,"" said Andrew Gordon, EY Global Forensic & Integrity Services Leader, adding remote working had raised the risk of fraud and unethical behaviour.
""Hybrid working makes it difficult to undertake effective compliance monitoring, and fraud risk factors typically increase at a time of crisis,"" he said.
Some 42% of surveyed board members said unethical behaviour in senior or high performers was tolerated in their organisation.

Global market research agency Ipsos MORI interviewed 4,762 board members, managers and employees in some of the largest organisations and public bodies across 54 countries between June and September 2021.

1042,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 09:46AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Higher as CPI Fails to Shock; Dow up 90 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday, shrugging off a slightly higher-than-expected print for inflation in December that cemented expectations for repeated interest rate hikes in the coming 12 months. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 90 points, or 0.3%, at 36,342 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%, on course for a third straight day of gains.
At the same time, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields moderated by 2 basis points to 1.72%. They had been as high as 1.80% earlier in the week, in response to new forecasts from private economists that envisaged four rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this year. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony at the confirmation hearing for his second term on Tuesday produced no major surprises, allowing market participants to feel that the new forecasts were sufficiently priced in. 
Earlier, the Bureau of Economic Analysis had confirmed expectations that annual inflation hit a 40-year high in December, against a backdrop of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and strong household balance sheets that are allowing consumers to sustain the pace of their spending despite the end of many pandemic-related fiscal supports last year. The report was strong all across the board, with both headline and core consumer prices rising a touch more than expected from November, up 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. The annual headline rate rose to 7.0%, a level it hasn't seen since the last oil shock in 1982.
""We could be close to the peak but the risk is that inflation stays higher for longer and we could see a more aggressive response from the Fed,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist with ING Group (NYSE:ING), in a note to clients.
However, such thoughts didn't hold back tech stocks, which have come under pressure in recent days and weeks due to their sensitivity to long-term interest rates. Chipmakers and software companies advanced broadly, while electric vehicle makers - a sector whose current struggle for profitability makes them particularly vulnerable to cost-of-capital concerns - also rose. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 1.8%, while Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) stock rose 2.8% and  Rivian Automotive  (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock rose 4.0%.
Financials were also well bid as fourth-quarter earnings season appeared over the horizon, at a time when rising interest rates are rapidly improving the profit outlook for banks' core lending businesses. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 0.6% while PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) stock, which is already up 12% this year, rose another 0.6% to a new record high.
On the downside, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock tumbled 9.5% to its lowest since September 2019 after regulators decided that Medicare shouldn't cover the costs of its Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm, except in the small number of people who are enrolled in clinical trials to monitor its effects. The decision greatly restricts the drug's revenue-generating potential and ensures the controversy over its authorization last June by the Food and Drug Administration will continue to cast a shadow over it. 
Elsewhere,  DISH Network  (NASDAQ:DISH) stock rose 4.3% on reports that it has renewed merger talks with DirecTV, while miner Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX) stock rose 4.7% to its highest since May as copper prices continued to surge. That rally is being underpinned by hopes of monetary policy easing in China, where figures released overnight showed inflation on a downward path.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 09:31AM ET</span>",Analysis-Rise in real bond yields may slow but not stop stock market bulls,"By Sujata Rao and Danilo Masoni
LONDON (Reuters) - This month's sudden spike in inflation-adjusted bond yields has jolted TINA, the thesis that ""there is no alternative"" to stocks, yet if history is any guide, equities should withstand this rise in real interest rates or even flourish. 
With inflation-adjusted U.S. 10-year bond yields below minus 1%, many investors have viewed equities as the only mainstream asset capable of providing strong returns.
TINA is believed to be the driver behind the almost $1 trillion inflow into global equity funds last year, a figure that according to BofA data surpassed the combined inflows of the preceding two decades.
Now though, with U.S. inflation peaking around 7% and the Federal Reserve likely to raise interest rates 3-4 times this year, real yields - the nominal interest rate a bond pays minus the rate of inflation - are on the move. 
Stocks tumbled after a spike in U.S. yields. The impact was especially severe on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index where stocks trade on the premise of bumper future earnings growth, making them particularly vulnerable to higher interest rates.
The Nasdaq is set for its second worst start to a year since the 2008 crisis, coinciding with a 40 basis point jump in ten-year inflation adjusted yields since Dec. 30.
But banks including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are still advising clients to buy the dip, arguing that real yields remain deeply negative around -0.8%, higher interest rates are already priced in and company earnings are in robust shape.
Above all, equities have performed well during many previous episodes of rising real yields, provided economic growth held up. Bernstein notes for instance that during five past real rate ""normalisation"" cycles in 1975, 1980, 2012-2013, 2016 and 2020-2021, global stocks returned between 2.3% and 51.8%.
""Historically when real yields have normalised back towards zero from negative levels, equities have had positive returns,"" Bernstein strategists Sarah McCarthy and Mark Diver told clients.
Separately, data from Truist Advisory Services shows the S&P 500 enjoyed positive returns in 11 of 12 real rate rise cycles since the 1950s.
Real yields moreover should move higher at a more gradual pace and won't hurt markets or economic activity until they actually turn positive, JPMorgan said, predicting year-end levels around -0.25%.
In the meantime, the trend should spur further sector switching - higher real yields tend to be bad news for tech shares but financials, commodities and cyclical shares such as travel usually benefit, JPMorgan wrote.

JAM TOMORROW
Behind the tech selloff is a premise that higher interest rates will cut into lofty share valuations. As a general rule of thumb, a sustained 100 bps rise in the U.S. TIPS yield causes a 20% drop in the price/earnings multiple, Pictet chief strategist Luca Paolini said.
Ultra-low rates have boosted equity valuations globally but those of tech stocks, often viewed as ""long-duration"" assets negatively correlated to rising bond yields, have ballooned to what some consider bubble territory.
Investing in tech firms, some of which have little or no profit, is therefore a bet on their future earnings potential. When rates rise, the present value of the investment diminishes on fund managers' spreadsheets.
The Nasdaq 100 currently trades at 27.8 times its 12-month forward earnings - a 54% premium over the MSCI All Country World Index, according to Refinitiv Datastream, and almost twice the 10-year average.
Grace Peters, EMEA head of investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, expects the S&P 500 - also tech heavy and currently trading at 21.1 times forward earnings - to end the year with an average P/E ratio a full percentage point lower. 
""With expectations that real yields will move up, must come an expectation that equity valuations move down. Multiple compressions will be particularly harsh for the kinds of stocks that are seen as 'jam tomorrow', she said referring to companies that trade off expectations of future profits.
Tangible profits and cash flow rather than future growth would command higher premia as the Fed's rate lift-off approaches, she added.

RETAIL AND TECH
The other unknown is how retail investors, a major new force in stock trading, will behave as yields rise, and tech turns volatile.
Having become accustomed to buying into stock market dips in the belief that monetary stimulus would staunch selloffs, the retail crowd may find such strategies less rewarding as the Fed prepares the decks for its first rate rise in three years.

Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager and strategist at Anthilia is expecting stock markets to gradually lose momentum - ""bounces will get more troubled and the declines more aggressive"".
""Retail is currently suffering from fatigue and it doesn't have the firepower it used to have,"" he added.

(Reuters) - Online trading platform  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) said on Wednesday it plans to move a majority of its 3,400 employees to remote work permanently, joining a slew of top tech firms embracing a hybrid culture.
The California-based company's move to adopt a 'remote first' approach, the plans for which were first shared with employees in December, will help create an accessible workplace, it said in a statement.
""Being able to go primarily remote really means that now we can recruit and attract talent from almost anywhere,"" said Cynthia Owyoung, vice president of equity, inclusion and belonging at Robinhood.
Robinhood said some teams will need to live within a commutable distance to an office location due to regulatory and business reasons, and a small segment will still need to work from the office. It expects no change in the compensation structure of its staff. 
Tech giants such as  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Meta Platforms Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) opted for flexible working policies early on during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Uncertainty around the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant has also pushed several big U.S. companies, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), to delay their back-to-office plans. 
Founded in 2013, Robinhood's popularity exploded among retail investors early in the pandemic due to its easy-to-use interface and commission-free trades. It was also instrumental in fueling last year's ""meme"" stock frenzy, although technical glitches and a temporary restriction on trading securities of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) in January 2021 embittered some of its users.

Investing.com – Dish Network stock (NASDAQ:DISH) jumped 3% on Wednesday on a report in the New York Post that it is in renewed talks with DirecTV for a merger.
The satellite-TV giants tried a combination around two decades ago but the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department red-flagged it. Two years ago, the DOJ also quietly warned executives off a prospective deal, concerned about the nascent rollout of 5G, the report said.
According to the report, officials are optimistic of about the this time as the market power of the companies has waned. The Biden administration’s infrastructure package allocates $65 billion to build out rural broadband. Once faster internet reaches more rural areas, the people there could look to cut the cord and buy streaming packages, providing competition to the satellite providers and addressing concerns over market monopoly.
The transaction could also help the country’s patchy rollout of 5G services, an argument that could go down well with the regulators at the time of approval, the report said.
Private equity giant TPG, a 30% shareholder of DirecTV, is pushing the deal even as Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen’s demands for a significant voting share and a say in key decision-making at the combined company are dragging the deal.
DirecTV currently has just over 15 million customers while Dish has 8.4 million.

Bankers to the ride-hailing firm have had preliminary discussions with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, a report in South China Morning Post said. The move is in line with the company’s decision to withdraw from the NYSE and list on the island. Didi has promised to ensure its NYSE-listed stock is convertible into tradable shares on another stock exchange.
Didi listed on the NYSE on June 30, ignoring the advice of the authorities in China that it should delay its public debut, pending scrutiny of its data handling practices.

The SEC has asked the company to produce documents and information regarding allegations made in a report by short-seller Blue Orca Capital.
Blue Orca in September disclosed a short position in Hyzon and alleged that the truck maker's largest customer Shanghai HongYun was a ""fake company"" and that it was formed days before announcement of a deal to supply 500 fuel-cell vehicles.
In October, Hyzon rejected the report and its chief executive officer said the company has no record of the short seller meeting with the management requesting ""any information or clarification"" or seeking ""to verify its claims"". 
Hyzon said on Wednesday it was cooperating with the SEC in the investigation. 
Blue Orca and the SEC were not immediately available for comment.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google launched Google News Showcase in 2020. The platform promotes content from more than 1,000 publishers that have agreed to license content for a fee.
Germany's Cartel Office said in June that it was investigating Google's Showcase product under new powers to regulate internet companies, after a complaint by Corint Media, which manages the rights of German television and radio stations.
The Bonn-based Cartel Office is concerned that Google's dealmaking power could lead to some news providers being squeezed out of the market, and that including Showcase results into its general search engine could give it an unfair advantage over competitors.
The German Cartel Office said in a statement that Google has now given assurances that access to Showcase was based on objective criteria. 
It also said that the conditions for Showcase participation would not impede a publisher's ability to assert general ancillary copyright, under which content providers must pay publishers for the use of news snippets.
The regulator said that the investigation will now consult with Corint Media as well as with other news publishers to assess whether Google's proposal would be effective.
Reuters signed a News showcase agreement with Google a year ago, and Wall Street Journal owner News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) closed a similar deal a month later.
Corint Media, based in Berlin, said it welcomed the Cartel Office's announcement on Wednesday.
""This means that the substitute competition by Google that had been feared, which would have made the offerings of publishers dispensable in the long run, will not be possible,"" Christoph Schwennicke and Markus Runde, managing directors of Corint, said in a statement.

The study, initiated in May, tested the company's next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PREVNAR 20, with a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 shot in 570 participants.
The aim of the study was to test the safety of the combination and the immune response after adding the pneumonia vaccine to the existing COVID-19 vaccine.
The company said responses elicited by PREVNAR 20 and booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were similar when given together or with placebo.
The data provides evidence supporting the potential to administer PREVNAR 20 and the company's COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, reducing the number of visits people make to doctors or pharmacies for recommended immunization,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said. 

PREVNAR 20 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June last year to help protect adults against most invasive pneumococcal diseases and pneumonia.
Study participants were recruited from the companies' late-stage COVID-19 vaccine study, and those who had received the second dose of the company's COVID-19 vaccine at least six months before entering the co-administration study.

Investing.com – Ally Financial stock (NYSE:ALLY) rose 2.1% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after the company’s board approved a fresh share repurchase program as well as a higher dividend.
The company said it expects to begin repurchasing shares in the first quarter of 2022 and spend up to $2 billion through the year on the exercise. Ally recently completed a $2 billion share repurchase program in 2021.
Tuesday’s closing price of $50.54 gave Ally’s equity base of over 346 million shares a market cap of $17.5 billion. At that price, a $2 billion outlay allows the company to buy close to 40 million shares or just over 11% of its equity.
The share buyback does not the tie the company to any quantity or any price it must buy the shares at. 
Ally will also pay a dividend of 30 cents a share to its shareholders, a 20% increase. Shareholders whose names appear in the company’s books as on February 1 will get the dividend.

CHENNAI (Reuters) -Apple Inc supplier Foxconn restarted production at its plant in southern India on Wednesday, a company official said, over three weeks after it was closed because of protests over workers falling sick.
The company official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the factory reopened with one shift and 120 workers, adding it would take over two months for the plant to produce at full capacity.
The plant, in the town of Sriperumbudur near the Tamil Nadu state capital of Chennai, employs about 17,000 people but was closed on Dec. 18 after 250 workers fell sick with food poisoning, sparking protests. Workers previously told Reuters the plant generally operates three shifts.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined to comment on Wednesday, but had said on Monday the plant remained on probation, and that it would continue monitoring conditions at workers' dormitories and dining halls, along with independent auditors.
Foxconn did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Apple and Foxconn had previously found some worker dormitories and dining rooms did not meet required standards, forcing the Taiwan-based company to restructure its local management team and take immediate steps to improve facilities.

Women who assembled iPhones at the southern Indian Foxconn plant told Reuters they lived in crowded dorms without flush toilets and food served at worker hostels sometimes crawled with worms.
The factory, which has started trial production of the iPhone 13, is strategically important in the long term as the U.S. tech giant tries to cut its reliance on its Chinese supply chain amid trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 07:21AM ET</span>",Back to Zoom: Omicron weighs on investment bankers' hustle,"By Anirban Sen and David French
(Reuters) - Investment bankers who rushed to court clients in person after COVID-19 vaccines became available last year have been forced to cancel such gatherings at the start of 2022 as the Omicron variant rages.
Bankers say the impact on dealmaking will not be as severe as 2020, when the pandemic started and global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity fell to a three-year low. They expect the new surge to be short-lived and they have become accustomed to putting together deals virtually through online platforms such as Zoom.
Some fret, however, about losing the chance to cultivate relationships with executives socially. The timing is also poor for bankers hoping to win new assignments, as many large corporations review strategic changes at the beginning of the year. 
""My motto has always been, if I'm not in front of my clients, someone else is. But I think this is just a different time. If people want to travel, and they are comfortable doing it, and they take precautions, I'm allowing people,"" said Drew Goldman, global head of investment banking coverage & advisory at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB).
Most of corporate America and Wall Street have asked employees not to come to the office this month, as COVID-19 cases in the United States repeatedly break new daily records. The vaccines have helped prevent hospitalizations and deaths, but infections have surged with the Omicron variant. 
Other industries from healthcare to airlines to retail have been hit hard by Omicron. The World Bank on Tuesday cut its forecasts for economic growth in the United States, the Euro area and China and warned that new coronavirus variants and other factors threatened the recovery in developing economies.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and other big banks have encouraged staff to work from home to limit the spread of the virus. Some, such as  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), have gone further, implementing a ""no jab, no job"" policy to push employees to get fully vaccinated -- barring employees who receive an accommodation or exemption. 
Many in-person meetings with bankers have been canceled by the companies themselves, according to interviews with six investment bankers who discussed the matter on condition that they and their clients are not identified. Some bankers have also canceled meetings on their own initiative.
It is a u-turn from last year, when bank CEOs, including JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, urged bankers to use private corporate jets, if needed, to travel and meet clients. 
Banks put on lavish dinners and wine-soaked meet-and-greets for clients. Some even rewarded staff with bonuses based on the number of clients they met.
It paid off. The value of M&A globally topped $5 trillion for the first time ever in 2021, according to Dealogic.
As with when the pandemic emerged in 2020, the toll is heaviest on young bankers, who learn their trade and develop contacts by working alongside and traveling with senior colleagues. The social distancing restrictions make it challenging for them to evolve from footsoldiers to rainmakers.

Given the Omicron wave's rapid pace, bankers are hoping to be back in the office and on the road come February.
""We have the chance to kind of go back to more normalcy, hopefully, in the next couple of weeks,"" said Deutsche's Goldman.

(Reuters) -OVHcloud aims to capitalise on the exponential growth in the global cloud market, the French cloud services provider said on Wednesday after its first-quarter revenues beat market expectations on the back of strong customer gains.
The group, which made its market debut in October in one of Paris' biggest new listings of 2021, said recent signings of new customers like EDF (PA:EDF) Renewables and HarfangLab confirmed its relevance as a ""trusted alternative"" in the industry.
As the emphasis on data security and privacy rises, analysts see OVHcloud's positioning as increasingly pertinent to tap into demand for data sovereignty cloud solutions.
The competitive landscape, however, remains dynamic, with U.S. giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure making modifications to their operations to comply with European regulations.
""There is a new momentum for new regulations,"" chief executive Michel Paulin said in a call. ""OVHcloud is uniquely well-positioned to propose alternative solutions against most of the hyperscalers.""
The group reported a 13.9% rise in its first-quarter revenue to 187.2 million euros ($212.9 million), ahead of analysts' average estimate in a company-compiled consensus, according to J.P. Morgan.
The brokerage said the highlight of the report was OVHcloud's higher client retention, with a 112% revenue retention rate (NRR) over the quarter compared to 100% reported for the 2021 fiscal year ended August.
The company - which was admitted to SBF 120 index less than two months after its initial public offering - maintained its 2022 objectives, with revenue growth expected in the upper half of its initial 10% to 15% target range and a core profit margin at about 40%.
""We believe that the company has left itself room to upgrade this guidance if NRR metrics stay at, or continue to improve from, current levels,"" J.P. Morgan said.

OVHcloud shares were up 4.7% at midday after rising as much as 7.4% in early trading.

1057,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 07:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Edge Higher; Key Inflation Data Looms Large,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s positive trend ahead of the release of key inflation data which could provide clues as to when the Federal Reserve will start tightening monetary policy.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 25 points, or 0.2%.
The major indices closed higher on Wall Street Tuesday, ending a five-day selloff in the broad-based S&P 500, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to the fore after Fed Chair Jerome Powell eased worries he would signal a faster-than-expected tightening schedule during his renomination testimony on Capitol Hill. 
U.S. Treasury yields had soared in the early days of the new year after the Federal Reserve took a hawkish turn at its December meeting, pressuring the highly-leveraged tech sector in particular.
This new positive tone faces a fresh test Wednesday with the release of the latest U.S. consumer inflation data, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). The headline CPI is expected to come in at a hefty 7% on a year-on-year basis, the biggest jump in prices since the early 1980s.
“The U.S. inflation data will be the next hurdle for the equity rally continuance,” said analyst Jeffrey Halley, at OANDA. “Above 7.0% likely brings the inflation trade back, limiting gains, while a sub 6.50% headline should keep the party going as Fed hiking timetables get reset back to mid-year.” 
In corporate news, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock traded sharply lower premarket after a U.S. health agency decided to restrict Medicare coverage of certain Alzheimer's drugs, including the company’s Aduhelm, to only those patients who are enrolled in a qualified clinical trial.
Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) could also be in the spotlight after Chairman Andrew Liveris announced plans to build an electric-vehicle factory in Saudi Arabia in the next three to four years.
Oil prices traded higher Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s sharp gains that pushed benchmark contracts to their highest levels since the highly transmissible Omicron variant emerged in late November.
However, supply data from the American Petroleum Institute suggested caution may be warranted. While crude stocks fell by 1.1 million barrels last week, gasoline stockpiles rose by a hefty 10.9 million barrels suggesting the Omicron outbreak may be having an impact on U.S. drivers.
Investors now await the official crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration due later in the day.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $81.97 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $84.27. Both contracts jumped around 3.5% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,816.70/oz, while EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1362.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 06:36AM ET</span>",Time to buy: Retail investors swoop in when stocks falter,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retail investors have been dip-buyers so far in 2022, snapping up equities that funds have shed from their portfolios in light of a more hawkish Federal Reserve, but with a focus on quality stocks as opposed to speculative names.
Growth and technology stocks, which typically generate lower returns in higher-interest rate environments, have had a rocky start to the year as big investors respond to expectations the Fed will raise interest rates as many as four times in 2022, driving short-dated Treasury yields to nearly two-year highs.
Still, weakness in stocks has been met with retail investors seeing opportunities to buy. On Monday, after falling almost 3% earlier in the day the technology-heavy Nasdaq recouped all its losses for the day in afternoon trading, and it gained again on Tuesday.
""Buy the dip has been successful for how many – 8 or 10 years now – and I think that people still see opportunities when they look around for potential investments and the U.S. stock market is still the best game in town,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at retail brokerage TD Ameritrade, which is owned by  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp.
Clients of TD Ameritrade returned to buying this month after having been net-sellers in December, with heavy selling in the final week of the year as the Omicron COVID-19 wave began to hit hard, said Kinahan.
The busiest day this year for Apex Clearing, which processes trades for brokerages including SoFi Technologies Inc and Firsttrade, was Jan. 5, when the S&P 500 dropped around 2%, with a buy-to-sell ratio of 1.91, a spokesperson for the company said. The S&P experienced a similar drop the next day, and retail investors were again net-buyers, she said. 
Individual investors have been focusing on stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well as tech-focused and leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while they reduced their buying of securities related to gaming, space exploration, and cannabis themes, said Giacomo Pierantoni, Head of Data at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research. 
""Retail investors have continued to buy large-cap tech and ETFs, providing a cushion, but they aren't buying the dip aggressively in speculative assets,"" such as cryptocurrencies and hyper-growth stocks, he said. 
With risk appetite still low, some of the main picks in the past week for TD Ameritrade clients have been big tech stocks such as Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Inc Corp, as well as blue-chips, including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Kinahan said. 
A BIGGER FORCE 
Retail investors have become a bigger force in the markets in the past couple of years as retail brokerages have moved to commission-free trading and social media has made it easier for individuals, many working from home due to the pandemic, to coordinate on trading ideas. That can put them at odds with the patterns of institutional investors. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities analysts said retail clients and hedge funds were buyers of U.S. equities last week, with around $500 million in net buys, as the S&P 500 fell 1.9%. 
The bank's institutional clients, meanwhile, began the year with their biggest outflows since mid-January of 2021. 
That phenomenon was also seen on Monday when retail investors notched their third consecutive day of buying more than $1 billion in equities, according to a note from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts.

Monday's net total of $1.07 billion in equities bought by retail was in the 93rd percentile of historical data, they said. That stands in contrast to institutional investors which have been net-sellers.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 06:35AM ET</span>","Analysis-Elliott, Ancora lead hedge funds in pushing for more women on boards","By Jessica DiNapoli and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp and Ancora Advisors LLC led activist hedge funds in pushing for women to join corporate boards last year, as a Wall Street old boys' network makes strides toward diversity.
Activist investors who push for changes at companies shake up boards by putting slates of nominees to a shareholder vote or negotiating directly to add or remove directors.
While hedge funds still lag corporate America in diversity on corporate boards, some are significantly outpacing their peers in adding and nominating women directors, an analysis by data provider Insightia for Reuters shows.
Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, publicly nominated eight women to boards last year, all of whom were appointed, according to data from Insightia. The hedge fund was the only one last year to have more women than men added to boards. 
In 2019, Elliott had installed eight men on boards and no women, though it nominated a woman that year at Hyundai Motor Co and had helped women get appointed in the previous years. 
Ancora, run by Fred DiSanto, nominated nine women to boards last year, within close distance of the 13 men it put forward. Out of the eight directors it managed to install on boards, three were women, according to Insightia.
This is ahead of the industry average. Insightia examined the track record of 12 activist hedge funds with publicly disclosed assets of more than $500 million that pressured at least two companies in 2021. On average only about 20% of the directors installed on boards last year were women, compared to 30% female representation on boards in S&P 500 component companies, according to Insightia and a Reuters analysis.
Elliott, which oversees $48 billion, and Ancora, which oversees $9.4 billion, said they had made identifying women directors a priority, as environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues gain prominence among investors whose support the hedge funds need to pressure companies. 
""I have over 100 calls per year with directors. About 80% of the directors I speak with are women,"" said Christine O'Brien, head of investment stewardship at Elliott.
Ancora's co-president Jim Chadwick said that, as his firm was seeking to refresh stale boards, it found too many were ""instinctively insular because they have a collection of like-minded directors, who are often mostly men.""
Board appointments by activist hedge funds Starboard Value LP, Land & Buildings Investment Management LLC and Inclusive Capital Partners LP also beat the S&P 500's 30% level last year. 
Starboard, run by Jeffrey Smith, went from four women and 14 men appointed to a board in 2019 to a 50-50 split last year of three men and three women, according to Insightia. Out of three directors Land & Buildings installed last year, one was a woman. Inclusive, founded by former ValueAct CEO Jeff Ubben, had two women appointed to boards, and three men.
A Land & Buildings spokesperson said that nearly 60% of the individuals the fund had ""directly or indirectly"" added to boards in the last five years were women. 
Anne Sullivan, Inclusive's chief operating officer, said ""board representation is an active part of our investment strategy.""
Starboard did not respond to requests for comment.
Jana Partners LLC, the hedge fund run by billionaire Barry Rosenstein, disclosed last year it intended to nominate three women out of eight people it put forward to serve as directors.
""Jana is committed to adding diversity on boards as demonstrated by our three 13-D filings with nominee agreements in 2021, all of which included a female nominee,"" said chief legal officer and partner Jennifer Fanjiang.
ICAHN'S MALE-DOMINATED SLATES
Other major activist hedge funds and investors, including Icahn Enterprises LP, did not appoint any women to boards in 2021 despite being active.
Icahn Enterprises, run by the billionaire investor Carl Icahn who has agitated for changes at companies for more than four decades, has installed only one woman on a board in the last three years, out of 19 directors he placed in total, according to Insightia.
At Southwest Gas (NYSE:SWX) Holdings Inc, however, Icahn put forward a 10-person slate with four women in November.
Icahn declined to comment.

Beth Stewart, chief executive of Trewstar Corporate Board Services, which helps place directors at companies and slates, said more activist hedge funds sought women as they appealed to top ESG-minded money managers, such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, for their support in high-stakes shareholder votes.
""I think the word has gotten out, there are a whole lot of talented women out there, so why not?"" Stewart said.

Investing.com –  Exxon Mobil  stock (NYSE:XOM) edged higher in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the company put some of its shale assets in Ohio on the block.
According to Reuters, the sale, part of the company’s ongoing divestiture of U.S. assets, could value the assets at around $200 million based on current natural gas prices and existing production from the wells. The properties stretch across 27,000 acres in the state’s Appalachian basin, the agency said.
The oil giant is marketing 61 wells that last year produced around 81 million cubic feet per day equivalent of natural gas, according to the report. The sale also includes another 274 wells operated by other companies.
No agreement has been reached nor has any buyer been identified yet while operations continue, Reuters said.
The company three years ago set a goal of raising $15 billion from asset sales, and last year accelerated its efforts as energy prices recovered from the pandemic. Many of these assets were bought in 2010 at the time of a shale boom that eventually led to oversupply of gas and record-low prices.
In 2020, Exxon marked down the value of its U.S. oil and gas holdings by over $17 billion."

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Just Eat Takeaway.com, Europe's largest meal delivery company, reported a 14% increase in orders in the fourth quarter on Wednesday in line with expectations and maintained its financial forecasts for 2022.
In a trading update, the company said it had delivered 273.7 million orders in the fourth quarter of last year, up from 240.4 million in the same period of 2020. 
Chief Executive Jitse Groen repeated that Takeaway expected orders to increase and losses to fall in 2022 but stopped short of forecasting it would break even on an operating basis this year, unlike German rival Delivery Hero which said on Tuesday it would do so in the second half.
""We're not targeting profitability, we've given out a slight loss range for this year,"" Groen said.
Takeaway has come under pressure from investors to sell operations, including U.S. subsidiary Grubhub, to reduce its operating losses as the boost it received from increased orders during the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to fade.
Takeaway's shares have fallen 12% so far in 2022 and were down 1.4% at 42.57 euros at 0824 GMT on Tuesday, far below their all-time high above 109 euros hit in October 2020. 
After rapid growth during the pandemic, European food delivery firms such as Takeaway, Deliveroo and Delivery Hero are bracing for consolidation and more competition from a new generation of fast grocery and delivery companies. 
Groen said losses would be driven by continued investment in its delivery network in Britain, where it owns Just Eat.
He said the company was continuing to negotiate over the sale of its one-third stake in iFood, Brazil's largest meal delivery company. 

On Grubhub, which has lost market share since Takeaway bought it for $7.3 billion in June last year, he said: ""We are open to improvements ... that can be a partner and it can be something else that improves that business.""
Takeaway reports full-year earnings on March 2.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>",U.S. business fears never ending liability from 'take-home' COVID-19 lawsuits,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - As COVID-19 cases surge in the United States, businesses say they fear a California court ruling has increased the likelihood that companies will be sued for infections, even by people who are not employees or customers.
The Dec. 21 ruling allowed a wrongful death lawsuit to proceed against See's Candies Inc, owned by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), by the family of Arturo Ek of Los Angeles who died in April 2020 at 72 from COVID-19. 
See's employed his wife, Matilde Ek, who said she was infected by the coronavirus while working inches apart from sick coworkers, and then her husband caught it from her at home.
The ruling is the first by an appeals court to allow a novel ""take-home"" COVID-19 lawsuit, which seek damages from a business over allegations of violating safety protocols and setting off a chain of infections beyond the company's premises.
See's, which did not respond to a request for comment, could appeal to California's supreme court.
The See's ruling is only binding in California, but it may offer guidance to judges in other states, legal experts said.
Business groups warned in court papers filed before the See's decision that such a ruling could prompt lawsuits by an infected employee’s family and friends, and anyone infected by that circle of people.
The groups called it a ""never-ending chain"" of liability.
To counter COVID-19 lawsuits, including take-home cases, business interests have persuaded at least 30 states to adopt laws that make it difficult to bring them, often by requiring plaintiffs to show gross negligence.
California wasn't one of those states.
""The appellate court’s ruling could open up California employers to frivolous COVID-related lawsuits that will further dampen the ability of small businesses in particular to recover,"" said Kyla Christoffersen Powell, the president of Civil Justice Association of California, a business group. 
Hours after the decision, a California construction worker and his wife cited the ruling to a U.S. appeals court in San Francisco. The couple is seeking to revive a similar lawsuit against Victory Woodworks Inc.
There have been at least 23 take-home COVID-19 lawsuits across the United States, which are all in the early stages. Defendants include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc and Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC), an affiliate of meat producer  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY).
The lawsuits generally allege negligence toward COVID-19 protocols: employees were packed into work vans, symptomatic workers were kept in company dorms or infected people weren't screened before entering a worksite. They seek damages on behalf of employees' children and spouses who wound up on ventilators or even died of the disease.
At least six of the lawsuits have been dismissed including against Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and six, including two against McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), appear to have resulted in a private settlement, said Stephen Jones, general counsel of Praedicat Inc, a firm that evaluates risks for insurers. 
The cases are not limited to employees. Royal Caribbean's Celebrity Cruise line was sued in federal court in Miami for a COVID-19 outbreak on a ship, infecting two passengers who brought the disease home to their children. The two sides are scheduled to begin mediation later this month.
""Until you get a jury verdict, we won't know one way or other if there will be an explosion of cases,"" said Jones. 
The See's ruling helped to resolve an initial question that has hung over take-home COVID-19 cases by finding that employers aren't shielded from lawsuits by workers' compensation. The system provides quick payments without the need to prove fault for workplace injuries and in return it blocks lawsuits.
The California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, said Arturo Ek's death was dependent on his wife as a conduit for the virus. His death was not, as See's had argued, dependent on her disease.
The Ek family must still convince a judge that See's owed a duty to family and acquaintances of employees. Plaintiffs have failed to establish that in cases that were dismissed against Southwest Airlines, an Illinois meat processing company and a Maryland hospital.

To ultimately prevail, plaintiffs must also show that there is a link between the workplace and the case of take-home COVID-19.
""You would have to have a situation where an employee came to and from work and neither the employee nor anyone else in the family/household went anywhere else,"" said Amberly Morgan, an attorney with Fisher Phillips, which defends employers.

(Reuters) - A trade group seeking to promote geothermal energy in Texas will launch on Thursday with backing from large oil and utility firms seeking to transform their businesses.
The Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance (TxGEA) was organized as many fossil fuel giants and startup companies look to transition to low-carbon energy from oil and gas. The group includes Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Repsol (OTC:REPYY),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), Baker Hughes, CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP) and GeothermEx, a Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) company.
The former chairman of the state's public utility and energy regulatory boards, Barry Smitherman, spearheaded the group's formation. Texas is the largest oil- and gas-producing state.
""Decision makers and thought leaders are interested in a resource that is clean, renewable and dispatchable - that is what has piqued everyone's interest,"" said Smitherman. He added that the group's short-term focus will be education and advocacy.
Geothermal technology employs much of the same drilling technologies used in the oil and gas sector, although the wells are designed differently. One member, Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR), a drilling firm, is already eying geothermal as a business opportunity.
Smitherman said service companies see this as another way to use their technology, workforce and skill set.
There are many geothermal projects currently under way in the United States, which could usher in greater scale for an industry that does not yet easily compete with cheaper oil and gas.
Geothermal accounts for less than 1% of global utility-scale electricity generation because it is geologically limited, according to TxGEA member Sage Geosystems.
The United States has about 3.5 gigawatts of geothermal capacity currently installed.

Investing.com – Biogen stock (NASDAQ:BIIB) slumped 9% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after a decision to restrict Medicare coverage of certain alzheimer’s drugs, limiting the scope to generate revenue from its aduhelm drug.
U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the health agency that runs Medicare, has decided that it will only cover the costs of such drugs for patients enrolled in clinical trials.  The decision is preliminary and the public has a 30-day window to give its comments. A final decision will be taken in April. 
The decision to require the trial ""denies nearly all Medicare beneficiaries,"" Biogen said in a statement. The company warned that if the proposed provision comes to stay, “it would likely take in excess of a year to begin enrolling patients, further delaying reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries”.
Medicare currently pays for the treatment on a case-to-case basis.
The move to require continued clinical trials for a drug that has already been approved is unusual and reflects the controversy over the Food and Drug Administration's decision to authorize its use in June, which overrode strong objections from some experts on its own advisory panel. They argued that the company needed to place more evidence of the drug’s benefits.
The final CMS coverage terms are expected to apply to all drugs in the class, including experimental medications in development by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Roche (OTC:RHHBY) and Eisai (OTC:ESALY), Reuters said.
The drug's high price - $56,000 annually - was another sore point and hospitals and doctors backed away from endorsing the treatment because of this. The company has since cut the price to $28,200."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp's proposal to split itself into three companies won't solve its governance issues and the conglomerate should prioritise an overhaul of its board and management, said a senior executive at one of Japan's largest pension funds.
Ken Hokugo, corporate governance director at the Pension Fund Association (PFA), said the interests of Toshiba management and shareholders are ""not aligned"".
""The most orthodox solution to the discrepancy is to bring onto the board someone who can monitor and discipline management, and to let the revamped board to select the new chief executive,"" he said in written responses to Reuters queries.
Hokugo declined to comment on how the PFA, which owns an undisclosed amount of shares in Toshiba, would vote on the conglomerate's plan to break up into three companies - one for energy and infrastructure, another for electronic devices and a third to house its flash memory chip assets.
Nonetheless, his comments highlight broad shareholder concern about Toshiba, marking a rare public pronouncement from an influential Japanese pension fund, part of an industry that typically stays silent about companies they invest in.
The PFA, which provides benefits to people who have left their employee pension programmes, is one of the country's largest pension funds with 12.5 trillion yen ($108 billion) in assets.
Foreign shareholders have, however, been more vocal about their concern, with several of them having a tense relationship with Toshiba management after it was found by a shareholder-commissioned investigation last year to have colluded with the trade ministry to blunt their influence.
Toshiba said in a statement to Reuters that its board and management firmly believe the break-up plan is ""the best path to create additional value for our stakeholders.""
Hokugo noted successful turnarounds at Olympus Corp and chip materials maker JSR Corp, which both invited shareholder ValueAct Capital to take a board seat. ""As a result of overhauls assisted by a ValueAct partner, their corporate values shot up,"" he said.
Some Toshiba shareholders have told Reuters they are publicly or privately pushing the firm to do a more thorough review that would take into account potential private-equity bids.
Toshiba failed to formally solicit buyout offers during a five-month strategic review before deciding on the break-up, giving the impression that a split was a foregone conclusion for management, Hokugo said.
He also said it was understandable that some shareholders wanted to see a private equity deal as taking Toshiba private could allow for drastic measures that may be not possible for a listed company.
Hokugo also stressed that it should be up to shareholders, not management, to decide on the best option to increase corporate value.
Toshiba plans to hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting https://www.reuters.com/business/toshiba-shareholder-calls-extraordinary-meeting-vote-break-up-plan-2022-01-06 in March to gauge shareholder support for the break-up plan, but the exact date and what the bar will be for shareholder approval have yet to be decided.
It will also brief investors on Feb. 7-8 on the business strategies of the companies to be created from the break-up.

Years of accounting scandals and governance issues have seen Toshiba's market value more than halve to around $18 billion from an early 2000s peak.

The company, which has 176 stores and an online operation, reported sales of 407 million pounds ($555 million) for the 13 weeks to Dec. 25, its second quarter, up 13% on a year earlier and up 26% on the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. 
It said it had seen ""particularly encouraging growth from its stores"", while higher full-price sales of seasonal ranges helped boost margins by 160 points in the quarter.
Chief Executive Nick Wilkinson said: ""Whilst there are several macro uncertainties to be navigated, we feel well placed to continue to deliver profitable growth across all channels and grow market share.""
Dunelm said that as long as there was no significant new COVID-19 related disruption it expected its full-year pretax profit to be materially ahead of market expectations.
Its shares were trading up 5% in morning deals, as broker Peel Hunt upgraded its full-year pretax profit forecast by 27 million pounds to 206.1 million pounds.
Dunelm was a ""business on form,"" the broker said, with a proposition that was continuing to resonate strongly with customers.

(Reuters) -JD Sports Fashion raised its annual profit forecast for the second time in four months on Wednesday as shoppers splashed out on sportswear during the holidays and U.S. consumers spent their stimulus cheques on the latest trends.
Britain's biggest sportswear retailer, which has expanded in the United States during the pandemic with the purchase of streetwear retailer DTLR Villa and Shoe Palace, shrugged off supply chain disruptions and new COVID-19 restrictions.
""JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports has scored a Christmas cracker on a shopping pitch full of obstacles,"" said  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Susannah Streeter.
""With sports and fashion fans showing a willingness to queue around the block to get their hands on the latest styles, sales should remain buoyant even as belts are tightened elsewhere.""
JD Sports expects headline pretax profit of at least 875 million pounds ($1.2 billion) for the year to Jan. 29, ahead of current market expectations of 810 million pounds. It had previously forecast profit of at least 750 million pounds.
Shares in the FTSE 100 company rose as much as 4.8%, before reversing to trade down 1.7% by 0915 GMT as it also said earnings for the year ended January 2023 would be in line with the current year and ""revert more to historic norms"".
JD Sports, which has been embroiled in a lengthy tussle with Britain's antitrust watchdog over its purchase of smaller rival Footasylum, has seen demand rise since lockdowns were eased and people started visiting its stores again. 
Like-for-like revenue for the 22-weeks to Jan. 1 was up 10%, it said, without giving details on top-selling lines.

Investing.com – Philips ADRs (NYSE:PHG) tumbled 14% in premarket trading Wednesday after the Dutch company warned of a hit to its fourth-quarter profit, blaming supply chain shortages and customers choosing to delay installation of equipment for its gloomy outlook.
Philips' decision over six months ago to recall certain breathing devices and ventilators on concerns they could harm patients also continues to weigh on earnings.
The maker of medical equipment said its fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be 650 million euro ($741 million), down around 43% from 1.13 billion euro a year earlier. The company attributed this to falling sales and higher supply costs. As a percentage of sales, profit is down 6 percentage points on the year.
Group sales for the quarter are expected to be around 4.9 billion euro, around 350 million euro lower than its own expectations, the company said. Sales for the full year are seen at around 17.2 billion euro, down 12% from last year’s 19.5 billion euro.
The company had to make an even higher provision for the recall of ventilators, and that, coupled with supply chain headwinds, dealt a blow of 5 percentage points to the group’s full-year comparable sales.
Attempting to assuage investor concerns, the company said incoming orders grew 4% in the quarter, driven by demand for diagnosis and treatment businesses.
The company will reveal its final numbers on January 24."

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, continuing the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell-inspired global rally amid confidence in an economic rally despite the deluge of Omicron variant Covid cases.
At 4:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.8%.
Most sectors traded in positive territory in Europe Wednesday, with basic resources leading the way, as lower-than-expected inflation data out of China boosted hopes for easier monetary policy there, supporting real estate developers and other big buyers of raw materials.
Also helping were comments from Powell at his confirmation hearing for a second term in charge of the U.S. central bank, when he stated that the U.S. economy could handle tighter monetary policy even in the face of the new Covid-19 surge. He, however, did not announce a quicker change in policy from what had already been signalled, to the market's relief.
A new test of sentiment is expected later Wednesday with the release of the U.S. CPI data for December, which is expected to come in hot, climbing to 7% year-on-year.
Back in Europe, J Sainsbury (OTC:JSAIY) stock rose 1.4% after the British supermarket group raised its full-year profit forecast by at least 9% following stronger than expected food sales over Christmas.

Pagegroup (LON:PAGE) stock rose 1% after the recruiter lifted its full-year profit forecast for the third time in six months, buoyed by a surge in demand for long-term hiring amid staff shortages.
On the flip side, Philips (AS:PHG) stock fell 10% after the Dutch health technology company said it expected fourth-quarter core profit to drop around 40%, hit by a global shortage of electronic components and the fallout from a massive recall of ventilators.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock fell 1.6% after the German auto giant said its car deliveries dropped 8.1% in 2021 to just under 4.9 million amid severe supply chain bottlenecks. 
Still, despite the stock market optimism, the surge in Omicron cases in the region shows few signs of letting up. Germany reported a new daily record for Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, and more than half of people in Europe could contract the new variant in the next two months if infections continue at current rates, the World Health Organisation said.
Oil prices traded higher, continuing the sharp gains of the previous session which pushed benchmark contracts to their highest levels since the highly transmissible Omicron variant emerged in late November.
However, supply data from the American Petroleum Institute suggested caution may be warranted. While crude stocks fell by 1.1 million barrels last week, gasoline stockpiles rose by a hefty 10.9 million barrels suggesting the Omicron outbreak may be having an impact on U.S. drivers.
Investors now await the official crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration due later in the day.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 03:05AM ET</span>","Analysis-Buy the bounce? Investors watch valuations, technical levels to decide","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As stocks attempt to climb back from a brutal sell-off, investors are watching a variety of metrics to decide whether to buy the rally or brace for more declines.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 1.4% on Tuesday, a day after falling more than 10% from its Nov. 19 record close during intraday trading before rallying at the end of the session. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury have risen by 20 basis points this month in anticipation of a more hawkish Federal Reserve and stand near their highest level since January 2020. Growth and tech stocks can be particularly sensitive to higher yields as they threaten to erode the value of future cash flows. 
""We are entering a period where you will see really dramatic leadership shifts and volatility"" in the equity market as the Fed prepares to raise rates, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). 
A look at historical valuations shows there may be more downside ahead for tech and growth stocks.
The price-to-earnings multiple of growth companies stands 15 points higher than that of so-called value stocks, compared to a long-term average of six points, wrote Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a recent report.
The Russell 1000 Growth index is down 3.8% year-to-date, while the Russell 100 Value which tracks the shares of banks, energy firms and other comparatively cheap, economically sensitive stocks, is up 1.4%. 
UBS expects the broad market to rise, with a year-end price target of 5100 on the S&P 500, some 8.2% above where it closed Tuesday. 
Still, “investors will have to be nimble in 2022, and be aware of any outsize exposure they may have to growth stocks,” Marcelli wrote.
Others are less bullish. Analysts at BofA Global Research said the nearly 2% decline that the S&P 500 experienced in the first five trading days of January bodes ill for its performance for the rest of the year.
The S&P 500 finishes the year higher nearly 75% of the time, delivering an average return of around 11%, when the first five trading sessions of the year are up. 
When the first five sessions are down, the year is up just 52% of the time, with an average return of 1.77%, BoFA’a analysts said in a report. The S&P 500 - where tech-focused stocks have a heavy weighting - rose nearly 27% in 2021 and is down 1.1% so far this year. 
Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald, meanwhile, warned that a “significant sell-off is coming,” in the face of a more hawkish Fed, calling for a pullback of 10% or more by the end of February. 
Alarming signs include a sharp rise in global bond yields that has dulled the attractiveness of equities and an 80% jump in margin debt among individual investors over the past two years, they said in a recent note.
“Equity exposure is at historic highs which means that an equity drawdown will overshoot to the downside,” wrote Eric Johnston, the firm’s head of equity derivatives and cross asset. 
Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group are watching technical levels. They noted that the QQQ exchange traded fund, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, closed in “extreme oversold” territory on Friday, a sign that the index could hit a short-term bottom. Since 1999, the Nasdaq 100 has gained 4.9% in the six months following an ""extreme oversold"" reading, according to Bespoke.

Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group, believes expected strong earnings over the next two quarters are likely to make any market sell-off short-lived
""Whether a correction is happening now or later this year, it will probably be met by solid company fundamentals,"" he said.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 02:51AM ET</span>",Hong Kong warns COVID-19 curbs on air cargo to hit goods supply,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong will soon feel the negative effects of tougher COVID-19 quarantine curbs on air crew, with cargo traffic and the supply of goods into the city set to drop, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Wednesday. 
Hong Kong's first transmission of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was detected at the end of last year after three months of zero infections in the community, prompting authorities to tighten quarantine measures, including on air crew, and reintroduce wide-ranging restrictions on social life. 
More than 40 local cases have since been discovered.
Authorities said the outbreak could be traced back to two air crew members of Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) who broke self-isolation rules. An investigation has been launched into the airline.
The tighter rules prompted Cathay to cancel most of its planned passenger and cargo flights in January. Cathay will operate about 20% of its pre-pandemic cargo capacity and around 2% of its pre-pandemic passenger flight capacity this month.
Lam, speaking at the opening session of the Asian financial hub's new ""patriots-only"" legislature, said Hong Kong already had the strictest measures against imported coronavirus infections and it was difficult to tighten them further.
""The consequences of these cargo policies will be seen very soon,"" Lam told legislators. ""We almost have no goods entering via cargo flight.""
""Destroying this industry will not only affect the flight companies, it will affect every citizen.""
Lam said she expected some goods to be unavailable or their price to go up, with food, electronics and medicine among the worst affected.
Returning air crew now need to quarantine for seven days in a hotel, having earlier been asked to isolate at home for three days. Most other residents returning to Hong Kong have to quarantine for 21 days in a designated hotel at their own cost.

On Tuesday, Lam said kindergartens and primary schools must stop face-to-face classes from Friday until after the Lunar New Year at the beginning of February.
She has also ordered a disciplinary investigation into 13 senior government officials who attended a birthday party for a delegate to China's legislature after health officials appealed to Hong Kong people to avoid large gatherings.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 02:46AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Humble and nimble,"A look at the day ahead from Julien Ponthus. 
""We are going to have to be humble but a bit nimble"". 
Arguably not much of a hint on the timing of rate hike lift-off but investors seemed happy enough with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's congressional hearing yesterday to eagerly buy the dip on Wall Street.
The upbeat sentiment, helped by the Bank of Japan offering its most optimistic view of the country's regional economy in more than eight years, spread to other asset classes with commodities and oil ticking higher while the dollar hit a six-week low and Asian bourses thrived.
Quite crucially, following the Nasdaq's positive close, tech stocks in Hong Kong made a 4% jump, which suggests that stock pickers aren't yet writing the sector off just yet.
The first days of trading of the year had indeed exposed some early cycle teething problems with volatility hitting tech shares for which investors are typically reluctant to pay hefty premiums when interest rates are headed higher. 
But while some traders seem to be comfortable with rising bond yield and gently biting into the comparative appeal of stocks, there's still some palpable angst on how smooth the tightening cycle will prove to be for markets. 
Of course, today's Chinese factory-gate prices and consumer inflation rising more slowly than expected in December came as a relief but there's another major test coming up today for the smooth tightening cycle narrative.
Apart from German wholesale inflation, U.S. December consumer inflation data will be released with headline CPI expected to hit a whopping 7% year-on-year.
As spectacular as it might be the reading seems currently priced in and expectations are still for inflation to gradually peak as we move further into 2022. 
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields have slightly retreated from the 1.808% reached on Monday, the highest since January 2020.
In Europe, where the European Central Bank is nowhere near a rate hike and at the earliest expected to move in 2023, German bond yields are reluctant to creep out of negative territory.

At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
The main equity indices closed higher Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way, and this positive tone has been matched in Asia overnight. 
At his confirmation hearing for a second term in charge of the U.S. central bank, Powell stated that the economy could handle tighter monetary policy even in the face of the new Covid-19 surge. He, however, did not announce a quicker change in policy from what had already been signalled, to the market's relief.
A new test of sentiment is expected later Wednesday with the release of the U.S. CPI data for December, which is expected to come in hot, climbing to 7% year-on-year.
Back in Europe, Germany reported a new daily record for Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, illustrating that the Omicron variant continues to run wild through the continent.
More than half of people in Europe could contract the new variant in the next two months if infections continue at current rates, the World Health Organisation said.
In corporate news, Dutch health technology company Philips (AS:PHG) said it expected fourth-quarter core profit to drop around 40%, hit by a global shortage of electronic components and the fallout from a massive recall of ventilators.
Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY), Europe's largest meals delivery company, reported fourth-quarter order growth of 14%, and maintained its financial forecasts for 2022.
Oil prices stabilized Wednesday after the sharp gains of the previous session pushed benchmark contracts to their highest levels since the highly transmissible Omicron variant emerged in late November. Powell’s testimony also gave the market a boost.
However, supply data from the American Petroleum Institute suggested caution may be warranted. While crude stocks fell by 1.1 million barrels last week, gasoline stockpiles rose by a hefty 10.9 million barrels suggesting the Omicron outbreak may be having an impact on U.S. drivers.
Investors now await the official crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration due later in the day.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded flat at $81.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $83.60. Both contracts jumped around 3.5% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,819.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely unchanged at 1.1365.

The total number of such delinquent firms jumped 26% in December from the previous month, according to the list published by the Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange.
The spike in defaults on commercial paper - a popular short-term debt instrument that Chinese developers use to delay payment to suppliers - shows sustained liquidity stress in the real estate sector despite some policy easing.
The list also contains an increasing number of defaults by construction material suppliers and decoration companies, suggesting developers' debt troubles could be spreading.
A total of 484 companies were overdue on at least three commercial paper payments during the Aug. 1 to Dec. 31 period, according to the list, published on the exchange's website.
The December total was 100 more companies than in November and included 95 in the real estate sector, or nearly one-fifth of the total. 
Four of the names are project companies of developer Shimao Group, which is discussing payment arrangements with creditors after announcing a default on a trust loan last week.
The list, which does not disclose financial figures, also includes real estate firms controlled by Kaisa Group, which is also struggling to repay investors, according to an analysis of the firms by Reuters.
Companies controlled by Greenland, Risesun Real Estate Development Co, China Grand Enterprises (CGE), Zoina Group and Seedland are also on the list. 
Shimao and Kaisa did not immediately respond to requests for comment and Greenland declined to comment. Risesun, Zoina, Seedland and CGE could not be reached for comment. 
China's CSI 300 Real Index retreated 1% on Wednesday morning after dropping as much as 3.2%, while the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index lost 1.4%. 
Property bond performance was mixed, with a Shimao bond slumping 18% in Shanghai.
China's commercial paper market came under renewed scrutiny in 2021 with regulators demanding greater disclosure as part of efforts to rein in ballooning debt in the property sector.
Commercial paper, which is not counted as interest-bearing debt, increasingly became a source of funding for developers locked out of other financing channels. 

China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted developer struggling amid a debt crisis, owes more than 200 billion yuan ($31.42 billion) in commercial paper.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 11:40PM ET</span>",Citi to exit Mexican consumer business as part of strategy revamp,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) will exit its Citibanamex consumer banking business in Mexico, the bank said on Tuesday ending its 20-year retail presence in the country that was the last of its overseas consumer businesses. 
Citigroup's decision to sell or spin off Citibanamex, Mexico's third biggest bank by assets as of June, is part of chief executive Jane Fraser's strategy to bring Citigroup's profitability and share price performance in line with its peers.
After taking up the top job last year, Fraser pledged to simplify Citigroup by exiting non-core businesses, including consumer franchises in 13 markets in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. While Citigroup's Mexican exit was not part of the announced plan it is consistent with that ""strategy refresh,"" Fraser said on Tuesday.
Citigroup will retain its institutional client business in Mexico, as it has in other overseas markets. It will focus its consumer banking business on a targeted U.S. retail presence, global wealth management, and payments and lending, it said. 
The bank's acquisition of Banamex for $12.5 billion in 2001 was the largest ever in Mexico at the time and came amid a wave of foreign purchases after an economic crisis devastated the country's banking sector in the mid-1990s.
Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego, who is ranked as the country's third-richest man with a family fortune estimated in excess of $15 billion by Forbes, said he was analyzing if it was possible to acquire Citibanamex. 
Other possible buyers for Citibanamex could come from Canada, where the big six banks have excess cash to spend on deals. Bank of Nova Scotia already has a sizable Mexico business.
The local arms of  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA) would also have the cash, while Mexican institutions Banorte and Inbursa could use an acquisition of Citi's operations to challenge this duo.
An industry laggard hobbled by creaky technology and poor risk-management controls, Citigroup's seeming inability to fix its operational issues and boost its share price has frustrated shareholders. ""Investor exhaustion"" plagues the bank, Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove said last month.
Fraser's revamp amounts to the biggest overhaul for Citigroup since it was forced to unload assets following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. To date the bank has taken $2 billion in charges exiting Asian markets.
Before becoming CEO, Fraser was responsible for the Mexico business and for Citigroup's global consumer bank. In that role she worked to build on investments the bank made to refurbish the Mexico consumer business which had been known as Banamex.
By disposing of the Mexico consumer businesses, ""we'll be able to direct our resources to opportunities aligned with our core strengths and competitive advantages,"" Fraser said in a statement, adding Mexico remains ""a priority market"" for Citigroup's institutional businesses. 
""We expect Mexico to be a major recipient of global investment and trade flows in the years ahead, and we are confident about the country's trajectory,"" she said.
MERGER BINGE
Citigroup's acquisition of Banamex was one of several led by Sandy Weill, CEO from 1998-2003, who built the bank into a U.S. giant and, some analysts believe, set it up for its problems.
Institutional investors and analysts, such as Mike Mayo of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), have long called for Citigroup to give up Citibanamex which they saw as drag on its investment returns.
Fraser's predecessor as CEO, Mike Corbat, had invested more in Citibanamex even after it suffered loan losses in a massive fraud involving a supplier to Mexico's state oil company.
Citigroup shares rose as much as 1% in after-market trading. 
The bank did not estimate the cost of exiting the business or what it might receive in a sale. The business currently uses about $4 billion of tangible common equity.

The Mexico consumer businesses provided about $3.5 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2021 and $1.2 billion in pre-tax earnings, Citigroup said. They include $44 billion of Citigroup's $2.36 trillion of total assets.
Citigroup said the timing of the exit is subject to regulatory approvals in the United States and Mexico.

Sunac’s note due 2024 lost 5.6 cents on the dollar to 48.6 cents, headed for the largest drop since Dec. 14. China’s high-yield dollar bond market lost on average 2 cents, traders said, led by declines in property developers. One of Shimao Group Holdings Ltd.’s bonds was on pace for a record low.
Some of China’s most stressed property developers face a raft of key payments this week, a test for the country’s volatile credit market. China Evergrande Group, which already failed to repay dollar debt on time, is seeking to avoid its first onshore default when holders vote on whether to allow the firm to defer payment Thursday. Shimao and one of its onshore units need to service some $376 million in bonds and interest payments in the coming days. The company assured it will repay a local note due Saturday.
Key Developments:
Sunac equity interests frozen (11:12 a.m. HK)
The Shenzhen court ordered Sunac Real Estate to freeze some equity interests in Guangzhou Wanda Cultural Tourism City Investment, Shanghai Sunac Property Development and a Wuhan unit, according to data from Tianyancha, which tracks public registrations. 
Minsheng lent billions to Evergrande (0:00 a.m. HK)
An ill-fated push into property lending has turned China Minsheng Banking Corp. into one of the biggest casualties of the real estate debt crisis that’s roiling Asia’s largest economy. Battered by mounting losses on loans to developers including Evergrande, Minsheng’s stock tumbled 31% in the 12 months through last week -- the worst performance in the 155-member Bloomberg World Banks Index.
Minsheng has about 130 billion yuan ($20 billion) of exposure to high-risk developers, amounting to 27% of its so-called tier-1 capital, the most among big Chinese lenders,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts estimated in a September research report. The bank will need years to work through its bad debt problem and a capital injection from a stronger rival can’t be ruled out, said Shen Meng, director at Chanson & Co., a Beijing-based boutique investment bank
Oceanwide gets default notice, demand for $165M repayment (9:40 p.m. HK)
China Oceanwide has received a default notice on a $1.28 million loan with the lender saying the default triggered an acceleration clause for full immediate repayment in all amounts totaling $165 million, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing. The real estate firm said it’s seeking legal advice and making efforts to secure funding to repay the outstanding sums.
Shimao plans to repay yuan bond due Saturday (6:19 p.m. HK)
Shimao is set to repay a local bond maturing Saturday after the developer received higher-than-anticipated cash inflows from property sales in December, according to people familiar with the matter.
Onshore subsidiary Shanghai Shimao Co. has set aside funds to repay the 4.65% local bond with outstanding principal of 1.9 billion yuan ($300 million), said the people, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private.
Meanwhile, Shimao’s long-term issuer default rating was downgraded by Fitch to B- from BB, citing concerns about its “lower margin of safety in preserving liquidity”.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 10:51PM ET</span>",U.S. Medicare plans to cover Biogen Alzheimer's drug only for trial patients,"By Deena Beasley and Leroy Leo
(Reuters) -The U.S. government Medicare program on Tuesday said it plans to cover Alzheimer's treatments including Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Aduhelm but will require patients to be enrolled in a clinical trial, limiting access to the treatment more than many expected.
Biogen shares were down 7.3% at $224 in extended trading on Tuesday. Shares of Biogen's Japanese partner Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd slid 2.6% in Tokyo. 
The decision from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the health agency that runs Medicare, could change as it seeks comment from companies and patients. A final decision is due on April 11.
The final CMS coverage terms are expected to apply to all drugs in the class, including experimental medications in development by Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY), Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and Eisai. 
Patient advocacy group UsAgainstAlzheimer’s chairman George Vradenburg said he was angry Medicare placed conditions on the use of the drugs that were more limiting than the regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, put on Aduhelm, and that the Medicare decision applied to any amyloid drug. 
The government's health service was ""at war with itself,"" he said.
""The FDA has approved this drug and now Medicare has disapproved the drug,"" Vradenburg said.
The FDA approved the drug in June last year despite its 11-member committee of outside experts voting nearly unanimously in November 2020 that the drug should not be approved, citing inconclusive evidence the drug was effective.
Many experts have questioned the FDA's rationale for Aduhelm's approval without more definitive proof of benefit, and doctors have held back on prescribing it.
""The wholesale rejection of this product by payers and health systems around the country is notable but not shocking, given how little evidence the manufacturer produced at the time of its FDA approval,"" said Dr. Caleb Alexander, a professor with the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, in Baltimore. Alexander was a member of the FDA advisory panel that voted not to approve the drug. 
Demand for an Alzheimer's treatment, he said, ""should fuel our investments in drug development, not a lowering of standards that Americans rely upon to know whether their drugs are safe and effective.""
UNUSUAL RESTRICTIONS
The unusual move to require clinical trials for recipients of the already approved drug comes after a six-month process in which CMS had been working on a national coverage policy for the drug.
The decision to require the trial ""will exclude almost all patients who may benefit,"" Biogen said in a statement. 
The requirements ""can take months to years to initiate,"" it said, and promised to urge the agency to align its coverage policy with the populations that have been studied in previous clinical trials.
""We believe Alzheimer's patients should have access consistent with other therapies with FDA accelerated approval,"" Biogen said.
Sales so far have been weak and Biogen last month cut the medication's list price by about half to $28,200 per year.
Cowen analyst Eric Assaraf said in a research note the decision to restrict coverage to clinical trial participants was more restrictive than he had expected, noting the agency could have simply required Biogen to maintain a registry of patients that documented responses to the drug. He said CMS may change its stance in the final decision.
Aduhelm's high price also has raised concerns over the toll it might take on the Medicare program, the U.S. government health plan for people age 65 and over. Because Alzheimer's is an age-related disease, around 85% of people who might use the medicine are in the government plan.
With the proposed decision, the cost will shift to patients, Vradenburg said.

""Unless you are a very wealthy person, you are not going to get access to the drug,"" he added.
Aduhelm, given as a monthly infusion, is a monoclonal antibody designed to remove a type of brain plaque associated with Alzheimer's Disease. Patients need to be monitored for potential side effects including brain swelling.

1083,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 10:46PM ET</span>","As costs soar, some Japanese companies do the unthinkable: raise prices","By Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) - Premium telescopes, violin bows and speciality paper are bucking a deflationary trend that has defined Japan for decades - all have had their prices hiked by companies confident they can charge more without losing business. 
Years of stagnant prices and wages have made Japan Inc nervous about charging more for fear of alienating shoppers and losing market share. Traditionally, firms have chosen belt-tightening in the face of rising costs.
While the overall rise in prices is still modest, more firms are opting for increases, led by market leaders often with speciality products, as commodities and transport costs soar due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a weakening yen makes fuel and imports costly.
Vixen Co Ltd, which commands nearly 60% of the local market for astronomy telescopes, plans to increase prices of its best selling lower-end models by as much as 24% from next month, to 74,800-169,840 yen ($650-$1,500).
""If costs go up and we don't increase the prices, it will have a big impact on us, so we had to start there,"" spokesperson Yasuhisa Tsuzuki said, adding Vixen had also been impacted by rising wages in China where it manufactures.
So far, there has not been a consumer backlash, he said.
""Few people care when the price of an astronomy telescope goes up,"" Tsuzuki said. ""But a hike in the cost of milk or eggs will be reported as big story on every single news show."" 
Tokyo-based Shirakawa Sogyo Co Ltd, which has been importing and selling violins since the 1960s, this month raised prices of some Swiss-made bows by as much as 36%, to up to 539,000 yen.
A strengthening Swiss franc against the yen has added to the squeeze on already tight profit margins, company President Susumu Shirakawa said. 
Now may be an ""easier time"" to raise prices because costs are generally going up for everyone, he said.
""Some of our competitors are doing it as well.""
CAUTIOUS HIKES 
Goods sold to other businesses are seeing bigger price increases than those sold directly to consumers, according to official data.
Wholesale inflation, which reflects the prices firms charge each other for goods, rose to a record 9% in November, while the core consumer price index ticked up 0.5% from a year earlier, the highest in nearly two years.
Final goods prices rose just 4.6% in November even as raw material costs spiked 74.6%.
Retailers, for instance, generally allow food suppliers to hike prices only when the cost of raw materials jumps 20-30%, said Takao Sekine, executive director at Food Marketing Research and Information Center, a Tokyo-based industry think tank.
Less than that and food companies are forced to resort to ""shrinkflation"", Sekine said, where they offset costs by making products smaller. 
Even companies selling directly to other businesses say they are careful about the size of their increases. 
Nippon Paper Industries Co Ltd, which accounts for around 40% of the domestic paper market excluding cardboard, is raising prices of some products by 5-15% in the next few months.
But it is limiting increases to products where it is a market leader, such as the ""gable-top"" cartons used by milk producers, according to spokesperson Tetsuo Egawa.
""It's hard for a company that's not a top player to be the first to raise prices,"" Egawa said.
TOUCHY TOPIC
Japanese companies often describe price hikes as something they do as a last resort when costs cannot be absorbed by corporate efforts - a euphemism for cost-cutting.
Sangetsu Corp raised prices of wallpaper, curtains and flooring materials by around 15% in September, which a spokesperson said was partly on behalf of the industry, to ensure other companies would be able to stay profitable.
Top stationery maker Kokuyo Co Ltd raised the price of scissors, staplers and other metal items by around 8% from Jan. 1, but it limited increases to fewer than one out of every six items in its stationery line-up.

""Our internal streamlining could no longer address the rise in steel prices,"" said Hideki Kubo, a spokesperson.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which assesses mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law, has put off a vote on  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s purchase of Aerojet Rocketdyne for as much as two weeks, two people briefed on the matter said.
The vote had initially been scheduled for midweek, one of the people said, adding that the extension would allow the FTC more time to evaluate terms for the merger. Aerojet shares were up more than 3% in after-market trading on Tuesday as investors viewed the delay as a positive sign that the deal would go through.
The people spoke on condition of anonymity. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the FTC declined comment.
The deal has drawn criticism because it would give Lockheed - the No. 1 defense contractor - a dominant position over a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry. Rocket motors are used in everything from the homeland defensive missile system to Stinger missiles. Missile maker Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) has been an outspoken opponent of the proposed deal.

The $4.4 billion deal announced in late 2020 is Lockheed's first large acquisition under new Chief Executive Jim Taiclet, and would reshape the competitive landscape for solid rocket fuel missiles which are used with jets and drones.
Aerojet develops and manufactures liquid and solid rocket propulsion, air-breathing hypersonic engines, and electric power and propulsion for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Its customers include the Pentagon, NASA, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), and the United Launch Alliance.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. airlines have come a long way since the spring of 2020 when COVID-19 brought the industry to its knees. Yet the pandemic will loom large when big carriers report quarterly earnings starting on Thursday.
The latest wave of the health crisis, driven by the highly contagious Omicron coronavirus variant, has caused havoc for a short-staffed industry. A multifold increase in daily sick calls as well as a series of winter storms have led to mass cancellation of flights.
For example, in one day alone, nearly one-third of United Airlines' workforce in Newark, New Jersey called in sick. The Chicago-based carrier has 3,000 employees who are currently infected with the virus.
Since Christmas Eve, U.S. airlines have canceled more than 30,600 flights, or about 7% of the scheduled total, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware - one of the biggest disruptions in recent years.
Until the Omicron variant began to take a toll on airline operations, the quarter through December was shaping up as the industry's strongest period in two years. 
The promising start prompted Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co last month to forecast a profit for the quarter. Both carriers had previously expected to report a loss.
Delta is due to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. Analysts on average expect the Atlanta-based carrier to post an adjusted profit of 15 cents a share, according to Refinitiv data.
Similarly, Wall Street expects Southwest's adjusted profit to come in at 9 cents a share on Jan. 27.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) on Tuesday forecast a smaller-than-expected fall in fourth-quarter revenue. Both American and United Airlines will report their results next week. 
SURGE IN SICK CALLS 
The virus-induced turmoil has dampened expectations of an upside earnings surprise.
Air travel demand tends to cool off in the first quarter, which should ease staffing needs of carriers. Still, their earnings could suffer if they struggle to run a smooth operation.
""If planes do not fly, airlines do not generate revenue,"" said Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrials materials and energy at research firm Third Bridge.
A spokesperson for JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp warned of additional cancellations until COVID-19 case counts start to come down. Most of the airline's crew members are based in the Northeastern United States where the Omicron variant is raging.
""Like many businesses and organizations, we have seen a surge in the number of sick calls from Omicron,"" JetBlue's spokesperson said.
The airline has cut its flight schedule through mid-January and is deploying team leaders and managers to staff frontline operations. It is also offering incentives for crew members not scheduled to work to pick up additional shifts and trips.
To mitigate the staffing issues, United Airlines is offering its pilots premium pay through the end of the month. Southwest, too, is offering pay incentives for operational employees through Jan. 25.
BUMP-UP IN COSTS 
All the incentives along with flight cancellations are expected to further inflate the industry's costs, which have gone up in the past year due to efforts to ramp up operations.
Until Omicron's onset, carriers were assuming that a rebound in business and international traffic would help mitigate the cost pressure and allow them to be profitable this year. 
They were all aggressively hiring pilots, flight attendants and airport staff to run more flights this spring and summer.
Surging COVID-19 cases, however, have called that assumption into question as they have brought in a new wave of border restrictions.
Last month, Delta said while it was still hopeful of a ""very strong"" summer over the transatlantic route, the Omicron variant could delay a recovery in international traffic by at least three months. The transatlantic route is one of the most lucrative ones in the world and accounted for up to 17% of 2019 passenger revenue for the major U.S. carriers.
The variant has also clouded the outlook for the industry's cash cow, business travel, as it has forced companies to further delay bringing their employees back to office.

Analysts at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) reckon the pandemic's impact on corporate travel is the biggest risk to the airline industry.
""The pandemic will continue to drive travel patterns, but we think it will have the biggest impact on corporate travel,"" the bank's analysts wrote in a note.

(Reuters) -World Wrestling Entertainment Inc was sued on Tuesday by a smaller rival that accused it of violating federal antitrust law by monopolizing the professional wrestling market.
MLW Media LLC accused WWE and its Chief Executive Vince McMahon of threatening content partners for doing business with MLW, to help protect its 85% share of the U.S. market for professional wrestling broadcasting rights.
The Mamaroneck, New York-based plaintiff said WWE's interference in 2021 caused Vice TV to end talks to air new MLW content, and led to a 40% drop in ticket sales after Fox Corp's Tubi streaming service abandoned a licensing agreement the night before it was to be publicly announced.
MLW also accused Stamford, Connecticut-based WWE of inducing MLW wrestlers to break exclusive contracts and airing MLW footage without permission, to combat a five-year decline in the popularity of its own programs.
WWE's ""pattern of predatory and exclusionary conduct"" reduces competition and irreparably harms consumers by depriving them of content and keeping prices high, MLW said.
""This anti-competitive behavior has to stop,"" MLW Chief Executive Court Bauer said in a statement.
The complaint was filed in San Francisco federal court.
In an emailed statement, WWE said it believed MLW's claims had no merit and that it intended to vigorously defend itself. McMahon was not named as a defendant.
MLW said U.S. television rights for two WWE programs, WWE Raw and WWE Smackdown, are worth $470 million.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified triple and other damages.

WWE shares closed Tuesday up 38 cents at $51.54. They have risen 9% in the last year, while the Russell 1000, which includes WWE, is up 21%.
The case is MLW Media LLC v World Wrestling (NYSE:WWE) Entertainment Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-00179.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its recommendations that people should isolate for five days after a COVID-19 infection, instead of 10.
A spokesperson for CVS said that the company is providing five days of paid leave for eligible full- and part-time workers, except where state or city paid leave laws provide for more. 
The company also added that paid leave is available only to employees who are vaccinated, approved for a reasonable accommodation, or otherwise covered by local laws. 
Walgreens said that it is providing COVID-19 paid leave benefits for five days to workers and after Feb. 23 will continue to provide the same benefit for five days to those who are fully vaccinated and test positive for COVID-19. 
Both the companies offered up to two weeks of paid leave earlier.
The company added that unvaccinated workers, who have an approved medical or religious exemption, also will continue to be eligible for the paid leave benefit.

Last week, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said workers in the United States will receive one week of paid leave instead of two, if in need of isolation or have tested positive for COVID-19.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said that the workers infected with the virus can receive up to 40 hours paid leave given the shorter period of isolation.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Wednesday morning, as investors digested the latest Chinese inflation data. Their U.S. equivalents also rose after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tackle inflation.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.22% by 9:01 PM ET (2:01 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.77%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) contracted 0.3% month-on-month while growing 1.5% year-on-year in December. The producer price index (PPI) grew 10.3% year-on-year.
U.S.-listed Chinese stocks were up, with the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index jumping as much as 4.7%. But Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its forecast for China’s growth in 2022 as the country deals with its latest COVID-19 outbreaks involving the omicron variant.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.56%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.72% and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.24%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.50%.
In his Senate Banking Committee hearing for a second term as Fed chairman, Powell said that the central bank would act if needed to contain high inflation, adding that the Fed will probably start asset tapering in 2022.
It has been a rocky start to 2022 as investors brace for interest rate hikes to curb soaring inflation.
“The market is grappling with a broad-based rotation and the potential for a hastened pace of rate hikes, which is leading to volatility,” UBS Private Wealth Management managing director Greg Marcus said in a note.
“Regardless of the volatility seen in markets so far this year, corporate fundamentals are strong, and we are expecting double-digit earnings growth this year, which should bode well for stock prices in 2022.”

Aeromexico said in a statement that the voting ended on 7 Jan. and 86% of the creditors who voted backed the plan.
""The conclusion of the voting process and the strong support from the company's creditors represents a key milestone in Aeromexico's restructuring process,"" the company said.
It also puts Aeromexico in a strong position to ""obtain Court approval for the plan"", the company added.

Shares in the Aeromexico, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States last year amid the pandemic, have been wildly seesawing in recent weeks amid speculation about its bankruptcy proceedings. 
A meeting of the company's shareholders is due to be held on Friday, where they will discuss the restructuring plan. The court is then due to consider confirming the plan on 27 Jan., Aeromexico said.

(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) on Tuesday launched the sale of shale gas properties stretching across 27,000 acres in the Appalachian basin of Ohio, the company confirmed, part of an ongoing divestiture of U.S. assets.
The top U.S. oil producer is marketing 61 wells that last year produced around 81 million cubic feet per day equivalent (mmcfd) of natural gas, according to a marketing document viewed by Reuters. The sale includes another 274 wells operated by other companies. 
A sale could value the assets at around $200 million based on current natural gas prices and existing production from the wells, a person familiar with the matter said.
""ExxonMobil is providing information to third parties that may have an interest in the assets, but no agreement has been reached and no buyer has been identified,"" said spokeswoman Sarah Nordin. Operations are continuing, she added. 
The company in 2020 took about a $20 billion writedown on properties, primarily purchased with subsidiary XTO Energy a decade earlier. It removed gas assets in Appalachia, the Rocky Mountains, Oklahoma, Texas and elsewhere from its development plan after the writedown.
The Ohio properties produced around 250 mmcfd of gas in 2017 and are among assets that Exxon put on the market as it focuses development in Guyana, offshore Brazil and Texas's Permian Basin shale field.

U.S. natural gas futures settled at $4.219 on Tuesday, up more than 80% since the end of 2020.
The company three years ago set a goal of raising $15 billion from asset sales, and last year accelerated its marketing efforts as energy prices recovered from the pandemic. (This story corrects natural gas settlement price to $4.219 from $2.249 in paragraph 7)

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 07:57PM ET</span>",Wall Street closes higher after Powell testimony eases investors' concerns,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes gained ground on Tuesday with Nasdaq leading the advance as investors were relieved that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress did not include any major surprises.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a congressional hearing that pointed to his likely confirmation for a second term in the job, said the U.S. central bank, was determined to ensure high inflation did not become ""entrenched."" 
But he added that rather than diminishing job growth, the Fed's tightening plans which include higher interest rates and a reduction in its asset holdings were necessary to maintain the economic expansion.
After falling just 1% earlier in the day, the interest rate sensitive technology sector bounced back and brought the broader indexes with it. Technology-laden Nasdaq closed up 1.4% marking its biggest daily gain so far this year.
Powell's comments likely reassured investors that the Fed was not going to prioritize inflation reduction above everything else, including employment, said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. 
""The initial concern was the Fed would upset the pace of the recovery,"" said Cruz. But the investor takeaway from Tuesday's testimony was that ""he's not just going to try and crush inflation"" without regarding ""the other effects that could have on the economy."" 
Investors had been selling stocks since Jan. 5 when December meeting minutes showed Fed officials discussing how ""very tight"" job market and unabated inflation might require interest rate hikes sooner than expected and a reduction of the Fed's overall asset holdings as a second brake on the economy.
While investors will anxiously watch inflation data due out on Wednesday, Cruz notes that they are already prepared for an elevated number with consensus forecasts for a 7% increase on a year-on-year basis for the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is seen rising by 5.4%, according to economists polled by Reuters. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 183.15 points, or 0.51%, to 36,252.02, the S&P 500 gained 42.78 points, or 0.92%, to 4,713.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 210.62 points, or 1.41%, to 15,153.45.
Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with growth-heavy sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and communications services contributing most to the S&P's gains. The biggest percentage gainer was energy, which finished up 3.4%, as crude oil futures rose. (OR) 
The S&P snapped a five-day slump, while the Nasdaq added to Monday's tiny gain. It had started the week with an afternoon comeback that strategists attributed to an influx of retail investors hunting for bargains after an early session sell-off. 
Marko Kolanovic, chief global markets strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), on Monday issued a research note calling the recent pull-back in riskier assets ""arguably overdone"" and calling it a buying opportunity. [nL1N2TQ2DY
Also on investor watchlists for this week is the unofficial start of the fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday, with big banks expected to show an uptick in quarterly core revenue thanks to new lending and firming Treasury yields. 
Vaccine maker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) finished down 5.3% after rising more than 9% on Monday.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine partner BioNTech also fell 6.2%. The World Health Organization said more research is needed to find out if existing COVID-19 vaccines provide adequate protection against the Omicron variant.
Pfizer closed up 0.8%. It said it was reducing its U.S. sales staff jobs as it expects doctors and other healthcare providers to want fewer face-to-face sales meetings after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.
Casino operator  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) Corp rose 6.6% after J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock to a ""overweight"" rating.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) fell 1.6% after UBS downgraded the stock to ""sell"" and slashed its price target.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 42 new highs and 108 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges 10.58 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.55 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

LG Energy Solution, which counts Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) as its customers, will buy 100,000 dry metric tonnes (DMT) of lithium spodumene — a key raw material for making electric vehicle batteries — from Liontown's Kathleen Valley project.
Liontown joins other lithium players in the country, like Vulcan Energy, to strike major supply deals with EV makers as the sector assumes centre stage amid a global push by companies and governments towards a greener future.
The company also said the deal — a first for its Western Australia-based project — will account for nearly 30% of its annual output after year one of production and is expected to be operating from 2024.

Liontown added that it had received ""strong interest from a range of parties in long-term offtake from the Kathleen Valley Lithium Project,"" without offering details.

Earlier on Tuesday, King Soopers, the largest grocery store chain in Colorado, had sweetened a wage offer to workers of UFCW Local 7 to $170 million calling it their ""last, best and final offer.""
This came after the union rejected several previous offers, including a $148 million investment in wages and signing bonuses over three years, last week.
""The company's last, best, and final offer, in many ways, is worse than its previous offers,"" Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, said in a statement. 
Cordova said the company's wage offer ""still doesn't cut it"" and retains many of its previously proposed concessions and adds new concessionary items. 
The union is seeking an increase in wages of at least $6 per hour for all workers. However, the company's ""last, best and final offer"" proposed raises of up to $4.50 per hour based on job classification and tenure, which was the same as its previous proposal.
While many terms of the new offer remain the same, a full-time checker with five years of experience will now get an annual compensation of over $47,000, compared with nearly $46,000 in the previous offer, or an additional 50 cents per hour in 2022, the proposal showed. 
""This offer not only puts more money in associates' pockets but if accepted, promises to bring stability to our associates and Coloradans who have endured enough uncertainty and disruption,"" the company said in a statement. 
UFCW Local 7 said that it will be out on the picket lines at 5 AM MT on Wednesday.

Over 8,700 UFCW Local 7 workers from 78 King Soopers stores are expected to participate in the strike, Cordova had previously said in a press briefing. 
King Soopers operates more than 100 stores in Colorado.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 06:40PM ET</span>","Bank of America, Wells Fargo scrap some overdraft fees as regulatory scrutiny grows","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) will no longer charge customers for bouncing checks and are adopting new policies to limit overdraft-related fees, the latest lenders to overhaul such charges amid growing regulatory scrutiny.
Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, said earlier on Tuesday it will reduce the fee it charges customers who overdraft accounts to $10 from $35 starting in May.
Both banks said they will stop charging customers a $35 non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee for bouncing checks or making other automated payments, and will eliminate the roughly $12 fees previously levied when customers used overdraft protection services.
Such fees have drawn the ire of U.S. lawmakers and the scrutiny of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The watchdog said last month it was exploring new guidance aimed at curbing banks' reliance on overdraft and NSF fees, which have ballooned, generating an estimated $69 billion for banks in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $15 billion for the whole of 2019.
Bank of America has been in discussions with the CFPB regarding the new policy, which it received ""in a positive fashion,"" said Holly O'Neill, the bank's president of retail banking, in an interview.
Wells Fargo's Consumer and Small Business Banking CEO Mary Mack said in an interview the bank had taken its actions after studying customer spending data.
In addition to waiving certain fees, Wells will give customers who overdraw their accounts 24 hours to bring the balance above $0 before charging them a $35 fee, and it will begin giving customers who receive direct deposits access to those funds up to two days earlier than current practice.
These changes follow similar moves made late last year when  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) said it was eliminating all overdraft and NSF fees, and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) said it would give customers more leeway on overdrafts before charging fees.
Unlike some lenders, Bank of America decided not to eliminate overdrafts entirely or cut fees to zero.
""Eliminating overdraft altogether is not really what clients want,"" O'Neill said, citing the bank's conversations with community advisory groups.
O'Neill expects more banks to offer access to overdraft with a minimal fee. ""If you take the fee to zero, it is going to be very hard for banks to allow clients even that occasional access,"" she said.

Bank of America does not break out revenue from overdraft and related fees, but estimated on Tuesday that they made up 1% of revenue in 2021. 
The changes, coupled with others over the past 12 years, including stopping debit card overdraft charges at point of sale and offering low-cost, short-term loan coverage, have reduced overdraft fee revenue by 97% from 2009, it added.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 06:30PM ET</span>",GM challenges Carvana with CarBravo online used car marketplace,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co said it will launch an online used vehicle market called CarBravo that will allow the automaker and its dealers to challenge  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA),  CarMax Inc  (NYSE:KMX) and others profiting from selling secondhand vehicles.
GM's CarBravo site will aggregate vehicles owned by Chevrolet, Buick and GMC dealers, as well as cars and trucks that GM Financial, the automaker's consumer finance arm, controls after taking them back from rental car agencies or vehicle leases. GM officials said the company's dealers have about 400,000 used vehicles in stock.
GM said CarBravo will launch to consumers this spring.
About 40 million used vehicles are sold annually in the United States, more than twice the number of new cars and trucks. Auto manufacturers are largely removed from the profits from those sales, as well as information about customers and the opportunity to sell recurring revenue services such as satellite radio subscriptions.
The price of used cars has skyrocketed during the pandemic due to lack of new inventory in the wake of supply-chain constraints.
Online used-car marketplace Carvana, with a market value of $34 billion, filled the e-commerce space left open by automakers and most traditional dealers, offering consumers a way to shop for a wide range of used vehicles from multiple brands, and get their purchase delivered at home. Now, GM is joining auto retail chains such as AutoNation (NYSE:AN) in setting up online used vehicle marketplaces to counter Carvana, whose shares have fallen nearly 50% from their 52-week high.
Steve Carlisle, head of GM's North American operations, said on Tuesday that CarBravo could outsell Carvana because of the supply of vehicles that GM and its dealers control.
""We think we stack up pretty well against anyone else out there,"" Carlisle said.

Carvana in a statement on Tuesday did not address GM's move directly, but underscored that it ""pioneered online car buying"" and has bought and sold over 1 million vehicles. 
CarMax Chief Marketing Officer Jim Lyski said in a statement, ""While we are still learning about the newly announced service from GM, what they have set out to do is difficult.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A new Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) brewery to be built in the Mexican state of Veracruz, announced after a dispute over water stymied plans for a plant on the northern border, could spark $2.6 billion in investment, a government official said.
The plant in the Gulf coast state is part of a previously announced $5 billion to $5.5 billion investment in Mexico through 2026 by the U.S. maker of beer, wine and spirits.
Constellation Brands plans to initially invest $1.3 billion in the brewery, Enrique Nachon, Veracruz's economic and port development minister, said in an interview late on Monday.
Veracruz hopes the company could double that sum, by either upping production once the plant is completed or investing locally in bottling and infrastructure to export goods, Nachon added.
""We're pushing for both these investments to stay in Veracruz, that is, $2.6 billion through 2026,"" he told Reuters, adding that the state government has been in regular contact with the company.
The brewery's construction will employ up to 2,000 directly and 12,000 indirectly. Once operating, the plant will create up to 750 jobs directly and 4,000 indirectly, Nachon said.
""We continue to work with federal and state government officials in Mexico on plans for a new brewery in ... Veracruz, where the government is trying to drive investment, in a suitable location with ample supply of water and a capable workforce,"" Constellation said in an email.
Constellation had previously spent around $666 million constructing a brewery in the arid state of Baja California. It was called off after residents concerned about water use rejected it in a referendum encouraged by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Nachon did not confirm previous comments by a government official that the new plant would be built by one of Veracruz's central rivers, the Rio Papaloapan.

He said the plant will use underground water sources, and that Constellation has so far looked at 27 plots of land. 
The brewery's exact location would be revealed in a joint announcement from Constellation Brands and Lopez Obrador, Nachon said.

Facebook, now Meta Platforms, had asked Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C. federal court to dismiss the lawsuit in which the government asked the court to demand that Facebook sell Instagram and WhatsApp. 
The FTC's high-profile legal fight with Facebook represents one of the biggest challenges the government has brought against a tech company in decades, and is being closely watched as Washington aims to tackle Big Tech's extensive market power.
""Ultimately, whether the FTC will be able to prove its case and prevail at summary judgment and trial is anyone's guess. The Court declines to engage in such speculation and simply concludes that at this motion-to-dismiss stage, where the FTC's allegations are treated as true, the agency has stated a plausible claim for relief,"" wrote Boasberg.
The FTC originally sued Facebook during the former Trump administration, and its complaint was rejected by the court. The agency filed an amended complaint in August, adding more detail on the accusation the social media company crushed or bought rivals and once again asking a judge to force the company to sell photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp.
Meta shares rose 1.9% on Tuesday, closing at $334.37.
In his ruling denying dismissal, the judge, however, said that the FTC could not press allegations that Facebook refused to allow interoperability permissions with competing apps as a way to maintain its dominance, saying the policies had been abandoned in 2018 and Facebook's most recent enforcement of the policy was even older.
Meta said that it was confident the company would prevail in court.
""Today's decision narrows the scope of the FTC's case by rejecting claims about our platform policies. It also acknowledges that the agency faces a 'tall task' proving its case regarding two acquisitions it cleared years ago,"" a spokesperson said in an email statement.

But Boasberg agreed with the FTC that Chair Lina Khan, who voted to file the amended complaint against Facebook, should not have been forced to recuse herself, saying that her role was less of a judge and more like a prosecutor. 
""Although Khan has undoubtedly expressed views about Facebook's monopoly power, these views do not suggest the type of 'axe to grind' based on personal animosity or financial conflict of interest that has disqualified prosecutors in the past,"" wrote Boasberg.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -The U.S. National Labor Relations Board said on Tuesday that it will send unionization ballots to workers at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, on Feb. 4, setting the stage for the next labor contest facing the online retailer.
Votes in the mail-ballot election, which is a re-run after the NLRB found Amazon interfered last year, will be counted starting on March 28, according to a notice published by the NLRB. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) has been seeking to represent the workers.
Scrutiny of working conditions at Amazon has intensified in recent months, with some employees seeking to organize at facilities in New York and Canada. A victory at even one warehouse would be a milestone that labor experts say could invigorate the U.S. labor movement.
In a statement, Amazon spokeswoman Barbara Agrait said: “Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU last year. We look forward to our team in (the warehouse) having their voices heard again.”
In last year's count, workers at the Bessemer warehouse rejected forming a union by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The organizing drive had garnered support from U.S. lawmakers and President Joe Biden.
Then in August, an NLRB hearing officer determined the company had interfered with the vote. As examples, the officer said workers may have felt they were being surveilled when dropping ballots in a mailbox on Amazon's property that the company encouraged them to use. Amazon also put a campaign slogan around the mailbox. An NLRB regional director, Lisa Henderson, officially called for a re-run in November.

In an order accompanying Tuesday's election notice from the NLRB, Henderson said that same mailbox would be in a ""neutral location"" on Amazon's property for the forthcoming vote and that no party could put a banner around it or issue a directive on its use.
The RWDSU said it was still worried about Amazon ""continuing its objectionable behavior in a new election"". It said it was especially concerned that same mailbox will remain on Amazon’s property for voting, which it believes will create an impression of surveillance that undermines a free and fair election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -United Airlines said on Tuesday that about 4% of its U.S. employees, or about 3,000 workers, have tested positive for COVID-19 but vaccinated employees had neither died nor recently been hospitalized with the disease.
United's disclosure comes amid soaring cases https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb and continuing debate about U.S. vaccine mandates https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-wants-us-agencies-mandate-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated-employees-by-feb-2022-01-11. On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-considers-whether-halt-biden-vaccine-mandates-2022-01-07 to challenges to President Joe Biden's vaccine or testing mandate for companies with more than 100 employees.
COVID-19 cases and quarantines are impacting staffing and hitting flight schedules. U.S. airlines have cancelled more than 30,000 flights since late December over weather and COVID-19 staffing issues.
United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said on Tuesday the airline was ""reducing our near-term schedules to make sure we have the staffing and resources to take care of customers.""
United canceled 149 flights on Tuesday, or 7% of its flights, according to FlightAware.com. 
Chicago-based United was the first U.S. carrier to mandate vaccines for its employees in order to facilitate travel and flight operations.
Kirby said ""the Omicron surge has put a strain on our operation ... Just as an example, in one day alone at Newark, nearly one-third of our workforce called out sick."" 
Kirby said in a memo on Tuesday that ""since our vaccine policy went into effect, the hospitalization rate among our employees has been 100x lower than the general population in the U.S.""
Before United's vaccination requirements were put in place, ""tragically, more than one United employee on average *per week* was dying from COVID,"" Kirby said. ""But we’ve now gone eight straight weeks with zero COVID-related deaths among our vaccinated employees.""
He added: ""While we have about 3,000 employees who are currently positive for COVID, zero of our vaccinated employees are currently hospitalized."" 
United’s prior experience and nationwide COVID data suggests ""there are approximately 8-10 United employees who are alive today because of our vaccine requirement,"" said Kirby.
Last month, Kirby defended the airline's vaccine mandate decision in the face of Republican criticism.
""We did this for safety,"" Kirby said at a U.S. Senate hearing. ""We don't compromise on safety.
Kirby said last month about 200 employees did not comply with United's mandate and were fired out of its 67,000 employees.
Rival American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said on Friday that more than 96% of its employees have submitted proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a request for an accommodation. 

Last month, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to soften quarantine guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals who experience breakthrough COVID-19 infections, warning the long quarantines may ""significantly impact our workforce and operations."" Other airlines followed Delta's request.
The CDC last month agreed to shorten the recommended isolation time to five days from the previous guidance of 10 days.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Tuesday, led by energy and tech after U.S. bond yields fell following as less hawkish-than-expected from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell calmed fears of aggressive Fed policy tightening. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, or 183 points, the Nasdaq added 1.4%.
Powell confirmed the Fed plans to begin normalizing policy including ending bond purchases, hiking rates, and letting bonds on its balance sheet mature later this year.
“I would expect that this year 2022 will be the year in which we take steps toward normalization [of monetary policy],” Powell said.
That would involve “ending asset purchases in March, raising rates over the course of the year  … and “perhaps later this year, we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off.”
Surging Treasury yields, which had weighed on growth sectors of the market like tech, took a breather, supported the rebound in tech pushing the broader market higher.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), formerly know as Facebook, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which make up about a quarter of the S&P 500.
The recent pullback in tech was linked to “the fear of a Fed being more hawkish and more aggressive in its policies going forward … but Powell calmed the markets in his hearing,”  Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday.
“The most powerful lever the Fed has to pull on right now is starting to shrink its balance sheet by selling bonds,” Schuringa added. ""But Powell backed away from that, saying we're going to let our balance sheet roll off … that’s not as disruptive in the market as selling bonds."" 
Semiconductors continued to pare recent losses, up nearly 2%, following a 5% jump in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) after KeyBanc upgraded its rating on the stock to overweight from sector weight, citing cloud data center growth in 2022.
Energy was also among the top gainers on the day, as oil prices moved higher on expectations that the demand impact from the omicron impact may not be as severe as initially feared.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Hess (NYSE:HES) and APA (NASDAQ:APA), led the energy sector move higher, with the latter up more than 8%.
In a potential sign of renewed appetite for risk assets, defensive corners of the market such as utilities and consumer staples were on the back foot.
The rally in the broader market comes a day ahead of the inflation report due Wednesday, the U.S. is expected to report its fastest pace of inflation since 1982. 
""The risk to the market is to the downside ahead of inflation report because I think the probability is CPI comes in hotter than expected, according to Schuringa. ""If inflation is much hotter,  there's going to be [renewed] pressure for the Fed to act."""

The Boots business has over 2,200 stores across the UK, which include pharmacies, health and beauty stores, among others, according to the chain's website.
""This review is very much in line with our renewed priorities and strategic direction. In particular, our increased focus on U.S. healthcare. While the process is at an exploratory stage, we do expect to move quickly,"" Brewer said at the J.P Morgan Healthcare Conference.
The review comes at a time when the company, which was formed in 2014 after the acquisition of stake in Alliance Boots by Walgreens, moves beyond its drugstores with its investments in two smaller healthcare providers, CareCentrix and VillageMD. 

Late last year, Walgreens also launched its Walgreens Health unit to provide pharmacy and primary care services in stores, at home, or at a doctor's office and via mobile app.
Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales increased 8.8% in the quarter ended November due to increased footfalls.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks bounced and Treasury yields retreated on Tuesday in choppy trade as investors absorbed remarks from the Federal Reserve that interest rates are likely to rise this year, as expected.
In comments to U.S. lawmakers, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he expected the Fed would raise rates and end its asset purchases this year, but that the central bank had made no decision about the timing for tightening monetary policy.
""Inflation is running very far above target. The economy no longer needs or wants the very accommodative policies we have had in place,"" Powell said in his testimony.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.51%, the S&P 500 added 0.92%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.41%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.84% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.94%. 
""Comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell reassured investors that the Fed is prepared to tighten monetary policy to maintain price stability,"" analysts at Australia's ANZ Bank said in a note.
Inflation pressures prompted the Fed in December to flag plans to tighten policy faster than expected, possibly even raising rates in March, though that was before it became clear just how fast the Omicron coronavirus variant would spread. 
Some investors were relieved that the Fed did not sound more hawkish than the market had anticipated, and this helped Treasury yields pull back a touch from two-year highs struck earlier.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields retreated to 1.741%, after hitting an almost two-year high above 1.8% overnight. 
Two-year Treasury yields, which are highly sensitive to interest rates, dipped to 0.8966%, down from a high of 0.945% last seen in February 2020. [US/] 
The recovery in risk appetites weighed on the dollar. The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.34% to 95.614. A softer dollar lifted the euro up 0.3% to $1.13670. [USD/]
The weaker dollar benefited bullion, and spot gold added 1.2% to $1,822.75 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 1.34% to $1,822.50 an ounce. [GOL/]
U.S. December consumer inflation data will be released on Wednesday with headline CPI expected to hit a red-hot 7% year- on-year, boosting the case for rates to rise sooner rather than later.

""We continue to believe liftoff in March is increasingly likely. How these debates are settled will likely have implications for post-liftoff rate hikes,"" Nomura economists said in a report, referring to U.S. monetary policy.
""In particular, we believe comments regarding earlier runoff and less aggressive rate hikes support our view that the Fed will slow the pace of rate hikes to two per year in 2023.""
Oil rose to nearly $82 a barrel, supported by tight supply and hopes that rising coronavirus cases and the spread of the Omicron variant would not derail a global demand recovery.

U.S. crude recently rose 3.82% to $81.22 per barrel and Brent was at $83.72, up 3.52% on the day.
Stronger risk appetites supported bitcoin, which rose 2.1% to $42,722.21, after dropping below $40,000 the previous day for the first time since September.

Investing.com -- Stocks reversed yet again on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell wasn’t as aggressive about monetary policy as people thought he would be.
Technology stocks jumped after Powell said the central bank didn’t aim to undermine strong employment trends.
The Fed will begin removing some of the massive stimulus it unleashed on the economy to support it for the duration of the pandemic. Even though the virus hasn’t left us, the economic recovery has progress to where the Fed now forecasts three rate hikes this year.
Some private economists see the possibility of four rate increases this year. The Fed is also going to scale back the size of its bond purchases and the number of bonds it holds on its balance sheet.
Tech stocks have sold off in recent days out of fear the Fed would act too swiftly after the Fed’s meeting minutes from December focused on rising inflationary pressure.
On Wednesday, the government releases consumer price index readings from the latest month, with analysts expecting it to be 7% over last year.
And then later this week, earnings kick off with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing on Thursday and several big banks on Friday. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. FANG bragging rights
Which company is the best FANG stock this year? Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Analyst Justin Post told investors in a note on Monday that they expect several headwinds to ease for Amazon, and they have an outlook for ""strong growth and margin expansion in 2023-2025 following a massive infrastructure investment cycle.""
2. Netflix outlook
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is seen beating estimates when it reports fourth quarter earnings next week, according to Moness Crespi analyst Brian White. Analysts will be focused on growth in streaming, but the analyst believes the company should put that measurement aside. Stay tuned. 
3. GM selling used cars
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is rolling out an online used vehicle dealership, because used cars have been such a hot market during the pandemic. The site is expected to launch in the spring and will offer GM and non-GM vehicles. 
It will directly compete with companies such as  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA) and CarMax (NYSE:KMX). With used cars making up a significant portion of vehicle sales, and more customers wanting to buy vehicles online, automakers are moving into the online market space. Ford announced the launch of its used car marketplace last year.

(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it is reducing its U.S. sales staff as it expects doctors and other healthcare providers to want fewer face-to-face interactions with sales people after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.
The move comes as the company is expected to announce more than $80 billion in revenue in 2021 on strong sales of the COVID-19 vaccine it developed with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). That would be record sales for a pharmaceutical company, according to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Chief Executive Albert Bourla.
""We are evolving into a more focused and innovative biopharma company, and evolving the way we engage with healthcare professionals in an increasingly digital world,"" the company said in a statement.
""There will be some changes to our workforce to ensure we have the right expertise and resources in place to meet our evolving needs."" 
The company did not specify how many sales jobs it was cutting.
A source familiar with the matter said Pfizer was eliminating a few hundred positions. The company also plans to create new positions in different areas for around half those jobs, the source said. 
According to a document seen by Reuters, Pfizer believes that doctors and other healthcare professionals will want around half of their interactions with drug companies to be remote in the future.
Pfizer's revenue is expected to climb even higher this year and is projected to top $100 billion, according to analyst estimates.

Around half of the company's 2022 sales are expected to come from the COVID-19 vaccine and its new oral COVID-19 treatment, Paxlovid.
The vaccine and Paxlovid are being sold directly to governments in the near-term.

(Reuters) - U.S. companies ranging from American Eagle to United Airlines are set for a tepid start to the year as the fast-spreading Omicron variant threatens to slow the fragile rebound in growth by exacerbating supply chain problems and labor shortages.
The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines and easing of restrictions last year had promised to be a boon for companies looking to recover from the heavy toll that the pandemic had taken on them.
But the fast and relentless surge of Omicron-related infections has once again put sales and profits of companies under pressure. 
Staffing, customer traffic and store operating hours have been hampered as the daily infections in the United States touched 1.35 million, the highest in the world. 
The first signs of its impact on Corporate America is the hit to sales over the recent weeks seen by companies such as  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO), Abercrombie & Fitch and  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU).
""Time to perhaps buckle your seat-belts as a bumpy end to the fourth quarter and uncertainty surrounding supply chain and anniversarying stimulus impacts in the first quarter are likely to make the next few months volatile,"" MKM Partners analyst Roxanne Meyer said.
The U.S. travel industry, a sector that has barely been able to get back on its feet, too has been jolted by staff shortages forcing cancellations of flights and cruises during the crucial holiday.

American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc expects cost per available seat mile to be up 13% to 14% compared to pre-pandemic levels, while United Airlines said it was reducing near-term flight schedules as about 3,000 employees have tested positive for COVID-19.
However, some companies have stood to benefit. Pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) raised its 2021 profit view on expectations of higher demand for COVID-19 vaccines and over-the-counter testing, while  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) expects sales of its COVID-19 tests to stay strong in the near term.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Star stock picker Cathie Wood of ARK Invest doubled down on her bet that deflation, rather than inflation, will be the largest factor in the U.S. economy in the year ahead in a webinar on Tuesday.
Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar in 2020 before plummeting to among the worst performers of 2021, pushed back against the idea that companies in her portfolio such as  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc were simply beneficiaries of the economic lockdowns at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. 
""They are not stay-at-home stocks, they are stay connected stocks,"" she said. 
Zoom, for instance, should ""have stunning growth rates ahead"" while Teladoc will become the ""backbone"" of the U.S. healthcare system, she said. 
Inflation, meanwhile, will fall this year as supply chain bottlenecks ease and companies no longer feel the need to put in double or triple orders for goods, Wood predicted. At the same time, technology will continue to push down prices of goods and services, she said. 
""Companies are learning how powerful technology can be on holding the line on costs,"" Wood said.

The company said it now expects revenue for the quarter to be down about 17% versus pre-pandemic levels, compared with its prior forecast of an about 20% fall.
A rise in COVID-19 infections of the Omicron variant has forced airlines to cancel flights as pilots and cabin crew fell sick and needed to quarantine. 
Mass cancellations over the Christmas and New Year holiday period and higher incentives given to employees had an impact on carriers, with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) forecasting higher fourth-quarter costs.
The company expects cost per available seat mile excluding items - the measure in the industry showing what it costs to fly one seat one mile - to be up between 13% and 14% versus 2019, compared with its previous guidance of a rise of between 8% and 10%.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 01:11PM ET</span>","KKR's bid target TIM close to decision on new CEO, sources say","By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) is moving closer to appointing a new chief executive, with General Manager Pietro Labriola tipped as frontrunner, four sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
TIM, which faces a 10.8 billion euro ($12.24 billion) takeover approach from U.S. private equity investor KKR, has been without a CEO since November when Luigi Gubitosi stepped down following a string of profit warnings.
TIM Chairman Salvatore Rossi has called a board meeting on Jan. 21 to appoint a new CEO after a group of five directors, including representatives of TIM's top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), asked him to speed up the process, one of the sources said.
Labriola, a veteran TIM executive and the current CEO of TIM's Brazilian operations, is drawing up a new three-year business plan to relaunch the group as a standalone business.
""Labriola is a plug-and-play solution and I don't see any concrete rival to him,"" said a senior manager at  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
Debt-laden TIM has been under pressure for years due to fierce price competition in its domestic market. Its strained finances hamper investments to upgrade its network in line with Italy's digital plans. 
The business plan includes a possible spin-off of TIM's assets, including its prized fixed network infrastructure, sources have previously said.
Labriola, who has the backing of Vivendi, is set to present an outline of the plan to directors on January 18 in what would mark a major step towards winning over TIM's second biggest shareholder, state lender CDP, and independent board members. 
Labriola's plan, which will provide a benchmark to measure TIM's value, is a key element for TIM's response to KKR's proposal, which is conditional on backing by TIM's board and Italy's government.
French media group Vivendi, which owns 24% of TIM, has said KKR's offer does not properly reflect the value of the company.
Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) and Vitale&Co are working with TIM on the business plan. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and LionTree are helping TIM to study KKR's bid and possible alternatives.
CDP recently renewed a call for TIM to rekindle a stalled project to merge its network with that of fibre optic rival Open Fiber, which is 60% owned by CDP itself.
Vivendi has said it is open to handing control of TIM’s fixed network to the Italian state as part of a project led by Italian institutions, in a sign it may be interested in pursuing an alternative plan to KKR’s.

KKR's proposal also entails the separation of TIM's network assets whose oversight would be entrusted to CDP.

The pizza chain said it will cut the number of chicken wings in its $7.99 carryout offer to eight pieces from 10 pieces, the first of a few changes the company is making to counter higher labor costs and prices of meats, cheese, and some grains.
""We expect unprecedented increases in our food basket costs (for fiscal 2022) versus 2021 of 8% to 10%, which is 3 to 4x what we might normally see in a year,"" Chief Executive Officer Richard Allison said at ICR Conference.

Domino's is also moving the offer to only its online sales channel as it could cut costs by not having its workers answer the phones.
Global supply-chain bottlenecks have driven up costs of ingredients, forcing U.S. restaurants to increase prices, while they have also had to pay their workers more to keep them from leaving for higher-paying jobs.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 12:38PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Smart guns finally arriving in U.S., seeking to shake up firearms market","By Daniel Trotta
(Reuters) - Personalized smart guns, which can be fired only by verified users, may finally become available to U.S. consumers after two decades of questions about reliability and concerns they will usher in a new wave of government regulation.
Four-year-old LodeStar Works on Friday unveiled its 9mm smart handgun for shareholders and investors in Boise, Idaho. And a Kansas company, SmartGunz LLC, says law enforcement agents are beta testing its product, a similar but simpler model.
Both companies hope to have a product commercially available this year.
LodeStar co-founder Gareth Glaser said he was inspired after hearing one too many stories about children shot while playing with an unattended gun. Smart guns could stop such tragedies by using technology to authenticate a user's identity and disable the gun should anyone else try to fire it. 
They could also reduce suicides, render lost or stolen guns useless, and offer safety for police officers and jail guards who fear gun grabs. 
But attempts to develop smart guns have stalled: Smith & Wesson got hit with a boycott, a German company's product was hacked, and a New Jersey law aimed at promoting smart guns has raised the wrath of defenders of the Second Amendment.
The LodeStar gun, aimed at first-time buyers, would retail for $895.
The test-firing of the LodeStar gun before Reuters cameras has not been reported elsewhere. A range officer fired the weapon, a third-generation prototype, in its different settings without issue.
Glaser acknowledged there will be additional challenges to large-scale manufacturing, but expressed confidence that after years of trial and error the technology was advanced enough and the microelectronics inside the gun are well-protected.
""We finally feel like we're at the point where ... let's go public,"" Glaser said. ""We're there.""
Most early smart gun prototypes used either fingerprint unlocking or radio frequency identification technology that enables the gun to fire only when a chip in the gun communicates with another chip worn by the user in a ring or bracelet.
LodeStar integrated both a fingerprint reader and a near-field communication chip activated by a phone app, plus a PIN pad. The gun can be authorized for more than one user.
The fingerprint reader unlocks the gun in microseconds, but since it may not work when wet or in other adverse conditions, the PIN pad is there as a backup. LodeStar did not demonstrate the near-field communication signal, but it would act as a secondary backup, enabling the gun as quickly as users can open the app on their phones.
SmartGunz would not say which law enforcement agencies are testing its weapons, which are secured by radio frequency identification. SmartGunz developed a model selling at $1,795 for law enforcement and $2,195 for civilians, said Tom Holland, a Kansas Democratic state senator who co-founded the company in 2020.
Colorado-based Biofire is developing a smart gun with a fingerprint reader.
Skeptics have argued that smart guns are too risky for a person trying to protect a home or family during a crisis, or for police in the field.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the firearms industry trade association, says it does not oppose smart guns as long as the government doesn't mandate their sale.
""If I had a nickel for every time in my career I heard somebody say they're about to bring us a so-called smart gun on the market, I'd probably be retired now,"" said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the NSSF.
Guns coming to market could trigger a 2019 New Jersey law requiring all gun shops in the state to offer smart guns after they become available. The 2019 law replaced a 2002 law that would have banned the sale of any handgun except smart guns. 
""The other side tipped their hand because they used smart guns to ban everything that's not a smart gun,"" said Scott Bach, executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs. ""It woke gun owners up.""

When Smith & Wesson pledged in 1999 to promote smart gun development, among other gun safety measures in an agreement with the U.S. government, the National Rifle Association sponsored a boycott that led to a drop in revenue.
In 2014, German company Armatix put a smart .22 caliber pistol on the market, but it was pulled from stores after hackers discovered a way to remotely jam the gun's radio signals and, using magnets, fire the gun when it should have been locked.

Investing.com — Moness Crespi analyst Brian White told investors in a research note Monday that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) will beat its fourth-quarter earnings estimates.
""This story has a long runway of growth in coming years,"" White was quoted as saying by StreetInsider. The analyst reiterated a buy rating and a $730 price target on the stock. 
White added: “Given Wall Street’s concerns that Netflix will fall short of its 4Q:21 paid global streaming net add guidance of 8.50 million, we believe it is timely for the company to consider shelving this metric altogether, one that was useful in the younger days of the service but has since become more of burden than a benefit.”
While Netflix shares initially rose Tuesday, it has been unable to sustain any upside momentum and is currently flat on the day. 
Elsewhere, Tuesday saw KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson lower his firm's price target on Netflix shares to $620 from $725 to reflect his lower estimates. However, the analyst maintained an overweight rating.
Netflix's next earnings report is set to be released next week.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms has delayed its U.S. office reopening date and mandated COVID-19 booster shots for employees returning to office, joining the growing list of companies revamping reopening plans as Omicron surges.
For employees who opt to work from office, the reopening date has been delayed to March 28 from the earlier plan of Jan. 31, the tech giant said on Monday.
All workers returning to office will have to present proof of their booster jabs, while the company closely monitors the Omicron variant situation, it said. Meta currently requires all its U.S. employees coming to office to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. 
Employees have until March 14 to decide whether to return to the office, request to work remotely full time or request to work from home temporarily.
Employees who are not vaccinated for medical or religious reasons can request such remote work, a spokesperson said. ""Employees who take no action can face disciplinary measures, including termination. Obviously, this would be a last resort,"" the spokesperson said by email.
Corporate America has doubled down on vaccination mandates and delayed back-to-office plans as the Omicron variant drives up infections to record levels across the country.

Last week, Citigroup said its U.S. staff who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 14 will be placed on unpaid leave and fired at the end of the month unless granted an exemption.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 12:07PM ET</span>",Boeing wins annual jet order race on adjusted basis,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co bounced back to win the traditional annual order race against Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) on an adjusted basis, but its European rival remained the world's largest planemaker based on the number of jets delivered, data showed on Tuesday.
Shares in Boeing rose around 2% after the closely watched data showed it ended 2021 with 535 net orders after cancellations and conversions that were partially offset by regular accounting adjustments. Gross orders were 909.
Excluding the upward accounting adjustments, which reflect a more positive view from Boeing on airlines' ability to take delivery, Boeing fell behind its rival with 479 orders. 
Airbus sold 771 airplanes in 2021, giving a net total of 507 after cancellations, almost twice its 2020 level.
After slashing production due mainly to the pandemic, planemakers are seeing more demand for medium-haul passenger jets and freighters, despite global concern over Omicron.
Boeing largely met analyst expectations on aircraft deliveries, handing over a total of 340 aircraft to customers in 2021, up from 157 in 2020, but down from 380 in 2019 and a record 806 jets in 2018. 
Its 2021 numbers include a severely depressed delivery tally of 14 787 Dreamliner twin-aisles - compared to 41 in 2020 - as intensive inspections over production flaws compounded delays from the COVID-19 crisis. 
By comparison, Airbus delivered 611 jets in 2021, retaining its crown as the world's largest jetmaker for the third year running. 
In December, the latest data showed Boeing delivered 38 planes to customers, including 32 of its 737 MAX jets, one P-8 maritime patrol aircraft to Norway, and five widebodies. 
Boeing had 79 net orders for aircraft in December, after cancellations and instances where a buyer converted an order for one type of aircraft to another. That included an order for 50 737 MAX airplanes from Allegiant Air, seven jets for an unspecified customer, 19 767 freighters for  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), and four 777 freighters for Atlas Air (NASDAQ:AAWW).

Boeing continues to dominate booming sales of freighters as lockdowns boost e-shopping. It notched 84 orders for new production freighters, surpassing its previous record of 83 set in 2018.
Airbus for its part booked the first orders for a new A350 freighter - albeit partially by swapping existing orders for passenger versions to the cargo planes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank stocks have rallied in recent weeks, but a pick-up in hedging on a key financial sector exchange-traded fund may be a sign that investors are wary of earnings season volatility, options market experts said.
With big banks like JP Morgan,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) set to kick off earnings season on Friday, the one-month moving average of open put options on the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund outnumbers open calls by a factor of nearly 1.9. 
That's the most bearish ratio for the $48 billion financial ETF ahead of quarterly results since banks reported earnings for the first quarter of 2020, a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data showed. Put options are typically used to protect against price declines, while calls are often used to bet on price gains.
Expectations of higher yields and new lending, as well as a shift from growth stocks to economically-sensitive, comparatively cheap names, have driven the S&P 500 Financials sector up 5.05% through Monday, its best start to the year since 2012.
The bearish options positioning likely reflects investors protecting profits in the sector. Some of the larger bank stocks have been notoriously volatile around earnings season, said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) shares, for instance, have slipped for five straight quarters on the day it reported results. Shares of Citi and Wells Fargo have declined on earnings day in 6 of the last 8 quarters.
""I really don't like being long this stuff into earnings. It presents a lot of downside gap risk,"" Feygin said.
The relative rise in put options comes on the heels of big inflows into the sector. 
The XLF fund drew $2.15 billion dollars in December, its best month since May, helping lift 2021's net inflows to a record $9.64 billion. The fund rose 32% last year - same as the S&P banks index - compared with the S&P 500 Index's 27% rise. 
Broadly speaking, the picture for bank results is likely to be positive and analysts anticipate executives will sound an optimistic note on the outlook for core earnings.

""The rally in financials makes a lot of sense because banks that make their money in corporate or mortgage lending benefit from a steeper yield curve, while those banks and brokers with clearing operations benefit from higher short term rates,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR).
""We've gotten both, but the speed of the move inspires some suspicion, and thus the hedging,"" he said.

The air freight market has been a rare bright spot for airlines over the past two years, with rates rising due to an online shopping surge and pandemic-linked supply chain disruptions driving demand for cargo space.
""For us, Ethiopian Airlines, the cargo business is strong and I would say is a breadwinner in the group,"" CEO Tewolde Gebremariam told a Dubai conference by videolink.
The airline, which he said managed the pandemic with its own finances and without bailouts, is operating close to 70% of its pre-pandemic capacity, and had given staff pay rises and bonuses.
""We are cash-positive. We are profitable.""
While demand for passenger travel is improving year-on-year, with 2022 expected to be better for airlines than 2021, Gebremariam cautioned the industry was still far from a full recovery from the crisis.
Gebremariam criticised what he called the ""fragmented, uncoordinated"" responses by governments around the world to the pandemic, which he blamed for creating bottle necks and the slow recovery in passenger travel.
He also singled out Dubai of the United Arab Emirates, the Middle East travel hub, which has banned those who have recently been in Ethiopia and 13 other African countries from entering or transiting.

Ethiopian Airlines had not flown passengers to Dubai in 3-4 weeks, Gebremariam said.

The funding round was led by Sequoia. Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia, will join the board of Citadel Securities, the company said.
The two-decade old company provides trading services to asset managers, banks, broker-dealers and hedge funds. Its institutional business serves over 1,600 clients.
The Chicago-based company has benefited from a surge in trading activity, helped in part by retail investors flocking to popular mobile trading apps since the pandemic began.
Citadel Securities was subjected to a close scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and regulators, after  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and several other brokers restricted trading in shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) in January last year.
The restrictions, which drew the ire of some retail investors, followed a stunning rally that sparked a ""short squeeze"", leading to billions of dollars in losses for Wall Street hedge funds.
Citadel, the $43 billion hedge fund, had made a $2 billion investment in Melvin Capital at the time, after the latter, which had been short on GameStop since 2014, suffered massive losses.

Genting, led by Malaysian tycoon Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, bought MV Werften in 2016. The pandemic has hit the global travel industry, including cruise operators and led to production stops at shipyards that build cruise ships.
Genting's subsidiary Genting Hong Kong said on Tuesday the German government and the German federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern had withheld a total $336 million in funding it was promised.
Included in that was an $88 million backstop facility from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern that the Hong Kong group said it was due to draw down, but said that the German state imposed additional pre-conditions in December.
The German government has said Genting Hong Kong had turned down aid that was offered to it. 
Genting's court case was heard by the regional court in the northern German town of Schwerin on Tuesday. A spokesman for the court said a ruling would be made on Monday at 2 p.m. local time (1300 GMT).
Genting Hong Kong also said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Tuesday that MV's insolvency led to defaults under its ""Global 1"" credit facility, which would in turn lead to further defaults on financing arrangements worth a total of around $2.8 billion.

Shares in Genting Hong Kong have been suspended from trade since Friday. The company said they would continue to be suspended pending another announcement, which would include the outcome of legal proceedings.
MV Werften currently has around 2,000 workers in Germany's northern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

In a decision on Monday, a panel of the California Court of Appeal said it agreed with a trial court's conclusion that the workers had been abating asbestos, and that the relevant insurance policies did not cover the accident.
Motiva had been seeking coverage from insurers of Excel Modular Scaffold and Leasing Corp, the contractor hired to abate asbestos at the refinery, the nation's largest.
One crew member died of severe burns and his supervisor suffered serious injuries in the August 2017 fire.
The supervisor and relatives of the crew member later sued Motiva in Texas for the company's alleged negligence. After settling, Motiva filed an action in June 2018 seeking indemnification from Excel’s insurers.

Shares in the drugstore chain operator were up nearly 2% at $107 in early trading.
The company said it now expects adjusted profit per share for 2021 in the range of $8.33 to $8.38, up from a prior forecast of $8.00. 
Higher-than-expected coronavirus vaccinations in November and December, as well as elevated demand for over-the-counter COVID-19 testing in the last month of 2021, helped with a strong retail segment performance, CVS said.

Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc last week raised its full-year adjusted profit growth forecast on the back of similar comments.
CVS also said its health insurance unit performed better than expected despite higher coronavirus cases, particularly in the back half of the fourth quarter, as deferred elective procedures offset higher COVID-19 costs.

Analysts and Corporate America had previously estimated supply-chain snafus to ease halfway through the year, but a full recovery could now be delayed because of Omicron-related issues, including labor shortages. 
""For 2022, we expect supply pressures to likely linger for longer, perhaps until the second half of next year before gradually unwinding,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday.
Shares of Albertsons declined 8% in morning trade after the company also said it was witnessing cost inflation across its supply base, including in ingredients, packaging, transportation and labor.
Albertsons, which also owns Safeway, Vons and Jewel-Osco chains, cut its capital expenditures forecast for fiscal 2021 by $100 million at midpoint to $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, citing ""supply-related constraints.""
""There are more supply challenges, and we would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks,"" Chief Executive Officer Vivek Sankaran said on an earnings call.

Sankaran also said Albertsons had to deal with several product categories being out of stock for a few months.
The company, however, raised its forecast for fiscal 2021 profit after posting better-than-expected sales and earnings for the third quarter. It benefited from administering COVID-19 vaccines at its stores and strong demand for groceries.

1136,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 10:27AM ET</span>","Four Fed Rate Hikes Are Priced In, and Jamie Dimon Wants More","(Bloomberg) -- When it comes to expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes, what was once seen as radical has practically become conservative. 
Just a few weeks ago, predicting that the Fed would raise rates four times in 2022 would have been considered wildly ambitious. Now, not only is that being priced in, but JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon is saying the U.S. economy can handle even more.
That said, the market remains divided on just how much the Fed will move in 2022. The central bank’s dot plot still only shows three rate increases this year, but Wall Street is becoming increasingly hawkish.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). now expects the Fed to raise rates four times this year and start its balance sheet runoff by July at the latest. That echoes similar calls from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) and JPMorgan last week. And some are willing to go even further. 
“I, personally, would be surprised if it was just four rate increases next year,” Dimon said. “I think four increases of 25 basis points is a very, very little amount and very easy for the economy to absorb.” He pointed to debt payments, increased income and a strong housing market as economic tailwinds.
The idea of four rate hikes in 2022 has accelerated in the first 10 days of the year and is quickly turning into a Street consensus. The spread between the 13th and 1st month fed funds contract, another way to measure rate hike expectations over the next 12 months, shows 3.9 increases priced in. The steepness of the move is most significant, as those expectations have accelerated far more quickly than even the push to cut rates during the trade war in 2019.
Nominal rates are getting the message too. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes have risen 47 basis points on an intraday basis since the start of December, which is the equivalent of almost two rate hikes. Some traders are even hedging against the risk of as many as six rate increases, with bets going as far as suggesting eight quarter-point moves by early 2024.
With Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s congressional confirmation on Tuesday and inflation data due Wednesday, balance sheet reduction is also worth bearing in mind. Whether it happens at the same time as the first rate hike is crucial, as is the method the central bank uses. Selling bonds on the open market would have drastic ripple effects on financial markets. But buying shorter maturity securities and letting them roll of the balance sheet faster also remains an option. 
What’s clear is the Fed has many options at its disposal. And it’s the uncertainty of what it’s about it do that’s leading to bond-market bets that were considered extreme just a few weeks ago.

Investing.com — Digital payments and financial technology company Mogo Inc (NASDAQ:MOGO) said Tuesday it is expanding into the metaverse through an investment in NFT Trader.
NFT Trader is a Canadian company that operates a peer-to-peer over-the-counter trading platform for non-fungible tokens or NFTs. The company has previously collaborated with projects, including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Cool Cats, Gutter Cat Gang, and CyberKongz.
Mogo shares are up 4% on the news. 
""The world of finance is rapidly changing and nowhere is that more apparent than what we are seeing with the emergence of Web3, the Metaverse and NFTs,"" said David Feller, CEO of Mogo.
The company's initial investment in NFT Trader is through a convertible note, that if converted will represent a 25% interest in NFT Trader. Mogo can acquire an additional 25% interest through a secondary purchase of common shares within six months of the initial investment. It can also appoint one director to the NFT Trader board of directors.
""We believe that a next-gen financial platform will not only bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi, but the merging of the digital and physical worlds will become one of the biggest growth opportunities ever,"" added Feller.
Following the announcement, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said in a note to investors that the investment was a natural extension of Mogo's platform, and he expects the company's shares to react favorably. The analyst currently has a buy rating and a $13 price target on the stock, which trades around the $2.86 level."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Cerberus' sale this week of part of its sizeable holdings in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) is likely the first step to a full exit from the lenders by the U.S. investor, said two people with knowledge of the matter.
For years, profits in the financial industry of Europe's largest economy have been under pressure, as banks face stiff competition, high expenses, and ongoing low interest rates.
But Cerberus in 2017 bet big on Germany by buying a 3% stake in Deutsche Bank and a 5% stake in Commerzbank, a move that the two people said was meant in part to capitalise on the prospect of bank mergers.
Since then, the two top lenders have tried and failed to join forces to create a single national banking champion, instead embarking on separate restructurings.
Cerberus, which raked in $500 million in proceeds in Monday's partial sale of the stakes, didn't respond to requests for comment. 
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment.
By mid-afternoon on Tuesday, Deutsche Bank shares were down 1%, while Commerzbank was 5.2% lower. 
The two banks' overhauls - involving major job cuts and the closure of some business lines - have helped stabilise the lenders, and their stock is well off lows recorded in 2020.
But Deutsche Bank's shares are still down more than 20% and Commerzbank's more than 30% since Cerberus first bought in, and regulators and analysts say German lenders remain fragile.
""Cerberus has finally recognised that there is no longer any realistic chance of a merger between Deutsche and Commerzbank,"" said Klaus Nieding of shareholder lobby group DSW.
In a recent report, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said profitability would remain challenging for high cost, net interest-dependent German banks.
In November, S&P lifted its rating on Deutsche, citing ""tangible benefits"" of its restructuring, but noted that most competitors ""have greater business stability and stronger, more predictable profitability"".
The same month, it said that Commerzbank's restructuring entails a high degree of risk and that it didn't foresee any improvement in profit before the end of this year. 
Cerberus pared its holding of Deutsche Bank to 2% from 3%, and its Commerzbank stake to 3% from 5%.
Nonetheless, Cerberus has had a big impact on strategy. In 2020, for example, it launched a vocal campaign for major changes at Commerzbank, prompting a management reshuffle, thousands of job cuts and the closure of bank branches.
Andreas Thomae, a portfolio manager at Deka, a big investor in the German banks, said he thought Cerberus was taking advantage of a recent rise in the banks' shares and didn't expect a change in strategy by the lenders as Cerberus retreats.

""Both banks are on a good path to recovery,"" he said.
In some ways, Cerberus' holdings in the banks have been unusual because the firm tends to hold majority stakes in non-publicly traded companies, but it is not unusual for private equity investors to exit their holdings after three or five years.

BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc sold 70,847 China-made vehicles in December, the highest monthly rate since it started manufacturing in Shanghai in 2019, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Tuesday.
Tesla's December sales, which included 245 for export, were almost three times the amount achieved in the same month last year and 34% higher than November's sales.
It also brought Tesla's total sales of China-made cars for last year to at least 473,078, according to Reuters' calculations of CPCA's data, which prior to April did not publish figures for Tesla's China-made car exports. 
This accounts for around half of 936,000 vehicles the U.S. automaker delivered globally last year. 
Tesla's Shanghai factory, which started delivering vehicles at the end of 2019, makes electric Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles for domestic and international markets, including Germany and Japan.
The automaker, which has been able to surmount supply chain woes experienced by rivals to post record quarterly deliveries, said during its third-quarter results in October that the Shanghai plant's potential annual output exceeded 450,000 vehicles. ()
Tu Le, Beijing-based managing director at Sino Auto Insights, said the December numbers showed that the Tesla brand in China remained strong and that it was also operationally ""impressive"" given that the Shanghai factory had the capacity to make around 42,000 vehicles a month on average. 
""They were well over that number in December. And this is despite the chip and battery shortages that other EV makers dealt with.""
China's EV market is dominated by domestic brands including BYD and Wuling - a local marque that is part of General Motors (NYSE:GM). Tesla is only the foreign brand in the top 10, according to Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility. 

The CPCA also said Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc delivered 10,489 cars last month, a year-on-year increase of 49.7%, while Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc delivered 16,000 vehicles. Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said it sold more than 13,787 ID. series EVs in China in December, the fourth consecutive month in which the ID. family has delivered more than 10,000 units in China.
CPCA said passenger car sales in December in China totalled 2.14 million, down 7.7% from a year earlier.

In presentation slides for J.P. Morgan's annual healthcare conference, which is being held virtually this year, the German biotech firm said on Tuesday it expects 13 billion to 17 billion euros in revenue accruing to it from the vaccine this year, which compares with a guidance of 16 billion-17 billion euros for 2021. 
The financial windfall from the Comirnaty shot, its first product on the market since the company's 2008 inception, presents a ""historic chance to accelerate our vision through reinvestment in the company"", it said in the slides.
Encouraged by the earnings prospects, BioNTech has accelerated clinical testing on humans of various product candidates, by far the most expensive phase of developing new medicines.
According to the presentation, it started five clinical trials last year with experimental oncology drugs previously not tested on humans and moved two trials into the second phase of testing on humans. Three phases are typically needed for market approval though in oncology regulators are increasingly considering clearance even after the second phase.
BioNTech has an influenza vaccine in the first phase of testing on humans and plans to start human testing of four vaccine candidates against shingles, malaria, tuberculosis and herpes simplex this year.

In another sign of rapid growth, the headcount in research and development increased by 40% last year to more than 850 staff.

Moller-Maersk on Tuesday warned its customers it was still struggling to move goods around the world as the easing of congestion is taking longer than the Danish company had hoped for.
The pandemic has prompted shortages of container ships and logjams at ports at a time of very high consumer spending, meaning that hundreds of container vessels are lying idle outside ports.
""Unfortunately, 2022 has not started off as we had hoped,"" Maersk said in an advisory published on its web page. 
""The pandemic is still going strong and unfortunately, we are seeing new outbreaks impacting our ability to move your cargo,"" it said, adding that it expects the constrains to continue ""for some time still"".

The biggest waiting times for container vessels to discharge or pick up cargoes were on the U.S. West Coast where the waiting time at Long Beach port in Los Angeles currently is between 38 and 45 days, Maersk said. 
However, it noted that there had been some recent easing in Northern Europe where the Port of Antwerp in Belgium was expected to reduce the wait to around two days this week from 10 days the week before.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower again on Tuesday as hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials, together with increasing signs of a wave of Covid-related absenteeism across the U.S. economy, kept a firm lid on risk appetite. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 243 points, or 0.7% at 35,826 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5%.
Earlier gains in the premarket session quickly reversed after Kansas City Fed President Esther George, a noted hawk on the policymaking committee, said that she was comfortable with the idea of the Fed selling its bond holdings back into the market faster than it did after the last quantitative easing program ended. 
""My own preference would be to opt for running down the balance sheet earlier rather than later as we plot a path for removing monetary accommodation,"" George said in prepared remarks to a virtual event to Central Exchange, a women's organization.
George's comments were a setback to hopes that the Fed may go easy on removing stimulus due to a likely soft patch for growth in the first couple of months caused by the Omicron-variant of Covid-19. The new dominant variant has caused record numbers of infections across the U.S., and resultant absences from work.  
The U,S. reported 1.42 million new cases on Monday, over four times as many as the previous daily peak last September.  And while the new variant appears to be less virulent than Delta and the original Wuhan variants which account for nearly all of the 838,000 U.S. Covid deaths in the last two years, the number of people in intensive care is still at 75% of its previous peak, with no sight of the current wave cresting yet.
The market subsequently pared losses but was still mostly lower as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sat down in the Senate Banking Committee for the confirmation hearing to his second term. Powell said in prepared remarks that he was determined not to let inflation become ""entrenched"" - a nod to the sharp rise in inflation expectations in the second half of last year that were reflected in consumer sentiment surveys and in forward inflation-linked swap contracts.
Among individual movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock regained some momentum after data showing its best ever month for deliveries in China, which leads the world in absolute numbers of Electric Vehicles registered.  However, old-world mobility was also strong, with  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rising 1.3% to its highest since the start of the pandemic two years ago. Oil prices have risen this week on concerns that OPEC and its allies will be unable to deliver the additional volumes of oil they have promised, creating space for big shale players like Exxon to fill a vaccum in the market at some of the highest crude prices in the last five years.
Elsewhere, Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR)  stock rose 4.4% after U.S. health authorities agreed to buy another 600,000 doses of the antibody-based Covid-19 treatment that the U.S. drugmaker manufacturers with British partner GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). "

(Reuters) - U.S. housing finance giant Fannie Mae has started integrating data from digital banking startup Blend Labs Inc. into its underwriting program to make it easier for lenders to evaluate a borrower's rental payment history when approving a home loan. 
Fannie's effort to include rental payment history in the loan approval process comes as President Joe Biden's administration pushes to improve access to credit and address inequities in the housing system. 
Alternative sources of data, like rental payments, can help lenders more accurately assess the creditworthiness of borrowers with limited credit history, say credit experts. 
Fannie Mae, along with  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC), guarantees more than half the nation's mortgages and must approve the loans it insures, along with the lenders that originate them.
“We think it's going to allow more first-time home-buyers or aspiring first time home-buyers to responsibly qualify, including those that who have a more limited credit history,” said Steve Holden, Fannie's vice president of single-family data and analytics. 
Approximately 20% of the U.S. population has little established credit history – a group in which Black and Hispanic consumers are disproportionately represented, according to Fannie.
San Francisco-based Blend gathers third-party data which it shares with lenders to help them quickly verify requirements like a borrower's source of income. 
The company powers the mortgage application process for several major lenders, including  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, U.S. Bancorp and Mr. Cooper Group Inc, processing around $5 billion of loans daily on average, it says. 
Many lenders were eager to participate in the new program, but were wary of asking borrowers for bank statements showing that they made timely rental payments, and of the added burden of having to manually review those statements, said Nima Ghamsari, Blend co-founder and chief executive officer. 
“There's only a few times a year where the CEOs of some of these mortgage companies will call me and say, ‘Hey, how come you guys don't have this thing yet?’” he said. “This was one of those occasions I got a lot of phone calls.”
After Fannie said in August that it would consider rental payment history, Blend integrated the bank rental payment transaction data into its platform and Fannie in turn integrated the new Blend feature into its underwriting system. 

Lenders using Blend can have the fintech send the payment data directly to Fannie, instead of gathering it themselves which would be costly.
The housing finance giant is exploring other ways to unlock access to credit for under-served borrowers, Holden said, without elaborating.

(Reuters) - The United States has agreed to buy 600,000 more doses of GSK and Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR)'s COVID-19 antibody therapy for an undisclosed sum, as the country bolsters its arsenal of treatments against the Omicron coronavirus variant.
The additional doses of sotrovimab would be delivered in the first quarter of 2022, the drugmakers said on Tuesday, taking the tally of doses secured by nations worldwide to roughly 1.7 million. Canada and the European Union have signed deals too. 
The U.S. government in November had signed contracts worth about $1 billion for an unknown number of doses of the treatment, after saying it would control the distribution of sotrovimab in the country.
The drug belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies which are lab-generated compounds that mimic the body's natural defences. Tests have indicated sotrovimab works against the fast-spreading Omicron variant.
The United States reported 1.35 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest daily total for any country. 
""We understand the role we can play in supporting the ongoing pandemic response,"" said Maya Martinez-Davis, GSK head for U.S. pharmaceuticals. ""Our teams are working with urgency to explore options to expand our supply capacity so we can support more patients in 2022."" 
SCRAMBLING
Scientists and governments are scrambling to bolster defences against Omicron with testing, shots, therapies, as the variant threatens to become dominant globally by evading protection offered by current vaccines and drugs. 
Last week, the Biden administration doubled its order for  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s oral COVID-19 antiviral treatment, providing the government a total of 20 million courses. 
While Omicron is potentially less severe than other variants, the sheer number of infections has raised concerns hospital systems could get strained by rising patient numbers and staff shortages.

GSK and Vir expect to produce about 2 million doses of sotrovimab globally in the first half of 2022. While the drug is given via an infusion, a trial has shown it works also as a potentially more convenient shot in the arm.
The therapy was authorised for emergency use in the United States in May 2021 to prevent mild or moderate cases of COVID-19 from worsening.

Aleph did not reveal any financial terms of the investment but said Twitter's stake buy would help the company expand its educational tech platform.
Emerging markets-focused Aleph, which helps large digital platforms connect with advertisers and customers, counts Meta Platforms Inc  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corp-owned LinkedIn among its customers.
Despite wide-ranging supply chain disruptions that delayed products from reaching shelves and a user privacy clampdown by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that many feared would disrupt mobile advertising, brands have continued to advertise online.
Founded in 2005 as IMS Internet Media Services, Aleph was valued at $2 billion last year after private equity firm CVC Capital Partners bought a stake worth $470 million.

Aleph had confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering in October.
Latin American fintech company  MercadoLibre  (NASDAQ:MELI) Inc is also among Aleph's investors, having picked up a stake worth $25 million in August last year.

The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) had requested Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google to submit compliance plans after the bill was passed in August last year and went into effect in September.
Google announced its plans to allow alternative payment systems in South Korea in November to comply with the amended Telecommunication Business Act, dubbed the ""anti-Google law"".
""We look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users,"" Apple said in a statement, but did not provide details such as timeline of when the new payment systems will take effect or commission fee rates. 
It plans to discuss further details with the KCC, the regulator said. The KCC said Apple plans to allow alternative payment systems for a lower service fee versus the current 30% commissions.
In the United States, the iPhone maker is wading through a lawsuit brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games in 2020 when the game maker tried to get around Apple's 30% fee on in-app purchases by launching an in-app payment system of its own.
A U.S. judge last year ordered Apple to change its App Store rules, which ban developers from including links in buttons to outside payment systems over using Apple's own.

""I hope Apple's move here (in South Korea) isn't another fake opening of payment systems as Google recently announced,"" Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said in a tweet.
Apple said it paid developers a total of $260 billion through its App Store since its launch in 2008, implying a $60 billion payout to developers in 2021.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, continuing the previous session’s late rebound ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s confirmation testimony.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 80 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.4%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 75 points, or 0.5%.
The major indices on Wall Street clawed back some of their losses on Monday after opening sharply lower on concerns about rising interest rates, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite actually closing higher.
This positive tone is expected to continue Tuesday as investors await U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. 
In his opening remarks for the hearing released in advance, Powell pledged to prevent high inflation from becoming ""entrenched,"" but did not provide clues about the central bank’s timeline and speed of monetary tightening.
Powell will most likely be pressed about how many interest rate rises will be necessary this year. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, one of the more hawkish voices at the central bank late last year, told The Wall Street Journal he only expects three hikes but that there is a risk that a fourth may be necessary.
“Given how cautious the FOMC has been over the past two years, to the point of appearing snail-like, I am struggling to see them hitting the panic button right now,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at OANDA. “We may be approaching ‘peak Fed-fear’ for now. That could see a sharp jump for equities, a retreat by U.S. yields and the U.S. dollar.”
The main economic data release Tuesday is the Redbook index, an indicator of growth in retail sales, but investors will focus squarely on Wednesday’s consumer price inflation data. This is expected to show headline CPI breaking above 7% year-on-year, approaching a four-decade high.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be in focus after data from the China Passenger Car Association showed the U.S. electric vehicle maker sold 70,847 China-made vehicles in December, the highest monthly rate since it started manufacturing in Shanghai in 2019.
Grocery store Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) is scheduled to report its quarterly results before the bell Tuesday, while Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) could be in the spotlight following reports that head of operations Rod Copes left the electric vehicle maker at the end of last month.
Oil prices pushed higher after two days of losses with the globe’s major suppliers continuing to struggle to increase output to match recovering demand.
The market is waiting on U.S. oil and product inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, later Tuesday, followed by data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $79.42 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.5% to $82.09. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,806.00/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1339.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Debt-laden property developer Guangzhou R&F Properties said it would use $104 million to pay for a tender offer and fees to offshore bondholders deemed to have consented to an extension in maturity of a $725-million bond due on Thursday.
The amount, while far less than the $300 million the firm had expected, will still help it avert default, as Chinese developers battle an unprecedented liquidity squeeze caused by years of regulatory curbs on borrowing that brought several offshore debt defaults and credit downgrades. 
In a filing to the stock exchange on Tuesday, R&F said the settlement would leave $608.6 million outstanding on the 5.75% notes, with a six-month extension leading to a new maturity date of July 13. 
Last week, the developer said it had insufficient funds for the settlement, as 95.9% of holders of the offshore notes had tendered to sell their notes back to the company, but stopped short of saying how much it had.
Holders who have tendered would be deemed to have approved the maturity extension.
The news came the same day that larger rival Shimao Group Holdings denied a media report that it had struck a preliminary deal to sell a plaza in Shanghai, while saying it was in talks with potential buyers to sell some properties. 
The developer, based in the Chinese commercial hub, said last week it had defaulted on a trust loan after missing a payment of 645 million yuan ($101 million).
It is now struggling to raise funds while discussing payment arrangements with creditors.
In a stock exchange filing, Shimao denied the weekend report by financial publication Caixin that said it had a preliminary pact to sell its Shimao International Plaza Shanghai to a state-owned company for more than 10 billion yuan. 
However, it added that it ""may consider disposing of certain properties if the terms and conditions are appropriate in order to reduce the indebtedness of the group"". 
OTHER TROUBLED DEVELOPERS
Fitch Ratings downgraded Shimao's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ""B-"" from ""BB"", citing a ""lower margin of safety in preserving liquidity"" after it defaulted on a trust loan.
The downgrade follows similar action by S&P and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) the previous day, and Shimao's ratings remain on Rating Watch Negative (RWN), Fitch added.
The Caixin report said Shimao had put up for sale all its real estate projects, including residential and commercial properties, and was in talks with China Vanke to dispose of some assets.
Shimao is set to repay a local bond maturing on Saturday after receiving higher-than-anticipated cash inflows from property sales in December, Bloomberg said on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Shares of Shimao reversed early losses to close up 0.5%, following a gain of 19% in the previous session, while R&F shares rose 1.2%.
Last week, Reuters reported that a unit of the company, Shanghai Shimao Construction, had proposed extensions on maturities for two ABS due this month totalling 1.17 billion yuan.
In its filing, Shimao said it had no outstanding asset-backed securities (ABS) due and payable as of Tuesday. 
China Evergrande Group, set to be China's biggest defaulter, saw its shares ease 0.6%, as it struggles to repay more than $300 billion in liabilities. It has said the voting period for a meeting of onshore bondholders will be extended to Thursday from Monday.

The developer is seeking a six-month delay in the redemption and coupon payments of a 4.5-billion-yuan ($157-million) bond.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 06:32AM ET</span>",Volkswagen aims to double electric car sales in China this year after missing targets,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) -Volkswagen AG said it would likely double sales of its ID battery electric vehicles in China this year and aims to do even better but the automaker could be hamstrung by a shortage of semiconductors.
The ID series, which Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) produces at its Chinese joint ventures with SAIC Motor and FAW Group, is the backbone of its EV ambitions in China, the world's largest auto market.
The German automaker sold 70,625 of its ID electric vehicles in China last year, missing its goal of selling 80,000 to 100,000 cars, with production also affected by regional COVID-19 outbreaks in addition to chip-related issues.
Volkswagen's China chief Stephan Wollenstein told a briefing in Beijing that the automaker would still like to double its original plan but that goal ""is not currently secured by the semiconductor supplies that we currently see."" 
He added, however that he was ""pretty positive that we will see a doubling of actual sales."" 
Volkswagen Group, which alongside its own brand owns other marques such as Audi, Lamborghini and Porsche, sold 3.3 million cars in China last year, down 14%, Wollenstein said. 
The company aims to boost that number by around 15% or roughly 500,000 units this year, though he said this also depended on the chip supply situation. 
The shortage of chips, used in everything from brake sensors to power steering to entertainment systems, has led automakers around the world to cut or suspend production, pushing up both new and used vehicle prices amid robust demand from consumers.
While China's EV market is seeing very strong growth, most foreign automakers have lagged their Chinese counterparts in designing smart cars that appeal.
The market is now dominated by Chinese brands, led by BYD and Wuling - part of the GM group but a local marque. While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks as No.3, it is the only foreign brand among the top 10.

“You don’t see Volkswagen. Players like Volkswagen, GM and Toyota have fallen far behind in China’s smart EV race,” said Bill Russo, head of consultancy Automobility in Shanghai.
Some 15% of all passenger cars purchased in China last year through November were either battery electric cars or plug-in electric hybrids, according to Russo. In November alone, electric car sales accounted for 21% of China’s overall passenger car sales.

Unfazed by the stock market’s bumpy start to the year, strategists from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) to UBS Global Wealth Management reiterated their bullish calls on bets that equities can weather higher interest rates and rising bond yields.
“The selloff in some long duration high quality names might be overdone soon,” Goldman strategists led by Cecilia Mariotti wrote in a note dated Monday. With real yields not expected to move much higher, “valuations are unlikely to become a binding constraint for equities,” the strategists wrote in a note.
U.S. stock market futures gained on Tuesday -- after the worst start of a year since 2016 for the S&P 500 -- while European benchmarks rebounded, in tentative signs that the rout may be easing. Indications that the Federal Reserve may tighten policy more aggressively than expected triggered a selloff on both sides of the Atlantic, with pricier growth stocks and tech the hardest hit.
“While investors should brace for volatility as markets adjust to the more hawkish line from the Fed and the latest wave of Covid-19 infections, we still expect the rally to resume,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management wrote in a note on Tuesday. “The normalization of Fed policy shouldn’t dent the outlook for corporate profit growth,” supported by consumer spending and easy access to capital.
Adding to the chorus of assurances that a more hawkish Fed doesn’t fundamentally change the positive outlook for stocks, BlackRock’s Investment Institute recommended investors use selloffs to add risk. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) strategists said on Monday that it’s time to buy the “arguably overdone” dip.
Optimism is also abounding in Europe, a region which has been singled out as a potential haven in a rising rates environment, with stocks that are generally cheaper and less sensitive to hikes. 
“The U.S. is more vulnerable to rising bond yields as it has a larger weight in long duration sectors,” and the earnings gap between the U.S. and Europe is narrowing, Bernstein strategists led by Sarah McCarthy wrote on Monday, recommending an overweight position on stocks, and a preference for Europe. 
BNP Paribas strategists including Ankit Gheedia concurred: “We believe a combination of earnings revisions, bearish positioning in European equities and attractive valuations could pave the way for a strong equity rally over coming months,” they wrote.

The move extends Monday’s biggest rebound since March 23, 2020 when the Nasdaq wiped out a drop that reached 2.7% at its worst to finish higher by 0.1%. Optimism that a more hawkish Federal Reserve will seek to avoid hampering growth and signs that the omicron virus variant may be peaking is helping investor sentiment.
Last week, the Nasdaq endured a four-day skid that pushed it more than 8% below a November record. 
“Markets are already pricing in a very aggressive hiking cycle from the Fed,” said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at Flowbank SA. “Over the medium to long term, we still like tech stocks as inflation is probably peaking, earnings will remain strong and yields should remain somewhat contained.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) was Britain's fastest growing food retailer in the key Christmas quarter, market researcher NielsenIQ said on Tuesday, providing further evidence that the company's latest turnaround programme is gaining traction.
NielsenIQ said M&S's grocery sales soared 9.4% in the 12 weeks to Jan. 1 from the same period a year earlier, with growth accelerating from its previous report.
In November, M&S said it had beaten forecasts for first-half profit and upgraded its earnings outlook for the second time in three months, sending its stock soaring on bets that one of Britain's most elusive turnarounds could finally materialise.
M&S shares were up 1.6% at 0915 GMT, extending gains over the last year to 92%. 
Some analysts believe M&S, which also sells clothing and homeware, could upgrade its 2021-22 profit outlook again on Thursday when it publishes its own third-quarter trading update. 
NielsenIQ's data showed market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) was the best performer of Britain's so-called Big Four grocers. 
Its 0.1% sales decline significantly outperformed Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons which had falls of 4.2%, 3.1% and 5.6% respectively.
That data echoed data from rival market researcher Kantar published last week. However, Kantar does not include M&S in its monthly reports.
NielsenIQ noted, however, that M&S had weaker comparative sales numbers than the Big Four in 2020. 
The researcher said UK shoppers spent a total of 7.1 billion pounds ($9.6 billion) at supermarkets in the two weeks to Dec. 25, up from 6.7 billion pounds in 2020.
Sainsbury's will give an update on its Christmas trading on Wednesday, while Tesco will provide an update on Thursday.

The British arm of German discount supermarket group Aldi said on Monday its sales in December rose 0.4% compared with the previous year, while rival Lidl GB said on Tuesday its December sales rose 2.6%.

Last month, Intel was slammed on Chinese social media for a letter to suppliers published on its website. The Dec. 23 letter said Intel had been ""required to ensure that its supply chain does not use any labour or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region"" following restrictions imposed by ""multiple governments"".
This paragraph, or any reference to Xinjiang or China, was no longer in the letter, according to a Reuters review of the same page on Tuesday. The letter now reads that the company prohibits ""any human trafficked or involuntary labour such as forced, debt bonded, prison, indentured, or slave labour throughout your extended supply chains."" 
Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It apologised last month for the ""trouble"" it had caused, saying that its commitment to avoid supply chains from Xinjiang was an expression of compliance with U.S. law, rather than a statement of its position on the issue.
Multinational companies have come under pressure as they aim to comply with Xinjiang-related trade sanctions while continuing to operate in China, one of their biggest markets. 
The United States has accused China of widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang, home to the country's predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, including forced labour. Beijing has repeatedly denied the claims.
Intel's deletion of any reference to Xinjiang in its annual letter to suppliers, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, was criticised by U.S. Senator Marco Rubio.
“Intel’s cowardice is yet another predictable consequence of economic reliance on China,” Rubio said in a statement on Monday. 

“Instead of humiliating apologies and self-censorship, companies should move their supply chains to countries that do not use slave labour or commit genocide.”
Rubio was one of four U.S. politicians who introduced the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act last month calling for a ban on imports from Xinjiang over allegations of forced labour there. On Dec. 23, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the act into law.

Nokia said it expected a comparable operating margin of 11-13.5% in 2022, sending its shares up 2.8% in the morning trade following the announcement.
""The outlook shows that the business turnaround is still progressing well and no offset is coming from cost inflation or component shortage,"" Inderes analyst Atte Riikola told Reuters. 
The company said it also expected to exceed its 2021 earnings guidance, with its venture fund investments driving the boost.
Nokia estimated a full-year 2021 comparable operating margin of 12.4-12.6%, above its previous guidance of 10-12%, and net sales of 21.7-22.7 billion euros, within its previously announced range.
The company said its underlying business performed largely as expected in the fourth quarter.
""However, other operating income was higher than expected including further benefits from venture fund investments, leading to a stronger comparable operating margin exceeding the 2021 guidance,"" it said in a statement.

Nokia now expects Q4 revenue of 6.4 billion euros, below expectations of 6.5 billion euros, according to Reuters calculations.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - For more than a year, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and India's Future Group have been locked in a complex legal stand-off that has stalled Future's $3.4 billion sale of assets to the U.S. firm's rival Reliance Industries - with no end in sight.
Here's what the dispute, seen as key to deciding who gets an upper hand in one of the world's fastest-growing retail markets, is all about.
WHAT TRIGGERED THE DISPUTE?
In 2019, Amazon and Future, number two player in India behind market leader Reliance, became business partners when the U.S. company invested $200 million in a gift voucher unit of the Indian group. 
That deal, Amazon argues, came with certain non-compete clauses that prohibited Future from selling retail assets to certain rivals, including Reliance, run by one of India's richest men, Mukesh Ambani. The deal also included clauses for settlement of any disputes under rules laid down by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
But in 2020, Future - hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic - decided to sell assets to Reliance. 
Amazon then approached Singapore arbitrators and successfully stopped the sale. Both parties have also challenged each other with lawsuits in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, since the ""seat of arbitration"" remains in New Delhi and Indian law governs the proceedings.
WHAT DO AMAZON AND FUTURE SAY?
Amazon argues various agreements signed in 2019 with Future gave it special rights over Future's retail assets, some of which it had also hoped to ultimately own should India's rules for foreign investors be eased. The potential Future-Reliance deal ""destroys"" the latter prospect, the U.S. company has said.
Future denies any wrongdoing, saying Amazon is illegally seeking to exert control on Future's retail business. Future Retail - the group's flagship retail arm - says it faces liquidation and its more than 27,000 employees can become jobless if the Reliance deal fails. 
Both sides have deployed a battery of lawyers and top Indian legal firms are involved in the high-profile matter. Two lawyers who formerly occupied the position of Solicitor General of India have played a key role in arguing for Amazon and Future.
WHAT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE?
At stake is whether Amazon can become a bigger force in a $900 billion retail market, with 1.3 billion consumers, than Reliance.
Conglomerate Reliance has operations including 1,100 supermarkets, while Future has more than 1,500. Both are expanding fast into e-commerce, but the Future deal will immediately boost the retail footprint of Reliance, which has attracted marquee foreign investors in the business.
For its part, Amazon has invested $6.5 billion in India, which it counts as a key growth market where it is a leading e-commerce player. The Future partnership had already allowed Amazon to boost its online portfolio of grocery deliveries by integrating the Indian company's stores on its website.
Keeping Future away from Reliance chimes with Amazon's efforts to combat billionaire Ambani's growth plans. In one confidential legal filing, Amazon said Reliance's consolidated position with Future ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"".
HOW DID INDIA'S ANTITRUST AGENCY GET INVOLVED?
Future complained to India's antitrust agency, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), that Amazon was making incorrect and contradictory submissions about the intent of the 2019 deal.
Amazon said it never concealed any information, but last December the CCI suspended its approval of the 2019 deal with Future, saying there was ""a deliberate design on the part of Amazon to suppress the actual scope"" of the deal and its interest in Future's retail businesses.
While Amazon contends the CCI acted beyond its powers, Future maintains the U.S company no longer has any right to assert its claims as the 2019 deal itself now lacks regulatory approval. 

In a setback for the U.S. giant, the Delhi High Court this month halted the Singapore arbitration proceedings between the two sides in light of the Indian antitrust decision. 
The arbitration has since been on hold, but Amazon has appealed the decisions in Indian courts which are yet to hear the matter.

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 04:15AM ET</span>",Tokyo bourse to keep most firms on new 'prime' market,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nearly 85% of the companies listed on the top section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange will be permitted on its new ""prime"" market in an April rebranding, the bourse said on Tuesday, potentially diluting its goal of creating a more prestigious main board. 
In Japan's biggest overhaul of its equity markets in adecade, the TSE will adopt tougher listing criteria for its top category, hoping to highlight companies with strong profitability whose governance meets global standards, with the aim of luring more foreign investors.
Of 2,185 firms now listed on the main exchange, 1,841 have chosen the prime market, but 296 firms have not met the criteria, said the TSE, which is owned by Japan Exchange Group Inc..
Companies that fall short of the new rules can still stay on the prime market in an unspecified transition period by submitting improvement plans, a provision some investors say waters down the reshuffle.
Stricter rules for liquidity - market capitalisation in tradable shares of at least 10 billion yen ($90 million) with a tradable share ratio of 35% or more - are especially tough for small cap firms or those largely owned by parent companies or business partners.
The number of firms that have failed to meet the criteria was ""higher than we expected,"" said Keiichi Ito, SMBC Nikko Securities' chief quants analyst.
But Ito said the reform will prompt companies to unwind cross-shareholdings, the common practice in Japan where companies take stakes in partners to cement relationships.
""This is positive from corporate governance perspectives,"" he said.

The bourse's overhaul is part of a long policy drive begun under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to win foreign investors back to Tokyo's market, which Japan fears is increasingly overlooked by global institutional asset managers.
In the April 4 re-organisation, the exchange will reshuffle its four existing markets into three, designated as ""prime"", ""standard"" and ""growth"".

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday helped by strong economic data, suggesting the region may be weathering the hit from the Omicron variant more strongly than when the Covid-19 virus first hit.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.8% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.3%.
U.K. retail sales jumped in December, growing 4.6% compared with December 2019, the British Retail Consortium said Tuesday. Another report from Barclaycard showed consumer spending was up 12.2% last month from two years before. 
Adding to the positive news, Spanish industrial production rose 4.8% in November, a sharp improvement from the revised drop of 0.7% the previous month.
That said, the spread of the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus shows few signs of slowing down globally, with the United States reporting 1.35 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest daily total for any country in the world. China meanwhile locked down Anyang, a city of some 5 million inhabitants, after discovering local transmission of the Omicron variant, adding to restrictions in place at Xi'an and Tianjin, the world's fourth-largest port.
On the brighter side, a number of European governments are now relaxing Covid-19 rules to keep hospitals, schools and emergency services going, an acknowledgement that the Omicron variant is less dangerous than previous dominant strains.
In corporate news, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock fell 0.6% after the German auto giant blamed supply chain constraints for missing its ID electric vehicles sales target in China last year.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) stock fell 1.7% and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock dropped 2.7% after Cerberus Capital Management announced plans to sell stakes in the German banks, with the private equity company scaling back an investment that hasn’t worked out over the last four years. The DAX's biggest gainer was Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) stock, which recovered 5% after saying it expected its delivery business to break even in the second half of this year. 
Sika (SIX:SIKA) stock rose 3.9% after the construction chemicals maker posted its highest ever annual sales figure in 2021, while Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) stock climbed 2.3% after data from NielsenIQ showed the company was Britain's fastest growing food retailer in the key Christmas quarter.
ASML (AS:ASML) stock rose 1.5% with the semiconductor still in demand despite saying that some of its systems remained offline after last week’s fire at its Berlin factory.
Oil prices edged higher after two days of losses with the globe’s major suppliers continuing to struggle to increase output to match recovering demand.
The market is waiting on U.S. oil and product inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, later Tuesday, followed by data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $79.08 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1% to $81.64.

Did retail investors save the day? The Nasdaq, which fell more than 2% at one point on Monday managed to close in positive territory, as bargain hunters swept in.
It's a scenario seen repeatedly in the past year and often attributed to amateur traders. Buy buyside analysts were also out in force with buy-the-dip advice, noting that markets were well on their way to pricing the likelihood of four U.S. rate hikes this year, making further hawkish surprises harder.
Possibly, that's kept the dollar flatlining this month, well off 16-month highs touched at the end of November, while Treasury yields on Monday snapped a six-session rising streak. 
As we write, Wall Street futures appear undecided on direction though European shares are opening firmer. Bar any fresh news, markets will likely wait to see if Wednesday's U.S. consumer inflation print indeed breaches 7%, as anticipated.
In a reminder of global inflation pressures, a survey showed Japanese households' inflation expectations at a more than two-year high.
Policymakers seem calmly confident though they can avert runaway inflation; pre-released comments show Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will tell Congress the bank would ""prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched"".
And while euro area inflation is running at 5%, ECB chief economist Philip Lane says he does not see prices above the 2% target in the medium term. 
Markets for now remain conviced that the interest rate peak, the so-called terminal rate, will be lower than in previous cycles. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is among those warning that U.S. terminal rate pricing is too low. But with the Nasdaq market cap down more than $1.5 trillion this year, it may be bargain-hunting time. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
-""Grand Theft Auto"" video game maker Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive to buy Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) for $11 billion
- Britons splurged on eating at home pre-Xmas, shunned restaurants
- ECB President Christine Lagarde to speak

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 03:06AM ET</span>",Heathrow hit by Omicron cancellations in December,"LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's biggest airport Heathrow handled 19.4 million passengers in 2021, less than one quarter of pre-pandemic levels and lower than 2020, after Omicron sparked a run of cancellations in December. 
The airport to the west of London said on Tuesday that at least 600,000 passengers cancelled travel plans from Heathrow in December as new travel restrictions came into force. 
Britain's airports have been buffeted through the pandemic by waves of infections and travel restrictions that were introduced often at short notice, requiring passengers to take expensive tests or isolate to avoid spreading the virus. 
The airport said ""significant doubt"" remained over the speed of any recovery, with industry body IATA suggesting that passenger numbers will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2025. 
Heathrow handled 80.9 million customers in 2019 and 22.1 million in 2020. 

The group said that sparked enormous uncertainty for the UK aviation regulator in its role of setting passenger charges for the next five years, an issue that has enraged airlines as both sides try to recover from the pandemic.
""There are currently travel restrictions, such as testing, on all Heathrow routes - the aviation industry will only fully recover when these are all lifted and there is no risk that they will be reimposed at short notice, a situation which is likely to be years away,"" Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye said.

The reports have created a degree of optimism that the U.K. economy, one of the hardest hit by the Covid pandemic, may be weathering the Omicron variant better than the previous iterations of the virus.
Still, the major focus this week will be on the latest U.S. inflation data and what this means for the pace at which the Federal Reserve will normalize its monetary policy by, hiking interest rates and shrinking its balance sheet.

Dallas, Texas-based Capstone helps private equity firms find limited partners to invest in their funds, helping raise capital for global private equity, credit, and infrastructure firms. 
Following the acquisition, Capstone will come under Mizuho's holding company in the United States, where it is expected to help build out the Japanese bank's investment banking business, the person said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.
Mizuho does not plan to disclose the cost of the acquisition, the person added.
No one was immediately available for comment at Capstone's Dallas office outside normal working hours.
Mizuho, which has struggled at home to overcome a long-running series of system errors, is set to appoint senior executive officer Masahiro Kihara as its next chief executive to tackle the issue.
The Capstone purchase is in line with efforts by Japan's biggest banks to acquire more businesses overseas, particularly in faster-growing markets. 

Of the three megabanks, Mizuho has, however, been slower to move than bigger rivals Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group.

United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 President Kim Cordova said on Monday that King Soopers has not yet provided the information the union needs to evaluate its proposal, according to an update livestreamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
The only proposal during the three days of talks was from the union, which the company representatives asked them to revisit, said Liz Wesley, a store manager at Colorado Springs who has spent 17 years with the grocery chain.
""The (company) is not taking our proposals seriously,"" Wesley said. ""We want a better contract for us.""
The company has filed unfair practice charges against the union for refusing to bargain in good faith, King Soopers said on Monday.
King Soopers operates more than 100 stores in Colorado and is the No. 1 grocery chain by market share in the state. Its sales have boomed during the pandemic, with shares of its parent Kroger hitting a record high last week. 
Last month, King Soopers offered more than $145 million in new wages over the next four years, bringing the average hourly wage for 75% of associates to more than $18 and to over $20 for more than 50% of them. 
The union rejected the offer, following which the company sweetened it to $148 million in wages and signing bonuses over three years.
On Jan. 7, a day before the contract between the company and the workers in the Denver metropolitan area, and the cities of Broomfield, Parker and Boulder ended, the union warned of a strike from 5 a.m. (1200 GMT) on Wednesday.
King Soopers sought the help of a federal mediator, but Cordova rejected the move saying ""at this point in the process adding another presence is not going to be productive"".

This comes after the union last month filed a lawsuit against the grocery chain for violating an agreement by using third-party services to hire workers that then paid them wages starting at $16 per hour, more than the wage rate for many King Soopers workers.
The company said the union has not given any indication of when they will return to the negotiation process.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Investment inflows into Chinese government bonds (CGBs) pushed offshore holdings of the instruments to record highs in 2021, but at a slower pace as diverging monetary policy between China and the United States ate away at Chinese bonds' yield premiums.
CGB holdings by offshore investors stood at a record 2.45 trillion yuan ($384.51 billion) at the end of December, according to data released Monday evening by China Central Depository and Clearing Co (CCDC), the main depository institution for China's interbank bond market.
That was up 30.7% from a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations of the data, slower than a 43.7% increase logged in 2020. 
Holdings of quasi-sovereign bonds issued by China's policy banks rose 1% on the month to a record 1.08 trillion yuan. That was up 18% from a year earlier, compared with an 84.4% jump in 2020.
The slower rise reflected a narrowing spread between Chinese and U.S. yields, with the 10-year yield gap falling nearly 100 basis points to 124.52 basis points by the end of December. The drop nearly reversed the move in 2020, when foreign holdings of CGBs rose at their fastest annual pace on record.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) analysts Becky Liu and Jeffrey Zhang said that they expect Chinese rates to continue to fall in the first quarter of 2022 on more policy easing, slow growth and weak issuance, but that they could rise on higher supply and stabilising growth in subsequent quarters. 
""(The year) 2022 will see a rare divergence of monetary policy between China and most DM economies ... We see a risk of more material monetary policy easing in H1, including more broad-based reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cuts, in addition to targeted measures through re-lending and re-discounting facilities,"" they said in a note. 
Nevertheless, ""foreign inflows may rise steadily to CNY700-800bn, on relatively high carry and likely better return,"" they said.

Additional interbank market holdings data from Shanghai Clearing House was not yet available on Tuesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group will appoint senior executive officer Masahiro Kihara as its next chief executive who will be tasked with tackling long-running system failures, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The depth of those problems at Japan's No. 3 lender was underscored again on Tuesday when Mizuho's main banking arm reported yet another disruption.
The latest glitch affected its corporate online banking services, with some corporate clients unable to log into the system, a spokesperson said. It was fixed after a few hours.
A separate source said Mizuho will announce the new chief on Monday, when it reports measures to prevent system failures to the banking regulators after they reprimanded the bank for ""undermining the credibility of Japan's bank settlement system.""
The sources declined to be identified as the matter is still private. A Mizuho spokesperson said nothing has been decided.

Kihara, a graduate of Duke University School of Law, joined one of Mizuho's predecessor banks, Industrial Bank of Japan, in 1989. He also worked at the group's securities arm. The 56-year-old Kihara is the elder brother of deputy chief cabinet secretary Seiji Kihara.

The dispute began after company Chairman Edward Rogers, the only son of the company's late founder Ted Rogers, attempted to drop Joe Natale as CEO in September last year, saying he had lost confidence in Natale's ability to lead the company through the C$20 billion ($15.81 billion) acquisition deal of smaller rival Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR) Inc and replace him with Staffieri.
However, Rogers failed to win the board's support, leading to Staffieri, the then chief financial officer, leaving the company. Besides, Rogers' attempt to oust Natale put him at odds with his mother and two sisters, who are also the company's directors. 
Thereafter, Rogers lost out in the power struggle and was removed as the chairman, but got reinstated in November.

Staffieri, who was appointed as the interim CEO in November, has more than 30 years of experience in the telecoms, media, sports and financial sectors, including nine years as Rogers' CFO. He also held senior positions at BCE (NYSE:BCE) Inc prior to joining Rogers.

The legislation is expected to get a Senate vote this week after both parties struck a deal last month, in which Cruz released his hold on dozens of Biden ambassador nominations. The deal requires the bill to get 60 votes -- a high hurdle in the 50-50 Senate. The bill would also have to pass in the House and be signed by President Joe Biden, a Democrat.
Several senators told reporters that the administration officials were persuasive. Senator Chris Murphy said they made the case that Cruz's bill could harm relations with Germany's new government right when Washington needs its support to pressure Russia against an invasion of Ukraine. 
""I think their case is right,"" Murphy said. ""The Cruz amendment would make a Russian invasion more likely. There's no sense to be sanctioning the new German government when they have just switched their position to finally put the pipeline on ice."" 
The pipeline to take Russian gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany was finished in September but may not be approved until the middle of the year after Germany has slowed approvals.
Germany's ruling coalition is divided over Nord Stream 2, with the Social Democrats supporting the pipeline as the country is hungry for natural gas after shutting nuclear and coal plants. But one of its junior coalition partners, the Greens, oppose Nord Stream 2.
U.S. and Russian officials met on Monday in Geneva as Washington tries to dissuade Moscow from a new invasion of Ukraine after massing nearly 100,000 troops along its border.
The Biden administration has opposed Nord Stream 2 as it would bypass Ukraine, depriving it of lucrative transit fees, and potentially undermining its struggle against Russia.
But last year the administration lifted sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company controlling the project, to smooth relations with Germany and other European allies that became soured after former President Donald Trump ditched agreements on climate, Iran and other issues.
Senator Dick Durbin said legislation being formed by fellow Democratic Senator Robert Menendez is preferable and sends a ""strong message to Putin."" Still, Durbin said he did not know when a vote on Menendez's legislation would come. 
Senator Tim Kaine, said if an alternate to the Cruz bill emerges he wants to compare them. Kaine said he had a number of worries about a measure in Cruz's bill that would allow Congress to vote to reinstate sanctions should the president waive them. 
Ned Price, the State Department spokesperson said last week Cruz's bill would undermine the united front in response to Russia. 

Senator Jon Tester did not say whether he would vote against the Cruz bill, but said the Biden officials made a ""very salient"" point about needing Germany's support against a reinvasion of Ukraine by Russia. 
""The message was it would hurt the negotiations that have been going on with Germany ... in regards to Russia's impact on Ukraine,"" Tester said. ""We got to make sure if we're going to do sanctions, the sanctions are focused on the problem and not on collateral,"" Tester said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Tuesday morning, even as Australia released better-than-expected retail sales data.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.28% by 9:02 PM ET (2:02 AM GMT), re-opening after a holiday. South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.44%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.85%, with retail sales growing 7.3% month-on-month in November. The trade balance was AUD9.423 billion.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.50%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.12% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.29%. The country will release its consumer and producer price indexes on Wednesday.
Investors continue to monitor the impact of central banks’ tightening of their monetary policies and the spread of the omicron COVID-19 variant.
“We think eventually this market will shift back toward growth, but we still got some wood to chop there; the valuations haven’t corrected,” RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Bloomberg.
“This is a repricing, it’s painful, it has a little bit more ways to go.”
The U.S. Treasury curve flattened, with short-dated yields climbing sharply as bets of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike in March 2022 increased and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted four hikes in 2022, starting that month.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy was expanding at a fast pace, and the central bank will prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched, ahead of the Senate confirmation hearing for his re-nomination later in the day. Powell also cautioned that the post-COVID-19 economy could look different from the previous expansion.
The U.S. Senate Banking Committee will also hold a hearing for Fed vice-chair nominee Lael Brainard on Thursday. Other Fed officials due to speak later in the day are Kansas City Fed President Esther George and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
On the data front, the U.S. will release the consumer price index and the Fed Beige Book on Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.
Giving investor sentiment a boost, however, New York’s virus infections may have reached a peak around a month after the first omicron case was identified in the area.  Pfizer  Inc.

(Reuters) -""Grand Theft Auto"" video game maker Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive said on Monday it would buy Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) for $11.04 billion in a cash-and-stock deal that will add popular mobile titles such as ""FarmVille"" under its umbrella as demand surges for on-the-go gaming.
The deal, the largest ever in the sector, will create a gaming powerhouse with a market cap of nearly $30 billion, spanning console, PC and mobile devices at a time that more people are gaming on their smartphones.
Take-Two, also known for adventure game ""Red Dead Redemption"", offered $3.50 in cash and $6.361 in shares for each Zynga share, a 64% premium to the last closing price. Including debt, the acquisition is worth $12.7 billion.
""It's a bombshell deal ... Zynga was on the list of potential M&A transactions for a long time in the video game business,"" said Serkan Toto, CEO of videogame consulting firm Kantan Games.
""Take-Two is looking at the industry map and says 'we have basically nothing here.' So, a lot of people have been have been expecting Take-Two to make a big deal in mobile to close the gap with competitors like Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) for example.""
Zynga shares surged 45% on Monday, but were still a dollar and change short of the offer price, while Take-Two fell about 15%.
The deal is expected to close in the first half of this year. There is also a go-shop period of 45 days, meaning Zynga can negotiate with other buyers for a better offer until Feb. 24. 
The two companies have held talks off and on in the past year, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The latest round of negotiation came late last year, as Zynga shed more than a third of its market value, the biggest drop among major game publishers. Zynga has reeled from falling engagement levels and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s move to allow iPhone users to opt out of being tracked by advertisers. 
""It is a big price tag for a company that has not consistently produced profits or new blockbusters,"" said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.
But with the mobile gaming market likely to reach a size of $116.4 billion by 2024, according to data firm Newzoo, some analysts said more deals were expected in the sector.
""This trend won't stop here. Many of the console developers are finding out that creating mobile games is difficult,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Franco Granda.
Crypto and the metaverse are potential growth opportunities, but mobile gaming is proven to work, he said. 

Take-Two expects about $100 million in annual cost savings within the first two years, and more than $500 million in net bookings over time when the deal closes in mid-2022.
JP Morgan and LionTree advised Take-Two while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) advised Zynga on the sale.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 08:36PM ET</span>",Nasdaq ekes out gain in late session comeback,"By Sinéad Carew and Caroline Valetkevitch
(Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes staged a late-session comeback on Monday as the Nasdaq managed to eke out a tiny gain and investors swooped in to hunt for bargains, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished well above their session lows.
After falling almost 3% earlier in the day and as much as 10.37% below its intraday record level reached on Nov. 22, the technology-heavy Nasdaq pointed sharply higher to regain all its losses for the day in afternoon trading. 
While investors spent the morning fretting about rising bond yields and what this week's inflation data might mean for U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening, others took advantage of earlier nerves to buy the dip.
""We've gotten to the point where you wonder if the roller coaster has peaked and is heading straight down. But fundamentally there's a lot of buyers in this market buying on the dip,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner of Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey who attributed much of the afternoon strength to retail investors buying favorite stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago also attributed the late session comeback to dip-buyers looking at U.S. Treasury yields fall from their peaks of the day. 
""Some of the tech names are off 5 to 10 percent or more, and people are looking at that and going that looks pretty good - time to snap them up,"" said Nolte.
""The other thing though to keep an eye on is what happens to interest rates because that has really been what's been dragging technology. We saw little bit of a reversal late in the day in (Treasury yields). They came down just a touch and that was a little bit of a green light for tech investors,"" he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 162.79 points, or 0.45%, to 36,068.87, the S&P 500 lost 6.74 points, or 0.14%, to 4,670.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.93 points, or 0.05%, to 14,942.83.
After starting the day among the biggest laggards, the S&P technology index managed to eke out a tiny gain of 0.1%, behind the healthcare sector which closed up 1% and ahead of communications services which, rising 0.02%, was the session's only other gainer among the 11 major industry sectors. 
The biggest decliners on the day were industrials which closed down 1.2% and materials which dropped 0.99%. 
Traders have ramped up their rate hike expectations since the Fed's minutes from the December meeting appeared to signal an earlier-than-expected rate rise.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it expects the Fed to raise rates four times in 2022, compared to its previous forecast of three.
Earlier the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to its highest level in nearly two years on Monday.
After falling as much as 4.6% earlier in the session, Nasdaq heavyweight Tesla made a dramatic turnaround to close up 3%.
Meckler said retail investors appeared to flood back into the stock which had suffered after Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the electric carmaker will raise the U.S. price of its advanced driver assistant software. 
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) shares closed down 4.2% after HSBC downgraded the stock to ""hold."" 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.97-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 69 new highs and 609 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges 12.15 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.55 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

By Clare Jim and Marc Jones
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - China's property sector saw more drama on Monday after reports Shimao - investment grade-rated until a couple of months ago - had put all its projects up for sale, and Evergrande attempted to avoid another high-profile default. 
More unwelcome surprises this month have meant no let up in the Chinese property crisis that wiped over a trillion dollars off the sector last year.
Monday's twists saw Shimao Group's credit rating cut again by both S&P and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) after it unexpectedly defaulted on a ""trust loan"" last week, although its shares surged nearly 20% on reports it was in talks about asset sales with state-backed giant China Vanke.
China Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer that first triggered the turmoil last year, said it had moved out of its Shenzhen headquarters to cut costs. 
The company kept a glimmer of hope alive that its first ""onshore"" Chinese yuan bond default might still be avoided by extending until Thursday a deadline for bondholders to agree to a six-month, 4.5 billion yuan ($157 million) payment deferral. 
Chinese property firms have faced unprecedented pressure over the last six months following efforts by Beijing to curb overborrowing in the sector.
Reuters reported last week that the government now plans to make it easier for state-backed property developers to buy up assets of struggling private rivals.
But the sector's cash crunch is expected to intensify too with firms needing to make nearly $40 billion of international bond payments over the next six months according to brokerage Nomura, including almost $1.5 billion this week alone.
One of those likely to be highlighted alongside Evergrande on Thursday will be Guangzhou R&F Properties. Its bonds have slumped to deeply distressed levels ahead of a $750 million bond payment due that day. It also has a number of unfinished mega projects in global cities like London. 
""I think the worst might be yet to come"" said Himanshu Porwal, emerging markets corporate credit analyst at Seaport Global.
""A lot will depend on what the Chinese government does in terms of liquidity measures... But it has been four months already so I don't know what they would be waiting for.""
NEW LOWS
The woes of recent days have seen ICE (NYSE:ICE)'s China high-yield debt index, which is dominated by homebuilders, hit an all-time low, while Evergrande and fellow-defaulter Kaisa have seen their bonds ejected from J.P. Morgan's closely followed emerging market corporate debt index. 
S&P and Moody's both cut Shimao's rating deeper into the junk category on Monday and warned of potential for a further downgrade. 
S&P, which had rated Shimao investment grade as recently as November, cut it by a full two notches. It said, ""The decline is worse than we previously anticipated. We now assess the company's liquidity to be weak.""
Moody's and Fitch also downgraded Yuzhou Group due to increased refinancing risk while Moody's withdrew the rating of another firm, Yango, due to ""insufficient information.""
Separately, small developer Modern Land, which missed payment for its 12.85% notes due in October said in a filing on Monday that it has received notices from certain noteholders demanding early repayment of their senior notes.
The developer said it has been discussing a waiver with these creditors and has appointed financial advisers to formulate a plan. It is also in talks on a restructuring plan for $1.3 billion of its offshore bonds, the firm added.
Modern Land shares, which resumed trading after being suspended since Oct. 21, sank 40% in Hong Kong to HK$0.23. 
""It's going to be the peak of repayment period and we'll see more developers default,"" said Kington Lin, managing director of the asset management department at Canfield Securities Limited.

""The market is watching how many SOEs (state-owned enterprises) will get more M&A loans to help the developers in distress.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Five U.S. college graduates have sued 16 major U.S. universities including Yale, Columbia and the University of Chicago, accusing them of colluding to limit financial aid to undergraduate students in violation of antitrust laws.
The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status, saying the collusion has limited price competition and caused 170,000 financial aid recipients to be overcharged hundreds of millions of dollars over two decades.
The 16 schools are members of the 568 Presidents Group, a consortium of colleges that discuss common financial aid principles.
""Elite, private universities like defendants are gatekeepers to the American Dream,"" the plaintiffs wrote. ""Defendants' misconduct is therefore particularly egregious because it has narrowed a critical pathway to upward mobility.""
Yale and Columbia did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. A University of Chicago spokesperson declined to comment. A message sent to a website for the 568 President's Group was not immediately acknowledged.
Tuition increases at private U.S. universities have outpaced inflation in recent decades, according to the College Board.
Undergraduate tuition at Yale and Columbia for the current academic year is $59,950 and $60,514, respectively, excluding room and board, according to the schools' websites. 
The lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court seeks unspecified triple damages for financial aid recipients who have attended the schools since 2003, as well as for their parents.

Many schools offer financial aid based on family income, known as need-based aid. 
Universities in the 568 Presidents Group say they are need-blind, meaning they do not consider financial aid in admissions decisions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Starbucks cafe in Buffalo, New York, became the second unionized company-owned  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) location in the United States after the federal labor board on Monday certified the results of last month's election there. 
Baristas at the company's cafes in at least seven other cities have said since last fall that they also want to organize.
The union, called Workers United, had challenged several ballots for the Genesee Street location because it claimed the employees actually worked at a different store. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) agreed with Workers United that the ballots should be tossed out, making the final vote 15-9 in favor of the union.
The global coffee chain has 10 days to ask for a review of the NLRB's decision.
""We've been clear in our belief that we are better together as partners, without a union between us at Starbucks, and that conviction has not changed,"" a spokesman said.
The company is evaluating its options and believes the employees whose ballots were set aside should be able to vote, he said.
Employees at the first Buffalo store to be certified, on Elmwood Avenue, walked out a week ago in protest at what they said were unsafe, understaffed conditions amid a new wave of COVID-19 infections that has sickened workers and slowed service at many restaurants. 
They went back to work on Monday.

""We said we weren't going to put customers or partners at risk until we had enough staff to operate safely. As of Monday, we believe we can now do that,"" said Michelle Eisen, a union organizer and employee at the store.
The store also returned to the more frequent hand washing and cafe sanitization routines that employees had requested, said Jaz Brisack, a barista there.

However, apparel retailer Abercrombie said it had seen a pickup in post-holiday sales, sending its shares up 6.7% in extended trading.
Big Lots said it has seen a slowdown in traffic and sales trends since early January, driven by the rapid spread of Omicron and adverse weather conditions, sending its shares down 6.3% in extended trade.
Abercrombie said it did not have enough inventory to keep pace with customer demand during the fourth quarter, resulting in lost sales during the peak holiday shopping season. However, post holiday, much of the inventory landed, helping it see an acceleration in sales, Chief Executive Officer Fran Horowitz said.
The company, which owns the Hollister apparel brand, expects net sales for the fourth quarter ended December to rise 4% to 6%, or $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion, from the year-ago quarter.
Analysts, on an average, expect fourth-quarter sales for Abercrombie at $1.24 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marko Kolanovic, chief global markets strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), believes Wall Street's recent sell-off presents a buying opportunity.
Four days after reaching an all-time closing high, the S&P 500 has fallen 2.6%, an inauspicious beginning to a new year fraught with inflation worries, a more hawkish Federal Reserve, and spiking infections of the COVID Omicron variant.
But calling the pull-back in risk assets ""arguably overdone,"" Kolanovic believes that going forward, there is ""more room for the Fed to surprise on the dovish than hawkish side.""
Further, he believes that while Omicron presents some downside risk, he also sees it becoming a positive for markets.

""After all, if a less severe and more transmissible strain quickly crowds out more severe variants, it could transform a deadly pandemic into something more similar to a seasonal flu,"" Kolanovic wrote.
While acknowledging the possibility of a dip in large cap stocks pulling down the broader market, the note says that ""despite this week's volatility, there is a good chance we are coming to the end of this period of fragile sentiment, although it may take a few weeks for the market to process the Fed's incremental changes and Omicron's beneficial (yes, beneficial) impact as the more dominant, less severe strain.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday despite staging a comeback late in the day, as bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as March led investors to pare risky assets and lifted the 10-year Treasury yield to a two-year high.
Monday's drop follows a bruising first week of the year when a strong signal from the Fed that it would tighten policy faster to tackle inflation and then data showing a strong U.S. labor market, unnerved investors who had pushed equities to record highs over the holiday period.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.45%, and the S&P 500 lost 0.14%. 
Technology stocks, which have soared in the past two years thanks in part to very low interest rates, led the falls early in the day but rallied later in the session to leave the Nasdaq Composite up just 0.05%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.48% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.26%.
""The big story of the first week of the new year has been the steady march higher in U.S. treasury yields,"" said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Holdings Corp. 
Hogan recommended investors put more money in financial, industrial and energy stocks as they will likely benefit from strong economic growth expected in the months ahead.
Some of Wall Street's biggest banks now expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates four times this year, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) sees the Fed beginning the process of reducing its balance sheet size as soon as July. 
A busy week sees U.S. inflation data due on Wednesday, which analysts say could show core inflation climbing to its highest in decades at 5.4%, a level that would all but confirm a U.S. rate rise is coming in March. The season of corporate earnings also kicks off this week with the big U.S. banks reporting from Friday onwards. [
Rate futures now imply a greater than 70% chance of a rise to 0.25% in March and at least two more hikes by year end.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of Wall Street's biggest banks now expect four U.S. interest increases this year starting in March, a more aggressive call than a week ago even as the situation remains fluid given the possibility that the supply shock to the economy could ease and consumer prices could stabilize.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P.Morgan, and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) all issued research notes forecasting that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy at least four times in 2022, more than a broad consensus from as recently as late December for three hikes.
Goldman also sees the Fed starting the process of reducing its more than $8 trillion balance sheet, or so-called ""quantitative tightening"" (QT) as soon as July.
J.P.Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC on Monday, meanwhile, he ""would be surprised if it's just four increases this year,"" adding that those four hikes ""would be very easy for the economy to absorb."" 
In predicting the four rate increases, Deutsche, in a research note on Friday, said the U.S. economy showed more progress toward maximum employment. The German bank expects the Fed's balance sheet run-off to begin in the third quarter.
Some investors believe, however, that U.S. inflation may be nearing its peak.
""We are already seeing supply chain kinks ease, and all other things being equal even without the rate hikes, we are seeing inflation rolling over probably later this quarter,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago.
""We will still see probably white-knuckle numbers this week. This is about where we are expecting inflation to peak. What will happen is the natural cycle is going to help the Fed and whether they do three rate hikes or two this year, we just don't see inflation running that hot for that long.""
Easing supply chain issues were already evident in a U.S. manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management released last week.
U.S. manufacturing activity cooled in December amid slowing demand for goods, with supply constraints starting to ease and a measure of prices paid for inputs by factories falling by the most in a decade. 
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 58.7 last month, the lowest level since January 2021, while the survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers tumbled to 68.2 last month, the lowest level since November 2020, from 82.4 in November. The 14.2-point plunge was the biggest since October 2011. 
""The inflation data will remain elevated but there are indications that make it seem as if everything is somewhat peaking, even on the wage inflation side,"" said Jim Barnes, director of fixed income at Bryn Mawr Trust in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.
""The problem is we are not going to be able to confirm that for another month until we start getting some additional data that is a little more down the road.""
Fed funds futures on Monday have implied about 3.5 rate hikes this year, 2.7 hikes in 2023, and 0.7 hikes in 2024. 

Since the release last week of the Fed minutes of its December policy meeting, the markets have priced the terminal rate, or the peak of the hiking cycle, at 1.8%, according to eurodollar futures' view of U.S. rates in three years from the first expected hike in March, higher from about 1.4% a month ago. 
That rate was still well below the Fed's U.S. central bank's view of 2.5%, and lower still than the revised core inflation estimate of 2.6% next year.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 05:37PM ET</span>",Fed's Clarida to resign two weeks early amid trading controversy,"By Ann Saphir and Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida, the second-in-command at the U.S. central bank who led its comprehensive monetary policy framework review, will resign on Jan. 14, the Fed said on Monday, leaving roughly two weeks before the end of his term. 
Clarida's resignation followed reports that he corrected his previous financial disclosure late last month to show he sold a stock fund and then swiftly repurchased it shortly before the Fed announced a barrage of rescue programs to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
His term was set to expire on Jan. 31, and U.S. President Joe Biden has nominated Fed Governor Lael Brainard to take his spot on the Fed's board.
The timing of the departure means Clarida will not be at the Fed's policy-setting meeting in late January, when officials are set to debate when to raise interest rates and how to start shrinking the central bank's $8 trillion-plus balance sheet as it responds to high inflation.
In his position as vice chair, Clarida led the 2019 monetary policy framework review and serves as a top advisor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said in a statement on Monday that Clarida's work ""will leave a lasting impact in the field of central banking.""
The framework review resulted in a new approach in which the Fed would no longer respond to strong employment numbers in anticipation of higher inflation, instead waiting for the price increases to materialize. 

Policymakers rolled out the new framework in August 2020, following years in which inflation ran below the Fed's 2% target. The central bank is now discussing raising interest rates sooner than expected and reducing its bond holdings later this year as it battles inflation substantially above its target, according to minutes from its Dec. 14-15 policy meeting.
Clarida's term at the Fed began in September of 2018 after he was nominated by former President Donald Trump. He has worked as an economics professor at Columbia University and was a managing director at the investment firm Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO).

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 05:20PM ET</span>",Tesla signs deal for first U.S. nickel supply with Talon Metals,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has signed its first U.S. nickel supply deal, choosing Talon Metals Corp's Tamarack mine project in Minnesota due to plans to make the electric vehicle battery metal in a way it considers more environmentally friendly.
The deal, announced on Monday, comes as demand for nickel is expected to jump over the next decade as EVs go mainstream. Nickel bolsters energy storage in a battery's cathode, which in turn extends an EV's range.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk in 2020 pleaded with the mining industry to produce more nickel ""in an environmentally sensitive way."" Musk also derided U.S. nickel production as ""objectively very lame"".
By sourcing from Talon's Minnesota project, a joint venture with Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) slated to open by 2026, Musk secures a key U.S. source of the metal for Tesla battery factories in Texas and Nevada, while also reducing the company's supply lines. The automaker last year signed nickel supply deals with BHP in Australia and from New Caledonia. 
Indonesia is the world's largest nickel producer, but miners there typically use energy-intensive technology to extract the metal and deploy controversial waste disposal practices, including dumping waste rock in waterways.
Talon Metals plans to use technology it hopes will allow it to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and chemically bind it - and thus permanently store it - to rocks found inside its Tamarack project in northern Minnesota. The process, which is still being tested, would effectively let Talon market nickel as carbon neutral, a huge appeal for Musk and Tesla. 
""Responsible sourcing of battery materials has long been a focus for Tesla,"" Drew Baglino, a Tesla executive, said in a press release. 
Tesla plans to buy 75,000 tonnes of nickel concentrate over six years, as well as smaller amounts of cobalt and iron ore, at London Metals Exchange-listed prices. It was not immediately clear where Tesla will refine the nickel concentrate. The United States does not have a nickel refinery.
Shares of Talon were halted just before the news was released. Shares of Tesla closed Monday up 3%. 

""Talon is excited to support Tesla's mission to accelerate the transition to renewable energy,"" Henri van Rooyen, Talon's CEO, said in a statement. 
In 2020, the automaker inked a deal for lithium supply with Piedmont Lithium Inc for its Texas battery plant, but the deal was halted last year amidst rising opposition in North Carolina to Piedmont's proposed mine.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Jana Partners LLC, the activist investor that successfully pushed for big changes including sales at portfolio companies, told investors that its JSI Benchmark A portfolio returned 30% after fees last year, two sources said on Monday.
The gains were fueled by campaigns at Vonage Holdings (NASDAQ:VG) Corp, which sold itself, and Laboratory Corp of America (NYSE:LH) Holdings, which announced a $2.5 billion share buy-back and plans to pay a dividend.
The portfolio's gains last year beat the benchmark HFRI Activist Index' 19% return, as record setting market gains helped investors.
Over the last three years, the JSI Benchmark A portfolio returned an average 30% a year after fees, the investors said.
The Jana Strategic Investment fund, structured more like a private equity fund, returned 26% after fees last year, said the sources who are not permitted to discuss the private funds' returns. Since its 2010 founding, the JSI fund returned an average 18% a year, one source said.
Jana Partners also filed a preliminary prospectus for its second special purpose acquisition company called Osprey Technology Acquisition Corp II.
A spokesman declined to comment.
The numbers come three years after Jana, founded by Barry Rosenstein in 2001, announced the closing of its event-driven funds. 
The firm manages $1.6 billion in its activist strategy and is best known for having pushed for changes at Whole Foods that led to the sale to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It is among the most successful of its type, shunning the limelight and trying to work collaboratively with target companies, said industry investors and other fund managers.
Research firm Gordon Haskett named Jana its ""activist of the year."" 
""Nobody catalyzed more action or was around the hoop more consistently than Jana,"" analyst Don Bilson wrote.
A large share of Jana's returns are directly related to work the firm did to make changes at target companies and did not come from gains in fast growing technology companies or private investments, which Jana does not own.
Shares of Vonage Holdings rose 59% between May and November when the company announced a sale to Ericsson (BS:ERICAs). LabCorp's stock price climbed 54% as Jana urged a strategic review. Jana also pushed for a sale of data center company Cyrus One which was taken private by buyout firms KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) and Global Infrastructure Partners.
Now it is pushing to break up Encompass Health (NYSE:EHC), scuttle Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN)'s planned purchase of Momentive Global and get Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY) to consider strategic alternatives.

The German carmaker was well-hedged against inflation, Antlitz told the Journal https://www.wsj.com/articles/vw-finance-chief-expects-inflation-to-ease-and-chip-shortage-to-drag-on-11641843428?mod=latest_headlines on Monday, adding that the company had mitigated the impact of raw material and component price increases through rigorous cost-cutting.
According to the report, he said the current high inflation will be temporary, but the company would continue to struggle with a tight supply of chips throughout the year.

Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in December had said the chip crunch would continue to pose challenges to Europe's largest carmaker during at least the first half of 2022, while the year as a whole should show a slight improvement.
The tight chip supply has led automakers around the world to curtail vehicle production, but has also driven up profit as vehicle prices rise.

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 04:56PM ET</span>",Airbus keeps top planemaker spot with 8% delivery rise,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus kept its crown as the world's largest jetmaker for the third year running as it outstripped Boeing (NYSE:BA) by delivering 611 jets in 2021, up 8% from the year before, company data showed on Monday.
The numbers gave Airbus an unassailable lead on revenue-generating deliveries - the industry's main yardstick - after Boeing handed over 302 jets in the first 11 months.
After slashing production due mainly to the pandemic, planemakers are seeing more demand for medium-haul passenger jets and freighters, despite global concern over Omicron.
Reuters reported last week that Airbus' auditors, who must validate each delivery, were torn between a tally of 605 or 611 jets after last-minute handovers took the total above an official target of 600. The outcome confirms the top end of the range. 
Airbus said it sold 771 airplanes in 2021, giving a net total of 507 after cancellations, almost twice the 2020 level.
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury called this the ""first fruits of a recovery"" and added: ""Demand is real"".
Boeing is rebounding more slowly as it tackles the aftermath of a 737 MAX safety crisis and negotiates snags that suspended deliveries of its wide-body 787 Dreamliner.
Recent changes in accounting rules and sharp swings in airline fortunes during the COVID-19 crisis have made it harder to compare the underlying performance of the two plane giants. 
With Airbus well ahead on deliveries, the winner on new orders depends on which accounting definition for net orders investors prefer when Boeing publishes data on Tuesday. 
Based on partial 2021 data, Boeing looks set to at least match Airbus on net orders on an adjusted basis after a recent deal with Allegiant for 50 737 MAX that surfaced last week.
For the first 11 months of 2021, orders rebounded sharply to 829 planes but fell to a net total of 400 after cancellations.
On an adjusted basis, Boeing posted 457 net orders by end-November after partially restoring to its count orders that it at one point had deemed unlikely to materialise.
Barring surprise new orders, the Airbus data suggests Boeing faces a harder task in matching its arch-rival in net orders on an unadjusted basis.
PRODUCTION PLANS INTACT
Airbus starts 2022 with some momentum. Recent orders from Air France-KLM and Qantas have yet to be counted.
It reported a new sale on Monday of 22 A220 small jets to Azorra, a Florida leasing firm.
Boeing continues to dominate booming sales of freighters as lockdowns boost e-shopping. Airbus did book the first orders for a new A350 freighter - albeit partially by swapping existing orders for passenger versions to the cargo planes.
Faury said production plans for the wide-body A350 had not been impacted by a dispute with Qatar Airways over surface problems on existing jets.
He reaffirmed plans to lift production of the smaller A320 family, which competes with the Boeing 737 in the busiest part of the market, by around 30% to 65 a month by summer 2023. 
Airbus expects to decide midyear whether to push that even higher despite resistance from leasing companies and engine makers that benefit from getting the most out of existing jets.

Like Boeing, Airbus carries out an accounting exercise to reflect the likelihood of some planes not being delivered. But it applies this to the value of cumulative orders once a year, rather than expressing it in the number of planes affected. 
Analysts say adopting the same methodology as Boeing would imply a lower number of net orders for Airbus than the 507 published for 2021, but the extent of the gap is unclear.

Bourla said Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) are working on both an Omicron-targeted vaccine version as well as a shot that would include both the previous vaccine as well as one targeted at the fast-spreading variant. 
""I think it is the most likely scenario,"" Bourla said, speaking at J.P. Morgan's annual healthcare conference, which is being held virtually this year. ""We're working on higher doses. We're working different schedules. We're doing a lot of things right now, as we speak."" 
Bourla said Pfizer could be ready to file for U.S. regulatory approval for a redesigned vaccine and launch it as soon as March. Bourla said Pfizer has built up so much manufacturing capacity for the vaccine that it will not be a problem to switch immediately.
COVID-19 vaccines eventually could be an annual shot for most people, Bourla said, and some high-risk groups might be eligible to receive the shots more often than that.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc CEO Stephane Bancel said last week that people could need another shot this fall, as the efficacy of boosters is likely to decline over the next few months.
An Omicron-driven spike in COVID-19 cases has forced some nations to look to another booster dose, but early signs suggest repeat vaccination may be a hard sell.
Pfizer earlier in the day announced three deals to broaden the use of the messenger RNA technology (mRNA) that its COVID-19 vaccine was based on, including a pact worth as much as $1.35 billion with gene-editing specialist Beam Therapeutics.
The U.S. drugmaker has been looking to advance the development of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics after it led global efforts to develop a COVID-19 shot against the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company will also collaborate with Codex DNA Inc to leverage the biotech's proprietary technology, which could enable more efficient development of mRNA-based vaccines, therapeutics and other biopharma products.
Its deal with private biotech Acuitas Therapeutics will focus on the use of the Vancouver-based company's lipid nanoparticle technology for developing up to 10 vaccines or therapeutics.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Heavy rainfall in southeastern Brazil has prompted miners including Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) to suspend some operations, they said on Monday, after downpours caused deadly floods in the northeast and threatened to delay harvests in the midwest.
Rainfall is expected to remain heavy this week in most of top mining state Minas Gerais, after runoff closed roads and railways.
The rains may also have contributed to the dramatic collapse https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/death-toll-brazil-waterfall-rock-face-collapse-rises-10-2022-01-09 of a canyon rock face in the state on Saturday, killing 10 people visiting a waterfall on boats.
In the northeastern state of Bahia, flooding https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/christmas-our-dreams-turns-nightmare-brazil-floods-level-homes-2021-12-28 displaced about 50,000 families and killed some two dozen over the holidays.
Vale said on Monday it has partially suspended operations at its Southeastern and Southern iron ore systems due to the bad weather, but reaffirmed its 2022 production target as the Northern system was not affected. 
Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP, also cut back operations in its Germano complex, producing at an estimated 50% of capacity until weather allows it to ramp up.
Brazilian steelmakers Usiminas (OTC:USNZY) and Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) also halted operations of their mining units.
 Anglo American  (LON:AAL) said its Minas-Rio system continued to operate as planned during the rainy season.
Over the weekend, France's Vallourec paused its Pau Branco mine after heavy rainfall caused a dike to overflow.
""We see the news as potentially negative for the entire mining sector, as it could result in new regulations to suspend existing operations or delay new projects,"" analysts at XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investimentos said in a research note.
BTG Pactual analysts said economic impacts could be muted if normal operations are restored quickly, but noted it all depends on how long the heavy rainfall will last. 
""We estimate there could be more than 100 million tonnes of annualized iron ore supply at risk at this stage in Brazil, which is a relevant number (roughly 7% of seaborne supply and about 30% of Brazilian supply), so clearly the stakes are high and we could see impacts on short-term iron ore movements,"" they said.
INTERRUPTED RAILWAYS, CLOSED HIGHWAYS
Vale said in a securities filing that train circulation at its Vitoria-Minas railway was partially interrupted by the rains, halting output at the Brucutu mine and the Mariana complex due to a lack of transportation.
Both mines are part of Vale's Southeastern system, along with the Itabira complex, where production was not affected.
In the Southern system, Vale said all of its complexes had to halt production because key highways BR-040 and MG-030 were closed.
Vale said its Northern System is still operating as planned, and maintained its 2022 iron ore production forecast at 320-335 million tonnes. It noted its production plan takes into account the seasonal rainfall impact.
The miner also said the rains had not changed the alert level for any of its tailing dams which are under constant, ""real-time"" monitoring.
""While Vale did not change its production guidance for 2022, we believe that the market could start to project volumes closer to the low end of the range,"" Itau BBA analysts said, noting that iron ore prices could be supported at their current high levels.
Vale's two halted operations accounted for about 31% of its output in the first nine months of 2021, the Itau BBA analysts said. A two-week halt in these operations could represent an impact of about 3 million tonnes for the company, according to their preliminary calculations.
Steelmaker Usiminas announced a stoppage at its mining subsidiary Mineracao Usiminas (MUSA) due to weather, but said it had enough inventory of raw material to avoid disruption.
The company also said its Barragem Central tailings dam, which has been inactive since 2014, reached alert level 1 - an initial warning that does not mean a safety breach was noted.
CSN and its steel mining subsidiary CSN Mineracao SA announced a halt to operations of the Casa de Pedra mine, but said they are expected to resume in coming days.
They said port operations at the Itaguai coal terminal, located in the neighboring state of Rio de Janeiro, were also suspended due to excessive rains.

On Sunday, Brazil's regulatory National Mining Agency (ANM) suspended operations at French steel pipe maker Vallourec's Pau Branco iron ore mine in the state after a dike overflowed, cutting off a federal highway. There were no reported injuries.
""After the dam incidents of the past, we welcome the zero tolerance approach that miners are taking in the country to minimize operational risks, which we consider the prudent approach,"" BTG Pactual said.

The company also forecast $20 million more in cost cuts over the $80 million originally planned from the merger that created the world's largest cannabis producer by sales in May last year.
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY)'s earnings, the first for the quarter ended November from a major cannabis producer, could help calm investors frustrated by slow regulatory progress and a lack of profitability after years of overspending by Canadian pot sellers.
""We will look to expand brands into different categories, geographies and products and there will be some additional acquisitions that will compliment some of these brands,"" Chief Executive Officer Irwin Simon told Reuters. 
Including the combined company's growth, Tilray's revenue grew 20% to $155 million in the second quarter, but missed analysts' average estimate of $170.55 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Simon attributed the miss to market saturation and related competitive challenges in Canada and said Tilray is responding to those challenges by adjusting product prices, a strategy he expects will help the company gain some lost market share.
On U.S. decriminalization of cannabis, Simon said he was ""very much"" expecting some form of legalization to take place last year, adding that ""we are just a couple of years away before anything happens.""

Expectations of policy changes, including federal decriminalization, have raised prospects for the U.S. cannabis industry.
On an adjusted basis, Tilray posted a profit of 3 cents per share in the second quarter ended Nov. 30, while analysts were expecting a loss of 9 cents per share.

The S&P 500 fell 0.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5%, or 163 points. The Nasdaq closed 0.05% higher, erasing a 2.7% intraday loss.
Tech clawed back intraday losses after starting the day on the back foot following expectations for a more aggressive pace of rate hikes, the enemy of growth stocks. Goldman Sachs lifted its Fed rate hike forecast to four hikes this year compared with prior estimates of three hikes.
Pointing to “declining labor market slack and “upside inflation risks,” Goldman’s Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said the bank continues ""to see hikes in March, June, and September, and have now added a hike in December for a total of four in 2022.” 
The rate-hike outlook comes just a day ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's confirmation hearing on Tuesday, when the Fed chief may offer fresh clues on monetary policy.   
Big tech closed well above its lows, with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), formerly know as Facebook and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) closing lower. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended the day higher. 
Semiconductor stocks also rebounded off lows to help the broader tech sector recover.
The more cyclical, or value areas of the market including energy and financials, which tend to perform well in an increasing interest rate environment continued to be favored.
“[T]he cheapest stocks tend to outperform the most expensive stocks when interest rates are rising. Today, energy and financials remain well represented on the list of the cheapest names, while technology remains well represented on the list of the most expensive names,” {{RBC said in a note}}.
“[W]e think the outperformance trade in value/cyclical isn’t done yet,” it added.
Financials were up about 0.9%, with major Wall Street banks trading just below the flatline ahead of the quarterly earnings season, which gets underway on Friday.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) report earnings on Friday.
 Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU), meanwhile, warned that fourth-quarter results would suffer hit from the impact of the omicron Covid-19 variant. Lululemon now expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share also toward the low end of its range of $3.25 to $3.32, with revenue also expected within the lower of guidance range of $2.13 billion to $2.17 billion.
In deal making news, Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) agreed to be acquired by video game maker Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive in a deal worth $12.7 billion, sending its shares more than 40%. Take-Two fell 13%.
“We’ve been anticipating a strong start to the year for value/cyclical, followed by a pivot back to growth/secular later in the year,” RBC said. “So far that’s playing out, and we think the outperformance trade in Value/Cyclical isn’t done yet.”"

""It's a new year, and I've decided it's a good time to replace myself as the CEO of Signal"", he said. Marlinspike, who will remain on Signal's board, said he is scouting for candidates for the permanent CEO position.
Acton founded Signal's rival messaging app WhatsApp in 2009. The company was bought by Meta Platforms, then  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), in 2014. He left WhatsApp in 2017 due to differences around the use of customer data and targeted advertising, according to Signal's website.

In February 2018, he alongside Marlinspike, started the non-profit Signal Foundation, which currently oversees the app, by providing an initial funding of $50 million.
Signal, an end-to-end encrypted messaging platform, has been endorsed by people including  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) co-founder Jack Dorsey, and whistleblower and privacy advocate Edward Snowden.

1208,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 03:57PM ET</span>","Rate Hikes, Lululemon Outlook, Gaming Deal: 3 Things to Watch","By Sam Boughedda
Investing.com -- Stocks clawed back some of their losses on Monday after opening sharply lower on concerns about rising interest rates, which weighed on the growth-oriented tech sector.
Heading into the close, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite were on track for a fifth-straight day of declines, though the Nasdaq turned positive in the last minute.
Growth stocks sold off during the start to the new year as investors braced for the Federal Reserve to begin pulling back its stimulus, which has kept wind the sales of the sector for the duration of the pandemic.
In a note, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecast four rate hikes by the Fed this year – one more than people expected..
Speaking of the Fed, Chair Jerome Powell heads to the Senate on Tuesday to testify as the chamber takes up his nomination for a second term at the head of the central bank.
Reuters reported that traders have raised their rate hike expectations this year after the U.S. central bank's minutes from the December meeting. Markets are now expecting a greater than 70% chance of an interest rate rise to 0.25% in March, the news agency reported.
Inflation data later this week could cement the Fed’s decision.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Rate hikes
Goldman analysts weren’t the only ones talking about the trajectory of Fed hikes this year. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said on Monday the economy is generating so much inflation that the Federal Reserve might have to raise short-term interest rates more than four times this year, according to Reuters.
Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, ""It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb.""
2. Tempering expectations
It was one of the beneficiaries of the pandemic, but now the pandemic is coming back to bite. On Monday,  Lululemon Athletica  Inc (NASDAQ:LULU)shares fell 5% after it told investors that the Omicron variant has affected the business, and it now expects earnings and revenue to be at the lower end of their respective ranges.
The athletic apparel company said it ""started the holiday season in a strong position but have since experienced several consequences of the Omicron variant, including increased capacity constraints, more limited staff availability, and reduced operating hours in certain locations.""
As a result, it now expects revenue to be toward the low end of its range of $2.125 billion to $2.165 billion for the fourth quarter. It also forecasts earnings per share for the period toward the low end of its $3.25 to $3.32 range.
3. Big gaming deal
 Zynga Inc  (NASDAQ:ZNGA) stock soared after  Take-Two Interactive  Software Inc (NASDAQ:TTWO)said it had a deal to acquire the mobile game maker for $12.7 billion, or $9.861 per share.
Shareholders of Zynga — the maker of ""FarmVille"" and ""Words With Friends"" — will receive $3.50 in cash and $6.361 in shares of Take-Two stock for each share of Zynga they own.
Take-Two, the parent company of ""Grand Theft Auto"" maker Rockstar Games, said the deal will establish them as one of the largest publishers of mobile games, ""the fastest-growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. financial investor Cerberus, which has favoured a merger of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in the past, on Monday divested a large chunk of its holdings in the two top German lenders, the bank running the sale said.
The sale marks a significant scaling back by one of the most prominent investors in the financial sector of Europe's largest economy and comes at a time when large-scale consolidation in the continent's banking sector is still waiting to happen.
Cerberus, which until now held around 3% of Deutsche Bank and 5% of Commerzbank and had ranked among the top-10 shareholders of both banks, sold 21 million Deutsche Bank shares and 25.3 million Commerzbank shares,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
Cerberus, which took stakes in both banks in 2017, fetched 443 million euros ($502 million) in the sale, Morgan Stanley said, a roughly 3% discount to Monday's closing price.
The divestment reduces Cerberus' stake in Deutsche Bank to around 2%, and its stake in Commerzbank to 3%.
Cerberus has committed to a 45-day lock-up period during which it will not sell additional stakes, Morgan Stanley said.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank shares were down 1.9% and 4.9% respectively in after-hours German trading following the news.
Cerberus has at times been a vocal investor, demanding changes at Commerzbank in 2020 that prompted a management reshuffle as well as substantial job cuts.
Since Cerberus bought its stakes, shares in both lenders are down more than 20%.
The investor did not respond to requests for comment.

Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both declined to comment.

Investing.com – The euro has suffered a bruising encounter against the dollar, but any hope of a reprieve for the single currency in the first half of the year is unlikely given the “clear and present danger” of rising U.S. interest rates, according to Dutch Bank ING.
EUR/USD was down 0.3% to $1.1325, and is down nearly 10% from its recent peak.
The bearish outlook comes in the wake of hawkish comments from European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel, who on Saturday warned that the ECB may be forced to act to curb if the EU transition to green energy proves inflationary.
Any uptick in the ECB's inflation forecast at its upcoming meeting in March could “see expectations build of earlier ECB tightening […] but with “the clear and present danger for tighter [US monetary policy]… we would prefer to back the dollar in 1H22,” ING said.
“[We] favour EUR/USD grinding back towards the 1.1300 area and staying offered into Wednesday's US CPI release,” the company said.
Bets on an aggressive path of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve as soon as March are expected to accelerate later this week, when the U.S. is expected to report its fastest pace of inflation since 1982.
“[W]e fully expect the Fed to hike in March, immediately after QE ends—and after three more awful CPI reports—and we think it increasingly likely that the second hike will come before mid-year, in May or June, leaving room for two further increases in the second half of the year,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.
The inflation report will arrive just a day after Federal Reserve Chair Powell’s his confirmation hearing on Tuesday at 10:00 AM ET before the Senate Banking Committee.
“There is high potential for fresh policy guidance being delivered during his testimony,” Scotiabank said in note."

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 03:21PM ET</span>","Major Canadian banks pursue U.S. buys, investments to grow","By Nichola Saminather and Sohini Podder
TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada's major banks plan to pursue their quest for growth south of the border, their top executives said on Monday, after Bank of Montreal's $16.3 billion Bank of the West buy last month.
With billions of dollars of excess capital and share prices close to record highs, Canadian banks are seeking to expand in the United States, whose more fragmented market offers more opportunity to grow than at home where Canada's Big Six already have a near-90% market share.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest lender by market value, is interested in buying wealth distribution businesses in the U.S. and Europe and commercial banking businesses in the U.S., its chief executive Dave McKay told the RBC Capital Markets CEO conference.
Meanwhile, Toronto-Dominion, the second-biggest, would seriously consider any opportunity in the United States, where it is already a top 10 bank, if it makes strategic, financial, risk and cultural sense, and help accelerate growth, CEO Bharat Masrani said. 
""We're a huge bank domestically in the U.S... We don't need to acquire just to get scale,"" Masrani told 
Following Bank of Montreal's deal, sources told Reuters that TD had fought https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/td-deal-hunt-after-bancwest-bid-canadian-lenders-pursue-us-growth-2021-12-23 hard for Bancwest, and continues to seek U.S. acquisitions.
Canada's fifth-largest bank, CIBC, will also invest in its U.S. business, where earnings contributed 21% of earnings in fiscal 2021, from 2% five years ago, CEO Victor Dodig said.
""Our bank's investment in the U.S. has been increasingly appreciated by our investor base,"" Dodig said, adding that CIBC expects ""continued growth in our franchise across the board"" and plans to invest more in the U.S. platform. 
Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) are the other two players in Canada's 'Big Six'. 
EXPENSE GROWTH
The banks also stuck to their expense-growth forecasts for this year, despite expectations that inflation could remain elevated for longer than originally anticipated. 
Major Canadian banks broadly posted expenses that were higher than market expectations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and some analysts see continued disappointments on that front in the first half of 2022.
Bank of Nova Scotia is seeing some inflationary pressure that's affecting salary and benefit expenses, but is confident revenue growth will continue to outpace the rise in costs, CEO Brian Porter said. 
""I’m glad central banks have stopped using the term 'transitory' because I believe it was obscuring the facts,"" he said. ""There are some inflationary trends and we have to be mindful of that. (But) it’s good for banking generally"" when interest rates rise alongside. 
CIBC said last month it expects mid-single-digit expense growth in fiscal 2022, after reporting a 13% increase in the fourth quarter, the highest in the industry.
Royal Bank still expects low-single-digit growth in non-interest expenses for fiscal 2022, and can slow down some investment and take out costs if needed, McKay said.

BMO CEO Darryl White also reiterated a forecast for flat expense growth, helped by the sale of its EMEA business.
The country's banks index fell 0.3% in afternoon trading, in line with the Toronto stock benchmark.

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Experimental Lilly drug neutralizes Omicron in test tubes
An experimental monoclonal antibody treatment from Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY) is effective against all known variants of the coronavirus, including Omicron, researchers have found.
The drug, known as LY-CoV1404 or bebtelovimab, ""potently"" neutralized engineered versions of numerous variants, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, Epsilon, Gamma, Iota, and Omicron, in test tube experiments, the researchers reported on Friday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. They noted that an experimental antibody drug from GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) called sotrovimab also neutralizes Delta and Omicron, but said that bebtelovimab ""is equally effective in viral neutralization against all tested variants and is several-fold more potent."" That could potentially allow for lower doses and injection under the skin rather than intravenous administration.
A spokesperson for Eli Lilly said the company is ""urgently working with the FDA to make bebtelovimab available under an emergency use authorization and expect authorization"" during the current quarter of 2022.
Slightly higher risk of new diabetes seen in U.S. kids after COVID-19
U.S. children who recover from COVID-19 may have a slightly higher risk for a new diabetes diagnosis compared to uninfected children, but the odds of developing the condition are extremely low, according to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis of billing codes from two large health insurance databases.
In one database with nearly 1.7 million patients under age 18, the rate of new diabetes diagnoses among the roughly 81,000 children who were diagnosed with COVID-19 was 0.08% compared with a 0.03% rate in kids who had avoided the virus, according to a report published on Friday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The second database included nearly 879,000 patients under age 18, roughly half of whom had been previously infected. In this population, there was a six-hundredths-of-one-percent difference in rates of new diabetes diagnoses: 0.25% in recovered children vs. 0.19% in uninfected children. 
The study was not designed to prove that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes more new diabetes diagnoses in children. Furthermore, the authors note, they lacked information on other factors that could have influenced the results, such as the childrens' rates of prediabetes and obesity and their race, ethnicity and access to commercial health insurance. More research is needed ""to further define the potential association between COVID-19 and increased diabetes risk"" among children, the researchers concluded.
COVID-19 vaccines tied to slight change in menstrual cycle
COVID-19 vaccination was linked with a small, temporary change to menstrual cycle length, a new study found.
The timing of the next period changed by less than one day, on average, during the menstrual cycle when the shot was given, researchers reported on Friday in Obstetrics & Gynecology. Receipt of two vaccine doses within a single menstrual cycle was linked with a two-day change, on average. ""This means that the time between a person's first day of menses, or bleeding, until their next first day of menses may be slightly longer than what they consider 'normal,'"" said Dr. Alison Edelman of Oregon Health & Science University. ""For instance, a person used to a 28-day cycle may experience a 29-day cycle after getting the vaccine, meaning their 'period' (menses) may begin a day later.""

The data are drawn from nearly 4,000 users of a smartphone app that tracks menstrual cycles. The length of periods did not change, and variations in timing of onset ""appear to resolve quickly - as soon as the next cycle"" in which no vaccine is received, Edelman said. While the changes to menstrual cycle length might appear to be minimal, ""on a personal level, any noticeable change to a person's cycle... can indeed feel significant,"" she added. ""While reassuring, the study findings may also be validating to individuals who experienced menstrual disruption following vaccination.""

Investing.com — GLJ research told investors on Monday that following  Tilray Inc  's (NASDAQ:TLRY) second-quarter results, they would be ""aggressively adding to short positions,"" raising questions about the company's numbers.
Tilray shares are currently up 12% following the earnings report.
The cannabis-lifestyle and consumer packaged goods company announced earnings per share of $0.00 on revenue of $155 million. 
Commenting on the results, Irwin Simon, Tilray's chairman and CEO, said: ""Our second quarter performance reflects notable success building high-quality and highly sought-after cannabis and lifestyle CPG brands which, coupled with our scale, operational excellence and broad global distribution, enabled us to increase sales and maintain profitability despite sector-specific and macro-economic headwinds.""
Despite Simon's positivity, GLJ analysts Gordon Johnson and James Bardowski said their read on the company's fiscal second quarter 2022 ""reveal a company teetering on the edge of disaster."" 
The analysts questioned the reported revenue growth, saying their own calculations have revenue falling 14% from the prior year compared with the 20% gain reported by the company. The analysts said the ""surprise profit"" was entirely due to ""non-operating items (i.e., because the stock fell 26% during the quarter, the embedded options within Tilray's warrants and convertible debt were all marked to a much lower market, resulting in a substantial non-cash, accounting gain).""
The analysts reiterated a sell rating and 82 cent per share price target on Tilray. The company's share price is currently trading around the $7.20 mark."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Monday launched a credit card with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and revamped its rewards program to let customers earn more points to put toward buying or leasing Buicks, Cadillacs and other GM cars, the automaker and bank said in a joint statement. 
Issued by Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) through Goldman Sachs, the My GM Rewards card is the second credit card Goldman has offered through its Marcus consumer bank app and it further advances the Wall Street bank's aims to be a main street lender. 
Goldman bought the GM credit card portfolio in what was reported to be a $2.5 billion deal in 2020. It gains roughly 3 million existing GM credit card holders, whose accounts were converted to Goldman from  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) this week, and all new applicants, who can apply using the Marcus by Goldman Sachs app. 
Goldman launched Marcus in 2016 to diversify its revenue and funding sources by offering traditional consumer banking products like savings accounts and, since 2019, a credit card with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Holders of that card had $6 billion in outstanding balances as of Sept. 30.

The card gives customers 7 points per $1 spent at GM, and 4 points per $1 spent elsewhere, with an annual interest rate of between 14.99% and 24.99%, after an initial promotional period. 
GM hopes its rewards program - an industry-first when it launched in 2018 - will drive more customers to redeem those points for new and used car purchases, or parts, accessories or OnStar services.

DUBAI (Reuters) -A group of institutional investors that last year took a stake in  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s oil pipelines network has hired Citi and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to help refinance a loan that backed the deal, bank documents and an investor presentation showed on Monday.
A consortium led by U.S.-based EIG Global Energy Partners in June bought 49% of the Aramco Oil Pipelines Company set up by Saudi Aramco, which holds the remaining 51% stake. As part of the deal, Aramco struck a 25-year lease and leaseback arrangement with the pipelines group. 
The banks will advise issuer EIG Pearl Holdings - in which the investors led by EIG control a near 90% stake and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company the remainder - on the sale of dual-tranche U.S. dollar-denominated amortising bonds, the documents showed. 
The bond offering will partly refinance the $10.8 billion term debt facility that backed the deal. Sources have said the loan would be refinanced across two or three bond deals, with the first bond issue likely to be at least $4 billion.
Investors in the stake include China's state-owned Silk Road Fund, Saudi Arabia's Hassana, the investment arm of the kingdom's largest pension fund, and Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) Asset Management, the investor presentation showed.
Citi and JPMorgan began investor calls for the debt sale on Monday, the documents showed. 

The offering will include a tranche with a final maturity of between 14-1/2 and 15 years and a weighted average life of 10.2 to 10.7 years, and a tranche with a final maturity of between 24-1/2 and 25 years with a weighted average life of between 23-1/2 and 24 years, the bank documents said. 
A group of 18 U.S., European, Asian and Middle Eastern banks are also involved in the deal, including First Abu Dhabi Bank, HSBC and Mizuho.

If the Fed raises rates at a smooth and steady pace, cash flow and margins can more easily be managed. S&P 500 earnings growth is projected to slow to a more normal rate this year. In that type of environment, tech is usually one of the better places to find reliable and outsized growth.""

""Technology is not going away as a group. The stronger, bigger mega-cap ones are going to do fine but the smaller, newer upstarts and those that are leveraged are going to struggle the most, and that will probably continue for a while.""
""You have a lot of newer tech companies that have gone public within the last couple of years that have a lot of debt, they don't have necessarily good cash flows yet, or they don't have profits. They may have bright prospects down the road, but in the immediate term, people are getting a little bit more cautious because of the Fed's plan to hike rates soon and they are going to move away from those names.""

1225,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 12:30PM ET</span>","Forget shareholder resolutions, fund manager says: hire better directors","By Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - A Texas-based fund manager is not jumping on the bandwagon of peers backing shareholder resolutions that call on companies to take stronger action on climate change. Dimensional Fund Advisors argues it would be more effective to just replace corporate directors who fail to address the issue.
Austin-based Dimensional backed just a tiny fraction of the climate-related shareholder resolutions tracked by Boston-based advocacy group Ceres last year.
Firm executives said the measures demanding everything from emissions reports to contingencies for extreme temperatures can be ineffective or not material to investors, even if the measures pass.
While Dimensional wants boards to oversee environmental risks, ""not every issue of environmental concern is material to shareholders,"" said Jim Whittington, Dimensional's head of responsible investment, in a recent interview.
Meanwhile Dimensional has voted against corporate directors more often than rivals, although it is unclear how often those votes stemmed from environmental issues.
Whittington said corporate directors are the ones best-placed to judge a company's exposure to climate risk. 
""Our overall philosophy is that we're trying to protect and enhance shareholder value,"" Whittington added. For some companies, steps to counter or adapt to climate change can certainly make sense, he said.
In 2021 Dimensional supported just two of 49 climate-related shareholder resolutions tracked by Ceres, about the same level as in 2020 and the lowest support rate by a significant margin among 58 top asset managers.
The average vote on the resolutions rose to 41% in 2021 from 31% in 2020, Ceres found, as giant asset managers BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group ramped up their support.
Ceres said Dimensional risks losing assets as investors put more money into funds focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. Dimensional actually has seen outflows from its funds firmwide, although analysts cited other factors. Still, Dimensional's own ESG funds have had substantial inflows.
Many climate activists blast Dimensional's voting approach, saying the resolutions can spur companies to quicker action.
""Dimensional needs to face the gravity of the systemic risk created by climate change,"" said Rob Berridge, Ceres' senior director of shareholder engagement.
STRATEGY PIONEER
With $710 billion in assets, Dimensional developed a reputation on Wall Street as an influential pioneer of quantitative and value-investing strategies. Its contrarian take on climate change-related resolutions stands out as more of the asset management industry pays attention to ESG matters.
The Austin-based firm saw net withdrawals of $10.3 billion for the first 11 months of 2021 and $37.7 billion for all of 2020, according to Morningstar Direct.
For last year, Dimensional said its specialized U.S. sustainability-focused funds, which supported more of the climate resolutions tracked by Ceres, had net deposits of about $2 billion.
Morningstar analyst Daniel Sotiroff said the outflows were likely due to its investment focus on smaller companies at a time investors were chasing gains in companies with large capitalizations, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Dimensional's ESG approach ""fits in with its house philosophy"" that with sufficient disclosures, efficient markets will price in the risks companies face, Sotiroff said.
When Dimensional votes against climate-related resolutions, it is often in the minority. Last May, it voted against a proposal for ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) to disclose so-called 'Scope 3' carbon emissions, created when consumers burn its fuel. The resolution passed with 59% support.
Dimensional's head of investment stewardship, Kristin Drake, said in an interview that the oil and gas exploration and production company has little control of how its fuels are used. ""For them to even be able to calculate their Scope 3 emissions would be really difficult,"" she said. 
A Conoco representative declined to comment on Dimensional's voting or whether it might set a Scope 3 target.
In the case of  Monster Beverage  Corp (NASDAQ:MNST), Dimensional's views carried the day. The firm voted in June against a proposal for the soft drinks giant to offer investors an annual ""say-on-climate"" vote. Drake said the idea would insulate boards from accountability. At Monster it won just 7% support.
""If shareholders are unhappy, they should be voting against directors,"" Drake said. 
A Monster spokesperson declined to comment.
BACKING DIRECTORS LESS
Dimensional has been less supportive of board directors than other major asset managers. It voted in favor of company-nominated directors just 86% of the time at U.S. shareholder meetings in 2021, compared to an average of 91% for investors of its size and larger, according to research firm Insightia.
Insightia also found about 8% of Dimensional's critical board votes went against directors who served on a board committees overseeing environmental or similar matters.
Since few companies have such committees, the finding suggests Dimensional was willing to vote against directors where it saw environmental concerns, said Doug Chia, president of consulting firm Soundboard Governance.
Dimensional did not provide a breakdown of how often its critical board votes were tied to climate change. 
""We vote against directors for reasons that we think are likely to contribute to insufficient oversight of E&S (environmental and social) risk such as a lack of independence, poor attendance, and serving on an excessive number of boards,"" Drake said.
Dimensional backed two of three dissident directors who won seats at  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) last May, choosing to support nominees of hedge fund Engine No. 1 which argued the oil major was not doing enough to tackle climate change. 
In addition, on April 9 Dimensional also voted against the re-election of a Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Plc director who chairs its sustainability board committee. In an e-mail to Reuters Dimensional said the vote was due to ""ongoing concerns about Rio Tinto’s oversight of material environmental and social risks.""

The nominee, Megan Clark, won 74% of votes, the lowest of any director.
A Rio Tinto spokesman declined to comment on Dimensional's votes.

(Reuters) -Lululemon Athletica Inc said on Monday the Omicron coronavirus variant had dented its holiday-quarter performance, pushing the yoga-wear maker to cut staff and store hours during the busiest shopping period of the year, sending its shares down about 5%. 
Omicron has further hurt the retail sector that has been grappling with shipping delays and product shortages due to an overburdened supply chain.
Personal products maker Bath & Body Works Inc said last week its post-Christmas sales were below expectations, while department store chain Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) reduced U.S. store hours for the rest of month.
Lululemon, which had a strong start to the holiday season, has been affected by several Omicron-driven shortfalls, including increased capacity constraints and reduced store hours in some locations, Chief Executive Calvin McDonald said. 
""Lululemon has consistently smashed sales and earnings expectations over the past three years, so it is surprising to see any sort of weakness,"" Morningstar analyst David Swartz said, noting that rival Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) Inc preannounced solid holiday results.
Dick's last week raised its annual profit and same-store sales forecast, while casual footwear maker  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) Inc on Monday lifted its revenue estimates for 2021.
""...we have concerns that the massive amount of low-priced competition is beginning to have some impact,"" Swartz added.
The Vancouver, Canada-based company said it now expects fourth-quarter net revenue to be toward the low end of its previous forecast of $2.13 billion to $2.17 billion.

It also expects quarterly adjusted profit per share to be toward the low end of its earlier outlook of $3.25 to $3.32.
Analysts on average had estimated Lululemon to post a profit of $3.34 per share on revenue of $2.17 billion for the holiday quarter.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co shares have rallied ahead of its quarterly earnings later this week as analysts expect the U.S. central bank to lift a damaging asset cap that has curtailed growth at the lender amid signs of rising interest rates. 
Shares of the San Francisco-based bank have jumped 14% so far in 2022, with analysts anticipating a 67% profit surge in the fourth quarter.
Wells Fargo, primarily focused on the lending business, has reined in costs as it grapples with the aftermath of a sales practices scandal that first came to light in 2016 and forced the Federal Reserve to cap its assets at $1.95 trillion.
The asset cap has restricted the loan and deposit growth needed to boost interest income and cover costs at the country's fourth-largest lender, while rival balance sheets have swelled.
It remains unclear how much longer the cap would stay in place, but recent brokerage action has been bullish, with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) last week saying it expects the lender to benefit from ""substantial progress"" on its regulatory issues and cost cuts.
""That balancing act - cutting expenses while maintaining service, controlling risk and avoiding adverse publicity - is not an easy task. But for now, they appear once again to be on plan,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""Investors are hoping that new management has finally put the recent scandals behind them and can rehabilitate what was once a premier banking brand.""
Jefferies, Raymond James and Evercore ISI are among the brokerages that named the bank among their top picks, while CFRA Research expects Wells Fargo and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) to benefit the most in the rising interest rate environment.
Since the start of 2022, investors have swapped technology shares for economy-linked stocks such as banks as the U.S. Treasury yield curve steepens. A steeper yield curve boosts profitability for banks, allowing them to borrow relatively cheaper in the short term and earn more on longer-term lending. 
The S&P 500 banks index, which last week logged its sharpest percentage jump since November 2020, was trading at an all-time high on Monday. 

Bank of America Corp,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), likely to begin reporting results from Friday onwards, are expected to report a fall in quarterly earnings.

Medicare in November raised the Part B premium, which covers physician and outpatient hospital services, by 15% to $170.10 in 2022, with uncertainty around the coverage decision for the treatment, Aduhelm, one of the drivers behind the increase.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Aduhelm in June to treat the brain-wasting disease despite the view of its outside advisory panel that Biogen had not proven the treatment's clinical benefit.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks customers arriving to claim their mobile drink orders have found cafes shut, and delivery drivers are waiting longer to pick up some McDonald's Big Macs. 
Service at U.S. restaurants has slowed as Omicron, the latest COVID-19 variant, sickens workers and scares off others, leaving many businesses without enough staff. 
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) customers complained on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) last week about temporary closures and reduced hours at locations around the country, including in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, California, New Jersey, Florida and New York.
Lawyer William Clarke told Reuters he placed a mobile order for coffee at a Starbucks in Hoboken, New Jersey at 9:20 am one morning. But the store had not opened yet when he arrived, and he had to seek a refund. The location has been opening late and closing altogether on some days since the end of December, he said. 
""I totally understand any staff shortage at the moment and understand if they need to adjust hours because of it,"" he said. 
Zmer Andranigian showed up at his Glendale, California Starbucks on Jan. 1 to pick the order he placed through the app at about 5 pm, but the store was already closed. He returned the next day and was able to get his drinks, he said. 
In Knoxville, Tennessee, one DoorDash Inc driver said he has been waiting up to 30 minutes in drive-thru lines at fast-food chains since early December. He said chains including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Yum Brands Inc's Taco Bell, and Chick-fil-A began putting up signs last month warning of longer wait times for customers and drivers picking up mobile orders because of labor shortages.
Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said some of its roughly 9,000 U.S. cafes have adjusted hours and operating levels throughout the pandemic. 
Some locations, including all 20 in Buffalo, New York, are carry out only, he said. 
McDonald's said in a statement it was monitoring the impact of COVID-19 variants closely and was continuing to serve customers with approximately 99% of its U.S. restaurants open throughout the pandemic.
A Chick-fil-A spokesperson said the chicken chain is experiencing business challenges due to Omicron, but 99% of their restaurants are still open. Taco Bell did not respond to requests for comment. 
RESTAURANT JOBS GAP
The United States reported nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on Jan. 3, the highest daily tally of any country in the world and nearly double the previous U.S. peak set the previous week. 
Even before Omicron, the restaurant industry had not recovered all the jobs it lost during the pandemic while people are also quitting at sky-high rates.
Employment https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/lgvdwjoadpo/chart.png at foodservice and drinking places as of December was also nearly 653,000 jobs – or about 5.3% - below pre-pandemic levels in February 2020, according to federal labor data released Friday. 
Other factors are adding to complications, including bad weather in many parts of the country, employees who stay home because they fear catching COVID, and the holiday season when some workers wanted to be with family. 
In New York City, independent restaurants have been forced to limit services. 

Manhattan pizza restaurant John's of Bleecker St. was short six staff members last week. The shortage is slowing operations and creating longer lines, said manager Kevin Jackson. 
""We're probably losing customers as a result of it,"" said Jackson, who had to deliver 10 pizzas himself New Year's weekend because couriers from delivery apps were not showing up.

LONDON (Reuters) -Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY), a unit of Germany's BMW, said on Monday its sales soared 49% to a record high in 2021 despite the global coronavirus pandemic, as demand worldwide for luxury vehicles surged.
In an online presentation, Rolls-Royce CEO Torsten Müller-Ötvös said the carmaker sold 5,586 vehicles to customers in more than 50 countries, the largest number in its 117-year history despite all the volatility wrought by the pandemic.
""In the luxury sector as a whole, the struggle was not so much focused on attempting to find customers, but rather producing enough product to satisfy huge customer demand,"" Müller-Ötvös said. 
He said sales hit all-time records in most regions, including China and the Americas. 
Premium and luxury car sales have been growing more broadly in key global markets such as China and the United States as pandemic travel restrictions have left wealthy consumers with more disposable income.
""Covid forced many people to ground, not to travel anymore and for that reason there is quite a lot of wealth accumulated and that is spent on luxury goods,"" Müller-Ötvös told Reuters. ""We profited from that development.""

""If you order a Rolls-Royce today, you will expect to take delivery of it about a year from now,"" he said.
Luxury British carmaker Bentley, a unit of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said last week that it had cruised to a record year in 2021 as global sales jumped 31% amid strong demand for high-end vehicles.

Last week BMW said it had achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 sales despite a global shortage of semiconductor chips.
Müller-Ötvös said that while the chip shortage was cause for concern, Rolls-Royce's parent BMW had ""assured that we could take delivery of all the chips we need to build our cars, so we haven't seen any shortages.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. oilfield services and equipment sector added 7,450 jobs in December, even as overall hiring in the United States slowed, according to a report released on Monday by the Energy Workforce & Technology Council, an industry trade group.
The sector has regained some 62,289 jobs since shedding a peak of roughly 109,000 jobs in February of 2021 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the report said. The pandemic-related losses have resulted in about $5.6 billion in lost annual wages, according to the Council. 

U.S. oil prices are up about 50% from a year ago, trading around $78.59 a barrel on Monday. The oil and gas rig count was at 588 in the week to Jan. 7, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes, the highest since April 2020.

Investing.com — Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock fell 8% in early Monday trading after a Piper Sandler analyst downgraded the shares. 
Analyst Thomas Champion downgraded Airbnb from overweight to neutral, lowering the price target to $169 from $215. 
In a research note, the analyst said the downgrade was based on elevated Street expectations, the current valuation, and the fact that it being a pure-play focus may be less desirable as travel normalizes.
Champion told investors they ""launched on ABNB with an Overweight rating in January 2021 thinking this name had a near-term advantage with an alternative accommodation focus during the pandemic. We also thought ABNB benefited from a longer-term structural shift toward alternatives and away from traditional lodging.""
However, while they still view ABNB as a ""top-tier online travel asset and leader in alternative accommodations,"" the firm believes it is overvalued compared with its peers. 
Champion's comments are in contrast to Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni who assumed coverage of Airbnb with a buy rating on Friday. Colantuoni said he sees upside to current consensus estimates."

Investing.com — Fubotv Inc (NYSE:FUBO) shares are down 6% Monday after the company reported preliminary fourth-quarter results.
The sports-first live TV streaming platform said total revenue is expected to be between $215 and $220 million, increasing between 105% and 109% year-over-year. This is above prior guidance of $205 to $210 million. Full-year revenue for 2021 is expected to be between $622 million and $627 million, representing an approximately 138% to 140% rise year-over-year. This again is above prior guidance of $612 million to $617 million.
At the end of the year, the company's paid subscribers are anticipated to surpass 1.1 million. This represents an over 100% increase year-over-year and again beats prior guidance of 1.06 to 1.07 million subscribers. Furthermore, Fubo's subscriber acquisition cost is forecast to be at the low end of its target range of 1.0x to 1.5x monthly average revenue per user for the quarter.
""fuboTV's strong preliminary fourth quarter 2021 results close out a pivotal year where we made meaningful advancements against our mission to define a new category of interactive sports and entertainment television,"" said David Gandler, co-founder and CEO, fuboTV.
""In the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver triple digit revenue growth, alongside operating leverage, through the efficient deployment of acquisition spend and the retention of high quality customer cohorts.

However, speaking on the deal, Gandler said: ""While still early, our progress to date continues to reinforce our belief that the synergies of the combined companies will give us operating leverage to build a scalable global platform with minimal incremental spend.”"

The approval sought is for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in patients 12 years of age and older, weighing at least 40 kilograms and are at high risk of their illness worsening, the European Medicines Agency said. 
While vaccines are central to the fight against the pandemic, regulators are looking at therapies as a new tool against the fast-spreading Omicron variant, which has now been detected in more than 128 countries around the world.
The EMA has already evaluated a portion of the data during a rolling review of Pfizer's pill that began in November.

Pfizer's two-drug regimen called Paxlovid, which is meant to be taken at home for five days soon after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, was authorized for people aged 12 and older by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in December.

Benedetto Vigna, a tech industry veteran and a former top executive at chip maker STMicroelectronics, took the CEO role in September with a task to drive Ferrari into a new era of cleaner, quieter and interconnected mobility.
The new structure, designed to sharpen Ferrari's technology focus and product exclusivity, will see more key operations segments directly report to the CEO, including ""Product Development and Research & Development"", ""Digital & Data"" and ""Technologies & Infrastructures"", the company said.
It will allow Vigna to reduce intermediate layers of management, making the carmaker, known for it roaring high-octane sportcars, faster and more agile, a source close to the matter said.
As part of the overhaul, the company appointed Gianmaria Fulgenzi - at Ferrari since 2002 and recently head of supply chain at its racing division - as chief product development officer, it said.
Ernesto Lasalandra was hired from Vigna's former employer STMicro to become Ferrari's chief research and development officer.
Silvia Gabrielli, who joined Ferrari in 2019 from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), was appointed chief digital and data officer to boost ""the digital transformation process throughout the company, ensuring more data driven and digitally focused processes.""
""The new organizational structure will further foster innovation, optimise processes and increase collaboration both internally and with partners,"" Ferrari said in a statement.
Ferrari also hired Angelo Pesci from STMicro, where he has spent over 20 years dealing with financial planning, supply chain and product planning, services and operations. He was named chief purchasing and quality officer at the Italian company. 
Bestinver analyst Andrea Trovarelli said in a report that Vigna's decision to hire two top executives from STMicro suggested he was ""turning to trusted allies to aid his turnaround and to put the iconic manufacturer on course for electrification.""
Ferrari has confirmed Mattia Binotto as boss of its Formula One racing team, it added. 
As part of its internal shake-up, the company last month anticipated three top executives were leaving the company, including Chief Technology Officer Michael Leiters and Chief Brand Diversification Officer Nicola Boari, who oversaw Ferrari's push beyond its luxury sports car business, with the unveiling in June of its first in-house fashion collection.

Vigna will run the ""Brand Diversification"" function on an interim basis, Ferrari said. 
The source said Vigna firmly believed in Ferrari's brand strategy but wanted to oversee the way it is managed, to make sure it can act with a ""start-up mode"" before a long-term boss for this function is appointed in the coming months.

The deal is a cash and stock transaction. Shareholders of Zynga — the maker of ""FarmVille"" and ""Words With Friends"" — will receive $3.50 in cash and $6.361 in shares of Take-Two stock for each share of Zynga they own.

1240,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 09:45AM ET</span>","U.S. Treasury Options Suggest Calm After Rout, Market Maker Says","(Bloomberg) -- The bond selloff that pushed 10-year Treasury yields to their highest in two years may not lead to a full-on taper tantrum, according to one of the biggest Treasury options market makers.
Bets in the options market suggest yields won’t go far above current levels, with investors positioned for the 10-year yield to rise modestly to 1.9% in the near term, despite hawkish Federal Reserve minutes last week, said Harm Backx, a trader at Optiver Holding BV in Amsterdam. Bearish bets also lost steam after data on Friday showed a mixed picture of the U.S. jobs market.
While unemployment fell and wage growth beat expectations, payrolls increased by less than half the projection. Yields surged to 1.8% last week -- the most since January 2020 -- amid a brutal bond market selloff, after the Fed signaled its plan to quicken monetary tightening to combat inflation.
“People are definitely still putting on bearish plays, but not for crazy scenarios,” Backx said in an interview. “The market actually acted very reasonably around the FOMC minutes and not panicky at all. After the payroll figures, we saw less interest from investors in betting on rising yields. Some people are reversing their bearish bets.”
The pace of bond repricing has preoccupied the market because so much is at stake. Although yields remain low by historical standards, a rapid rise could ripple through stocks, credit, housing and commodities. After a torrid start to 2022, a broad index of Treasuries has lost 1.6% this month, more than the 1% decline for all of January 2021. And while strategists surveyed by Bloomberg have a year-end target of 2.04% for the 10-year yield, the pace of increase may soon challenge that figure.
Expectations for the Fed to begin raising interest rates in March -- an outlier call just weeks ago -- are rising amid signs the central bank is keen to dial back stimulus as the threat of persistently high inflation grows. Analysts are revising their calls, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). among those moving forward their rate hike calls to March from June previously.
Yet signs from some corners of derivatives markets don’t seem to reflect the jitters in the cash market. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE Index -- which tracks the implied degree of price moves in Treasuries -- fell last week. The calmness in the options market may have partly reflected the fact that a lot is already in the price, according to Backx.
“We have seen decent interest in people playing a rise in yields for a few months already, for instance through buying puts and put spreads,” he said. “It tends to increase close to events such as the release of the FOMC minutes.”
To be sure, the recent Treasuries selloff has been more focused on the front end of the market. As a result, the yield curve has flattened, with 10- and 30-year yields lagging shorter-dated peers on the perception that early moves by the Fed may reduce price pressures down the road.
That view in the options market may be challenged this week when the U.S. government publishes its inflation data Wednesday. Consensus expects consumer prices to rise 7.0% for the year through December and 0.4% from a month earlier.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets started the week with a fresh lurch to the downside as fears about rising interest rates and weaker corporate profits combined to unsettle investors. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 282 points, or 0.8%, at 35,949 points, while the S&P 500 was down 1.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.9%. 
Fear of inflation - and of an aggressive tightening of policy by the Federal Reserve to stop it - was primarily responsible for the move. Having had the weekend to digest an employment report that showed inflationary pressures continuing to build up in the form of higher wages and a rapidly-evaporating pool of spare labor.  Analysts at Goldman Sachs revised their forecasts in response to say that they now expect the Fed to raise rates four times this year, and to start selling down its massive portfolio of bonds as early as July.
In addition, there were signs of sustained supply chain issues eating into corporate profits, as yoga wear maker  Lululemon Athletica  Inc (NASDAQ:LULU) said its holiday season sales had disappointed. Lululemon stock fell 4% to its lowest since June. However, it remains firmly in the category of companies most at risk from the rising interest rate trends. The stock was still trading at 53 times trailing earnings at Friday's close, despite already coming off its peak by more than 25%.
The most eye-catching move of the morning was driven by M&A news. Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) stock soared by 48% after agreeing to be bought by fellow games publisher  Take-Two Interactive  Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) in a cash and stock deal valuing the mobile games developer at $12.7 billion. The stock element of the deal weighed heavily on Take-Two's stock price, pushing it down by some 12.7%. 
Another stock under pressure was Coinbase, which suffered by association with the continuing selloff in the cryptocurrencies that generate its revenue. With Bitcoin prices briefly falling below $40,000 for the first time in over four months,  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) stock fell 6.4%. to its lowest since July.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock also broke through a psychological support level, falling 3.3% to trade below $1,000 for the first time this year despite being named by Goldman analysts as their top pick for the coming year. Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), whose outsize bets on growth stocks such as Tesla generated hefty outperformance during the early stages of the pandemic rally, meanwhile continued its recent underperformance. It lost another 4.6% to trade at its lowest since July 2020. 
Elsewhere, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock rose 19% after the cannabis company reported a surprise profit for the latest quarter.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock was another to defy the general selling, rising 0.2% after raising its sales forecast for 2022 by nearly 10%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock rose 1.2% after the chipmaker reported another record-breaking month for sales in December. Going in the other direction was ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock, falling 5.7% after the Dutch-based lithographer suffered a fire at one of its manufacturing plants in Europe.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Marked by devastating hurricanes and cold snaps in the United States, 2021 proved the second-most costly year on record for the world's insurers, Munich Re said on Monday, warning that extreme weather was more likely with climate change.
Insured losses from natural catastrophes totalled around $120 billion last year, second only to the $146 billion in damages during the hurricane-ridden year of 2017. 
The annual tally by Munich Re, the world's largest resinsurer, is higher than an estimate of $105 billion https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-storms-make-2021-one-most-costly-record-insurers-swiss-re-says-2021-12-14 that competitor Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) published last month.
The U.S. - ravaged by dozens of tornadoes in December, and by Hurricane Ida and freezes in Texas earlier in the year - accounted for an unusually large portion of the losses, Munich Re said.
""The images of natural disasters in 2021 are disturbing. Climate research increasingly confirms that extreme weather has become more likely,"" said Torsten Jeworrek, a member of Munich Re's board.
Nearly 10,000 people died from natural catastrophes, in line with previous years. Total losses, including those not covered by insurance, were $280 billion, the fourth-highest on record.
Hurricane Ida, damage from which stretched from New Orleans to New York, resulted in $36 billion in insured losses. The winter storm that primarily hit Texas resulted in around $15 billion in losses. Floods in Germany cost billions too.
""The 2021 disaster statistics are striking because some of the extreme weather events are of the kind that are likely to become more frequent or more severe as a result of climate change,"" said Ernst Rauch, Chief Climate and Geo Scientist at Munich Re.
Many scientists agree that events in 2021 https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/from-killer-heatwaves-to-floods-climate-idUSRTS3M1JF were exacerbated by climate change and that there is more – and worse – to come as the Earth's atmosphere continues to warm through the next decade and beyond.
The costliest year on record was 2017, with hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Other severe years were 2011, when big earthquakes hit Japan and New Zealand, and 2005, when Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans.

Insurers have in some cases been raising the rates they charge as a result of the increasing likelihood of disasters, and in some places have stopped providing coverage.

The U.S. Treasury Department reintroduced 20-year bonds in May 2020 and increased securities auction sizes across a range of maturities to raise cash to meet record government borrowing needs at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Total issuance since March 2020 of 20-year Treasury bonds, which the government had phased out in 1986, has been over $450 billion, creating customer demand for a new product that establishes 20-year yield exposure, said Agha Mirza, global head of rates and OTC products at CME. 
""The introduction of a futures contract on the U.S. Treasury's 20-Year bond responds directly to market need for a hedging tool at a time when managing U.S. Treasury market risk is more important than ever,"" Mirza said.
A 20-year bond future could boost demand for the maturity by offering investors an easier way to hedge the debt, or to speculate on its future yield moves.
The Treasury Department has said it plans to reduce auction sizes of seven-year and 20-year bonds more than other maturities to address supply and demand dynamics of the Treasuries.

CME's 20-year U.S. Treasury Bond futures will allow for delivery of original issue 20-year Treasury bonds with remaining terms to maturity at delivery of at least 19 years 2 months and not more than 20 years, the exchange and clearinghouse operator said. 
Chicago-based CME said its existing suite of Treasury futures and options grew more than 15% year-over-year in 2021 to a record 4.5 million average daily volume.

1249,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 06:55AM ET</span>","U.S. Futures Edge Lower; Inflation Data, Banks Earnings Due This Week","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Monday, with technology underperforming ahead of the release of key inflation data this week which could point towards early Federal Reserve hikes in 2022.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was flat, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 35 points, or 0.2%.
The major indices on Wall Street have had a shaky start to the year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posting four losing days on the trot last week as rising expectations of Fed hikes pressured a sector whose sky-high valuations have owed much to assumptions of easy money for years out into the future. 
With this in mind, investors will focus squarely on Wednesday’s consumer price inflation data. This is expected to show headline CPI breaking above 7% year-on-year, approaching a four-decade high, and underscoring why the Fed could start its rate hike cycle as early as March.
The nomination hearings of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, on Tuesday, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard for the post of vice chair on Thursday will also be followed closely for any clues of the future of monetary policy. 
Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs now sees the Federal Reserve raising interest rates four times this year, starting its balance sheet runoff process in July, if not earlier.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be in focus Monday after Goldman Sachs named the electric car manufacturer as its top pick for 2022, saying innovation in the sector will continue to drive growth for investors.
The big U.S. banks start posting fourth-quarterly earnings results at the end of this week, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) scheduled to report on Friday. Analysts expect big U.S. banks to show an uptick in fourth quarter core revenues, helped by higher Treasury yields.  
Cannabis company Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) heads up a thin earnings schedule on Monday.
Oil prices stabilized Monday after the sharp gains of the previous week, as operator Chevron said Sunday that Kazakhstan's largest oil venture, Tengizchevroil, is gradually returning to normal production levels after recent protests limited output.
Libya’s oil production is also recovering after a major crude pipeline was fixed, the country’s energy minister said Monday.
Supply outages in places like Kazakhstan and Libya have thrown the spotlight on global supply, superseding concerns that the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant might hurt demand.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $78.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $81.66. Both contracts posted gains of around 5% in the first week of the year.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,800.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1326.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 06:16AM ET</span>",Big U.S. banks expected to post uptick in core Q4 revenues on economic rebound,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Analysts expect big U.S. banks to show an uptick in fourth quarter core revenues thanks to new lending and firming Treasury yields even while headline earnings will be mixed on differences in how each institution accounted for pandemic loan losses. 
On Friday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) are expected to post roughly 20% and 30% declines, respectively, in profits compared with the year-earlier quarter, while Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s profits will be up 20% when it reports on Jan. 19, according to analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv as of Friday. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which also reports on Friday, is expected to show a 67% jump in profits.
That mixed performance will be largely due to the different pace at which banks started reversing accounting charges for pandemic-related loan losses which have not materialized. Other complicating factors are restructuring costs and asset sales at Citigroup and Wells Fargo.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), meanwhile, are expected to report fourth-quarter profit declines of about 7% and 2%, respectively, as revenue from fixed-income trading income dipped from exceptional levels. 
Broadly speaking, however, the picture is likely to be positive and analysts anticipate that bank executives will sound an optimistic note on the outlook for core earnings.
Operating profits are expected to rise as the continued economic recovery boosted loan growth and as yields from banks' Treasury securities edged up, or at least held steady, during the quarter. 
""If investors look under the hood, there is much good to be seen,"" Odeon Capital Group analyst Dick Bove wrote in note on Thursday.
Overall, core profits for big banks will be up about 6% on average after stripping out loan loss provisions, taxes and unusual items, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden estimated.
More consumers and businesses returned to their banks for credit during the fourth quarter after being propped up last year by government stimulus programs, analysts said.
Core loan balances at banks increased about 4% in the fourth quarter, the fastest growth in nearly two years, according to estimates by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Matt O'Connor, based on Fed data through Dec. 22. That strength came from both consumer credit card and business lending, he wrote in a note.
The quarter also offered a taste of the higher net interest income that could come as Treasury yields rise in 2022, according to Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. 
The difference in average daily yields between shorter- and longer-term government securities, known as the yield curve, increased slightly during the quarter. 
Betting on these positive trends, investors pushed the KBW Bank Index up 35% in 2021, easily beating the S&P 500's 27% gain.
""A late pick-up in loan growth in 4Q, coupled with a recent rise in interest rates bode well for bank (guidance) on net interest income in 1Q22 and for the full year,"" wrote O'Connor.
With the economic outlook uncertain due to inflation and the Omicron COVID-19 variant, however, some investors are cautious on buying more bank stocks. 
Doubts are growing about the Fed's ability to maintain the economic recovery on which lending growth relies after the central bank last week released minutes from its latest policy meeting that showed officials might raise interest rates sooner than expected to slow inflation. 

Jason Ware, chief investment officer for Albion Financial Group, said he is evaluating whether to buy more bank stocks but is hesitant, partly due to caution about whether higher yields are sustainable.
He's mindful, too, he added, of history suggesting that ""bank stocks do better going into rate hikes than they do during rate hikes.""

The bond would be due in 2027, it said in a financial release posted on its website. The group had already issued similar notes in October 2020, due in 2025.
Tereos, the world's second-largest sugar producer by volume, had been grappling with low prices after the end of European sugar quotas in 2017, which hit the group's results for several years and drove up its debt levels.
After a major management reshuffle at the end of 2020, the new leadership had said lowering the group's debt level was one of its priorities. Last year it said it was selling its minority stake in two starch joint ventures in China as part of the move.
S&P Ratings said shortly after the release it had given a rating of ""B+"" to the proposed senior unsecured notes.

""We understand Tereos will use the proceeds to repay existing debt, including part of its 600 million euros unsecured notes due in 2023. As a result, the refinancing will benefit the company's average debt maturity profile while the total debt amount will not change following the planned issuance,"" S&P said.

China's domestic air traffic, once the world's envy after a fast rebound during the pandemic, is faltering due to a zero-COVID policy of quickly stamping out virus clusters regardless of the economic cost. 
A growing number of imported cases as the Omicron variant spreads around the world have also led the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) to suspends more international flights recently.
The sector has been mired in deep losses since COVID-19 struck in early 2020, with China's three biggest airlines, Air China (OTC:AIRYY), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) and China Southern Airlines, posting a combined loss of 32.5 billion yuan ($5.10 billion) in the first three quarters of 2021, after a 42 billion yuan loss in 2020.
The CAAC, in a work meeting for 2022, said air passenger trips would likely exceed 570 million this year, compared with about 660 million in 2019 before COVID-19.
""Barring repeated fluctuations in COVID-19, we will strive to reverse losses and achieve profitability this year,"" the CAAC said in a statement. 
China has been banking on the domestic market to drive a recovery in its aviation sector, while heavily curtailing the number of international flights to discourage travel. 

The CAAC said on Friday it was targeting 2023-2025 for a recovery in international air travel.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 03:50AM ET</span>",JPMorgan to boost Asia private banking headcount by over 100 this year - sources,"By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) plans to boost its private banking business headcount in Asia by more than 100 this year, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, joining its peers in a push to grab a bigger share of the region's wealth.
About a fifth of its new hires will focus on clients in mainland China, the people added, which is among the fastest growing wealth markets globally despite an unprecedented regulatory crackdown that has clouded its economic prospects.
The Wall Street bank has already expanded aggressively in Asia in 2021 with 42 new joiners based in Hong Kong to cover mainland clients, bringing the total number of people on its mainland China team to 80, one of the sources said.
JPMorgan is eyeing China's wealthy individuals in the new economy sectors such as tech, biotech, and electric vehicles, the source said, adding its private banking clients in China include  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group founder Jack Ma.
Ma's charitable foundation, which handles his media queries, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Unlike some of its competitors that focus on the mass affluent segment, JPMorgan's private banking business targets individuals with at least $25 million in investable assets, the people said on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.
A J.P. Morgan Private Bank spokesperson declined to comment.
Global wealth managers, including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), HSBC and UBS, have been ramping up headcount in Asia as countries including China and India minted more billionaires and millionaires.
HSBC is ahead of its hiring targets for its Chinese retail wealth management business and is exploring re-entering India's private banking business, senior executives said in November.
It is looking to boost its mobile wealth planning service, HSBC Pinnacle, in China by having about 700 personal wealth planners by the year-end instead of the 550 originally planned.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said last May it would target to recruit 1,000 wealth professionals in Hong Kong in the next five years, including 550 new private bankers and relationship managers.

Asia's wealth management revenue pools are expected to soar faster than any other market, nearly doubling over the next five years to $52 billion, Boston Consulting Group said in a global wealth report published in June last year.
JPMorgan's asset and wealth management business had $3.0 trillion of assets under management in the third quarter last year. The bank neither discloses how much of that is accounted for by Asia, nor gives a breakup of the regional headcount.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Monday, with investors wary at the start of a week that includes the release of key U.S. inflation data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
At 4:20 AM ET (0920 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.1%.
European stock markets are trading against a backdrop of a rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus over the holiday period, although in the U.K., the first country in the region to record a surge in Omicron cases, the wave of infections appears to have peaked in London without overwhelming the healthcare system.
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock climbed 1.7% after a report by a Swiss financial website Inside Paradeplatz suggested that the beleaguered Swiss bank may be looking for a buyer. UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) were touted as potential buyers, but there is no confimation from either.
The banking sector as a whole could be in focus this week, with several large U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), set to release fourth-quarter earnings on Friday. 
Elsewhere, French business software group Atos fell 18% to a 10-year low after issuing a profit warning, while Idorsia (SIX:IDIA) stock rose 4% after the Swiss drugmaker said it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its treatment for insomnia in adult patients.
U.K. homebuilders suffered from news that they will have to pay more to remove dangerous cladding from multi-storey houses.  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW),  Persimmon  (LON:PSN), Barratt and Berkeley group all saw their stock fall by between 2.3% and 3%, putting them at the bottom of the FTSE 100.
Global stock markets will be focusing squarely on the latest U.S. inflation data this week, with strong numbers potentially cementing an early rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
The consumer price inflation data, on Wednesday, is expected to show headline CPI breaking above 7% year-on-year, approaching a four-decade high, while producer price inflation data the following day is also expected to show a surge higher.
The Fed is expected to lift interest rates well before its Eurozone counterpart, with influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now seeing the U.S. central bank raising interest rates four times this year. Even so, annual inflation in the Eurozone hit 5.0% last week, a new record high, raising the pressure on the European Central Bank to tighten its own monetary policy.
Oil prices stabilized Monday after the sharp gains of the previous week, as operator Chevron said Sunday that Kazakhstan's largest oil venture, Tengizchevroil, is gradually returning to normal production levels after recent protests limited output.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 03:15AM ET</span>",Marketmind: It's getting real,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. 
As markets move to price a U.S. interest rate liftoff, possibly even from March, 10-year Treasury yields have risen a quarter point since the year started. Even more interestingly, ""real"", or inflation-adjusted U.S. yields are driving the moves with a 33 basis-point jump. 
Real yields, while at the highest since last June, will remain deeply negative for a while. But their rise poses challenges for assets that benefited from the there-is-no-alternative reasoning. The past week saw stocks wobble, bitcoin tumble 8% and Nasdaq tech, the quintessential low-rate play, fell 4.5%. Graphic: Real yields, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egvbkjowdpq/Pasted%20image%201641767281191.png 
Holders of longer-duration bonds are also likely nervous -- such assets saw big outflows in the past four weeks, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) notes.
Meanwhile, inflation isn't letting up; euro area prices rose 5% year-on-year in December and Wednesday's U.S. CPI reading is expected at 7%-plus. The ECB has stayed resolutely dovish however -- board member Isabel Schnabel did say on the weekend the bank may need to act if energy price rises prove persistent. The euro started Monday 0.3% lower. 
Stocks are trying to claw their way back up -- U.S. and European equity futures are inching up even if Treasury yields, both real and nominal, are a touch higher. 
So what happens to stocks if real yields continue rising? There have been episodes a-plenty when equities rose alongside real yields, most recently in the March 2020-February 2021 period when a 1.5 percentage real yield increase was accompanied by a 50% global equities return.
Noting this, Berenberg recently advised clients to stay put. The share of rate-sensitive tech however is now far higher than in the past which possibly changes the equation a bit. 
Finally, let's not forget the worrying geopolitics and fast-spreading Omicron, both capable of adding to inflation and dampening economic growth. Oil prices are extending last week's 5% gain and U.S.-Russia talks look set to start later in the day with few expectations. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:
-German Finance Minister Christian Lindner and Paschal Donohoe, Eurogroup president hold press conference
-NATO head Jens Stoltenberg meets with Ukrainian Foreign Minister
- Kazakh president steps up purge of security agency
-No concessions, no breakthroughs: Russia, U.S. cast pall on Ukraine talks

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 02:15AM ET</span>",Analysis-Shrink to fit: the year Big Oil starts to become Small Oil,"By Ron Bousso and Sabrina Valle
LONDON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Europe's Big Oil companies are planning to spend their windfall from high energy prices on becoming Small Oil.
Surging oil and gas prices in 2021 delivered billions of dollars in profits to top oil companies, in stark contrast to the previous year when energy prices collapsed as the coronavirus pandemic hit travel and economic activity.
Typically, companies would invest the lion's share of that cash in long-term projects to boost oil and gas production and reserves after the previous year's deep cuts.
But unlike any other time in their history, BP (NYSE:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), TotalEnergies, Equinor and Italy's Eni are focusing on returning as much cash as possible to shareholders to keep them sweet as they begin a risky shift towards low-carbon and renewable energy.
""All of the large oil companies are managing decline to a degree,"" by shifting to fields that provide larger investment returns for shareholders and leaving more mature assets behind, said Ben Cook, portfolio manager with BP Capital Fund Advisors.
The growing pressure from investors, activists and governments to tackle climate change means that European oil giants are turning off the taps on spending on oil even as the outlook for prices and demand remains robust. 
The two-pronged strategy of reducing oil output and boosting shareholder returns was underscored when Shell sold its Permian shale oil business in the United States for $9.5 billion in September, promising to return $7 billion to investors.
Investors in U.S. companies can also expect their payouts to rise to record amounts, but  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), the top U.S. oil and gas companies, plan to continue ploughing money into new oil projects, encouraged by White House calls for more oil output to tackle high energy prices and inflation.
In 2022, European firms are set to return to investors a record $54 billion in dividends and share buybacks, according to analysis by Bernstein, while Exxon and Chevron are set to pay more than $30 billion combined. 
Graphic: Big Oil is shrinking, https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-MAJORS/akvezeoqkpr/chart_eikon.jpg SMALLER OIL
As investments in new oil projects dwindle, oil production by Europe's top five energy companies is set to drop by over 15% to below 6 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030 after reaching a peak of around 7 million bpd in 2025, data from Bernstein Research showed.
Britain's BP has said it will cut its oil output by 40%, or roughly 1 million barrels per day, by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell has said its oil output peaked in 2019 while Eni said its output will plateau in 2025. Graphic: Bringing it back home, https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-MAJORS/znpnelxbmvl/chart_eikon.jpg 
With the energy transition entering full swing, investors have welcomed the renewed focus on their returns. Having trailblazed oil and gas extraction for over a century, from drilling in the Middle East to pioneering deepwater production, oil majors have a history of pouring billions of dollars into huge, complex projects which ran over budget and behind schedule, leading to a decade of poor returns after 2010.
""Strategies for the energy transition are becoming more defined, but investors won't buy a story given the failures of the past, so the companies will need to prove they can deliver on these strategies effectively and profitably,"" said Alasdair McKinnon of the Scottish Investment Fund. 
HARVEST TIME
Some oil production will remain a key fuel in the energy transition and natural gas output is set to increase as countries such as India and China look to substitute gas for the most polluting fossil fuel - coal.
At the same time, European oil majors are diverting spending to renewables such as wind and solar power, promising that returns from their low-carbon businesses will match or even grow beyond those of oil and gas in the long run.
That is in contrast to U.S. companies, where Exxon and Chevron have largely stayed away from renewables. Chevron Chief Executive Mike Worth has said renewables ""don't generate the double digit returns that investors want.""
The sharp drop already seen in investments in new oil developments by European companies in recent years has helped push long-term oil prices higher on the expectation of supply falling short of demand.
""Such caution could underpin hydrocarbon prices, since energy demand looks set to continue to grow... and supply could be restrained, especially as renewable and alternative sources of power do not yet look ready to take up the baseload slack,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at online platform AJ Bell.
Demand for oil is expected to peak around 2030 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
""Oil executives are aware of public pressure, their environmental responsibilities and the opprobrium that any major new work could bring,"" Mould said, adding that companies will resist the temptation to ramp production back up.
Shell's Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said the company is looking longer term and while it wants to enjoy the strong oil prices, ""we are not minded to invest in a big way in a rising market because we believe that by the time we can start to harvest it, we will be beyond that peak again."" 

Europe's strategy will be a test case, said BP Capital Fund's Cook.
“It is hard to say who is right in the pace of the transition. Time will tell if Europe went too fast.”

At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
Global stock markets will be focusing squarely on the latest U.S. inflation data this week, with strong numbers potentially cementing an early rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
The consumer price inflation data, on Wednesday, is expected to show headline CPI breaking above 7% year-on-year, approaching a four-decade high, while producer price inflation data the following day is also expected to show a surge higher.
Additionally, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to testify Tuesday before a Senate panel at his nomination hearing, and his comments will be parsed carefully for clues as to the central bank’s intentions.
The Fed is expected to lift interest rates well before its Eurozone counterpart, with influential investment bank Goldman Sachs now seeing the U.S. central bank raising interest rates four times this year. Even so, annual inflation in the Eurozone hit 5.0% last week, a new record high, raising the pressure on the European Central Bank to tighten its own monetary policy.
This is occurring against a backdrop of a rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus over the holiday period, with the healthcare systems in many European countries stretched almost to the limit.
In corporate news, the banking sector is likely to be in focus this week, with fourth quarter results from several large U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), starting the earnings season on Friday.
Oil prices stabilized Monday after the sharp gains of the previous week, as operator Chevron said Sunday that Kazakhstan's largest oil venture, Tengizchevroil, is gradually returning to normal production levels after recent protests limited output.
Libya’s oil production is also recovering after a major crude pipeline was fixed, the country’s energy minister said Monday.
Supply outages in places like Kazakhstan and Libya have thrown the spotlight on global supply, superseding concerns that the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant might hurt demand.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $79.08 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $81.95. Both contracts posted gains of around 5% in the first week of the year.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,791.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1333.

Yu Minhong, who founded the company in 1993, published the figures on his official WeChat account on Saturday in a disclosure that showed how the crackdown in July 2021 hit what was once one of China's largest private tutoring firms. 
The WeChat post did not specify a time period for the drop in operating profit. 
Prior to the new rules, New Oriental had employed 105,200 staff including 54,200 teachers, according to its website. 
Chinese authorities last year banned for-profit tutoring in subjects on the school curriculum in an effort to ease pressure on children and parents, leading to a wave of school closures and lay offs across the private education sector. 
New Oriental, which has also seen its market value sink by 90% since the rules were announced, has been trying to pivot its business to other sectors that are not impacted by the regulations, including dancing and drawing classes and tutoring Chinese to foreigners in overseas markets. 
Yu has also steered the company into selling fruit and vegetables via live streaming and said the company plans to set up its own live streaming e-commerce platform for farmers. 

""New Oriental encountered too many changes in 2021,"" he said in his WeChat post.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2022 11:35PM ET</span>",Virgin Australia to cut capacity by 25% as COVID-19 cases rise,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Virgin Australia said on Monday it would reduce capacity across its network by around 25% for the rest of January and for February due to reduced travel demand and staff being required to isolate as COVID-19 case numbers rise in Australia.
The airline, which competes against Qantas Airways Ltd, said it would cut some flight frequencies and suspend 10 routes temporarily.
Australia on Monday surpassed 1 million COVID-19 cases, with more than half of them recorded in the past week, as the Omicron variant ripped through most of the country driving up hospitalisation numbers and putting a strain on supply chains.
Virgin Australia Chief Executive Jayne Hrdlicka said the surge in COVID-19 cases had affected customer confidence.

""Virgin Australia remains focused on growing its network and consumer reach and will resume services as soon travel demand improves,"" she said in a statement.
The airline said in November it would add seven more Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 NG planes to its fleet, nearly restoring it to pre-pandemic levels, to help meet a goal of obtaining a one-third share of Australia's domestic travel market.

The world's top fibre cement products maker on Friday fired CEO Jack Truong, saying dozens of top executives had threatened to quit due to his conduct, which was not rectified despite repeated calls to do so and breached its code of conduct.
Executive Chairman Mike Hammes later said on a conference call that he had urged Truong to change his behaviour but a ""sincere change"" had not occurred.
""I was blindsided by the termination and unequivocally reject the assertions made by Mr. Hammes and the company,"" Truong said in an emailed statement early Monday.
""I'm ... proud of the progress we made in building a culture of inclusion and respect with our more than 5,000 devoted employees. Based on employee and customer feedback, it was clear that they recognised our progress,"" Truong added.
Truong's departure came at a time James Hardie has ridden a pandemic housing boom to record profits, and highlighted the growing importance firms are putting on executive conduct beyond just earnings and dividends.
A spokesperson for James Hardie said the board had ""provided clear feedback and counselling on the impact that Truong's behaviours were having on his colleagues on multiple occasions"" before terminating his employment.

""This decision was in the best interests of the company, its people and the delivery of its strategy,"" the spokesperson added.
Brokerage Citi said it saw little cause for concern in the short-term from Truong's departure, but that the company's strategy may have a different feel over the medium-term when Hammes retires.

1264,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 09, 2022 09:54PM ET</span>",China Health Stocks Post Worst Start in Six Years as Woes Deepen,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese health-care stocks took another battering last week in the worst start to the year since 2016, as selling resumed amid worries over Beijing’s plans to cut medical costs and set out stricter drug development rules. 
The CSI 300 Health Care Index plunged 5.5% in the first week of trading, more than double the broader mainland benchmark, driven by biotech and pharmaceutical names. Losses were led by Asymchem Laboratories Co. Ltd., which fell 19% last week, its biggest decline on record. 
A year-long sweeping regulatory crackdown on private enterprise ranging from technology giants to property developers has also hit health-care firms. They are contending with unexpected shifts in research and development policies as well as drags on profit from drug price cuts. The sector now trades at 33 times 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio, from nearly 55 times in February last year. 
The decline also tracks the S&P 500 Health Care Index, which tumbled 4.7% last week as rising bond yields weighed on demand for companies yet to make a profit.
“Beijing’s policy uncertainty remains an overhang for the sector,” said Mia He, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. New regulatory measures including oncology drug development guidances have put some pressure on biotech companies and firms providing contract services to drug makers since the second half of 2021. That’s made investors “sensitive to unexpected policy updates,” she added.
Those draft guidelines released last year have worried investors because of the potential to slow down drug approvals and set a higher bar on innovative drugs. 
The sector was also caught in the crossfire of an escalation in Sino-U.S. tensions last month. Shares tanked as investors speculated that the firms may be added to the U.S.’s list of sanctioned entities, and they haven’t fully recovered even though they weren’t included in the list in the end. 
Investors should expect continued short-term volatility from potential major policies in the first quarter shaping clinical trial practices,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts including John Yung wrote in a Jan. 5 note. However, pharmaceutical names may have “bottomed out” and could see a recovery in their valuations on the back of new product launches, clinical developments and potential mergers and acquisitions, they said.
A rare bright spot is the traditional Chinese medicine sector led by Beijing Tongrentang Co., after those firms’ drugs were included in the nation’s medical insurance. That’s a reflection of the industry being a source of national pride that counts Xi among its supporters. 
But whether the rally can be sustained remains questionable, says Citigroup, as the sector may see a growth slowdown in the future due to the lack of new products.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2022 05:20PM ET</span>",GM recognizes California's authority to set vehicle emissions rules,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co on Sunday said it had agreed to recognize California’s authority to set vehicle emission standards under the Clean Air Act.
The move will make the Detroit automaker eligible for government fleet purchases by the state of California, GM said.
The automaker made the commitment to recognize California's authority in a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom. GM said in the letter it is ""committed to complying with California's regulations.""
Soon after Joe Biden was elected president, GM in November 2020 reversed itself and no longer backed an effort by the then-Trump administration to bar California from setting its own emissions rules.
""GM is joining California in our fight for clean air and emission reduction as part of the company's pursuit of a zero-emissions future,"" Newsom said. ""This agreement will help accelerate California's nation-leading commitment to tackling the climate crisis.""
GM announced in January plans to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. In June, GM boosted global spending on electric and autonomous vehicles to $35 billion through 2025, 30% over its prior forecast.
""We are committed to working in collaboration with California to achieve an equitable transportation future,"" said GM's global public policy chief Omar Vargas.
In November 2019, California said it planned to halt all purchases of new vehicles for state government fleets from GM, Toyota and other automakers backing former President Donald Trump in the tailpipe emissions battle.
California said it purchased $58.6 million in General Motors (NYSE:GM) vehicles between 2016 and 2018.
In April, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it was moving to restore legal authority to California to set tough vehicle emission rules and zero-emission vehicle mandates.
In July, 16 Republican state attorneys general urged the EPA to reject reinstating California's authority. ""The Golden State is not a golden child,"" they wrote.
GM previously backed overall emissions reductions in California's 2019 deal with rivals Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Honda and others, but asked the Biden administration to give automakers more flexibility to hit carbon reduction targets.

California plans to ban the sale of new gasoline powered passenger vehicles starting in 2035, a step the Biden administration declines to endorse. Biden has called for 50% of new vehicles sold by 2030 to be electric or plug-in hybrid.
Last month, the EPA finalized https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-epa-finalizes-tougher-new-vehicle-emissions-requirements-2021-12-20 new vehicle emissions requirements through 2026 that reversed Trump's rollback of car pollution cuts and will speed a U.S. shift to more electric vehicles.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has filed fresh legal challenges in its long-running dispute with Indian retailer Future Group after the national antitrust agency suspended a 2019 deal between the two sides, leading to a halt in their arbitration, four sources told Reuters on Sunday.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last month suspended its approval of Amazon's 2019 deal with Future, denting the U.S. e-commerce giant's attempts to block the sale of Future's retail assets to Indian market leader Reliance Industries.
The suspension jolted Amazon as subsequently a New Delhi court halted the arbitration proceedings between the two sides.
Late on Saturday night, Amazon filed an appeal against the CCI suspension decision at India's National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, two of the sources said.
Separately, two other sources said, Amazon also filed a challenge in the Supreme Court against the Delhi court decision in which judges last week that said Future-Amazon arbitration proceedings must remain on hold until Feb. 1 in light of the antitrust suspension of the deal.
Amazon and the CCI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The filings are the latest in the bitter legal dispute which has embroiled Amazon, Future and Reliance over what is seen as a battle for retail supremacy in India's booming consumer market. 
Reliance, run by one of India's richest men Mukesh Ambani, wants to expand its footprint by acquiring debt-laden Future, but Amazon has told India's antitrust body it believes Reliance's consolidated position ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"".
Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of its 2019 deal in deciding to sell retail assets to Reliance. The U.S. company's position has so far been backed by the Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts. Future denies any wrongdoing.

But after the CCI suspended that deal's approval, saying Amazon suppressed information while seeking clearances for the deal, Future has argued Amazon no longer has any legal basis to pursue the dispute.
Both of Amazon's appeals, to the Indian tribunal and Supreme Court, are likely to be heard in coming days, two of the sources said.

Rio Tinto wants to develop the mine near Loznica in the western Jadar valley, but the local municipality has already scrapped a plan https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rio-tinto-pause-lithium-mine-serbia-after-protests-report-2021-12-23 to allocate land for it.
The development is part of Serbia's efforts to bring in investment and boost economic growth. But environmentalists have staged protests and blocked roads to press authorities to end the project, which they say would cause irreparable damage to the area.
Rio has said any development would meet domestic and European Union environmental standards.
The protests have caused a political headache for the ruling coalition loyal to President Aleksandar Vucic ahead of April elections.
""We have neither brought them (Rio Tinto) in, nor have we made promises, nor have we done anything that the people did not know about,"" Brnabic told television channel Pink, saying the government was close to accepting all requests from environmentalists.
""We have worked in a transparent way, we have listened to the people,"" Brnabic said, adding the government needed to see how much it would have to pay out if the deal is annulled. 
Brnabic also said the government wanted to win agreement for any decision from President Aleksandar Vucic, who she said was against the fulfilling of ""requests by foreign services and agencies"".

Vucic has repeatedly said that opening the mine would dependon the outcome of an environmental study and a referendum. 
The protesters who blocked roads including in the capital Belgrade want the government to ban the extraction of lithium not only by Rio Tinto but any other company.

Hit by a string of profit warnings last year, the former phone monopoly lost its fourth CEO in six years after Luigi Gubitosi stepped down in November, a week after receiving a 33 billion euro ($37 billion) takeover approach by U.S. fund KKR.
Since then, the CEO powers have been split between the head of TIM Brasil, Pietro Labriola, who has been named general manager, and TIM Chairman Salvatore Rossi.
The group has an ordinary board meeting scheduled for Jan. 26. 
Labriola is a leading candidate for the role of CEO and has the backing of Vivendi, sources have previously said.
The French group, which controls a 23.8% stake in TIM, gave a cold response to the KKR offer, saying it is too low. 
A power struggle inside TIM has delayed the group's response to KKR, which requested access to company data before making a formal bid. 
Labriola, a veteran TIM executive, has been tasked to iron out a new three-year business plan to revamp TIM on a standalone basis, under a strategy that could include a spin-off of its prized fixed network infrastructure, sources have said.

Telecom Italia and Vivendi declined to comment.

(Reuters) -The head of communications at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms Inc, John Pinette, is leaving the company, the social media company said late on Friday.
Chris Norton, vice president of international communications, will cover the role on an interim basis, a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
""John Pinette has left Meta. We are thankful for his positive contributions during an intense and significant time in the company’s history, and we wish him well going forward,"" the statement said.
The spokesperson declined to say why Pinette was leaving, citing Meta policy of not commenting on personnel matters. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported Pinette's departure on Friday. 

Pinette was appointed vice president of global communications in April 2019, according to the company's website.
Before joining the company, Pinette led communications for Gates Ventures, the private office and innovation lab of Bill Gates, for five years, and was the head of Asia Pacific communications for Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2022 01:55AM ET</span>","No jab, no job: Citigroup to fire unvaccinated staff this month - memo","By David Henry, Noor Zainab Hussain and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) staff in the United States who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 14 will be placed on unpaid leave and fired at the end of the month unless they are granted an exemption, according to a company memo seen by Reuters on Friday.
The U.S. bank announced its plan to impose new vaccination rules in October and now becomes the first major Wall Street institution to follow through with a strict vaccine mandate.
Its move comes as the financial industry grapples with how to bring workers back to offices safely and get back to business as usual at a time when the highly infectious Omicron coronavirus variant is spreading like wildfire.
Other major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS),,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), have told some unvaccinated employees to work from home, but none has yet gone as far as sacking staff.
While Citigroup is the first Wall Street bank to enforce a vaccine mandate, a handful of other major U.S. companies have introduced ""no-jab, no-job"" policies, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and United Airlines, with varying degrees of stringency.
More than 90% of Citigroup employees have complied with the mandate so far and that figure is rising rapidly, according to a source familiar with the matter, adding that the timing of the vaccination mandate would be different for branch staff. 
When it announced its policy, Citigroup also said it would assess exemptions on religious or medical grounds, or any other accommodation by state or local law, on a case-by-case basis.
The bank said then it was complying with the policy of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration requiring all workers supporting government contracts to be fully vaccinated, as the government was a ""large and important"" client.
""You are welcome to apply for other roles at Citi in the future as long as you are compliant with Citi’s vaccination policy,"" the bank said in the memo. ""If you are not vaccinated, we urge you to get vaccinated as soon as possible.""
DIVISIVE ISSUE
Vaccination has become a divisive issue in the United States, as it has in many countries around the world, with some people fiercely opposed and many Republicans critical of mandates imposed by governments and businesses.
The U.S. Supreme Court was hearing arguments on Friday over requests by Republican state officials and business groups to block a Biden mandate for firms with more than 100 workers that requires employees be vaccinated or tested weekly.
Columbia Business School professor Adam Galinsky, who advises companies on their return-to-office strategies, said many companies initially welcomed the White House's vaccine mandate because it took the matter out of their hands. 
""However, companies are recognizing that the Biden mandate may not hold up at the conservative Supreme Court,"" he said. ""If it doesn't hold then they are going to have the decision put back in their hands and they will have to do something.""
Many financial firms have pushed back their return-to-office plans and are encouraging staff to get vaccinated and boosted, but have so far avoided vaccine mandates for legal reasons. 
""This is going to be a challenging and complex policy to implement,"" said Chase Hattaway, a partner at law firm RumbergerKirk, noting the bank has to navigate federal anti-discrimination and other state laws.
""Citi will have to tailor its policy to state legislation, and in many cases, cities and municipalities will have different regulations as well, that may require even further carve-outs,"" Hattaway said.
UNPAID LEAVE
Jacqueline Voronov, partner at law firm Hall Booth Smith, said, however, that courts have been upholding the right of private employers to mandate vaccines.
""A private employer is allowed to mandate its own policy. And if Citi wants to have a mandatory vaccination policy, they can do that,"" she said, provided the bank offers medical exemptions.
An increasing number of U.S. companies have been using vaccine requirements to protect employees and avoid operations being disrupted by mass staff absences.
United Airlines Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said last month the carrier fired 200 of its 67,000 employees for failure to comply with its mandate. 

Many hospitals have fired staff for failing to comply with mandates, which have been imposed on the healthcare industry in more than 20 states.
While some companies such as  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) have gotten more than 96% of its employees to take a vaccine, those in construction and retail have resisted vaccine mandates over fears of staff resistance amid a very tight labor market.

Reddit had confidentially filed for an IPO in December and is aiming for a valuation of over $15 billion at the time of its flotation. It was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round led by Fidelity Management in August.
A second source familiar with the matter said JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is also one of the top underwriters on the deal.
Goldman Sachs and Reddit did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.
Reddit, which was founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, has more than 50 million daily active users and over 100,000 communities.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street on Friday wrapped up the first week of the new year with daily and weekly losses as investors worried about looming U.S. interest-rate hikes and unfolding Omicron news.
The Nasdaq posted its biggest weekly percentage fall since February 2021 and led declines for the day in the major indexes. Stocks fell on Friday after the December U.S. jobs report missed expectations but was still seen as strong enough to keep the Federal Reserve's tightening path in place.
Friday's Labor Department data showed the U.S. jobs market was at or near maximum employment even though employment rose far less than expected in December, when there were worker shortages.
On Wednesday, minutes released of the Fed's Dec. 14-15 policy meeting showed officials at the U.S. central bank viewed the labor market as ""very tight,"" and signaled the Fed may have to raise rates sooner than expected.
""The investor takeaway is that the labor market continues to be tight despite the headline miss,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in Boston.
""Investors are concerned the Fed will be more aggressive than expected.""
Consumer discretionary and and technology sectors led the way lower on the S&P 500 on Friday. Big tech companies have benefited from low interest rates.
On the flip side, the S&P 500 financials sector and banking index extended recent gains and reached record closing highs. The bank index rose 9.4% for the week, registering its biggest weekly percentage gain since November 2020.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.81 points, or 0.01%, to 36,231.66, the S&P 500 lost 19.02 points, or 0.41%, to 4,677.03 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.96 points, or 0.96%, to 14,935.90.
For the week, the Dow fell 0.3%, the S&P 500 declined 1.9% and the Nasdaq dropped 4.5%. 
Banks have risen with U.S. Treasury yields, with the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield soaring to a two-year high on Friday on the outlook for Fed rate hikes. [US/]
""The sentiment has turned negative,"" said Jack Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""Right now the market is nervous and in the mood to sell at the first hint of bad news.""
Rising cases on the Omicron variant of the coronavirus also caused investor jitters this week.
Investors have been rotating out technology-heavy growth shares and into more value-oriented shares, which they think may do better in a high interest-rate environment. 
The S&P 500 value index added 1% this week, outperforming the S&P 500 growth index which fell 4.5%, its biggest weekly percentage drop since October 2020.
The S&P 500 energy sector gained sharply for the week, rising 10.6% in its best week since November 2020.
""Meme stock""  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) jumped 7.3% after the video game retailer said it is launching a division to develop a marketplace for nonfungible tokens and establish cryptocurrency partnerships.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Friday revived a pension plan's 2019 shareholder lawsuit against Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co officers and directors alleging they had made false public statements about the 737 Max.
The plane was involved in two crashes that killed 346 people over a five-month period and led to the plane's grounding in March 2019.
The Seafarers Pension Plan filed a lawsuit alleging that current and former Boeing officers and board members made false and misleading statements about the 737 MAX in proxy materials from 2017 through 2019. The suit seeks damages from these people on behalf of the company. 
A U.S. District Court judge previously dismissed the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, applying a Boeing bylaw that gave the company the right to insist claims be filed in a Delaware state court. In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit on Friday reversed the lower court ruling. 
Filing the suit in a federal court in Chicago, where Boeing is headquartered, ""seems appropriate for the case,"" the majority wrote. The Delaware court does not have jurisdiction over the federal claims at issue, the ruling said. 
Boeing declined to comment.
The 737 Max crisis cost Boeing more than $20 billion and grounded the plane for 20 months. The 737 MAX only returned to service after the company made significant software and training improvements.

In November, Boeing current and former company directors reached a $237.5 million settlement with shareholders in a separate lawsuit over the board's 737 MAX safety oversight.
Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department in January 2021 stemming from the 737 MAX crashes.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A new Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) brewery, diverted to the Gulf coast state of Veracruz in Mexico after a dispute over water use, will be built by a major river, a government official said on Friday.
The plant is part of planned investment in Mexico of up to $5.5 billion by the U.S. producer of beer, wine and spirits through 2026.
Constellation will build the plant by the Rio Papaloapan in central Veracruz, presidential spokesperson Jesus Ramirez told Reuters.
""As a government we're not opposed to private investment, nor foreign investment. They're welcome as long as they respect the environment ... and Mexican laws.""
Constellation, whose brands include Corona beer, Robert Mondavi wines and Svedka vodka, has yet to decide on a site or budget for the plant, company spokesperson Nina Mayagoitia said.
Constellation said this week it would build the plant in Veracruz. A dispute over water access prompted it in 2020 to halt construction of its largely completed brewery in the arid, northern border city of Mexicali.
Area residents said the brewery, which had cost hundreds of millions of dollars, threatened their water supply and rejected it in a referendum promoted by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
The referendum result caused widespread consternation among business groups, and the deal to bring the plant to Mexico's poorer south is a victory for Lopez Obrador.
Constellation said on Thursday it would invest $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2023 to 2026 on the Veracruz brewery and two other plants already in operation in Mexico.

Constellation denied media reports that Mexico had compensated it for losses on the Mexicali project, which was initially earmarked as an investment worth around $1.5 billion 
""We're in talks, hoping that (money) can be recovered, but there's no certainty,"" Mayagoitia said.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended up 12.25 points, or 0.06%, at 21,084.45 on Friday. For the week, it was down 0.65% after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday struck a hawkish note in minutes from its latest meeting. 
""The story is still tied to the Fed and rising interest rates coming sooner than expected,"" said Sadiq Adatia, chief investment officer at BMO Asset Management.
Wall Street extended its weekly decline as investors remained worried about the U.S. interest rate outlook even after a weaker-than-expected December payrolls report.
Domestic data showed the Canadian economy adding twice as many jobs as expected in December, supporting expectations for the Bank of Canada to begin hiking rates in the coming months.
""What you have been seeing is a bit of rotation going on ... the high-flying tech names have been selling off,"" Adatia said.
Higher interest rates reduce the value to investors of the future cash flows that technology and other high growth sectors are expected to produce.

(Reuters) -GameStop Corp's stock rallied on Friday after a report that the videogame retailer plans to expand its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) marketplace and partner with crypto firms.
The company's shares soared last year as it was at the center of a battle between small investors coordinating on online forums and Wall Street hedge funds that had taken short positions. Since mid-November, its stock has mostly declined.
On Friday, GameStop (NYSE:GME) jumped 7.3% to $140.62 after reports late on Thursday that the company would build an online hub for trading NFTs for virtual game collectibles and establish cryptocurrency partnerships. 
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters about GameStop's plans, which had been reported by the Wall Street Journal.
GameStop declined to comment on the reports. 
NFTs, which use blockchain to record the ownership of digital items such as images and videos, surged in popularity in 2021, leaving many confused about why so much money was being spent on copiable digital items that do not physically exist.
Highly volatile crypto assets have tumbled in recent months, with bitcoin plummeting to a more than three-month low of $42,001.97, down about 38% from its $69,000 all-time high in November.
Ether, used to buy NFTs, has slumped to $3,219.77, levels last seen in early October.
""Meme stocks are speculative rather than fundamental and, to a degree, cryptos are also little speculative in nature ... too much of an exposure to cryptos could have an effect on the balance sheets of these companies,"" warned Mirabaud analyst Neil Campling.
Short selling against GameStop increased by about 1 million shares to 8.4 million in the past 30 days, now worth $1.11 billion and equivalent to 13% of GameStop's free float, according to data from S3 Partners. 

Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said Friday's share move was unlikely to be a short-covering rally.
""First we would need to wipe out recent mark-to-market profits on the short side, which means getting back to levels in the $170 - $200 stock price range,"" for a short squeeze to happen, Dusaniwsky said.

Technology and growth shares eased as investors remained worried about the U.S. interest rate outlook, while consumer discretionary and technology sectors led the way lower on the S&P 500; financials extended recent gains.
It had already been a confusing week for stocks. After a start to 2022 marked by new highs, the mood changed on Wednesday after minutes from the Fed's December meeting signaled the central bank may have to raise interest rates sooner than expected.
Wall Street steadied by Thursday evening, though analysts at ING bank said the minutes were still reverberating across markets, driving bond yields higher, hitting growth stocks and supporting the dollar.
The MSCI All Country stock index was flat at 743.52 points, down nearly 2% from a record high on Tuesday. In Europe, the STOXX index was off 0.4% at 486.3 points, also off about 1.6% from a record high on Tuesday.
SUPPLY CONCERNS
Longer-dated Treasury yields rose anew on Friday but shorter-term government bonds declined after the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. Analysts said the data was solid enough to keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates at its March meeting - or sooner.
""Today’s report should be eye-opening for the Fed as tight labor conditions are only going to exacerbate the building inflation problem,"" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management in Minneapolis, said. ""It would be surprising if the Fed is not contemplating a faster removal of policy accommodation at the January meeting.""
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was last at 1.7673%, up from 1.7461% before the payrolls data.
Euro zone inflation rose unexpectedly last month to 5% from 4.9% in November, a record high for the currency bloc, though unlike the Fed, the European Central Bank says prices will ease enough this year to avoid the need for rate hikes.
The dollar was on track for its biggest daily percentage drop in six weeks on the heels of the jobs report seen as strong enough to keep the Fed's tightening path intact.
The dollar index fell 0.53% at 95.750, and was poised for its biggest drop since Nov. 26, when concerns about the Omicron COVID-19 variant began to rattle markets. Even with Friday's weakness, the dollar was still on track for a slight weekly gain, its first in three weeks.
Oil prices settled lower as the market weighed supply concerns from the unrest in Kazakhstan and outages in Libya against the mixed U.S. jobs report and its potential impact on Federal Reserve policy. 
U.S. crude fell 0.52% to $79.05 per barrel and Brent was at $81.90, down 0.11% on the day, partially erasing gains earlier in the week. [O/R]
Spot gold stood at $1,795 an ounce, up slightly on the day after touching a two-week low of $1,788.25 on Thursday, as rising U.S. Treasury yields hurt demand for the non-interest bearing metal. 

Bitcoin slumped as much as 5% on Friday to its lowest since late September, amid a broader sell-off for cryptocurrencies driven by concerns about tighter U.S. monetary policy.
Bitcoin was last down about 3% at $41,896 after touching $40,938, its lowest since Sept. 29, as the payrolls data fueled some bargain buying.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 04:45PM ET</span>",Hawkish Fed gives value stocks a second wind,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are recalibrating their portfolios to account for a more hawkish Federal Reserve, as signs that the central bank is ready to pull out the stops in its fight against inflation has shaken up markets in the first week of 2022. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury are on track for their biggest weekly gain since September, 2019, while technology and growth stocks have tumbled and investors snapped up shares of banks, energy firms and other economically sensitive companies. 
The action is broadly reminiscent of how markets started 2021, when the rollout of vaccines for the coronavirus boosted expectations of a U.S. economic reopening. Yields slipped later in the year while the rally in economically sensitive shares slowed and investors returned to the big technology and growth stocks that have led markets higher for the last decade. 
This time around, investors must factor in a Fed that is expected to raise rates at least three times this year as it battles surging consumer prices. This could weigh on tech and growth stocks, as higher borrowing costs could erode their future earnings. The S&P 500 Value index has gained around 1% for the year to date, while the S&P 500 Growth index has fallen around 4%. The broader index was recently down around 1.7% for the year. 
Bob Leininger, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, expects that trend to continue and is focusing more of his portfolio on financials, energy, and aviation stocks such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co in anticipation of a broad resurgence in global travel. 
""The Fed is serious about ending quantitative easing,"" he said. ""This is the year that we will start to see quantitative tightening and that will favor value stocks."" 
While investors typically view a hawkish Fed with caution, equities have nevertheless tended to rise during past rate-hike cycles. The S&P 500 has risen at an average annualized rate of 9% during the 12 such cycles since the 1950s and showed positive returns in 11 of those instances, according to data from Truist Advisory Services. 
Expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates at least three times in 2022 will ""cut down on speculation"" in the market, said Lew Altfest, chief executive of Altfest Personal Wealth Management. 
That will likely weigh on both deep value-oriented sectors like travel and energy that saw outsized gains in 2021, while at the same time hurting high-growth technology shares, he said. 
Altfest is focusing on companies such as banks, which he expects to benefit from higher interest rates and trade at comparatively lower valuations, while also maintaining positions in giant technology-focused companies. 
The S&P 500 bank sector was recently up more than 7% year-to-date and trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 11.5, compared to a 26.1 price to earnings ratio for the broader index. 
Banks “just look more rational,"" Altfest said. 
Investors will get a closer look at bank earnings in the week ahead as several large banks, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), are expected to release their quarterly results. 
Some believe the heavy weighting of tech-focused stocks in the S&P 500 could slow the broader index if those names stumbled: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) accounted for nearly a third of the S&P 500’s almost 29% total return last year, according to data from UBS Global Wealth Management. 
Though many of the big tech stocks have gotten hit in recent days, the pain has been much worse in smaller tech names that rallied during the early stages of the pandemic. The ARKK Innovation ETF, which was the best performing equity fund of 2020, is already down some 11% year-to-date.
Others, however, are betting investors will inevitably return to tech stocks, which have handily outperformed other parts of the market for years. 

Ross Frankenfield, managing director at Harbor Capital Advisors, has beefed up his allocation to larger cap financials but expects momentum to shift back to mega-cap tech stocks later in the year as it becomes clear that economic growth will stagnate in 2023. 
""There is a good near-term case for value stocks, but over the long run we think there will be a tailwind for mega-cap growth stocks again once earnings are harder to come by,"" he said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed down Friday, marking its worst weekly start to a year since 2016 amid pressure from tech stocks as Treasury yields continued to rally on rate hike expectations despite a mixed monthly job report.
The S&P 500 fell 0.4% taking the weekly loss to 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.01%, or 4.8 points, the Nasdaq lost 1%.
The U.S. economy created 199,000 jobs in December, markedly missing expectations for a gain of 400,000. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% from 4.2% as the participation rate remained unchanged, pointing to a tight labor market.
In a sign that inflation pressures are likely to persist and prompt the Fed into sooner than expected monetary policy tightening, wage growth jumped 0.6% for the month, above economists' forecast for a 0.4% increase.
“Today’s data affirms the Federal Reserve’s conclusion that the labor market has recovered despite the shortfall in jobs since February 2020,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Expectations for more an aggressive path of Fed tightening pushed yields higher, with the 10-year yield briefly rising to 1.8%, and underpinned a bid in the cyclical sectors of the market such as financials.
The move higher in yields is expected to continue to support the financials including bank stocks, which benefit from a rising rate environment.
“I would be looking at 2% or even 2.25% on the 10-year yield as an upside target,” Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
“[V]ery few of us have been in an environment, as investors, where banks have consistently outperformed tech stocks, that just hasn't happened in a long, long time [but] that's more the environment we're going to be in,” Keller added.
Energy stocks continued to shine even as oil prices had a timid end to the week as investors continued to back the sector ahead of the quarterly earnings season, which starts in earnest next week.
“We could come out of this first earnings season, seeing sectors like financials and energy looking fairly attractive and a lot of clouds on the horizon for growth sectors,”  according to Keller.
Tech fell as mixed performance in big tech gave up gains and weakness in semiconductor stocks exacerbated the weakness.  
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) and  ON Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:ON) were down more 3%
Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) was one of the bright spots on the day, rising nearly 17% after Bank of America upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, citing the company’s pending merger with Warner Media.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two U.S. lawmakers on Friday raised concerns about home rental firm Airbnb Inc's business activities in China's Xinjiang region, where Washington says Beijing is committing genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslim groups.
Senator Jeff Merkley and Representative James McGovern, two Democrats who respectively chair and co-chair the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, sent Airbnb a letter asking about some of its listings in Xinjiang and other issues.
Airbnb did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China denies abuses in Xinjiang.
The lawmakers cited an Axios website report that more than a dozen of Airbnb’s listings in Xinjiang are on land owned by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), which was hit by U.S. Treasury Department sanctions in 2020.
The action freezes any U.S. assets of the company and officials and generally prohibits Americans from dealing with them.
The letter cited the U.S. Department of State as saying XPCC is a quasi-military organization ""directly involved in forced labor and possibly other human rights abuses"" in Xinjiang.

The lawmakers said they were raising ""questions about Airbnb’s commitment to human rights and anti-discrimination in China as it sponsors the Beijing Winter Olympics"" that starts next month.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday repeated its denials of abuses in Xinjiang and said certain members of Congress ""repeatedly hyped up the issues and exerted pressure on companies."" It asserted some lawmakers had a ""malicious intention of hijacking business with political schemes and keeping China down with Xinjiang-related issues.""

The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has prompted a spike in cases in the United States and worker shortages at schools, airlines and businesses. On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) backed recent guidance that people who contract the virus can end their isolation after five days.
In a message to staff, which Amazon shared with Reuters, the online retailer said its new week-long isolation policy took effect immediately. Workers with the virus can receive up to 40 hours paid leave, a decrease corresponding to the shorter isolation period.
""Do not come to work if you are sick,"" the message said. ""Additional leave options are available for individuals who remain symptomatic beyond one week.""

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the news.
With hundreds of thousands of warehouse and logistics staff, Amazon is the second-largest U.S. private employer. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the largest, this week told workers it was halving its COVID-19 paid leave in line with the updated CDC guidance.

Investing.com — Shares of  Digital Brands Group Inc  (NASDAQ:DBGI), the collection of luxury lifestyle, digital-first brands, fell over 14% Friday after the company updated the market on its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance.
Fourth quarter revenue is predicted to come in line with the company's previous forecast of around $4 million. However, Digital Brands said revenue in the quarter was slightly affected by global supply chain delays in the apparel industry. 
""The delays were due to some of our products stuck in transport, which were limited to our Bailey 44 brand,"" the company said in its statement.
Meanwhile, DBGI's fiscal year 2021 net revenue is anticipated to increase 44%, to $7.6 million, versus $5.2 million a year ago. However, the revenue figure does not include the entire net revenue from 2021 for Harper & Jones or Stateside, as the company acquired the brands during fiscal year 2021.
Focusing on 2022, the company reaffirmed its fiscal year revenue guidance of $37.5 million to $42.5 million, representing around a 350% increase over the previous year. Furthermore, it forecasts a positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 2022.
""Our 2022 revenue guidance reflects the power of our brand portfolio, especially as we are able to benefit from the full year revenue contribution from our acquisitions in 2021,"" stated Hil Davis, CEO of Digital Brands.
""This forecasted increase of 350% in our year over revenue growth does not reflect any potential additional acquisitions, nor does it reflect any meaningful benefit from our expected increase in marketing spend."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday allowed Purdue Pharma to immediately challenge her rejection of legal protections for Sackler family members who own the OxyContin maker, and which were a major component of its bankruptcy reorganization plan.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon's ruling means Purdue will have another shot at keeping intact a $4.5 billion opioid litigation settlement at the heart of the company's plan. She gave Purdue until Jan. 17 to file the appeal to the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
McMahon reversed a bankruptcy judge’s order approving the deal in December. The settlement provides so-called nondebtor releases that shield the Sacklers against future opioid-related lawsuits.
Several states and the U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog opposed the releases, saying the Sacklers should not be afforded such protections since they did not file for bankruptcy themselves.
McMahon said in Friday's ruling that the appeal should be handled quickly ""given the urgency of the opioid crisis and the importance of the issue to the resolution of this case.""
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and the Sacklers of fueling the opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing.
The Sacklers, who have denied wrongdoing, contributed the $4.5 billion to the settlement in exchange for the releases. Under Purdue’s reorganization plan, settlement funds would be directed toward opioid abatement programs.
Purdue said in a statement that McMahon's ruling on Friday underscored the need for a speedy resolution to the case.
""At a time when drug overdose deaths are at record levels, using Purdue’s settlement funds for opioid abatement programs and overdose rescue medicines is more needed than ever, so we hope to move as quickly as possible through the appeals process,"" the company said.

A lawyer for several states that opposed the fast-tracked appeal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for the Sacklers declined to comment or did not immediately respond to a request.
While the appeal works its way through the courts, Purdue and the Sacklers are in mediation with the states that opposed the releases with the goal of coming up with a new deal that, if reached, would likely moot the ongoing appeal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday said a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker charged in the 1MDB Malaysian sovereign wealth fund scandal will be tried in early February, expressing confidence the Omicron coronavirus variant will not upend the trial.
Chief Judge Margo Brodie of the federal court in Brooklyn delayed jury selection for Roger Ng by three weeks to Feb. 7, with a trial beginning the following week. Jury selection had been set for Jan. 18.
Ng, the former head of investment banking for Goldman Sachs Malaysia, has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate an anti-bribery law and launder money.
His former employer agreed in October 2020 to pay $2.9 billion and have a Malaysian unit admit criminal wrongdoing to settle probes by the U.S. Department of Justice and others into the alleged looting of billions of dollars from 1MDB.
Prosecutors sought to delay Ng's trial until late February, saying Omicron could cause disruptions and prevent travel by government witnesses from Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Kingdom.
But the judge said trials are taking place in Brooklyn, and a short delay should suffice based on expectations of the court's epidemiologist.
""It will be a little easier for us to get a decent jury pool because, according to the epidemiologist, that the virus will peak in January, then I think we'll be on the down end of it,"" Brodie said.
Lawyers for Ng had opposed delaying the trial, saying he was ready to proceed after spending more than three years away from his family since his November 2018 arrest in Malaysia. Ng was extradited six months later.
""He's spent every one of the last 1,000 days getting ready for this trial, and that's what he's going to do until this trial is over,"" Ng's lawyer Marc Agnifilo told Brodie, before accepting the three-week delay.
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak launched 1MDB promote economic development.

Goldman helped sell $6.5 billion of bonds for 1MDB, and authorities said its bankers paid more than $1.6 billion in bribes for 1MDB business.

The delivery firm said severe winter storms around the country, including at its main air hub in Memphis, Tennessee, are posing challenges and it is implementing contingency plans and adjusting operations to minimize disruptions.
Severe winter weather and the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant have led to a sharp rise in infections, forcing several U.S. airlines to cancel flights as pilots and crew quarantine.

The vaccine was estimated to be 91% effective in preventing Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in 12- to 18-year-olds, the study said. MIS-C causes inflammation in children in organs including the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain two to six weeks after a mild or asymptomatic infection.
The estimate is based on the assessment of 283 hospitalized patients aged 12–18 years at 24 children's hospitals in 20 states between July and early December, when the prevalence of the Delta coronavirus variant was high. 
All 38 MIS-C patients requiring life support were unvaccinated, the study said. 
The results add to a growing body of evidence that vaccination against COVID-19 is likely to prevent disease-related complications in children, including MIS-C, the report said. It was not previously known whether the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine prevented the condition. 

The study's findings have several limitations including questions about vaccine effectiveness against the fast-spreading Omicron variant, the report published in the CDC's Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report (MMWR) said. 
Children aged 5–11 years are at highest risk for MIS-C but only became eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in late October in the United States. They were not included in the analysis, the report said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former model accusing Leon Black of rape asked a U.S. judge on Friday to dismiss the billionaire investor's defamation and racketeering conspiracy lawsuit against her and her law firm, as she pursues a separate lawsuit over the rape claim.
In a Manhattan federal court filing, Guzel Ganieva accused the former Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc chief executive of trying to drive a ""wedge"" between her and Wigdor LLP by suing, four months after she sued him in a New York state court.
Black had accused Ganieva and the law firm of engaging in a ""criminal enterprise"" where they employed an unnamed financing source and public relations representatives to extort him and destroy his reputation.
The 70-year-old has also strongly denied Ganieva's claims, including that he tried to arrange a sexual encounter between her and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2008.
In seeking a dismissal of Black's claims, Ganieva and the Wigdor law firm denied conspiring against him.
""Simply put, there are no 'funders' or 'flacks,'"" the law firm said, using a term for PR representatives.
Susan Estrich, a lawyer for Black, in an interview on Friday said Black had offered ""incontrovertible evidence"" against Ganieva's claims, and her ""scurrilous claims have no purpose other than to humiliate and embarrass Mr. Black with lies.""
Both lawsuits stem from a relationship between Ganieva and the married Black from 2008 to 2014, and which Black has called consensual but ""regrettable.""
Ganieva has accused Black of forcing her to sign a nondisclosure agreement, and defaming her by claiming she tried to extort him.
Black has said he had paid Ganieva $100,000 a month for 5-1/2 years to keep quiet. Those payments stopped last March.
Epstein killed himself in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Black has publicly regretted his ties to Epstein. He stepped down from Apollo last year after an independent review found he had paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning, though was not involved in Epstein's criminal activities.

ALMATY (Reuters) - Security forces appeared to have reclaimed the streets of Kazakhstan's main city on Friday after days of violence, and the Russian-backed president said he had ordered his troops to shoot to kill to put down a countrywide uprising.
A day after Moscow sent paratroopers to help crush the insurrection, police were patrolling the debris-strewn streets of Almaty, although some gunfire could still be heard.
Dozens have died and public buildings across Kazakhstan have been ransacked and torched in the worst violence the ex-Soviet republic has experienced in 30 years of independence.
Moscow said more than 70 planes were ferrying Russian troops into Kazakhstan, and that these were now helping control Almaty's main airport, recaptured on Thursday from protesters.
The uprising has prompted a military intervention by Moscow at a time of high tension in East-West relations as Russia and the United States gear up for talks next week on the Ukraine crisis.
Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev blamed foreign-trained terrorists for the unrest, without providing evidence.
""The militants have not laid down their arms, they continue to commit crimes or are preparing for them,"" Tokayev, 68, said in a televised address.
""Whoever does not surrender will be destroyed. I have given the order to law enforcement agencies and the army to shoot to kill, without warning.""
The demonstrations began as a response to a fuel price hike but swelled into a broad movement against Tokayev's government and former President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
Nazarbayev, 81, was the longest-serving ruler of any ex-Soviet state until he turned over the presidency to Tokayev in 2019. His family is widely believed to have retained influence in Nur-Sultan, the purpose-built capital that bears his name.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has discussed the situation with Tokayev in several phone calls during the crisis, the Kremlin said on Friday.
SCARED
The protesters in Almaty appeared mainly to come from the city's poor outskirts or surrounding towns and villages. The violence has come as a shock to urban Kazakhs, used to comparing their country favourably to more repressive and volatile ex-Soviet Central Asian neighbours.
""At night when we hear explosions, I am scared,"" a woman named Kuralai told Reuters. ""It hurts to know that young people are dying. This has clearly been planned ... probably our government has relaxed somewhat.""
In a state where scant political opposition is tolerated, no high-profile leaders of the protest movement have emerged to issue any formal demands.
One man who attended the first night of protests and who did not want to be identified said most of those who initially turned up wanted to ""express solidarity spontaneously"", before 100-200 ""aggressive youths"" started hurling rocks at police.
The Interior Ministry said 26 ""armed criminals"" had been ""liquidated"", while 18 police and national guard members had been killed. Those figures appeared not to have been updated since Thursday.
State TV reported more than 3,800 arrests.
Fresh gunfire could be heard on Friday near the main square in Almaty, where troops had fought protesters on Thursday. Armoured personnel carriers and troops occupied the square.
Unrest has been reported in other cities, but the internet has been shut off since Wednesday, making it difficult to determine the extent of the violence.
In Aktau, a city on the Caspian Sea in western Kazakhstan, some 500 protesters gathered peacefully on Friday in front of a government building to call for Tokayev's resignation, a witness told Reuters.
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE
Moscow's swift deployment demonstrated Putin's readiness to use force to maintain influence in the former Soviet Union, at a time when he has also alarmed the West by massing troops near Ukraine, whose Crimean peninsula Russia seized in 2014.
The mission falls under the umbrella of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, comprising Russia and five ex-Soviet allies. Moscow said its force would number about 2,500.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday reiterated Washington's concerns about the situation in Kazakhstan and the involvement of Russian-led forces.
""It would seem to me that the Kazakh authorities and government certainly have the capacity to deal appropriately with protests ... so it's not clear why they feel the need for any outside assistance,"" he told reporters.
Tokayev's administration said the Russians had not been engaged in combat or the ""elimination of militants"".
Mukhtar Ablyazov, an exiled ex-banker and cabinet minister turned opponent of the government, told Reuters the West must counter Russia's moves, or watch Putin rebuild ""a structure like the Soviet Union"".
Kazakhstan's other major neighbour, China, has backed Tokayev. State television said President Xi Jinping had told him Beijing opposed any use of force to destabilise Kazakhstan.
Nazarbayev has not been seen or heard since the protests began, though Belarus's state news agency said President Alexander Lukashenko, another close Putin ally, spoke by phone with the former Kazakh leader on Friday.

Tokayev removed Nazarbayev and his nephew from security posts on Wednesday.
Kazakhstan is a major oil producer and the world's top miner of uranium. Global oil prices rose on Friday, fuelled by supply worries. [MKTS/GLOB]

Despite the bullish view, shares of Coinbase fell 2% on Friday, as Bitcoin fell nearly 4%. 
The longer-term outlook is bright, however. ""As financial analysts, we are most excited about the implications for financial services and see the tokenization and fractionalization as holding particularly large promise as transactions speeds in crypto become more competitive with trad-fi networks,"" the analyst wrote.

Most major U.S. banks have had staff working in offices since the summer, but some are now choosing not to host holiday parties and others are strongly recommending staff to get booster shots. 
The following are the pandemic-related rules among Wall Street's biggest banks and financial firms. 
For a FACTBOX on Canadian financial firms, click on
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)
The bank is encouraging employees to work remotely in the first week of January, according to a person familiar with the matter. It will host on-site vaccine booster clinics for its staff across the country.
Since late summer, the bank has also been encouraging employees to get fully vaccinated and more recently to get their booster shots when eligible. It offers onsite clinics in several locations.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
Citigroup will begin implementing a 'no-jab, no-job' policy starting Jan. 14, a source familiar with the matter said. The bank had said in October it would require U.S. staff to be vaccinated, but has not yet mandated boosters.
Citi is also providing rapid test kits and encouraging testing for employees going into the office, a source said earlier.
Employees have also been asked to work from home during the first few weeks of 2022, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
The German lender has made COVID-19 boosters available to staff at its new midtown headquarters in New York City since early November, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
Goldman Sachs is encouraging its eligible U.S. staff to work from home until Jan. 18, a spokesperson for the bank said.
Its offices will continue to remain open with previously announced COVID-19 safety protocols - a vaccine requirement, booster for all eligible populations effective Feb. 1, bi-weekly testing effective Jan. 10 and mandatory masks.
As infections flared up in August due to the spread of the Delta variant, the Wall Street bank mandated vaccines for all staff and visitors entering its offices in the United States.
Goldman in December postponed its remaining holiday parties in New York due to COVID-19 concerns, a source familiar with the matter said last month.
Jefferies 
The investment bank has asked staff to work remotely until Jan. 31, according to a post on Instagram from the investment bank's chief executive officer, Richard Handler. 
The bank requires all workers who want to enter its offices to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and has said it will require boosters by Jan. 31, unless the person concerned is not yet eligible for the additional shot. Jefferies does not perform onsite testing.
The bank has also canceled all but essential travel.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
JPMorgan has offered its staff the option of working from home for the first two weeks of 2022, with a caveat that all employees are expected to return to office no later than Feb. 1, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The biggest U.S. bank, which has been one of the most aggressive in bringing employees back to the office, mandated face coverings for its U.S. employees in August, saying they would be required to wear masks in public indoor settings and in common areas regardless of vaccination status.
The lender in October said that it would restrict business travel for employees who are unvaccinated or have not disclosed their vaccination status. Such employees are required to get tested twice a week and contribute more of their pay toward medical insurance. It also mandated vaccines for new recruits in client-facing roles.
In December, JPMorgan instructed unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home. It also relaxed mask requirements for vaccinated staff working in its Manhattan offices. And, it told managers that they should evaluate more often ""who should revert to working from home."" 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
Morgan Stanley is asking employees, contractors and visitors to show proof of vaccination before entering its New York headquarters. The bank does not require additional COVID-19 testing for staff or visitors, a spokesperson said.
The bank expects staff who are not required to be in the office to take advantage of the ability to work from home and to spend more time with their families. But it is not sending staff home and does not have a work-from-home policy, a source familiar with the situation said.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
Last month, the lender delayed its plans for employees to return to the office ""given the changing external environment."" It said it would announce new plans for a full return in the new year.
Wells Fargo has said its offices are open to those who have been vaccinated and choose to use them. The bank is providing all employees with four hours of paid leave to get the booster shot, if eligible.
The bank also requires employees to either document that they are fully vaccinated or get tested regularly.
Fidelity Investments
The company said it had paused its voluntary return-to-office plans in New England, citing a rising risk from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP)
The company has decided to delay the launch of its return to office program, ""Amex Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX)"", in the United States which was scheduled for Jan. 24, extending its hybrid work plans.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)

The asset manager is providing flexibility through Jan. 28 and allowing U.S. employees to work from wherever they are most comfortable, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Investing.com — Shares of smart glass technology company Crown ElectroKinetics Corp. (NASDAQ:CRKN) fell more than 6% Friday, giving up the previous day's gains.
On Thursday, Crown shares closed 6% higher after it revealed it has finalized an agreement with Hudson Pacific Properties (NYSE:HPP) to install energy-saving Smart Window Inserts at several office properties across its West Coast portfolio.
Crown explained that the inserts are solar-powered, can be retrofitted to existing window frames and will provide additional insulation. This, according to the company, allows Hudson Pacific tenants to transition their windows from clear to dark. 
Hudson (NYSE:HUD) owns and operates over 20 million square feet of studio and office space on the West Coast, including buildings populated by tech and media giants including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Riot Games, Square and Uber (NYSE:UBER). 
“Tenants are demanding climate innovation, and forward-thinking property owners are responding. On top of ESG considerations, there's also a strong business case: Proptech that reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions also reduces heating and cooling costs."" said Crown ElectroKinetics CEO Doug Croxall.
Following a regulatory filing that disclosed the deal at the end of December, Dawson James analyst James Mcllree said in a note to investors that this could be a $100 million revenue opportunity for Crown.
U.S. President Joe Biden has previously outlined his aim — as part of his administration's climate change agenda — for zero-emissions buildings. Earlier this week, Jigar Shah, the director of the Loan Programs Office of the U.S. Department of Energy, tweeted:

(Reuters) - The state of Georgia has decided to join a proposed $26 billion nationwide settlement resolving lawsuits alleging that three large drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) fueled the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic.
Friday's announcement by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr marked the latest instance of a holdout state opting into the landmark agreements with J&J, McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH).
""We are confident that joining the settlement at this time will prove beneficial to our state, our citizens and our communities, as we continue our fight to end this epidemic and address the widespread damage it has caused,"" Carr said.
AmerisourceBergen said it was ""pleased to see the increased commitment to participation in the global settlement process."" J&J referred to an earlier statement saying the deal supports state and local efforts address the epidemic.
More than 3,300 lawsuits, largely by state and local governments, are pending seeking to hold those and other companies responsible for an opioid abuse crisis that led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths.
Under a proposal unveiled in July, the distributors and J&J agreed to pay up to $21 billion and $5 billion, respectively.
How much the companies ultimately must pay and how much outstanding litigation they will face depends on state and local government participation.
Settlement supporters recently extended to Jan. 26 a deadline for cities and counties in states that backed the proposal to opt-in to the deals, citing the potential for more states to join.

Nevada did so Tuesday, and New Mexico in December backed the distributors' deal. Five states are left for the distributors to contend with, including the state of Washington, which has taken them to trial.
Six states have not settled with J&J, including New Hampshire, where a judge on Friday cleared the way https://tmsnrt.rs/3q0dQWl for the state to take J&J to trial on Feb. 1 for creating a public nuisance.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will show a production version of its long-awaited ID.Buzz, an electric reincarnation of its beloved Microbus or Kombi, on March 9 and plans to launch it in the United States in late 2023, the company said on Friday.
The ID.Buzz is one of ""the most anticipated and most hyped"" models anticipated from the Volkswagen brand since the company launched its new Beetle in the late 1990s, Scott Keogh, head of Volkswagen's North American operations said during a media call.
Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess tweeted on Thursday ""The legend returns on 03/09/22!"" The tweet contained a sketch of the profile of the ID.Buzz van.
Volkswagen has shown a series of prototypes for a new Microbus over the past decade. But those prior show vans - the Budd.E and the Bulli - never made it to production, to the frustration of fans of the vehicle.
Keogh said that a three-row version of the ID.Buzz will launch in the United States, where the original microbus became an icon of the counterculture, in late 2023 or early 2024. Volkswagen will launch a two-row version in Europe. 
Volkswagen does not plan to build the ID.Buzz at its U.S. factory in Chattanooga. 
""You want to get to 100,000 units before you localize,"" Keogh said.
Volkswagen will ramp up production of its ID.4 electric SUV at Chattanooga this year.
Earlier Friday, Volkswagen said U.S. sales of its VW brand vehicles rose 15% in 2021, driven largely by strong sales of gasoline-fueled SUVs such as the Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) and Tiguan.

Shortages of vehicles caused by chip supply chain problems will continue to limit vehicle production and sales in the United States through 2022, Keogh said. 
He said he believes as many as two million potential car buyers did not buy a vehicle in 2021 because of the lack of supply, creating pent up demand for this year and beyond.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. trade court barred Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) late Thursday from importing products that infringe home-audio company Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO)' smart-speaker patents.
The U.S. International Trade Commission affirmed an August decision that Google audio products infringed five Sonos patents and banned Google from importing ""networked speaker devices"" and devices that can control them like mobile phones and laptops.
The ruling says Google won't be barred from importing products that it had redesigned to avoid infringing the patents. A Google spokesperson said it does not expect the decision to affect to its ability to import or sell its products. 
""We will seek further review and continue to defend ourselves against Sonos' frivolous claims about our partnership and intellectual property,"" the company said. 
Sonos' Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus called the ruling an ""across-the-board"" win and said Google's products still infringe the patents despite its attempts to design around them.
Sonos' stock was up 1.5% in late morning trading on Friday, having earlier risen more than 3%.
The parties have been embroiled in a global patent war over multi-room audio technology since 2020 that includes court cases in California, Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands, according to a Sonos regulatory filing.
Sonos first sued Google in Los Angeles, alleging the company misused its technology in ""more than a dozen different infringing products"", including Google Home speakers and Pixel phones, tablets, and laptops.
Google responded with its own lawsuit in San Francisco, alleging Sonos used ""substantial volumes"" of its technology without permission for several products, including controller apps and its Sonos Radio service.

At the ITC, Sonos had been trying to block Google from importing Home speakers, Pixel phones and other products from China.

In 2021, the median pay for employees was $68,254, Apple said, adding it had selected a new median employee for comparison due to changes in hiring and compensation.
The median pay in 2020 was $57,783 and the pay ratio was 256 times Cook's salary.
The iPhone maker has benefited from strong demand over the past two years as consumers working from home splurged on upgrades. Apple's revenue rose more than 30% to $365.82 billion for its fiscal 2021 and its shares briefly crossed $3 trillion in market capitalization this year.
Cook, whose salary remained at $3 million, received $82.3 million in stock awards, $12 million for hitting Apple's targets and $1.4 million for air travel, 401(k) plan, insurance premiums and others.
In total, he earned $98.7 million, compared with $14.8 million in 2020.
Cook took the helm in August 2011 after the company's co-founder Steve Jobs stepped down months before his demise. The stock has surged over 1,000% since Cook took charge.
In September, Cook received 333,987 restricted stock units, in his first stock grant since 2011 as part of a long-term equity plan. He will be eligible to receive additional units in 2023.

Cook told Fortune magazine in 2015 that he plans to donate his wealth to charity.
CEOs in the United States were paid 351 times more than the typical worker in 2020, a report by the Economic Policy Institute showed, while the compensation of top CEOs grew roughly 60% faster than the stock market from 1978 to 2020, eclipsing the slow 18% growth in a typical worker's annual pay.

A report from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday evening said the company would start a division to develop a marketplace for non-fungible tokens and establish cryptocurrency partnerships.
According to the article, the retailer has hired over 20 people to steer the division, with the marketplace being an online hub for buying, selling and trading NFTs of videogame goods.
In addition, GameStop is said to be asking certain game developers and publishers to list NFTs on its marketplace when it launches.
Bloomberg quoted Tokyo-based games industry analyst Serkan Toto saying he is ""very skeptical if GameStop can make it on its own. The company definitely needs partners to compete with the likes of OpenSea and get video game companies to cooperate.” OpenSea, an NFT marketplace, recently raised $300 million in venture funding, for a valuation of $13.3 billion, according to CoinDesk."

McDonald's Holdings Company Japan said in a statement on Friday that the impact of flood damage on the port of Vancouver and other disruptions since last year would delay an expected shipment of potatoes from North America.
Global shipping operations continue to be severely affected by a mix of factors including COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, extreme weather and a rapid recovery in demand.

As a result, McDonald's said that from Sunday it would sell only S-sized fries for about a month ""to make sure we have plenty of inventory and our customers can enjoy McDonald's fries without interruption.""
The fast-food chain took the same step for a week at the end of December at its roughly 2,900 branches in Japan.

In its order, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said Google dominates certain online search services in the country and may have imposed unfair conditions on news publishers.
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The complainant, Digital News Publishers Association, which comprises the digital arms of some of India's biggest media companies, said Google denied fair advertising revenue to its members.
""In a well-functioning democracy, the critical role played by news media cannot be undermined,"" the CCI order said. ""It appears that Google is using its dominant position in the relevant markets to enter/protect its position in the market for news aggregation service."" 

News organisations, which have been losing advertising revenue to online aggregators such as Google, have complained for years about tech companies using stories in search results or other features without payment.
The CCI order also mentioned new rules in France and Australia - fuelled by media lobbying and public pressure - that have led to licensing deals around the world collectively worth billions of dollars.

McTernan added Uber to Needham's conviction list and lowered the price target on the shares to $75 from $77, keeping a buy rating. 
“Calling the floor in UBER has been difficult given a reliance on EV/Sales multiples. UBER looked cheap to us from 6x sales all the on its way to 3.5x currently,"" said the analyst in a research note.
McTernan explained that he believes this year will be different due to the outlook for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which they forecast ""improving from -$800M in '21E to $1.3B in '22E to $3.3B in '23E.""
""UBER is on the brink of investors being able to put a multiple on a fairly close annual metric, which should provide a studier floor for valuation,” McTernan said in a client note,"" he added.
Elsewhere, in a further boost for Uber, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill downgraded LYFT Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) to hold from buy, telling investors in a research note that  Lyft  will fall behind Uber due to ""the re-opening focus widening beyond the U.S. to global markets where UBER stands to benefit."""

The agency expects the shorter interval, reduced by a month for people aged 18 and above, will provide better protection sooner against the variant, which is driving up infections and overwhelming hospitals.
The United States reported 662,000 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, the fourth highest daily U.S. total ever recorded. The Omicron-driven surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases has likely not topped out yet, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.
The FDA earlier this week cut the interval to get a booster dose of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, based on mRNA technology like Moderna's, to five months from six.

""Vaccination is our best defense against COVID-19, including the circulating variants, and shortening the length of time between completion of primary series and a booster dose may help reduce waning immunity,"" Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said. 
People who received Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine can get a booster dose two months later.

The tycoon aims to list the special acquisition company, or SPAC, on Amsterdam's Euronext stock exchange instead of the bourse in London, where his Virgin Group empire is based, the report said, citing an unidentified source.
Amsterdam was Europe's top share trading venue in 2021, although British regulators have reformed rules to boost London's role as a financial hub and global centre for listing.
Branson's blank-check company initially aims to raise 200 million euros ($226 million), the Sky News report said.
Virgin Group said it did not comment on ""rumour or speculation"". Euronext Amsterdam said it did not comment on potential issuers on its markets.
Branson, a serial entrepreneur now recovering from what was described as a mild case of COVID-19, has used SPACs elsewhere.
His space venture Virgin Galactic and his satellite programme Virgin Orbit Holdings went public by merging with SPACs. Last year, a SPAC backed by Branson took consumer DNA-testing firm 23andMe public.

SPACs are shell companies that raise money on stock markets to buy private businesses, providing an easy route for the target to gain a listing without going through the rigorous process of a traditional initial public offering.

""Times of poor sentiment are usually good times to buy airline stocks,"" stated Didora.
He went on to say he prefers Delta over American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines due to the stronger balance sheet, cheaper valuation and more capacity discipline.

Investing.com -- U.S, stock markets were mostly lower at the opening on Friday, struggling to hold their nerve after being spooked by a labor report that hinted at sustained strong wage growth and inflationary pressure.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37 points, or 0.1%, at 36,199 points, on course to end a volatile week roughly unchanged. The S&P 500 was down by a similar amount, while the Nasdaq Composite, despite a 0.1% gain, remained on course for a weekly drop of 3.5% - its worst week in nearly a year. The S&P is set to close the week down 1.6%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said in its monthly report on the labor market that average hourly earnings grew 0.6% in December, faster than the 0.4% expected. November's figure was also revised higher. That, combined with a sharper-than-expected drop in the unemployment rate, outweighed a second straight miss in the headline job creation figure, which rose by only 199,000, compared to expectations of 400,000.
""This latest jobs report will comfort the Fed into thinking its hawkish policy pivot is justified with the economy making progress toward maximum employment,"" Oxford Economics' analyst Greg Daco said in a note to clients. Daco said he expects headline job growth numbers to remain soft in the first quarter of the year due to the impact of Omicron-variant Covid-19, but nonetheless expects the unemployment rate to fall to 3.5% of the workforce by year-end. 
One stock bucking the general trend in early trade was GameStop (NYSE:GME), which rose 17% after The Wall Street Journal reported that the videogames retailer is looking at setting up a marketplace for non-fungible tokens, digital assets that are often bought and sold with digital currency. As such, the move may open up a new stream of revenue for 2021's archetypal ""meme stock,"" which has otherwise struggled to justify the optimism behind its surge early last year.
Other stocks catching the eye early included  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock, which fell 3.6% after the streaming device maker said Scott Rosenberg will step down as head of its platform business. Roku stock is a prime example of the technology stocks that have been under the most pressure in the last week, as the prospect of a sharp tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve forces a reappraisal of valuation models built on assumptions of cheap money forever. Despite losing 60% from its 2020 peak already, Roku still trades at 93 times trailing earnings and doesn't expect to make a meaningful profit in the current quarter.
Elsewhere, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock rose 0.4% after announcing further details of its plans to expand into the so-called 'Metaverse', while  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock continued to defy the bad news coming out of Kazakhstan, which is home to one of its biggest cash-generating projects. Kazakhstan's President Tokayev said on Friday he had ordered the military to shoot protesters without warning. Chevron had confirmed earlier in the week that workers at the Tengizchevroil project were among those who had demonstrated against the government, before the arrival of troops from the Russian-led CSTO alliance.

Aston Martin, fictional agent James Bond's carmaker of choice, said it expected annual adjusted core earnings to be about 15 million pounds ($20 million) lower than expected.
However, it said the Valkyries that had not yet been shipped were already allocated to customers, with significant deposits.

Overall, the company sold 6,182 cars last year, helped by demand for its first sport utility vehicle, the DBX. Shares were up 1.3% in early trade.
Pandemic travel restrictions have left many wealthy consumers with more disposable income, fuelling demand for premium and luxury cars.
On Thursday, another British luxury carmaker, Bentley, reported a record year as global sales jumped 31%.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Lawyers who say they are representing ""a hundred"" institutional investors have filed a class action lawsuit against Airbus in a Dutch court, saying they suffered at least 300 million euros ($339 million) in damages as a result of company misconduct.
The suit, filed by the Foundation for Investor Loss Compensation on Jan. 3 at The Hague District Court, says investors suffered losses after buying shares in Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) that were overpriced because the company withheld information about corruption at the company. The suit also names accountants KMPG and Ernst & Young as defendants.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 07:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Congressional watchdog warns U.S. health agency unprepared to take over COVID vaccine program,"By Marisa Taylor and Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) appears unprepared to assume full responsibility for the nation's COVID-19 vaccine program, including activities currently managed by the Pentagon, according to a draft government watchdog report reviewed by Reuters.
The report cites a failure to ensure HHS has enough staff or a clear timeline for taking over those additional responsibilities. The COVID-19 vaccine program, dubbed “Operation Warp Speed,” by the Trump administration in May 2020, involved hundreds of officials from multiple agencies.
The program has invested more than $30 billion to develop, manufacture and purchase vaccines, including from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) that have been used to inoculate nearly 200 million Americans, as well as shots that have not been authorized for U.S. use.
It continues to oversee approval and funding of other potential COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. In May 2021, the Biden administration ordered HHS to begin assuming responsibilities of the program shared with the Department of Defense (DOD) by the end of 2021, according to the report by Congress’ auditing agency, the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
The GAO, however, said ""it is unclear"" whether HHS was prepared to take over the program given that a majority of the Pentagon's current responsibilities - including coordinating vaccine distribution, safeguarding the doses, and offering legal advice to federal agencies involved in the effort - had not been transferred to HHS by late last year.
""Without fully ensuring HHS readiness, HHS and DOD face an increased risk of interruptions in their remaining work, such as addressing ongoing vaccine needs for boosters or for any emerging COVID-19 variants,"" the agency wrote.
The report found HHS had not ensured ""it has sufficient workforce capacity"" nor arranged ""a schedule to manage the remaining vaccine development, manufacturing and distribution activities,"" risking a loss of capabilities.
GAO, an independent agency tasked by Congress to audit how federal programs are managed, declined to comment on the draft. The agency prepared the report at the request of the House of Representatives’ COVID subcommittee and is expected to publish it soon.
Questions about HHS' ability to fully take over vaccine and therapeutic efforts comes as the Biden administration grapples with a record surge https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-reports-nearly-1-mln-covid-19-cases-day-setting-global-record-2022-01-04 in COVID-19 due to the rapidly spreading Omicron variant that is disrupting returns to schools and businesses after the winter holidays. 
An HHS spokesperson said the ""long-planned"" transition had been ""successfully"" completed on Jan. 1. 
""Institutionalizing these functions within HHS ensures we are able to build on the progress to date, retain expertise and skills (including a number of DOD employees that transferred to HHS), and continue providing the necessary tools to the American people to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to discuss the extent to which the Pentagon remains involved in the program.
UNPRECEDENTED MISSION Before COVID-19, HHS's office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response (ASPR) was set up to oversee pandemic response. The Trump administration relied heavily on the Pentagon to help with the unprecedented task of producing, purchasing and distributing vaccines nationwide in the months following emergence of the new and deadly coronavirus. 
As of last September, DOD had assigned 76 officials from various branches of the military to work on the program, GAO said. A Pentagon spokesperson told Reuters ""HHS has assumed the lead for the COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic mission,"" adding that DOD continues to award COVID contracts for medical supplies in conjunction with HHS and is ""continuing to provide limited on-the-job training in a few areas to ensure the HHS workforce has all the tools and background information required to ensure the operation is successful."" The Pentagon said it is no longer helping HHS with vaccine transportation. 
One top federal official with knowledge of the program's operations said even if HHS has not fully assumed all responsibility, the Pentagon will help ensure a smooth transition. The official, who was not authorized to speak about it and asked to remain anonymous, called Dec. 31, ""an aspirational deadline.""

""If HHS is really not ready to assume all of the responsibilities, the government is not going to just drop the ball,"" the official said. While the Pentagon has agreed to help select contractors, the administration has not officially settled on any other shared responsibilities and ""therefore it is unclear what that support may entail or for how long,"" the GAO said. Even with Pentagon support, a Reuters examination https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/us-rushed-contracts-covid-19-suppliers-with-troubled-plants-2021-12-02 revealed problems with oversight of the contracts for COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, tests and other medical products.
Less than 20% of the companies awarded contracts were experienced manufacturers with a clean FDA record for their U.S. plants in the two years prior, and four of every five either had no U.S. manufacturing experience, poor domestic inspection results or serious recalls before their awards, Reuters found.

Investing.com - New Year 2022, the Year of the Tiger, is here. Investors have a lot of anticipation for 2022, as they have a lot of regret for the stock market in 2021. But while 2022 can be seen as the year of the tiger and a time to be aggressive, from another point of view, it looks like it will be the year that threats are lurking for investors, waiting to pounce.  
In the second half of 2021, the Korean stock market experienced a heavy loss, with the leading KOSPI index down 9.7%, as individual investors' liquidity decreased significantly due to domestic institutional issues: weakening sentiment, large shareholder transfer tax avoidance, passive liquidation of debt investments due to suppression of household lending, year-end dividend avoidance, and year-end fund demand.
It is expected that these challenges will be resolved in early 2022 as the natural effect of a fresh year and tax slate. The funds of large investors who evaded the large shareholder transfer tax will flow back into the stock market, and the passive liquidation of debt investment funds due to the suppression of household loans is expected to improve the burden of household loans, even for a short time, in the new year. 
At the very least, 2021’s liquidity headwinds should no longer be headwinds. As liquidity flows back into the market in 2022, there is reason to expect a small tailwind for valuations. In the end, we can predict that most of the small and mid-cap stocks that suffered the frost in the second half of last year will benefit from the liquidity inflow. 
In 2022, investors can look forward to the stock market rebounding, but on the other hand, the risk factors should not be overlooked. There are many potential risks, but there are two especially serious pieces of potential bad news to watch. The first potential downside is global monetary tightening and its side effects. Already at the FOMC in December, the Fed has accelerated its tapering rate from $15 billion per month to $30 billion per month, with QE expected to end in March next year. And it seems likely that interest rate hikes will follow almost immediately after that.

[Long- and short-term interest rate difference between 10-year US Treasury bonds and 2-year Treasury bonds since 2012] 
Often, near the final stage of tapering or when the key interest rate reaches 1% or so, the difference between the long-term and short-term US Treasury yields tends to reverse. If the yield curve inverts, market participants have learned from the summer of 2019 case and other historical cases, and that tends to trigger market volatility. At the same time, continued global economic recovery can override any headwinds from the yield curve and interest rates, which would postpone the onset of any sort of downturn or crisis. 
The second potential negative factor for the Korean market specifically is that investor demand may emerge as a problem in 2022 due to the pending financial investment income tax, which will be implemented in 2023. 
The defining trait of the 2020s stock market so far has been the active and increased participation of individual investors. That power of new investors helped drive the KOSPI index to the 3000 points level. The history of the stock market will record this as the Donghak Ant Movement. No one can deny that individual investors drove the Korean markets to all-time highs. In 2020 alone, the net increase in personal investment funds (individual net sales + increase or decrease in customer deposits) reached 100 trillion won ($83B USD), and the net increase in personal investment funds in 2021 exceeded 70 trillion won ($58B). It was the largest private liquidity inflow in history. 
However, there is an issue that makes individual investors uncomfortable, and that is the financial investment income tax system that will be implemented in 2023. Many individual investors plan to invest in stocks until the financial investment income tax comes into effect, and withdraw funds by 2023. So the liquidity that might flow out of the market by the end of the year, before the new system is implemented, could be quite large. This trend could lead to market volatility and be the reverse of the 2020 Donghak Ant Movement. This reverse ant march might overwhelm any tiger momentum.
While it is true that several risks await the stock market in 2022, on the other hand, a positive January effect awaits as well, and the global liquidity loosened after the initial onset of the pandemic in 2020 could trigger a global economic boom like in the mid-2000s. In other words, there are downside events ahead, but on the other hand, upside surprises can emerge like the famous chakhogapsa (tiger hunters) of yore to corral the risks and push the market higher. 
These risks are also already known, which means they are often priced in. Even so, rather than overlooking potential downsides like those mentioned above, how about thinking about the market like this in 2022? If 2020 was a strong positive argument because of the individual retail investor movement, and 2021 suffered in the second half due to liquidity issues, 2022 is a year where the market faces both possibilities. Investors who are mentally prepared can make strong investments even in the ups and downs of a volatile stock market.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 07:05AM ET</span>","At CES, tech alliances firm up in the self-driving car wars","By Stephen Nellis and Joseph White
(Reuters) - Major automakers like General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volvo Cars deepened ties with key technology partners this week to gird for the fight against electric car challenger Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as it revs up to enter the market.
Three chip firms -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Mobileye (F:0ME), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp - have emerged from a raft of announcements at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas as the leaders in locking down the brains of self-driving cars for the next decade.
The deals involve consolidating scores of older, slower chips into more powerful centralized computers. But to win them, the chip firms have had to consent to letting automakers control key parts of the technology.
Reuters has previously reported that Apple plans an electric car. Bloomberg reported last year that the iPhone maker is aiming for full self-driving capabilities as early as 2025.
For automakers facing Apple and Tesla, the stakes are high. In addition to electrifying their models, automakers are essentially designing computers with increasing self-driving capabilities.
That means a big opportunity for automakers to make money off software and services in cars long after vehicles roll off a dealer's lot, but only if they can keep the customer relationships and data for themselves, the way that Tesla and Apple do.
Automakers ""that haven't been the pioneers are finally realizing they're going to be left in the dust if they don't change their approach,"" said Danny Shapiro, vice president, automotive for Nvidia, a maker of high-powered chips.
Nvidia this week announced deals to supply the electronic brains for future models from several Chinese electric vehicle startups, and is working with other automakers including Mercedes, Hyundai Motor Co, Volvo and Audi .
Control of technology and data are areas of tension between automakers and technology companies, Shapiro said. ""Control and customization, and who owns the data?""
The answer is complex because of the staggering amount of technology required to make cars drive themselves.
These include computer vision algorithms to help cameras recognize pedestrians, sprawling high-definition maps of the world's roads, and ""drive policy"" software to make millisecond decisions about how the car should behave when confronted with the unexpected.
For chipmakers, this means they need to have every aspect of the technology ready, but be willing to let customers pick and choose.
 Qualcomm Inc , for example, spent $4.5 billion last year to purchase  Veoneer  (NYSE:VNE) Inc to round out all the pieces of software needed to complement its self-driving car chips. But after winning its first major self-driving chip contract with GM this week, those software assets will not be included because GM has its own.
""Our software stack is all internally developed. So we're not taking their pieces,"" said Jason Ditman, chief engineer for GM's forthcoming ""Ultra Cruise"" hands-free driving product.
But for other carmakers, Qualcomm needs to have all the pieces of a self-driving system ready, said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of automotive at the chip firm.
""Different automakers find themselves at different points of readiness,"" he said. ""What is critical for the automaker is that they have to be able to build a relationship with the customer that they're trying to acquire.""
A similar dynamic is at play in Mobileye's relationship with Ford, which was deepened this week. Mobileye used to deliver its camera, chip and self-driving software as an all-in-one product. Now Mobileye will start separating out some of its system's functions and allowing Ford to build its own technology on top of them.
""We provide all the outputs to Ford, and they'll run their own algorithms on top of our outputs,"" Mobileye Chief Executive Amnon Shashua told Reuters.
The chip companies have little choice but to be more flexible as they face significant competitors of their own. 
Automakers had relied on three main suppliers for the simpler semiconductors that controlled combustion engines – Infineon (OTC:IFNNY), Renesas and NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI), said Phil Amsrud, a senior principal analyst with IHS Markit.

But the market of chip firms supplying high-powered computing to vehicle makers is comparatively crowded, including Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and computer vision company Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) Inc moving into the auto sector.
""We're at a point where we might be getting too many suppliers,"" Amsrud said. ""If you look at automotive traditionally there's never been more than a handful.""

1338,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 07:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Just Higher Ahead of Key Nonfarm Payrolls Release,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, ahead of the key official jobs report which could cement the decision of the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates as soon as March.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 55 points, or 0.4%.
Despite these minor gains the major indices on Wall Street are on course to close the first trading week of the year lower after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting signalled the central bank is considering tightening monetary policy more quickly than previously guided. 
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 170 points, or 0.5%, on Thursday, heading for its first losing week in three. The Nasdaq Composite, an index which includes a lot of growth-sensitive stocks which would be negatively impacted by higher rates, is on course for its worst week since February 2021.
Attention is firmly focused Friday on the monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), particularly after Fed policymakers mentioned a ""very tight"" job market as well as persistent inflation as factors pointing towards early rate hikes. 
Payrolls are expected to have risen by 400,000 in December, almost doubling November’s disappointing 210,000 rise, with the unemployment rate seen falling to 4.1% from 4.2%. Other items such as wage growth will also be parsed for their implications for inflation.
In corporate news, GameStop (NYSE:GME), a retail investor favorite, is likely to be in the spotlight Friday after the Wall Street Journal reported that the troubled video game retailer is looking to develop a marketplace for non-fungible tokens and establish cryptocurrency partnerships.
Oil prices rose Friday, fuelled by concerns over global supply, largely on the back of unrest in Kazakhstan, a member of the OPEC+ alliance that is gradually adding oil back to the market.
TCO, Kazakhstan’s biggest oil producer and a joint venture led by  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) , confirmed Friday it has altered output amid unrest and protests in the country, but declined to provide further details on the size of the adjustment. President Tokayev said that order had been largely restored after the arrival of troops from the Russian-led CSTO alliance, of which Kazakhstan is a member.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $80.02 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $82.62. Both contracts were on track for gains of more than 6% in the first week of the year, with prices at their highest since late November.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,792.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1304.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 06:55AM ET</span>",Airbus 2021 deliveries hover between 605 and 611 units -sources,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus delivered at least 605 jetliners in 2021 and the final tally could rise as high as 611 depending on the outcome of a final audit, industry sources said on Friday.
Reuters reported earlier this week that Airbus had beaten its full-year target of 600 deliveries, maintaining a lead over U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA). Deliveries have been seen as key to generating cash during the pandemic.
Airbus will give an update on orders and deliveries after markets close on Monday, with Boeing disclosing data on Tuesday.
The European company declined to comment beforehand.
Deliveries have been partially secured during the crisis by workarounds that allow some carriers to delay accounting for new planes on their balance sheets, Reuters reported in, though such agreements must also be reviewed by auditors.
With Airbus confident of beating its 2021 target by up to 11 units, the focus has turned to narrowbody production rates and deliveries in 2022 as the aviation industry tries to re-mobilise a crisis-weakened supply chain.
Galleys and seats are among the items under pressure from shipping delays or chip shortages, industry sources said, with some aircraft due for delivery in 2022 estimated a few months late. One source saw a risk of some airplanes drifting to 2023.
Airbus has not given a delivery forecast for 2022, but it is expected to be comfortably higher than 2021, analysts said.

Airbus in October rounded up its main A320-family narrowbody production target to 65 a month by summer 2023. It has been at odds with engine makers led by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) over its ambitions to push production afterwards as high as 75 a month.
In May, Airbus had said it was calling on suppliers to secure a firm rate of 64 a month by second-quarter 2023, from a targeted rate of 45 in fourth-quarter 2021.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 06:50AM ET</span>",Back in the game: Portugal doubles pre-pandemic peak for export-focused investment,"By Sergio Goncalves
LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal last year more than doubled its pre-pandemic record for investment in export-focused projects, showing it remains an attractive destination for foreign companies, the head of the state agency that promotes investment and exports said.
AICEP, which offers tax breaks and other incentives for exports and investment, attracted 2.68 billion euros ($3.05 billion) of such investment ""with high added value and innovation"", after 287 million euros in 2020.
Its chief, Luis Castro Henriques, told Reuters investors have so far shown ""no signs of concern"" about political stability in Portugal before a snap general election on Jan. 30, which was called after parliament rejected the minority Socialist government's budget bill for this year.
Last year's investments smashed the previous record of 1.17 billion euros in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic.
With executives' travel curtailed by the pandemic, AICEP began heavily using online contacts and attracted 97 investments in 2021, ""almost all of them industrial projects"", with foreign companies accounting for about 80% of all funding.
""These numbers show that Portugal is highly competitive as we are capturing these investments in an open global competition,"" Castro Henriques said, pointing out that money was coming regularly from new sources such as South Korea and the United States, complementing European investment.
Projects included a metalworking factory to be built by South Korean wind tower manufacturer CS Wind, a production line of components for electric car engines by U.S. company BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), and others in the aerospace, automotive, or pulp and paper industries.
AICEP provides incentives, tax breaks and loans from European Union cohesion funds to companies only in export-oriented businesses.

Projects supported under AICEP's latest five-year incentives plan are expected to add 4.4 billion euros worth of exports, or more than 2% of GDP, and thousands of jobs.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 06:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive-China's Kaisa pressured by local government to repay wealth product investors - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Under pressure from authorities, Chinese property firm Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd is working furiously to come up with a feasible plan to repay wealth product investors, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Kwok Ying Shing, chairman of the cash-strapped developer, has agreed to a request from the government of Shenzhen where the company is based, to provide by the end of January a proposal to repay investors in its wealth management products (WMPs), said one of the sources.
The sources added that if the company fails to do so, they believe possible consequences include the Shenzhen government seizing some of Kaisa's assets and gradually taking over the company.
Kaisa's dilemma underscores how authorities are pushing property developers to prioritise meeting onshore debt obligations. That could pile more pressure on a sector hit by a regulatory-induced liquidity squeeze which has caused several developers to miss offshore bond payments in recent months, spooking financial markets.
Kaisa defaulted on a $400 million dollar bond last month and has started restructuring $12 billion in offshore debt - the most offshore debt held by a firm in the sector after embattled China Evergrande Group.
Overall it has disclosed debt obligations of 123.8 billion yuan ($19.4 billion) as of end-June, though it was not immediately clear if all of Kaisa's WMP obligations are included in that total.
Of its onshore obligations, WMPs are an issue authorities are particularly sensitive to. Many of the company's WMP products were sold to family members of Chinese officials, one source said.
Kaisa first confirmed it missed payments on some WMPs in early November, telling investors it had a total outstanding 12.79 billion yuan ($2 billion) in principal and interest at the time.
Kwok, 57, has also made clear he is worried about his personal safety amid the pressure from authorities, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.
He has been living in Hong Kong for a few years. In mainland China, tycoons who have run afoul of authorities have often found themselves suddenly detained.
Kaisa declined to comment and did not make Kwok available for comment. The Shenzhen government did not respond to a request for comment.
Kwok is actively engaging with some of the property developer's offshore bondholders, aiming to secure fresh lending from them to repay the WMP investors, said the sources.
A Kaisa bondholder group, which holds $5.5 billion of Kaisa's offshore notes, has proposed options including extending $2 billion in fresh debt to the developer, Reuters reported in December.
In early November, when angry WMP investors stormed the office of Kaisa's finance unit in Shenzhen, the firm said it would be speeding up asset sales to raise funds.
Kaisa is planning to sell 18 of its assets in Shenzhen by the end of 2022 - mostly retail and commercial properties, which sources have told Reuters are worth a combined 81.8 billion yuan.
The fate of Kaisa, Evergrande and other indebted Chinese property companies has gripped financial markets with investors fearing the sector's woes could inflict heavy damage on China's economy. Beijing has repeatedly sought to reassure investors that troubles in the sector can be contained.

Evergrande, which is at the centre of the debt crisis and is struggling to repay more than $300 billion in liabilities, is seeking a six-month delay for the redemption and coupon payments of an onshore bond in a meeting with bondholders this weekend.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 05:40AM ET</span>",China to ease debt rules for state-led distressed M&A - source,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) -China will make it easier for state-backed property developers to buy up distressed assets of debt-laden private peers, a source with direct knowledge said on Friday, another step by policymakers to avert a liquidity crisis in the sector.
State-owned developers acquiring distressed assets will not have those loans counted as debt under rules that cap borrowing. The ""three red lines"" policy restricts the amount of new borrowing property developers can raise each year by placing caps on their debt ratios.
The authorities have encouraged state-owned builders to look at the assets of private peers struggling with liquidity issues, as an increasing number have failed to meet their debt obligations, sending shockwaves to the financial markets. 
Chinese developers are facing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze due to years of regulatory curbs on borrowing. 
Banks have told state-owned developers about the exclusion of M&A loans in calculating their debt ratios, the source said, but added that the appetite to acquire assets is not high.
The looser debt rules for state-owned developers was first reported by financial intelligence provider REDD, who said local governments including Shanghai and Guangdong held meetings with the developers last week to facilitate the M&A process.
REDD added policymakers asked the firms in mid-December to acquire assets from 11 private developers with liquidity issues to ease their financial stress.
Chinese property shares gained on Friday, with state-owned China Overseas Land listed in Hong Kong jumping 9% and state-backed China Resources Land rising over 7%.
Shimao Group was one of the few property stocks trading in the red, however, after the Shanghai-based developer defaulted on a trust loan payment and entered discussion to delay payments on asset-backed securities, underscoring the continued stress in China's property sector.
Shimao Group's unit Shanghai Shimao Construction has proposed extensions on maturities for two asset-backed securities (ABS) due this month totalling 1.17 billion yuan ($183.50 million), three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The proposals would see the company repay 10% of the principal in January, 5% each month from February through November, and the remaining 40% in December, the three sources said.
One of the sources said that the company and ABS holders were currently in negotiations, but that the proposals were not likely to meet with approval from holders without credit enhancements.
""If the negotiations are not successful it will trigger cross-default clauses involving other bonds,"" the source said.
Shimao declined to comment.
News of attempts to delay ABS maturities, first reported by REDD, comes a day after a trust company, China Credit Trust Co, said that Shimao had defaulted on a loan after missing a 645 million yuan ($101.10 million) payment. 
Shanghai Shimao Construction said in a filing on Friday that it was in talks with China Credit Trust to resolve the outstanding payment, and that the missed payment would not accelerate payment requests in the open bond market. 
Shimao's Group's Hong Kong shares closed down 5.4%.
Shanghai exchange-traded bonds issued by its unit Shanghai Shimao Co tumbled more than 20%, triggering trading pauses over what the Shanghai Stock Exchange said was ""abnormal fluctuations"". 

Its dollar bonds due Sept 2023, Feb 2024 and Jan 2025 fell between 9% to 11.6% in Asia afternoon hours.

The retailer has hired more than 20 people to run the unit which is building an online hub for buying, selling and trading NFTs of virtual videogame collectibles such as avatar outfits and weapons, according to the WSJ report.

GameStop launched its NFT website last year and has been inviting creators to join the platform.

The study, which was published on Tuesday and had not been peer reviewed, came amid concerns over the effectiveness of Sinopharm's BBIBP-CorV shot, one of the two leading COVID-19 vaccines exported by China, against the Omicron variant. 
An earlier study showed a BBIBP-CorV booster had weaker neutralisation against Omicron than against an older coronavirus strain from the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Sinopharm's NVSI-06-07 protein-based vaccine, approved for emergency use as a booster in the United Arab Emirates in December, adopts a different technology than the BBIBP-CorV shot that contains an inactivated form of the coronavirus. 
Among 192 healthy adults vaccinated with two BBIBP-CorV doses for six months or longer, the neutralising antibody level against Omicron in those later given a NVSI-06-07 booster was ""significantly higher"" than that in those who received a BBIBP-CorV third dose, researchers said in a paper.

The antibody-based results are different from the efficacy readings about how well the NVSI-06-07 booster after BBIBP-CorV vaccination would protect people from Omicron-caused disease. 
The authors of the paper, including researchers from Sinopharm's units and Sheikh Khalifa Medical City in Abu Dhabi, cautioned that it remained unclear for how long the NVSI-06-07 booster's effect would last.

The LuoBuLesi app, which Roblox launched in July in partnership with an affiliate of Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY),, was shut down on Dec. 8, disappearing from mainland app stores. The app now shows users a message thanking them for using the test version when they log on. 
The app's importance to Roblox's expansion in China was prominently discussed in the company prospectus for its New York stock exchange listing in March, which saw the gaming platform valued at nearly $30 billion. 
A Roblox spokesperson told Reuters late on Thursday that the move was necessary as it builds the ""next version of LuoBuLeSi"", but did not say when the app would return. 
""We always knew that building a compelling platform in China is an iterative process, and we are thankful for the support of LuoBuLeSi users and our global developer community,"" a Roblox spokesperson said. 
""It is critical that we now make the necessary investments, including investments in our data architecture, in order to realize our long-term vision.""
Tencent did not respond to a request for comment. 
Roblox's platform is known for its virtual world technology, now popularly known as the ""metaverse"". The LuoBuLeSi platform is separate from Roblox's global version and allows users to create and play games, as well as join virtual 'events'.

Several users complained on social media that they did not realise it was a test. The app has been downloaded 1.7 million times according to Sensor Tower, a data analytics firm.
LuoBuLeSi secured the necessary licenses to operate in China from regulators at the end of 2020.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW has unveiled the world's first ""colour-changing"" car at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
The concept car, called the BMW iX Flow, uses electronic ink technology normally found in e-readers to transform the car's exterior into a variety of patterns in gray and white.
""This is really energy efficient colour change using the technology E Ink,"" said BMW research engineer Stella Clarke. ""So we took this material - it's kind of a thick paper - and our challenge was to get this on a 3D object like our cars.""
When stimulated by electrical signals controlled by a phone app, the material brings different pigments to the surface, causing the car to take on a different shade or design, such as racing stripes. 
In the future, the changes would also be controlled by a button on the car's dashboard or perhaps even by hand gestures, Clarke said. 
No energy is needed to maintain the colour the driver selects, according to BMW. 

""My favourite use case is the use of colour to influence sunlight reflections,"" said Clarke. ""On a hot, sunny day like today, you could switch the colour white to reflect sunlight. On a cold day, you could switch it black to absorb the heat."" 
Though the vehicle displayed at CES could only alternate between gray and white, the technology will be expanded to cover a spectrum of colour, according to BMW.

The Dublin-based producer of Bulmers cider and Tennent's beer also cautioned that earnings for the second half of fiscal 2022 would depend on how the curbs progress, sending its London-listed shares as much as 3.6% lower in early trade. 
C&C, however, added it had managed to eke out a ""modest profit"" during the holiday month, thanks to its cost cutting drive. 
Number of shoppers in Britain deteriorated sharply in December, while government advice https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-says-12-deaths-104-people-hospitalised-by-omicron-2021-12-20 for people to limit social contacts in the run-up to Christmas left pubs and restaurants largely empty during what should be one of their busiest periods.
Cost cuts, along with the return of customers to hospitality venues during the September-November period and higher prices of drinks helped C&C witness a robust third quarter, it said. 
In December, C&C managed to deliver just 64% of beverage volumes to ""on-trade"" customers, compared with an expectation of 90%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, newly returned to Japan after a 12-day journey into space last month, said being launched into the cosmos was less scary than riding a rollercoaster and made him obsessed with Earth.
The 46-year-old fashion magnate and art collector in December became the first space tourist on the International Space Station in over a decade, preparation for a more ambitious trip around the moon with Elon Musk's SpaceX planned for 2023.
""When you go into space, you become obsessed with the Earth,"" he told reporters on Friday. ""You're grateful that it has wind, that it has smells, that it has seasons."" 
One of Japan's more flamboyant public figures, Maezawa regaled his social media followers from space by showing how to make tea in zero gravity and discussing his shortage of fresh underwear. On Friday, he said never felt fear in orbit.
""At the time of the launch I was able to enjoy the experience,"" he said. ""I felt as if it was the start of a Shinkansen (bullet) train from the station, it was so smooth. I only realised (the launch) when I looked out the window."" 
Maezawa, who sold his online fashion business Zozo to SoftBank in 2019, will become the first private passenger on a SpaceX moon trip scheduled for next year and is sifting through ""a million"" applications for eight artists he has pledged to have join him on the voyage. 

But gazing at the Earth from space - which he said was ""100 times more beautiful than photographs"" - gave him other ideas.

LONDON (Reuters) -Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) said it will pursue ""at pace"" a $7 billion share buyback largely funded from the sale of its U.S. shale business as it faces liquefied natural gas (LNG) outages and slower fuel sales due to the economic hit from Omicron.
Shares in Shell, the world's largest trader of LNG, were down 0.32% on Friday after a trading update ahead of its quarterly results on Feb. 3. This compared with a 0.12% rise in the broader European energy index.
Shell said that its production and liquefaction volumes were impacted in the fourth quarter by unplanned maintenance, mainly in Australia, where its giant Prelude floating LNG https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-halts-prelude-lng-production-loading-after-power-outage-2021-12-03 vessel was hit by a power outage. 
LNG liquefaction volumes are expected to be between 7.7 and 8.3 million tonnes, well below a peak of 9.2 million tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2019, Shell said.
Shell's LNG trading results in the fourth quarter of 2021 are, however, set to be ""significantly higher"" compared to the third quarter.
Natural gas and electricity prices around the world have soared since the middle of last year on tight gas supplies and higher demand as economies rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Benchmark European gas prices and Asian LNG prices hit all-time highs in the fourth quarter.
Shell will later this month move its head office from The Hague to London, scrap its dual share structure and change its name to Shell Plc as part of a plan to simplify its structure and shift its tax residence from the Netherlands.
Last year Shell sold its Permian Basin shale oil assets to ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) for $9.5 billion in cash, an exit from the largest U.S. oilfield as it shifted its focus to a clean energy transition. It said it would return $7 billion of the proceeds to shareholders on top of 20% to 30% of cashflow from operations.

""The remaining $5.5 billion of proceeds from the Permian divestment will be distributed in the form of share buybacks at pace,"" it said.
Shell, which operates more than 45,000 petrol stations, said that earnings from its marketing division were set to be lower than the third quarter ""the demand impact due to the Omicron virus and foreign exchange impacts in Turkey.""

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Friday, weighed down by disappointing regional economic data ahead of the release of key U.S. employment numbers for December. 
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.2%. 
German industrial output fell 0.2% on the month in November, data from the Eurozone’s largest economy showed Friday, a sharp decrease from October’s 2.4% gain.
“Unfortunately, this is where the rebound of German industry stops for the time being,” said Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING. “The fourth wave of the pandemic and Omicron should send industrial activity back into hibernation.”
This weakness was also seen in France, where industrial production fell 0.4% on the month in November, after climbing 0.9% the previous month.
Still, losses are minor Friday with many investors keeping their powder dry ahead of the release of the widely-watched U.S. nonfarm payrolls data later Friday, especially after the Federal Reserve pointed to a tight labor market as a key reason for turning hawkish in December. 
The payrolls are expected to have risen by 400,000 in December, almost doubling November’s disappointing 210,000 rise, with the unemployment rate seen falling to 4.1% from 4.2%. 
However, Wednesday’s private payrolls report, which is often used as a guide to the government’s, showed companies added 807,000 jobs last month, more than twice the number expected, suggesting potential upside to the official number.
In corporate news, STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) stock rose 3.7% after the chip maker said its preliminary fourth-quarter revenues were slightly above the guidance given at the end of October, in the context of a global microchip supply crunch.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock fell 0.1% despite the energy giant stating it will channel $5.5 billion in proceeds from the sale of its Permian assets into a rapid stock buyback.
Oil prices rose Friday, fuelled by concerns over global supply, largely on the back of unrest in Kazakhstan, a member of the OPEC+ alliance that is gradually adding oil back to the market.
TCO, Kazakhstan’s biggest oil producer and a joint venture led by  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) , confirmed Friday it has altered output amid unrest and protests in the country, but declined to provide further details on the size of the adjustment. President Tokayev said that order had been largely restored after the arrival of troops from the Russian-led CSTO alliance, of which Kazakhstan is a member.

PARIS (Reuters) -Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics said its preliminary fourth-quarter revenues were slightly above the guidance given at the end of October, in the context of a global microchip supply crunch, which gave a lift to its shares.
Sales for the last three months of 2021 increased by 11.2% sequentially, coming in at $3.56 billion which was above a company forecast of $3.40 billion. Full year sales jumped by 24.9% to $12.76 billion, also higher than STMicro's October 2021 forecast.
STMicroelectronics' Paris-listed shares rose by around 3% in early session trading.
STMicro's update outlook echoed that of its peer Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), which on Friday said its fourth-quarter operating profit likely jumped 52% on-year to its highest for the quarter in four years, helped by solid demand for server memory chips and higher margins in chip contract manufacturing.
""We ended the fourth quarter of 2021 with net revenues above the outlook range and gross margin at, or slightly above, the high-end of the outlook range, primarily due to betterthan anticipated operations in an ongoing dynamic market"", said STMicroelectronics president and CEO Jean-Marc Chery.
""Our FY21 revenues (...) reflect a strong performance across all the end markets we address and our engaged customer programs throughout the year"", he added in a statement.

The global microchip shortage has forced automakers and electronics companies to cut production and bottlenecks in the chip industry are expected to affect output until 2023, several analysts have said.
STMicroelectronics, whose Paris-listed shares rose 43% in 2021, will publish its detailed Q4 2021 earnings on Jan 27.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Friday its fourth-quarter operating profit likely jumped 52% on-year to its highest for the quarter in four years, helped by solid demand for server memory chips and higher margins in chip contract manufacturing. 
The world's largest memory chip and smartphone maker estimated October-December profit at 13.8 trillion won ($11.5 billion), which would be tech giant's highest fourth-quarter operating profit since Q4 2017. 
The result missed a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 15.2 trillion won, which analysts attributed to items such as employees' bonuses, marketing costs for its mobile business, and ramp-up costs for new display panels being included in the quarter. 
""It looks like a shock because it came out less than the consensus, but I don't think it's as bad as it looks. It seems they reflected various costs in the fourth quarter,"" said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
""It's unclear as of now if there were any changes in expected chip shipments,"" Park added. 
Revenue likely rose 23% from the same period a year earlier to 76 trillion won, the company said in a short preliminary earnings release, in line with market expectations. 
Samsung (KS:005930) is due to release detailed earnings on Jan. 27.
Although prices of memory chips dipped during the quarter, increased demand from server clients lifted Samsung's quarter-on-quarter shipments of both DRAM chips, widely used in data centres, and NAND flash memory chips, used for data storage in tech devices, analysts said. 
Samsung shares rose 1.3% in morning trade. 
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF)' shares have climbed about 11% since early November in anticipation of memory chip prices dipping less than expected during the first half of this year then rebounding, boosted by new data centres and demand for videos, games, conferencing and other traffic-heavy services. 
Samsung's logic chip business, which includes chip contract manufacturing that competes with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), is also expected to post a jump in operating profit to above 1 trillion won in the December quarter due to more deliveries and higher prices, Hanwha Investment & Securities analyst Lee Soon-hak said.

The zero-tolerance policy on Covid-19 means any cases will be met with strong containment measures that stifle consumer spending, Bloomberg Economics said in a report Friday. Retail sales growth could weaken to as low as 3.7% this year from an estimated 13% in 2021 if there are more flare ups, economists Chang Shu and Eric Zhu estimate.
The situation could be much worse if the omicron variant gets a foothold in the country as it’s more contagious and China’s vaccines appear to have limited effectiveness against it, the economists said. 
China is seeing delta-variant cases pop up in several places after a dropoff in the latest epicenter of Xi’an. As one of the world’s last Covid Zero holdouts, China has enacted strict measures to curb the spread of the virus, including locking down some 13 million residents in Xi’an and halting flights in and out of the western city.    
READ MORE: China Sees Covid Cases Across Country, Even After Xi’an’s Drop
The world’s most populous nation is likely to stick to its virus policy in the near term given the fast spread of omicron worldwide and Beijing’s hosting of the Winter Olympics next month.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). expects China to retain border restrictions for possibly the rest of the year. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
The risk of the Covid Zero strategy is “a more difficult path for China to exit the pandemic, as many other economies increasingly open domestically and internationally with natural and vaccinated immunity. Top leadership is likely to be keenly aware of this risk and could be assessing its policy on pandemic management in a dynamic way.”
Chang Shu and Eric Zhu
Travel has already taken a knock, with air passenger trips during the Jan. 1-3 long weekend down 27% from a year ago, state broadcaster CCTV reported this week, citing data from the transport ministry. Rail passenger trips and traffic volumes also fell.
China’s strict virus containment strategy is already threating to cut a portion of the world’s computer memory production capacity given that Xi’an is one of the major production bases globally, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research economists wrote in a Thursday report. They estimate a potential 5% impact on global memory volume if the Xi’an lock-down is extended to March, leading to possible supply shortages.
A separate cluster in the port city of Ningbo has also caused disruption to the country’s garment production, the investment bank added, with one major firm in the region reporting a short-term suspension to their business operations. Although the total impact will be limited, the lockdown measures could last for around three weeks, the economists led by Helen Qiao said. 
Their views are echoed by Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. economists. Raymond Yeung and Zhaopeng Xing wrote in a Thursday report that the Ningbo outbreak could once again disrupt logistics at the world’s third-busiest port. Delays and backlogs at the port exacerbate the inflation in shipping costs as well as exert pressure on export volumes, they wrote. 
“The current coronavirus resurgence presents large downside risks to China’s economic recovery due to stricter containment measures amid the government’s zero-tolerance approach,” they said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely unchanged Friday, stabilizing after the previous session’s sharp losses with investors looking to the release of key U.S. employment data for confirmation of the likelihood of early U.S. interest rate hikes. 
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%.
European indexes slumped on Wednesday, with the DAX falling 1.4% and the CAC 40 dropping 1.7%, after the minutes of the December Federal Reserve meeting had shown that a tight jobs market as well as elevated and persistent inflation could force the U.S. central bank to raise rates more aggressively this year.
This brings the release of U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, due later Friday, firmly into the spotlight. 
The payrolls are expected to have risen by 400,000 in December, almost doubling November’s disappointing 210,000 rise, with the unemployment rate seen falling to 4.1% from 4.2%. 
However, Wednesday’s private payrolls report, which is often used as a guide to the government’s, showed companies added 807,000 jobs last month, more than twice the number expected. Other items such as wage growth will also be parsed for their implications for inflation.
Back in Europe, German industrial production fell 0.2% on the month in November, after rising 2.8% the previous month, but most eyes will be on the December Eurozone consumer price index release. This is expected to show prices remaining at elevated levels, climbing 4.7% on the year, a slight reduction from 4.9% the previous month. 
In corporate news, STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) said its preliminary fourth-quarter revenues were slightly above the guidance given at the end of October, in the context of a global microchip supply crunch, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) said it will channel $5.5 billion in proceeds from the sale of its Permian assets into a rapid stock buyback.
Oil prices rose Friday, fuelled by concerns over global supply, largely on the back of unrest in Kazakhstan, a member of the OPEC+ alliance that is gradually adding oil back to the market.

President Tokayev said that order had been largely restored after the arrival of troops from the Russian-led CSTO alliance, of which Kazakhstan is a member.
These supply concerns have appeared to have superseded worries that the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant might hurt demand.

Police in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen discovered 19 ""vulnerabilities"" in Walmart's network system in late November and accused it of being slow to fix the loopholes, the China Quality News, backed by the country's market regulator, reported on Wednesday.
Walmart was ordered to make rectifications, the report said, without mentioning any fines or details of the vulnerabilities. 
The retail giant and the Shenzhen police did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.
This marks a fresh set of in China for Walmart, which in the past month has faced criticism for what local media has said was its deliberate removal of products sourced from Xinjiang from its apps and stores.
Xinjiang is a growing point of conflict between the Western governments and China, as U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps there.
China has rejected accusations of forced labour or any other abuses in the far western region.
Walmart has seen a wave of membership cancellations at its arm Sam's Club in China since the Xinjiang issue. China's anti-graft agency also accused the retailer and Sam's Club of ""stupidity and short-sightedness"". 
While Walmart has not publicly commented on this, Reuters reported that a Sam's Club executive told analysts on a call that the matter was a ""misunderstanding"" and that there was no deliberate removal of Xinjiang-sourced products.

In December, Sam's Club was fined 10,000 yuan ($1,568) in Shanghai by the city's market regulator for violating food safety laws after they found that a frozen vegetable product carried no production or expiry date, according to a separate local media report.

(Reuters) - Australian building materials giant James Hardie (NYSE:JHX) Industries fired its CEO after dozens of top executives threatened to quit over his management style, a shock development for a company that has ridden a pandemic housing boom to record profit.
The world No. 1 maker of fibre cement products said Jack Truong's work-related interactions with up to 50 employees ""extensively and materially breached"" the company's code of conduct but did not elaborate.
His dismissal underscores the growing importance companies are putting on executive conduct beyond traditional measures of performance like profit and dividends. Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Australia's second-largest miner, and QBE Insurance, the country's biggest insurer, have both lost CEOs in recent years over lawful actions deemed by their boards to have crossed ethical lines.
James Hardie Executive Chairman Mike Hammes told a conference call that he had urged Truong, who had been CEO since January 2019, to change his behaviour after many employees threatened to quit as a direct result of his conduct.
Despite those calls, as well as engaging an external counsel and a third-party consultant to address the issues raised, ""it was clear that sincere change did not occur,"" Hammes said.
""He was unwilling to accept what caused the issues in the first place... it was not a chemistry problem, it was a lot more fundamental than that,"" he said.
Truong did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The news initially sent James Hardie's shares sliding nearly 11% lower on Friday, before they pared losses to be down about 4% in late trade against a 1.3% gain for the broader market.
""We have never seen something like this but appreciate the board's decisive action,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Quinn said in a client note.
""This reduces the risk of a mass exodus from the company's leadership ranks and hopefully indicates potential for a repair of whatever damage has been done.""

The company named Harold Wiens, an independent non-executive director and a former executive at 3M Co, as its interim CEO while it looked for a permanent leader.
James Hardie also issued a third upgrade to its profit outlook in a year. It now expects adjusted net profit between $605 million and $625 million compared with a November estimate of $580 million to $600 million.

Investing.com – Shimao Group Holdings Ltd.’s Hong Kong shares tumbled on Friday, with the price of bonds issued by flagship unit Shanghai Shimao Co. Ltd. also falling, after one of its units defaulted on a loan.
Shimao Group shares dropped 7.04% to HK$4.62 ($0.72) by 11:27 PM ET (4:27 AM GMT) after tumbling more than 17% earlier on Friday. A July 2022 Shanghai exchange-traded bond issued by Shanghai Shimao also fell more than 25%, triggering a trading pause over what the Shanghai Stock Exchange called ""abnormal fluctuations.""
A Bloomberg index of total returns on China high-yield dollar bonds fell 1.9% on Thursday, the most in two months, a potential sign of a wider fallout.
Shimao Group suffered its biggest-ever bond rout on Thursday after a creditor said one of the developer’s units defaulted on a local loan. The unit failed to pay CNY645 million ($101.10 million) of a total CNY792 million due by Dec. 25, according to a notice from the China Credit Trust Co. that was sent to investors. China Credit Trust had demanded early repayment by Dec. 25 after the developer failed to meet installment requirements, the notice added.
However, the unit that missed the payment said in a stock exchange filing that the incident will not trigger investor demands for accelerated repayment of its debt in public markets. The filing added that the unit faces liquidity pressure and will take steps to quicken asset sales while insisting that the unit had not suffered any public-market debt default.
Meanwhile, Shanghai Shimao Investment Management on Wednesday pledged 265 million shares, or a 7.06% stake in Shanghai Shimao with Ningbo Commerce Bank on Wednesday to fund its operations, according to an exchange filing.

BOSTON (Reuters) -The founder of a designer eyewear company whose family has held investments and leadership roles in retailers like  DSW Inc  has agreed to plead guilty to engaging in insider trading with two other men, court papers showed.
Federal prosecutors in Boston in court papers on Thursday disclosed that David Schottenstein agreed to plead guilty https://tmsnrt.rs/3eYbhxW to conspiring to commit securities fraud and cooperate in the prosecution of a hedge-fund manager and an entrepreneur.
Schottenstein, who founded designer sunglasses company Prive Revaux, said in a statement provided by defense lawyer Eric Rosen that he took ""full and sole responsibility for my conduct and deeply regret my actions.""
Prosecutors and regulators said he made over $600,000 trading on information gleaned from a relative who sat on the boards of shoe retailer DSW, now called Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI) Inc, and cannabis products company  Green Growth Brands  (OTC:GGBXF).
Court papers did not name the relative but his description matched that of Joey Schottenstein, the defendant's second cousin whose father is Jay Schottenstein, Designer Brands' executive chairman and  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc's chief executive.
A spokesperson for Joey and Jay Schottenstein said they were ""shocked and saddened"" to learn of the illegal conduct and breach of their confidences.
David Schottenstein, 38, traded ahead of a 2017 DSW earnings announcement; a 2018 merger agreement between Albertsons and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp; and a 2018 bid by GGB for Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc, which failed, prosecutors said.
A Schottenstein family business belonged to an investment consortium in the Rite Aid deal, which later failed.
Prosecutors said David Schottenstein also tipped two friends - Kris Bortnovsky, the co-founder of Sakal Capital Management, and Ryan Shapiro, who founded inmate money transfer service provider JPay - to the expected news.
Using those tips, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a related lawsuit said Bortnovsky and his fund made more than $4 million and Shapiro reaped $121,000.
They were initially charged last month and formally indicted Thursday.
James Froccaro, Bortnovsky's lawyer, said he is innocent. Martin Weinberg, Shapiro's attorney, said he ""is factually and legally innocent.""

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 09:36PM ET</span>",New York Times to acquire sports site The Athletic for $550 million,"By Chavi Mehta and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - The New York Times Co said on Thursday it has agreed to buy subscription-based sports site The Athletic for $550 million in cash, as the 170-year-old newspaper adds more digital content to grab subscribers.
Founded in 2016, The Athletic had 1.2 million subscribers as of December, and covers more than 200 clubs and teams in the U.S. and around the world. It was last valued at $500 million in a private raise in 2020. 
""Acquiring The Athletic puts us in a position to be a global leader in sports journalism,"" said New York Times Chief Executive Officer Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Kopit Levien.
The deal shows the New York Times' push towards a subscription-first model and growing paid readers outside its core news content. It has been expanding digital offerings including digital cookbook NYT Cooking and product review website Wirecutter as the print industry struggles with steep declines in advertising and print readership.
The company finished the 2021 third quarter with more than 8 million paid subscriptions across its digital and print products; it has set a goal to reach 10 million subscribers by 2025.
The Athletic had operating losses of about $55 million on about $65 million in revenue in 2021, Levien said on an analyst call on Thursday.
She said there is a small overlap between the New York Times and The Athletic's subscriber base and the company will help develop advertisement revenue at The Athletic.
It plans to sell The Athletic subscriptions as a standalone product at first, and gradually include in a broader bundle.
""We are now in pursuit of a goal meaningfully larger than 10 million subscriptions and believe The Athletic will enable us to expand our addressable market of potential subscribers,"" Levien added.
The deal is expected to add to the newspaper's revenue growth and be dilutive to its operating profit for about three years.
The Athletic will operate as a separate unit of the company, and its founders Alex Mather and Adam Hansmann will stay on after the acquisition.

Allen & Company advised the New York Times on the deal, while The Athletic was advised by LionTree Advisors.
The Information first reported the deal on Thursday. Shares of New York Times Co closed up 4.7% at $47.82. (This story corrects 5th paragraph to state that the New York Times finished the 2021 third quarter with more than 8 million paid subscriptions across its digital and print products, not that it added over 8 million paid subscriptions across digital and print products over the last three years.)

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Friday morning, clawing back losses from Thursday’s tech selloff. Investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report and digesting a bigger-than-expected contraction in Japanese household spending.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.62% by 9:08 PM ET (2:08 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that household spending contracted 1.3% and 1.2% year-on-year and month-on-month in November, while the Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.5% year-on-year in December.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.93% and in Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.20%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.43%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.30% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.42%.
The hawkish stance taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve, evidenced in its December meeting, roiled markets in the first few days of 2022. It has also led investors to reassess how to price assets as central banks tighten their monetary policies, a move not seen in at least three years.
“We knew coming into 2022 that the Fed was going to be a creator of volatility within the market and we’re seeing that right out of the gate at the start of the year,” Ally chief markets and money strategist Lindsey Bell told Bloomberg.
“The good news is that today things seem to be stabilizing a little bit after yesterday’s knee-jerk reaction.”
Comments by regional Fed presidents on Thursday provided some additional insight into a possible schedule for tightening policy. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said in a speech the U.S. central bank could raise its target interest rate as soon as March 2022, while San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said at a separate event that trimming the Fed balance sheet would come after normalizing the Fed funds rate.
Meanwhile, European Central Bank executive board member Isabel Schnabel will speak at a panel on Saturday.
DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas urged investors to tread “very carefully” the next few days.
“Markets are concerned that we’ve never seen the Federal Reserve both lift interest rates off zero and reduce the size of its balance sheet at the same time. We’re not predicting a meltdown, but we get why the market swooned.”
On the data front, the number of initial jobless claims rose to 207,000 for the previous week. Investors now await the U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, due later in the day."

1370,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 09:02PM ET</span>",U.S. flights still face risks from new 5G service -FAA,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday issued fresh warnings that new 5G wireless service could still disrupt flights, saying there were ""big differences"" between U.S. aviation protections and those used in France.
Late Thursday, the FAA launched a dedicated webpage https://www.faa.gov/5g on 5G and aviation safety raising questions about potential impact on sensitive airplane electronics like altimeters.
This week, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) agreed to adopt similar precautions to those in France. On Monday, the carriers said they would delay use of C-Band spectrum for wireless service until Jan. 19 -- an agreement aimed at heading off an aviation safety crisis and flight disruptions.
On Tuesday, President Joe Biden hailed the deal between wireless carriers and U.S. regulators allowing 5G deployment in two weeks. The FAA said the delay would allow it to evaluate ways to minimize disruptions to altimeters, and also gives companies more time to prepare.
The FAA said https://www.faa.gov/5g 5G airport buffer zones in France cover ""96 seconds of flight"" while safety precautions around U.S. airports ""only protect the last 20 seconds of flight."" It said temporary U.S. lower power levels will be 2.5 times higher than France. It noted that France requires antennas be tilted downward to limit harmful interference, a rule the United States lacks.
""If there’s the possibility of a risk to the flying public, we are obligated to pause the activity, until we can prove it is safe,"" the FAA website said. ""Radar altimeters still must be proven safe in the overall U.S. 5G environment to fly into these airports, so we must take into account the higher signal strength when assessing safety and risk.""
AT&T and Verizon won nearly all of the C-Band spectrum in an $80-billion auction last year. The FAA in early November issued a bulletin warning action may be needed to address potential interference from 5G, which prompted the carriers to agree to delay deployment for 30 days to Jan. 5.
The deal Monday assured AT&T and Verizon they will be able to start service this month and they agreed to temporary buffer zones around 50 airports that the FAA will identify by Friday.
The FAA website said 50 airports are covered because the ""wireless companies only agreed to 50 airports."" AT&T and Verizon did not immediately comment.
Biden said the agreement ""puts us on track to substantially reduce disruptions to air operations"" after Jan. 19.

The FAA said that ""even with the temporary buffer around 50 airports, 5G deployment will increase the risk of disruption during low visibility"" including ""flight cancellations, diverted flights, and delays during periods of low visibility.""
The FAA said it is working during the two-week delay ""to complete evaluations of the most popular altimeters allowing some aircraft to operate in 5G and minimize disruptions.""

Futures in New York traded near $80 a barrel after rising almost 6% over the past four sessions. Kazakhstan’s biggest oil producer has altered output at the giant Tengiz field following protests in the country, while Libyan production has also been crimped. Oil’s market structure has firmed in a bullish backwardation structure, signaling growing supply tightness.
The OPEC+ alliance this week stuck with a scheduled output boost of 400,000 barrels a day for February, but the group is unlikely to meet that threshold as some members struggle to achieve their targets. Output in Libya has declined amid militia unrest, while Russia also failed to boost output last month.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 06:31PM ET</span>",Qatar Airways seeks more than $600 million in Airbus A350 dispute,"By Tim Hepher and Guy Faulconbridge
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar Airways is seeking more than $600 million in compensation from Airbus over surface flaws on A350 jetliners, according to a court document shedding new light on an escalating business feud worth $4 million a day.
The Gulf carrier is also asking British judges to order France-based Airbus not to attempt to deliver any more of the jets until what it describes as a design defect has been fixed.
The two companies have been locked in a row for months over damage including blistered paint, cracked window frames or riveted areas and erosion of a layer of lightning protection.
Qatar Airways says its national regulator has ordered it to stop flying 21 out of its 53 A350 jets as problems appeared, prompting a bitter dispute with Airbus which has said that while it acknowledges technical problems, there is no safety issue.
Now, financial and technical details associated with the rare legal spat have emerged in a court filing at a High Court division in London, where Qatar Airways sued Airbus in December.
The Gulf airline is calling for $618 million in contractual compensation from Airbus over the partial grounding, plus $4 million for each day the 21 jets remain out of service.
The claim includes $76 million for one aircraft alone - a five-year-old A350 that was due to be re-painted in livery for the 2022 World Cup, which Qatar is hosting later this year.
That aircraft has been parked in France for a year needing 980 repair patches after the aborted paint job exposed gaps in the lightning shield, industry sources say.
The largest customer for Europe's premier long-haul jet claims Airbus failed to provide a valid root-cause analysis.
The jets feature a layer of copper mesh under the paint to prevent lightning - which strikes planes on average once a year - from damaging the carbon-composite fuselage, which is lighter but less conductive than traditional metal.
BREAKDOWN OF RELATIONS
Airbus said it understood the cause and would ""deny in total"" the airline's complaint. It has accused the airline, once one of its most highly courted customers, of trying to mischaracterize the problems as a safety concern.
""Airbus restates there is no airworthiness issue,"" a spokesperson said, adding this had been confirmed by European regulators. 
Shares in the European planemaker closed down 1.5%.
Qatar Airways, which originally ordered a total of 80 A350s, had no immediate comment.
The airline has long had a reputation as a demanding buyer, sporadically rejecting deliveries for quality reasons. 
But the 30-page complaint details an unusual collapse of relations between two of aviation's most powerful players.
The dispute widened in November when a Reuters investigation revealed at least five other airlines had discovered surface flaws, prompting Airbus to set up an internal task force and to explore a new anti-lightning design for future A350 planes.
Qatar is so far the only country to ground some of the jets.
Under aviation rules, the manufacturer's primary regulator - in this case the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) - oversees an aircraft's design. Regulators in nations across the world monitor local airlines and their individual aircraft.
The complaint detailed how the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) had withdrawn airworthiness approval for individual A350 planes in a series of letters from June 2021. 
It said the QCAA had told the airline that the deterioration of airplanes was ""disturbing, if not alarming."" The regulator had also said it was ""deeply concerned"" that safety could be compromised because of a lack of analysis or permanent fix.
It is the first evidence of the stance of Qatar's regulator, which has not commented in public. Europe's EASA, by contrast, has said it has not yet found evidence of airworthiness issues.
Airbus has appeared to question the QCAA's independence from the state-owned airline, saying the decision to drag safety into a technical matter put at risk global safety protocols. 

Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker insisted in November that Qatar's regulator was driving safety decisions and that the row had caused a ""serious dent"" in operations.
The airline has started bringing mothballed A380s out of retirement as it prepares to cope with the soccer World Cup.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp on Thursday rejected a proposal by the United Steelworkers union (USW) to end an eight-month lockout of about 600 workers at the company’s Beaumont, Texas, refinery, the company said. 
The union's proposed modifications to contract language do not meet the company's goals and would increase costs, Exxon said. The company told the union ""we remain far apart,"" it said on its Embeaumont.com website.
The two sides met for about an hour on Thursday in their first negotiating session since late October, said Bryan Gross, USW international representative.
""We made a few modifications around holiday pay and a few other items to match other  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) contracts at the Baytown (Texas) and Baton Rouge (Louisiana) refineries,"" Gross said. He said the proposal modifications were not concessions. 
The two sides are awaiting results from a U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)-supervised decertification vote on whether to remove the union from the plant.
The company has said it would end the lockout when its contract proposal, rejected by the union members in October, is ratified or when the union is removed through decertification. 
Exxon has kept the 369,000-bpd refinery and oil-blending facility running with supervisors, managers and temporary operators. The facility produces gasoline and Mobil 1 motor oil.
On Dec. 29, the NLRB said it impounded ballots in the decertification vote while it investigates the union's complaints of unfair labor practices against Exxon. Results may not be known for several weeks, a NLRB spokeswoman said. 

The federal board is reviewing union charges that the months-long lockout was intended to break the union at the plant and that Exxon improperly aided a union-removal campaign. Exxon has denied the allegations. 
USW 13-243 officials have said Exxon’s offer would eliminate job security for many of its members, while the company has said the changes are needed to operate profitably in low-margin environments.

Banks were among top performers among financials, with the S&P 500 bank index up 2.6% following a rise in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which touched its highest level since April 2021. [US/] Higher interest rates can increase profit margins for banks and financial firms.
Shares of Meta Platforms jumped 2.6%, the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
The Dow ended down 0.5% and the heavily weighted S&P 500 technology sector also eased 0.5%. The tech sector was biggest drag on the S&P 500 on Wednesday when minutes from the Fed's December meeting signaled the possibility of sooner-than-expected interest rate hikes.
The Fed minutes cited a ""very tight"" job market and unabated inflation, increasing investor unease ahead of Friday's monthly jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department.
""We have a jobs report tomorrow, which continues to be a focal area for the market in terms of the progression of the labor market,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
A private payrolls report on Wednesday was stronger than expected.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 170.64 points, or 0.47%, to 36,236.47, the S&P 500 lost 4.53 points, or 0.10%, to 4,696.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.31 points, or 0.13%, to 15,080.87. 
Investors this week have mostly rotated out of technology-heavy growth shares and into more value-oriented stocks that tend to do better in a high interest-rate environment.
The S&P 500 value index was up 0.1% on Thursday compared with a 0.3% decline in its growth counterpart.
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) ended down 2.5% after J.P. Morgan cut its price target on the movie streaming platform's stock.
Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week. Separately, U.S. services industry activity slowed more than expected in December, but supply bottlenecks appeared to be easing.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.07-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 492 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.10 billion shares, compared with the 10.4 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The company hasn't had a COO since Jon Steinberg stepped down from his role in 2014.
Baesler joined BuzzFeed last month after it acquired Complex Networks, where he will continue to be the chief executive officer. He has overseen the operations of Complex and its portfolio of brands since 2018.

Shares of BuzzFeed plunged as much as 17% on its debut, after its merger with a blank-check company was hit by a flurry of investor withdrawals.
The company's stock, which opened at $10.95 on Dec. 6, tumbled about 51% through the month.

Globally, coronavirus cases have been rising rapidly due to the highly transmissible variant. In Canada, 36,110 new infections were reported on an average each day, according to a Reuters tally. 
Due to mandated closures of Cineplex's theatres and entertainment sites across Ontario and Quebec, the company had yet again decided to temporarily lay off its part-time workforce, Cineplex spokeswoman Sarah Van Lange said. Cineplex had taken similar actions for all provincial government mandated closures earlier since the pandemic began, she added.
Out of the 6,000 workers being laid off, 5,000 are in Ontario.

The cinema industry has been one of the worst affected sectors by the pandemic, with lockdowns shutting cinemas and delaying movie releases at a time when the industry has been trying to stave off increased competition from streaming services. In December, the 2019 planned acquisition of Cineplex by British cinema operator Cineworld was scrapped.
The lay-offs were first reported by the Hollywood Reporter.

(Reuters) -Rivian Automotive Inc's stock briefly tumbled below its IPO price on Thursday in a selloff along with other electric vehicle makers as the race for market share intensifies and legacy companies ramp up their own production.
Rivian fell as low as $75.13, below its November initial public offering price of $78 for the first time. The stock pared losses and ended down about 3% at $87.33. 
Competing EV makers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Lordstown Motor and Fisker fell between 2.1% and 3.3%, with high-flying growth stocks under pressure from expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise interest sooner than previously thought. [.N]
""Rivian investors need to keep near-term expectations managed,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas cautioned in a note to clients. ""Tesla has shown us the extremely difficult path to ramping EV manufacturing. You can’t have the reward without the pain.""
Jonas rates Rivian's stock ""overweight."" 
Rivian's stock has slumped about 14% since the start of Wednesday, when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), one of Rivian's biggest investors, said it teamed up with carmaker Stellantis NV. 
The two companies will develop cars and trucks with Amazon software and deploy electric vans made by Stellantis on Amazon's delivery network.
U.S. shares of Stellantis rose 2.5% on Thursday and are now up 11% in 2022.
Rivian signed a contract in 2019 to build 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon by 2025. But now the electric commercial vehicle business, a vital market for Rivian, is becoming more crowded.
Rivian said on Thursday it expects Amazon to buy vehicles from many providers and that its partnership with Amazon is intact.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s electric commercial vehicle business, BrightDrop, has signed deals with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), while Ford Motor (NYSE:F) is expected to deliver its E-Transit cargo van to customers this year. 
Meanwhile, General Motors Co this week unveiled its electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup, while Ford said it is ramping up production of F-150 Lightning. Both pickups would compete with Rivian's R1T at a time it is struggling to stick to delivery dates due to chip supply constraints.
Ford's stock has soared 18% year to date and is now at its highest level since 2001. GM has rallied 7% in 2022.
""(Rivian) investors are probably getting a little spooked by the legacy industry making a comeback,"" said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid.

Rivian, which lost $1.2 billion in the third quarter, is expected to deliver cars to customers this year. Production at its second plant in Georgia, in which it has invested $5 billion, is likely to begin only by 2024. 
""It's still sort of unproven in terms of investability of that as a stock versus some of the other names like Tesla, and arguably Ford,"" said David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Yum Brands Inc's KFC restaurants will start selling plant-based fried ""chicken"" from Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc across the United States on Jan. 10 for a limited time, KFC said on Tuesday.
Beyond shares rose more than 7% in after-market trading. KFC, Yum's biggest brand, had nearly 4,000 restaurants in the United States at the end of 2020, according to a regulatory filing.
KFC started testing Beyond's plant-based chicken in August 2019 in Atlanta and expanded to more areas the following year.
In February 2021, Yum and Beyond announced a global partnership to create plant-based menu items for Yum's KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut over ""the next several years.""

Major fast-food chains have been vying for partnerships with faux meat makers as they add vegan and vegetarian menu options. Beyond rival Impossible Foods Inc is working with Burger King, a unit of Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc.
Prices for the Beyond Fried Chicken at KFC will start at $6.99 in most places but will vary by location.

ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazatomprom, the world's biggest uranium producer, said on Thursday it was operating normally with no impact on output or exports despite unrest in Kazakhstan.
Uranium prices have risen after unrest in Kazakhstan which was spurred initially by protests against fuel price hikes. Spot prices hit $45.50 per pound on Wednesday, the highest since Nov. 30, according to a Platts assessment.
But the central Asian country's political turmoil does not seem to have so far affected key industries. 
""Uranium mining is going according to plan. There have been no stoppages. The company is fulfilling its export contracts,"" a Kazatomprom spokesperson said. 
Kazatomprom's attributable production represented approximately 23% of global primary uranium output in 2020, according to the company's website.
Kazatomprom's London-listed shares clawed back some losses after the announcement, finishing Thursday down 6.7%. They earlier hit their lowest since the end of September, adding to Wednesday's 8% drop.
Shares in other uranium producers fell on Thursday after Wednesday gains. Shares in Canada's Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) Corp fell 3.7% on Thursday and a uranium exchange traded fund (ETF) from Global X fell 3.6%.
Cameco said it could resume production of roughly 24 million pounds of uranium annually in North America if needed by the global market. Representatives for Canada-based Uranium One, which is a subsidiary of Russia's state-owned nuclear corporation Rosatom GK, could not be reached for comment.
U.S.-based  Energy Fuels  (NYSE:UUUU) Inc said it could start producing uranium if the political unrest in Kazakhstan boosted prices for the nuclear fuel.
Earlier, a spokesperson for the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, the group that transports the country's main crude oil export blend, said it was operating normally. Production at  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX)'s Tengizchevroil venture also has continued.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Pure electric cars are making all the headlines, but their gasoline-electric hybrid rivals quietly achieved record sales in the United States last year, industry data showed.
While the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co pushed for electric vehicle sales, Asian automakers boosted hybrid vehicle line-ups, as many customers still shun EVs due to higher prices, limited driving range or lack of charging stations.
U.S. sales of hybrid vehicle sales jumped 76% to 801,550 vehicles last year, accounting for 5% of U.S. light vehicle sales, according to data from analytics firm Wards Intelligence.
Sales of EVs also jumped 83% to 434,879, but represented a meager 3% of the market. 
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp posted record hybrid car sales for the U.S. market, helping the Japanese automaker overtake General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) as the top-selling U.S. automaker.
Toyota boosted sales of its hybrids, plug-ins and fuel cells by 73% to 583,697, with most of them coming from hybrid. GM sold fewer than 25,000 electric vehicles, as it recalled Bolt EVs due to battery fire risks. 
""Hybrids offer a really intriguing mix of fuel economy performance without some of the huge drawbacks that electric vehicles present,"" Brett Smith, technology director at Center for Automotive Research, said.
Pure EVs run only on electricity and require charging infrastructure, while hybrid EVs combine a conventional combustion engine with an electric propulsion system.
Honda Motor Co, the No. 2 hybrid car seller in the United States, also boosted hybrid sales by 67% compared with 2020 to a record 107,060 last year. 
""We hope to increase our hybrid sales of our core products, CR-V and Accord, substantially in the coming years as we prepare for battery electric vehicles,"" Dave Gardner, executive vice president at Honda, told Reuters. 
Honda, which plans to launch its first EV for the U.S. market in 2024, expected the market to take off thanks to a slew of new model launches by automakers and policy support by the Biden administration. 
""It is just a matter of time, but I think consumer acceptance, it's going to take a while to catch up to,"" Gardner said.

Hyundai Motor Co sees hybrids and plug-in hybrids as ""enablers"" that will help accelerate sales of battery EVs, its global chief operating officer, Jose Munoz, said. 
""Some of our competitors, they jump directly into the battery EV only ... We still see many consumers that are hesitant when it comes to getting into battery EV only,"" he said.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Wall Street's headache over the potential of a relatively fast pullback from stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve lingered Thursday as stocks sold off again and government bond yields mostly marched higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 170.64 points, or 0.47%, to 36,236.47, the S&P 500 lost 4.53 points, or 0.10%, to 4,696.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.31 points, or 0.13%, to 15,080.87.
Stocks fell sharply in Asia and Europe too after Wall Street's technology-heavy Nasdaq index plunged more than 3% on Wednesday.
Minutes released on Wednesday from the Fed's December meeting https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-may-need-hike-rates-faster-reduce-balance-sheet-quickly-minutes-show-2022-01-05 had shown that a tight jobs market and unrelenting inflation could require the U.S. central bank to raise rates sooner than expected and begin reducing its overall asset holdings. 
The Fed news ""took stock markets unawares this week, creating a level of discomfort with more speculative stocks,"" analyst Christopher Whalen of Whalen Global Advisors LLC wrote in a note Thursday.
As stocks struggled, U.S. Treasury yields on most maturities rose again on Thursday as investors fretted over the Fed's more hawkish stance, surging inflation and a deluge of supply.
Benchmark 10-year yields rose to 1.7530%, the highest since March 2021, and were last up slightly on the day to 1.7246%. U.S. 2-year yields, which track near-term rate expectations, rose to the highest since early March 2020, the start of the global spread of COVID-19, at 0.8736%. 
Adding to the worries on Thursday was data from the U.S. Labor Department https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-weekly-jobless-claims-increase-moderately-2022-01-06 showing an increase in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week, and the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) noting that non-manufacturing activity fell in December.
""Despite the weaker than expected ISM today, the market continued to increase how much it is pricing for the Fed to hike in 2022 and 2023 – now more than 5.5 hikes is priced before the end of 2023,"" Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management in Greenwich, Connecticut, said in an email. 
Investors will now look ahead to a key U.S. jobs report on Friday, which will follow new euro zone inflation data that the European Central Bank will watch closely.
The dollar continued its climb towards a 14-month high, after riding the tailwind of the Fed minutes. The dollar index last gained 0.105%, with the euro down 0.19% at $1.1291. 
Cryptocurrencies were among the hardest hit in the overnight market selloff, with bitcoin falling more than 5%. It last traded at around $43,164, down 0.63% on the day.
Gold prices slid to a two-week low on Thursday, pressured by rallying U.S. Treasury yields. 
Spot gold dropped 1.2% to $1,788.22 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 2.1% to $1,787.10 an ounce.

In commodity markets, oil prices rose sharply on Thursday, extending their new year's rally, on escalating unrest in OPEC+ oil producer Kazakhstan and supply outages in Libya.
U.S. crude rose 2.1% to $79.50 per barrel and Brent was at $81.99, up 1.5% on the day.

(Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump's new media venture plans to launch its social media app Truth Social on Feb. 21, according to an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store listing. 
TRUTH Social, the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) alternative to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), is available for pre-order before going live on the U.S. Presidents' Day holiday. 
Similar to Twitter, the app offers features to follow other people and trending topics, according to demo photos. Its message equivalent of a tweet will be dubbed ""truth"".
The app's launch would come 13 months after Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter banned Trump for encouraging his supporters to participate in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol based on unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. 
Marking the one-year anniversary of the attack, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that his predecessor's false claims could unravel the rule of law and subvert future elections.
TMTG and Apple did not respond to requests for comment, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed that Feb. 21 is the planned launch date of the app. 
The launch is expected to be the first of three stages in TMTG's development. The second would be a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ with entertainment, news and podcasts, according to the company website. A November investor presentation indicated that TMTG also wants to launch a podcast network.
TMTG is valued at $5.3 billion based on the stock price of Digital World Acquisition Corp, which rose 20% after Reuters reported the app's listing on the App Store. TMTG agreed in October to merge with the blank-check firm at a valuation of $875 million.
Trump supporters and retail investors have snapped up Digital World's stock, betting that Trump's popularity with his Republican political base will translate into commercial runaway success.
The blank-check acquisition deal faces regulatory risk. Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren asked Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler last month to investigate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws around disclosure. The SEC has declined to comment on whether it plans any action.

TMTG last month raised an additional $1 billion from private investors. 
Trump canceled a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that had been scheduled for Jan. 6, marking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack. He said he will instead deliver remarks at a rally in Arizona on Jan. 15.

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 04:23PM ET</span>",Allegiant defends new Boeing 737 MAX order,"By Eric M. Johnson and Rajesh Kumar Singh
SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) -Allegiant Travel Co on Thursday tried to ease concerns among investors that a plan to add 50 new Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX planes to its fleet of used Airbus jets would drive up operating costs.
The Las Vegas-based company, which runs an ultra-low-cost carrier, said the $5.5 billion jet deal was part of its long-term growth strategy and would result in more than $300 million in savings.
""Strategically, you can't be all used car,"" said Chief Executive Maury Gallagher told investors on a call. 
Allegiant's shares fell more than 8% on Wednesday after the company confirmed plans, first reported by Reuters, to buy 737 MAX 7 and 737 MAX 8-200 jets. Shares were up about 2% on Thursday.
The Boeing order marks a stark change of approach by the fast-growing domestic carrier, which had previously relied mainly on used Airbus aircraft.
The strategy to fly highly used, older Airbus aircraft has helped the company keep its costs low. Allegiant's cost per available seat mile (CASM) - the standard measure in the industry showing what it costs to fly one seat one mile - is estimated to be at least 35% below the major airlines, according to CFRA Research.
Analysts say a mixed fleet could increase its operating costs.
Allegiant, however, said the annual ownership and fuel cost of the MAX planes is expected to be lower than its current fleet, and the new aircraft would generate higher earnings. 
The ultra-low-cost carrier aims to seize on post-pandemic leisure travel demand by adding more than 400 routes. It is looking to have more than 250 aircraft by the end of this decade.
But as the size of its fleet grows, the company reckons it would be difficult to source enough used spare parts for maintenance.
Gallagher said the prospect of running a fleet of more than 100 used planes was no longer tenable. ""No airline in the world is run that way - you just can't do it,"" he said.
Allegiant's expansion is the latest sign of growth among ultra-low-cost carriers that combine rock-bottom fares with optional charges. Such carriers are expected to emerge in a position of relative strength from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company said its ""bias"" would be to finance and own the Boeing aircraft as it has the financial ability to make the deal. 

Allegiant will buy 30 737 MAX 7 aircraft and 20 737 MAX 8-200 aircraft. It will take delivery of 10 of the jets in 2023, 24 in 2024, and 16 in 2025. 
The deal is a boost for Boeing after two key medium-haul customers, Qantas and several affiliates of Air France-KLM, switched to Airbus in December.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Twenty months after a global health crisis hobbled the U.S. economy, recent data - along with a hawkish turn from the Federal Reserve - is implying the labor market is approaching a complete recovery from the pandemic.
That recovery has contradictory implications for the stock market. On the one hand, it could mean the labor drought, which has jacked up wages and cut in to profit margins, could be on the wane.
Conversely, it could help hasten the Fed's timeline for hiking the Fed funds target rate, which could be a boon for interest rate-sensitive financials, but a headwind for sectors such as tech, which have benefitted from near-zero interest rates.
Wall Street gyrated this week, stumbling on signs from the Fed on Wednesday that it is considering bringing forward its monetary tightening schedule.
Now focus turns to Friday's January payrolls report at 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT), to resolve whether stocks resume last year's record rally or pull back more on rate hike fears.
After the labor market hemorrhaged more than 22 million jobs in the pandemic's opening months, recent indicators are suggesting the Fed's ""full employment"" condition for reversing its COVID-era monetary accommodation could be here sooner than expected.
This week the Institute for Supply Management's PMI reports indicated continued employment expansion and the Labor Department's JOLTS data showed job openings backing down from an all-time high and hiring on the upswing. (Graphic: JOLTS, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/myvmnboenpr/jolts.png)
More glaringly, payrolls processor ADP's national employment index showed private employers added 807,000 jobs last month, more than double the consensus estimate. (Graphic: ADP, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/lgpdwjlaavo/adp.png)
Add to that Thursday's report that jobless claims unexpectedly edged up last week to the lower end of the range associated with healthy labor market churn. Additionally, Challenger Gray's December planned layoffs rose 28.1% from the previous month, capping the lowest annual total on record.
The jobless claims trend ""bodes well for December payrolls which will be released tomorrow,"" wrote Jefferies economist Thomas Simons. (Graphic: Jobless claims and Challenger layoffs, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkplgbdaqvb/joblesschallenger.png)
But the Fed's rate hike timeline largely depends on Friday's December employment report, which economists polled by Reuters expect will show a nonfarm payrolls gain of 400,000 and an unemployment rate inching down to 4.1%.
As of November, the U.S. economy had yet to recover 3.9 million of the 22.4 million jobs lost in March and April 2020.
On Wednesday, minutes released from the U.S. Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting indicated its members had taken a more hawkish pivot than many anticipated, signaling that it may shorten its timelines for tapering and inflation-taming interest rate hikes as labor market conditions continue to improve.
The S&P 500 fell almost 2% and Nasdaq about 3% on the appearance that the Fed could be whisking away the punch bowl sooner than many investors have hoped.
Many investors and analysts believe that among the most significant indicators to watch on Friday will be the labor market participation rate, which remains well below pre-pandemic levels, and wage growth, as employers struggle to attract and retain workers.
""The participation rate is really important and can affect employment numbers,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""If you're not participating, you're not in the data. From the Fed’s perspective it's not so much low unemployment it’s getting more people working."" (Graphic: Labor market participation, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jnvwejxknvw/participation.png)
Should Friday's report suggest that hourly earnings growth is beginning to cool as U.S. companies grow less frantic in their efforts to hire and retain workers, that would be a good sign for profit margins.
""From a broader perspective, strength in wages is driving a reversal in labor('s) share of corporate income that has fallen sharply over the past two decades,"" wrote Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in a research note.
What's more, year-on-year wage growth, which held steady at 4.8% in November, is part of the larger inflation picture being closely watched by the Fed.
As illustrated by the graphic below, wages, along with other major indicators, continue to soar well above the Fed's average annual 2% target rate, a state of affairs that has helped prompt the central bank's increasing hawkishness: (Graphic: Inflation, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/akvezemjdpr/inflation.png)
The release of the monthly employment report often adds volatility to the stock market that day, but not always as expected.

Over the last year, February's print, reported on March 5, delivered the biggest upside surprise, coming in 340,000 above consensus. The S&P 500 jumped 1.5% that day.
But the biggest miss occurred when April's 269,000 job adds fell short of estimates by 709,000. On May 7, the day of that report's release, the S&P 500 counterintuitively rose 0.9%.

Investing.com — Aligos Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:ALGS) shares closed Thursday's session down over 57% after it told investors it has halted further development of its drug candidate to treat chronic hepatitis B.
The company said it decided to halt development based on emerging data from its phase 1 study, which indicates that there is no meaningful hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG) reduction at projected dose levels.
Furthermore, the company said higher doses levels intended to be assessed in the following studies are unlikely to reach the HBsAg reduction level that Aligos had defined as necessary to advance the program. 
The company said in a statement that ""based on this information, Aligos management reviewed the data with members of the study’s Study Review Committee (SRC) and jointly concluded that these data were not sufficient to support further development of ALG-010133 and that dosing should be discontinued.""
Lawrence Blatt, chairman and CEO of Aligos, said, ""We are disappointed that the antiviral activity data from this study indicate that ALG-010133 cannot meaningfully contribute to achieving functional cures in CHB.
“Hepatitis B is a very challenging virus that will likely require combination regimens involving distinct mechanisms of action (MOAs) in order to achieve functional cure.""
Piper Sandler reacted to this morning's news by saying that the update was discouraging, but they are keeping an overweight rating. meanwhile, Jefferies downgraded the sock to hold from buy."

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed slightly lower Thursday, as a climb in financials and energy was offset by slip in tech ahead of Friday's monthly jobs report.
S&P 500 fell 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.47%, or 170 points, the Nasdaq fell 0.1%.
Tech's intraday recovery was short-lived as the sector ended the day lower, though Meta, formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), was the notable out performer ending the day up more than 2%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended the day in the red.
The pressure in tech comes in the wake of concerns that growth stocks are set for a challenging period as the Federal Reserve - in its December minutes released Wednesday – signaled that it could be prepared to tighten monetary policy faster than expected to curb inflation pressures.
Some, however, were quick to remind investors that Fed member discussions about tightening were in line with the communication at the December meeting.
“It is important to keep in mind that these minutes are entirely consistent with the Fed communication at the FOMC meeting, the updated dots, and the communication in the interim,” Jefferies said in a note. “There isn't really any new information here.”
Cyclical concerns of the market continued to enjoy gains, with energy and financial leading to the upside.
Energy was pushed higher by rising U.S. oil prices, which briefly topped $80 a barrel, but some see headwinds on the horizon as the omicron variant threatens demand at time when supply is set to increase in the first quarter, “partly due to the release of strategic reserves,” Commerzbank said.
Financials, mostly bank stocks, were in rally mode, supported by higher Treasury yields as the 10-year closing in on its 52-week high amid expectations for sooner rather later tightening from the Federal Reserve.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), and People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT) were among the biggest gainers.
Banks are set to garner added attention in the coming weeks as JPMorgan and Citigroup kick off the quarterly earnings season in earnest on Jan. 14.
On the economic front, data showed that services activity weakened by more than expected, while weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rose to 207,000 for the week ended Jan. 1.
Still, market participants remain confident on the recovery, particularly in the labor market, where monthly job gains in December are expected to have bounced back following softer November data.
Economists forecast the U.S. economy created 400,000 jobs in December, underpinned by a pick-up in the number of people entering the labor market.
“In December, we think the participation rate will tick up from 61.8% to 61.9%. Together with our forecast for employment, this would leave the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2% in December,” Morgan Stanley said ahead of the jobs report.
In other news, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) rallied 8% despite reporting fiscal third-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines amid ongoing supply chain bottlenecks."

PARIS (Reuters) - The search for a new CEO at France's state-controlled telecoms firm Orange has boiled down to a shortlist of three people chosen by a dedicated selection committee, two sources close to the matter said. 
The committee, composed of three board members, selected Orange's Chief Financial Officer Ramon Fernandez, Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN)'s head for Europe Christel Heydemann -- who also sits on Orange's board -- and Verizon (NYSE:VZ)'s Chief Revenue Officer Frank Boulben. 
French newspaper Liberation was first to report the information.
Reuters was not able to immediately reach for comment the three people named as candidates after normal business hours.
Orange, France's biggest telecoms operator, said in November it would find a successor to its Chairman and CEO Stephane Richard by Jan. 31 after a Paris appeal court convicted him of complicity of misuse of public funds.
The court's verdict, which handed Richard a one-year suspended prison sentence, has precipitated his departure from the group, which he has led for 11 years. He has denied any wrongdoing. 
Orange's plan is to find both a new chairman and a new CEO by the end of the month but the tight time schedule may make it difficult for the company to replace Richard has head of the board by that time, one of the two sources said. 
The selection was made in collaboration with head-hunter Spencer Stuart, which was hired by Orange's board. 

Yet this whole formal process might be ignored by the French state, which keeps sway over key governance appointments with its controlling 23% stake. 
The French presidency has in effect the power to appoint another candidate than the ones put forward by the selection committee.

""The outlook for 'Royal Caribbean' and the cruise industry is far more grim than other hospitality and leisure 'post-Covid' stories,"" Hindenburg tweeted.
Royal Caribbean did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. Shares of companies often drop after Hindenburg and other short sellers tweet research related to them. 
Short sellers aim to make money by betting that stocks will decline. 
Royal Caribbean's stock dropped about 18% over a few days after the Omicron variant of the coronavirus roiled global markets in late November. Since then it has rebounded, even as COVID-19 cases surge around the world and dampen a nascent recovery of the battered cruise industry.
On Wednesday, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings canceled voyages due to rising cases.

Norwegian was down 1% on Thursday, while Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp was 0.3% lower.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week advised people to avoid cruise travel after launching investigations into onboard cases on more than 90 ships.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 moved off session lows Thursday, underpinned by a slight dip-buying in tech and financials and a jump in energy as oil prices rallied.

Argos and SURA, along with a host of other Colombian entities, form part of the Andean country's largest conglomerate, Grupo Empresarial Antioqueno (GEA). 
Many of GEA's more than 100 companies own significant stakes in one another which, until recently, helped protect the conglomerate's assets from hostile takeovers.
Argos said in a statement on Thursday Grupo Gilinski's offer price of $8.01 for each SURA share - which would make the transaction worth over $1 billion - is ""considerably inferior"" to the fundamental value of the company. 
""The price ... does not recognize the fundamental value of its operating companies nor that of its portfolio of investments,"" Argos said, citing a study by JP Morgan. 
Argos will take actions to maximize shareholder value in Grupo SURA and close the gap between its fundamental value and that which is reflected in the market, it said. 
Measures will include supporting SURA disclose its value, such as by forming partnerships or listing on international stock markets, as well as boosting profitability, Argos said. 

Grupo Gilinski launched a public acquisition offer for up to 62.625% of shares in Nutresa - another GEA company - in a bid worth some $2.2 billion in November, with the backing of Abu Dhabi's Royal Group.
Just weeks later, Grupo Gilinksi shocked the market again by making its move on SURA, the jewel in the GEA's crown. SURA owns 20% to 50% stakes in many of the conglomerates' other companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Baristas at a  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) location in Buffalo, New York, walked off the job for a second day on Thursday in protest of what they say are unsafe working conditions amid a new surge in COVID-19 cases.
Workers left their positions on Wednesday at the Elmwood Avenue location - the only unionized corporate-owned Starbucks store in the United States - and say they will not return until they feel safe.
A third of employees there are out because of COVID-19, said barista Casey Moore, one of the union organizers in Buffalo. 
""The store is drastically understaffed, leaving the remaining partners exhausted and overworked,"" she said.
Employees who can work have not been given N95 masks and ""Starbucks also made it clear that partners are still required to serve unmasked customers, despite state-wide mask mandates,"" she said.
Company spokesman Reggie Borges said that as of Monday, all 20 Buffalo-area stores had closed seating areas and switched to take-out only, and some had reduced hours of operation, to address a local spike in COVID-19 cases and staff shortages.
""Throughout the pandemic we have met and exceeded all CDC and expert guidelines for safety, and we've supported partners with vaccine pay, sick days and isolation-pay,"" Borges said. 

Employees at the store voted on Dec. 9 to join the Workers United union. The National Labor Relations Board certified the election results a week later.
Now, Starbucks employees at individual stores in six more cities are seeking elections to vote on whether to unionize.

1397,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 02:36PM ET</span>",Number of Nasdaq Stocks Down 50% or More Is Almost at a Record,"(Bloomberg) -- A near-record number of tech stocks have plunged by some 50% in an echo of the dot-com crash.
Roughly four in every 10 companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index have seen their market values halve from their 52-week highs, while the majority of gauge members are mired in bear markets, according to Jason Goepfert, chief research officer at Sundial Capital Research. 
“Whatever the fundamental and macro considerations, there is no doubt that investors have been selling first and trying to figure out the rest later,” Goepfert said in a note.
Another way of thinking about the tech wreck: At no other point since the bursting of the dot-come bubble have so many companies fallen like this while the index itself was so close to a peak. 
“Valuations are at historical highs, companies are raising billions based on fairy dust, and the Fed is signaling a tightening cycle,” Goepfert said. “All of these are scaring investors that we’re on the cusp of a repeat of 1999-2000.”
Tech stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year amid a bond-market selloff that’s driven yields on 10-year Treasuries to 1.72%. The carnage worsened after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting -- released on Wednesday -- pointed to earlier and faster rate hikes, suggesting to some that the central bank became more hawkish quicker than many had expected. Traders were quick to unload tech shares, whose high valuations become harder to justify in a rising-rate environment.
All this could spell trouble for active managers with broad market exposures since so many stocks are off their recent highs.

(Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) on Thursday said a trio of chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc will power the ""Ultra Cruise"" driver-assistance feature on a luxury Cadillac sedan next year.
The Qualcomm chips will provide the computing power for the all-electric Celestiq, the company's planned flagship sedan. The automaker says that Ultra Cruise will allow for hands-free driving on both surface streets and freeways to account for up to 95% of roads in the United States and Canada, going beyond GM's current Super Cruise feature that only works on highways.
""It's a supervised system, so you still have to pay attention. But essentially what we're doing is giving the driver a hands-free experience in a much larger domain,"" said Jason Ditman, chief engineer for Ultra Cruise.
At the heart of the system will be a computer about the size of two laptops sandwiched together. GM will provide the software to make the system work, and Qualcomm is providing key chips - two processor chips and then one chip designed to speed up specific functions. 
The deal is a milestone for Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones and has been diversifying its business. While it Qualcomm has numerous deals with automakers to provide chips for infotainment centers and 5G connectivity, but GM is the first automaker to use Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon Ride"" chips for self-driving features.
Qualcomm is competing against rivals like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Mobileye (F:0ME) to win deals with automakers for self-driving chips. The energy efficiency of the chips is a key requirement for automakers in electric vehicles, where computers must compete for limited battery life with the drive train.

Qualcomm has aimed to use its history making chips for phones, where battery life is a key selling point, to lure automakers. GM's Ditman would not disclose how much power the Ultra Cruise computer uses, but the device is air-cooled, meaning the chips likely consume less power and generate less heat than rival offerings that need liquid cooling.
""We're very conscious of what our power consumption is,"" Ditman said.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -A group of institutional investors representing $3.5 trillion in assets under management on Thursday called on pharmaceutical companies to link their executives' pay to making COVID-19 vaccines available around the globe.
While the majority of citizens of wealthy nations are vaccinated and many are now receiving booster shots, across the African continent vaccination rates average only around 10%.
The World Health Organization has set a target of a 70% vaccination rate in every country by July 2022 in order to end the ""acute phase"" of the pandemic.
The 65 participating asset managers, pension funds and insurance companies signed a letter viewed by Reuters dated Jan. 4 that was sent to the boards of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc. The letter asks them to adopt a WHO roadmap for achieving equitable vaccine access and tying it to management pay ""in a meaningful, material, measurable and transparent way"".
Vaccine deliveries worldwide have been delayed by production problems, hoarding by governments of rich countries, export restrictions and red tape.
The investor group said key points include better participation in international vaccine programs and licensing and sharing technology so countries can produce vaccines locally.
""It should make business sense for a vaccine manufacturer to aim to vaccinate the whole world,"" said Frank Wagemans of Achmea Investment Management, one of the backers of the initiative with $225 billion in assets under management. 
Other participating investors include Nomura, Investec, Boston Common Asset Management, Candriam, GAM, Aegon (NYSE:AEG) and PGGM. 
Moderna could not immediately be reached for comment.
A spokesperson for Pfizer said the company and partner BioNTech had met a goal to deliver 1 billion doses to low and middle income countries in 2021 and would do so again in 2022.
Johnson & Johnson said in reaction that 60% of its vaccine has been shipped to low and middle income countries as of the end of 2021, and the company is in talks on a licensing agreement with Aspen Pharmacare (OTC:APNHY) to produce vaccine in South Africa.
A spokesperson for AstraZeneca said the company has distributed most of its supply to low and middle income countries, and it does so for no profit in those countries.
Peter Singer, Special Advisor to the Secretary General of the WHO, said the investor initiative was ""extremely welcome"".
The current unequal vaccine distribution represents ""not only a complete moral failure for the world but also a very significant economic failure and a significant drag on the world economy"", he said.
Achmea's Wagemans said he believed vaccine makers will generally be receptive to the request but the fund manager will look at how the companies put promises into action before their annual meetings.

""I cannot speak for the other signatories as to how they will vote, but for Achmea management, yes, we will vote against (executive pay packages) if there's no link made"" to the WHO roadmap, he said.

Chief Financial Officer Garth Hankinson said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call Thursday that margins in the core beer business may suffer in the coming fiscal year in part because of inflation in commodity prices. He still expects operating margins for the beer business to be around 39% to 40% over the long term.
The glass shortage is the latest hit for beer makers, who spent the last year talking about shortages of aluminum cans as people switched from drinking at bars and keg parties to drinking at home or outside. MKM Partners analyst Bill Kirk said in a November research note that while Constellation’s most-affected brand seems to be Pacifico, Modelo Negra beers also come in brown glass and the largest risk would be if glass availability became so severe as to limit sales of Corona or Modelo Especial.
“We are diligently working to address the brown glass shortage that is acting as a headwind,” Chief Executive Officer Bill Newlands said on the call. Constellation also cited higher freight and warehousing costs among supply-chain changes brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

The analyst said the company is a top compute pick, and even without the potential Arm acquisition, it ""can achieve similar ends at a much lower price without Arm."" "

The airline will operate about 20% of its pre-pandemic cargo capacity and around 2% of its pre-pandemic passenger flight capacity in January, it said in an emailed statement. 
Hong Kong on Tuesday announced a two-week ban on incoming flights from eight countries, including the United States and Britain. 
Cathay Pacific's website showed on Thursday zero scheduled dedicated freighter plane flights from Hong Kong to Europe and Southwest Pacific between January and March. 
""This overall reduction in capacity will severely impact contracted cargo,"" the airline said.

The airline on Dec. 30 announced flight cancellation to and from Hong Kong. It did not say how many flights then, but that the cancellations would begin immediately and the airline planned to operate a skeleton passenger flight schedule in January. 
Last week, Hong Kong health authorities said the city would tighten quarantine rules for air cargo crew. The new measures require that returning air cargo crew spend three days in hotel quarantine before a period of home isolation.

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 12:30PM ET</span>","Vaccinations, testing demand power Walgreens forecast raise","By Manojna Maddipatla and Oishee Majumdar
(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc raised its full-year adjusted profit growth forecast and said it expects to administer 5 million more COVID-19 vaccines as the fast-spreading Omicron variant rages across the United States.
The company administered 15.6 million vaccinations and 6.5 million tests in the first quarter, helping U.S. same-store retail sales notch their best performance in over two decades.
Executives on a post-earnings call on Thursday sounded confident in the supply of at-home tests after the spike in new cases forced the company, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) to limit sales of such kits.
""We see our stock availability levels going up significantly by mid-month. So, we're feeling in a pretty good place in the next three months,"" Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said, without providing further details. 
Walgreens now expects to administer 30 million vaccinations at its stores in fiscal 2022, adding the number could be higher based on the evolution of the Omicron variant and regulatory guidance.
While there could be a potential positive impact on earnings due to the new vaccination target for the year, management's comments suggest there could be potential challenges from labor investments, Cowen analyst Charles Rhyee said. 
Walgreens, which has administered over 56 million vaccines so far, said it would invest about $120 million in employees, as it seeks to battle staffing shortages and temporary operating hour reductions.
In September, the company said it would give a one-time bonus of $1,250 to its full-time pharmacists and a $1,000 payment to part-time pharmacists. 
For the first quarter, Walgreens posted an adjusted profit of $1.68 per share, easily beating estimates of $1.33.

The company, which reported sales of $51 million in its newly created Walgreens Health unit, also increased its full-year adjusted profit expectations to low-single digit growth from flat. 
Shares of the company were down about 1% at $53.25.

“This acquisition underscores our commitment and focus on our customer,"" stated Kevin Lobo, chair and CEO, Stryker. “Vocera will help Stryker significantly accelerate our digital aspirations to improve the lives of caregivers and patients.”

The company lowered its forecast for annual adjusted operating margin to around 15.5% from 16% and also missed market expectations for quarterly profit, sending its shares down 4%.
Packaged food companies have in recent months reeled under soaring prices of commodities such as wheat and resin, while an overburdened supply chain has driven up their freight costs. 
""We expect to continue experiencing cost pressures above original expectations in the second half of fiscal 2022,"" Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said in a statement. 
The Duncan Hines cake mixes maker expects gross inflation to be 14% for the year, higher than its previous view of about 11%.
The company said it brought in another round of price increases during December, the benefit of which was expected in the second half of the year. 
""We probably won't see the fruits of those efforts until inflation begins to subside ... we eventually should see better profit growth, but are uncertain when that might occur,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.
Still, the price hikes and a sustained at-home cooking boom helped Conagra top sales estimates for the second quarter and raise its core sales forecast for the full year.

The company now expects annual organic net sales growth of about 3%, compared with a 1% rise estimated previously.
It earned 64 cents per share on an adjusted basis in the three months to Nov. 28, missing estimates of 68 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.

LONDON (Reuters) - Luxury British carmaker Bentley cruised to a record year in 2021 as global sales jumped 31% amid strong demand for high-end vehicles, the Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) unit said on Thursday.
Bentley said its sales rose to 14,659 units from 11,206 in 2020, which was also a record year despite shutdowns caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.
Premium and luxury car sales have been growing more broadly in key global markets like China and the United States as pandemic travel restrictions have left wealthy consumers with more disposable income.
Bentley said sales last year rose 39% in the Americas and 40% in China, with those two markets between them accounting for nearly 60% of its total sales.
""2021 was yet another year of unpredictability, though I am delighted to be able to confirm that we overcame significant headwinds, and deliver a breakthrough in our sales performance,"" Bentley Chief Executive Adrian Hallmark said in a statement.
The Bentayga luxury SUV, which has a starting price of around 150,000 pounds ($203,000), remained Bentley's top-selling model, with sales boosted by a new hybrid option.

The luxury carmaker has committed to going fully electric by 2030.

Aeromexico transported 1.74 million passengers last month, or 98.9% of the 1.76 million people it moved in December 2019, the company said in a statement.
Aeromexico's total offer, measured in available seat-kilometers (ASKs), was equivalent to 82.6% of the capacity of December 2019, the company said.
Domestic capacity was up 13.6% from December 2019, while international capacity was 70.7% of that month.

Aeromexico filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States in 2020 as demand cratered amid the pandemic. In December it unveiled details of a tender offer valuing its outstanding shares near zero as part of its reorganization plan, sparking a sell-off in the stock.
The positive traffic figures did nothing to help the airline's long-suffering stock price, as the shares slumped 6.5% to 2.31 pesos in their seventh straight daily drop.

LONDON (Reuters) - The global computing power of the bitcoin network has dropped sharply as the shutdown this week of Kazakhstan's internet during a deadly uprising hit the country's fast-growing cryptocurrency mining industry.
Kazakhstan became last year the world's second-largest centre for bitcoin mining after the United States, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, after major hub China clamped down on crypto mining activity. 
Russia sent paratroopers into Kazakhstan on Thursday to help put down the countrywide uprising after violence spread across the tightly controlled former Soviet state. Police said they had killed dozens of rioters in the main city Almaty, while state television said 13 members of the security forces had died.
The internet was on Wednesday shut down across the country in what monitoring site Netblocks called ""a nation-scale internet blackout"". 
The move would have likely prevented Kazakhstan-based miners from accessing the bitcoin network. 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrenices are created or ""mined"" by high-powered computers, usually at data centres in different parts of the world, which compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in a highly energy-intensive process. 
In August last year, the most recent data available, Kazakhstan accounted for 18% of the global ""hashrate"" - crypto lingo for the amount of computing power being used by computers hooked up to the bitcoin network. 
In April, before China's latest clampdown on bitcoin mining, the figure was just 8%.
The hashrate at major crypto mining pools - groups of miners in different locations that team up to produce bitcoin - including AntPool and F2Pool was on Thursday at 1215 GMT down around 14% from its level late on Tuesday, according to data from mining firm BTC.com. Neither pool immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment,
CRACKDOWN ON CRYPTO MINING
Yet a drop in hashrate isn't necessarily supportive for the price of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin fell below $43,000 on Thursday, testing multi-month lows after investor appetite for riskier assets fell as the U.S. Federal Reserve leant toward more aggressive policy action.
The more miners on the network, the greater the amount of computer power is needed to mine new bitcoin. The hashrate falls if miners drop off the network, in theory making it easier for the remaining miners to produce new coin. 
Kazakhstan's crypto mining farms are mostly powered by ageing coal plants which themselves - along with coal mines and whole towns built around them - are a headache for authorities as they seek to decarbonise the economy.
The Kazakh government said last year it planned to crack down first on unregistered ""grey"" miners who it estimates might be consuming twice as much power as the ""white"" or officially registered ones.

Its energy ministry said last year ""grey"" mining may be consuming up to 1.2 GWt of power, which together with ""white"" miners' 600 MWt comes up to about 8% of Kazakhstan's total generation capacity. 
The country's uprising began with protests in the west of the country against a New Year's Day fuel price hike.

TOKYO (Reuters) - From personal music players to games consoles,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group has often gambled in order to be a pioneer, but a leap into electric cars could take the risks to a new level for the Japanese consumer tech giant.
While investors were wowed when Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida this week told a Las Vegas tech fair the company was setting up Sony Mobility, its stock fell 7% on Thursday as they contemplated the challenge of actually delivering EVs packed with sensors, consumer electronics and entertainment offerings. 
The primary goal of Sony-branded cars, analysts say, is to create an autonomous connected vehicle for services such as car sharing and ride hailing, which could eventually outstrip automobile sales.
Research firm MarketsandMarkets estimates that the ""mobility as a service"" market could balloon to $40 billion by 2030 from around $3 billion last year.
But analysts point out that Sony would likely have to invest heavily in plant and equipment to bring its prototype Vision-S EV, first unveiled in Las Vegas two years ago, to market in sufficient numbers to compete effectively. 
""It's going to be a tough business to succeed in,"" Takaki Nakanishi, automotive analyst at the Nakanishi Research Institute in Tokyo, said of Kenichiro's announcement.
Industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which delivered its first electric vehicle in 2008, has ploughed billions of dollars into revolutionising the automobile industry, relying on the backing of investors as it navigated years of losses.
Now an accelerating shift to EVs, as countries try to cut carbon emissions by phasing out the use of gasoline and diesel-driven cars, is likely to help tech companies because they are simpler to build than internal combustion engine vehicles. 
Sony is joining a growing list of major technology firms exploring automotive opportunities, including iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), South Korea's LG Electronics and Taiwan's Foxconn, Nakanishi added.
But for their vehicles to be deemed road worthy they would also have to comply with much stricter safety regulations than those applied to consumer electronics. And components too would have to withstand the rigours of the road and the harsh outdoors.
""Sony isn't going to be able to do what Tesla did, the hurdle is too high,"" said Nakanishi, adding that an easier road for the Japanese company to take would be to outsource vehicle manufacturing to the likes of Foxconn.
Sony has yet to say if or how it would build a branded car, but it has already recruited an established carmaker to produce its prototype EV, partnering with a factory in Austria owned by Canadian autoparts maker  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA), that builds cars for firms including BMW, Mercedes Benz and  Toyota . 
Other members of its Europe-based project include German autoparts maker Bosch, French automotive technology company  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) SE and Hungarian autonomous vehicle start-up AImotive.
OLD VS NEW
While the EV market is still small, sales growth is outstripping that of fossil-fuel cars and Tesla is benefiting most in terms of the value investors are putting on it. 
Tesla's market capitalisation is now around four times that of Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, even though vehicle output by the U.S. firm is only a tenth of the world's biggest car producer.
Legacy carmakers such as Toyota, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Chrysler-owner Stellantis are beginning to fight back with plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars, which will add to the competition for tech firms such as Sony.
For some technology companies, the lure of EVs has already been dropped, outweighed by the risks.
Bagless vacuum cleaner inventor James Dyson scrapped his electric car plans in 2018 because of the complexity of putting a vehicle on the road.
And Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp, Sony's fellow Japanese consumer tech competitor, has also eschewed mass-market EVs, although automotive components, including batteries it makes for Tesla cars, are now a major sales driver.

""Panasonic is not considering the production of Panasonic-branded EVs,"" a spokesperson said.

Investing.com — Shares of Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) rallied 8% at the start of Thursday's session after  Saia  (NASDAQ:SAIA) LTL Freight, a less-than-truckload company, said it signed a letter of intent to purchase or lease 100 Nikola Tre heavy-duty battery electric vehicles.
The plan is part of a collaboration between the two companies to accelerate the implementation of heavy-duty electric transportation trucks. However, the deal to purchase or lease the trucks is still subject to the completion of a demonstration program.
The demonstration program includes three battery-electric vehicle trucks to be operated in separate locations across the Saia network. The program is expected to begin in the first half of 2022. 
The deliveries of the 100 production vehicles are forecast to occur between 2022 and 2024, with an initial 25 targeted for 2022. 
""We are thrilled that Saia has chosen to work with us,"" said Nikola President, Energy and Commercial Pablo Koziner. ""Saia is a leader in the freight and logistics industry, and will be a key development partner for Nikola.""
Saia President and CEO Fritz Holzgrefe said: ""We are excited to partner with Nikola Corporation as we work to integrate battery-electric trucks into our tractor fleet."" 
On Wednesday,  USA Truck  (NASDAQ:USAK) said it entered into a letter of intent to purchase 10 Nikola Tre BEV trucks."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets were choppy in early trade on Thursday, vacillating around the gain line, as concerns about the likely pace and scale of monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve this year eased a little.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 17 points, or less than 0.1%, at 36,424 points, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which have borne the brunt of this week's selling, were up more clearly, by around 0.2% and 0.4% respectively. 
The Nasdaq had its worst day in 11 months on Wednesday, falling over 3%. The S&P had also fallen nearly 2% and the Dow had only escaped the carnage by virtue of its heavier weighting of financial stocks, for which the prospect of higher interest rates is something usually to be welcomed.
As the market searched for direction, bears appeared to gain the upper hand again, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock falling another 4.0% to completely close the gap it had created in response to the electric carmaker's strong fourth-quarter delivery numbers last week. The stock is a key holding of Cathie Wood's high-profile ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), which has underperformed sharply as long-term growth stories have fallen out of favor this week. Higher discount rates have a particularly strong effect on the valuation models for companies whose potential lies further out in the future. A series of announcements by Ford (NYSE:F), Daimler (OTC:DMLRY) and Chrysler owner Stellantis  (NYSE:STLA) this week, meanwhile, have also underlined the increasingly strong competition Tesla faces in the EV space.
What's true for Tesla is in many ways true for Rivian, too, all the more so since it still hasn't produced its electric vehicles in any meaningful quantity. Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock fell 14% to the lowest level since it listed late last year. Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), another highly-valued rival, fell 7.5%.
The market had been unsettled by suggestions in the minutes of the Fed's December meeting, published on Wednesday, that the first interest rate hike since the pandemic could come as early and March and that, moreover, some Fed policymakers are already pushing for a reversal of the bond purchases that have underpinned market liquidity and risk appetite for the last two years.
The release of weekly jobless claims earlier did little to suggest that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and the wave of infections it is causing are forcing businesses to lay off staff. Initial claims ticked up to 207,000 from a revised 200,000 the previous week, but remain near their post-pandemic lows. Trade data, meanwhile, continued to point to unprecedented demand from U.S. consumers, with imports topping $300 billion for the first time in December.
Of more concern was the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing survey, which showed more of an impact on activity from the latest Covid wave. The headline purchasing managers index fell more sharply than expected to 62.0 from 69.1, but the prices sub-index rose to 82.5, just short of its all-time high of 82.9 in October.
Elsewhere, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock escaped the selling pressure, rising 11% after posting sound quarterly results

LONDON (Reuters) - Amsterdam ended 2021 as Europe's top share trading venue, holding its lead over London despite efforts by the British financial centre to make its equity markets more attractive after Brexit.
Euro-denominated share trading by EU investors had to stop in Britain when the country left the European Union on Dec. 31, 2020. Much of the trading switched to Amsterdam, where pan-European Euronext has a base, along with the new post-Brexit operations of Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE) and  London Stock Exchange  Group's (LON:LSEG) Turquoise.
Figures from Cboe Global Markets on Thursday show that average daily trading in Amsterdam last month totalled 8.97 billion euros ($10.15 billion), ahead of London's 8.32 billion euros.
Amsterdam overtook London as a share trading venue soon after Brexit, but the British city had managed to nudge back ahead in June
Graphic: 2020: London towers above peers- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbvgnjbbopq/2020.png
A deal with Switzerland to allow Swiss share trading to resume in London helped it claw back lost ground, but was not enough to secure the number 1 spot for long as other initiatives failed to gain immediate traction.
Britain in August made it easier to list special purpose acquisition companies or SPACs, long the darlings of investors on Wall Street, but by November just one had listed. 
Euronext said it had 22 new SPAC listings, accounting for nearly half of all those coming to the market in Europe last year.
Graphic: 2021: Amsterdam takes the lead- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbkjaaovq/2021.png
Britain's finance ministry is facing calls from the financial sector to accelerate efforts to buttress UK capital market competitiveness.
""It's not a given nL1N2TL14P that people will want to come to London,"" Catherine McGuinness, policy chief for the City of London, home to the financial district, told Reuters on Tuesday.
The Financial Conduct Authority introduced more flexible rules last month nL8N2SN25Q for listings on LSEG's premium segment in a bid to lure more tech companies, which Wall Street has been so successful in attracting.
LSEG said last week that 122 companies listed on its exchange in 2021, raising over $22.75 billion, its best year since 2007. 

Euronext, whose exchanges in Europe include Amsterdam, said last week it also had a record year with 212 new listings raising $29.42 billion.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 09:21AM ET</span>","As Toshiba investors carp, No. 2 shareholder urges EGM vote on break-up plan","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - The second-largest investor in Japan's Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp on Thursday called for an extraordinary general meeting, seeking to force the company to win two-thirds support for a three-way breakup plan that has angered some major overseas shareholders. 
The proposal by Singapore-based hedge fund 3D Investment Partners marks the latest in a long and acrimonious battle between the once-mighty tech conglomerate and a number of its foreign shareholders, many of them activist funds.
Toshiba is now about 30%-owned by foreign hedge funds, many of which doubt whether management's plan to split the company into three businesses - one each for energy/infrastructure, electronic devices and flash memory chips - can maximise shareholder value.
The break-up plan was announced last November after a five-month strategic review following years of accounting scandals and governance issues that undermined investor confidence and saw Toshiba's market value more than halved, to around $18 billion, from an early 2000s peak.
If 3D's proposal for the meeting were to be accepted, it would trigger a vote that could ultimately scupper the break-up plan, a strategy that carries echoes of a similar move announced last year by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.
3D owns more than 7% of Toshiba, a stake worth well over a billion dollars. In a statement, it highlighted concerns about the cost of going ahead with the split before getting a mandate from shareholders, and called for Toshiba to resume its strategic review.
""There is no rationale for pursuing at great expense the separation plan without knowing whether a sufficient number of Toshiba shareholders will ultimately provide consent,"" the fund said. Toshiba has previously said the plan will cost 10 billion yen ($86 million) to implement.
'EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES'
In a twist, 3D said that if an extraordinary general meeting were to be approved, it would actually vote against its own proposal that Toshiba's statutes of incorporation should be changed to mandate the implementation of the break-up plan.
Instead, 3D said, the company should not pursue the plan ""without first further exploring other alternatives thoroughly"".
With its proposals, 3D is effectively trying to force the conglomerate to bring forward by more than a year a vote requiring backing from two-thirds of shareholders that is required under Japanese law. Officially, the vote is not slated to be held until the annual general shareholder meeting in 2023.
Toshiba said on Thursday it is carefully considering its response as 3D's proposal ""contains unusual content,"" with the fund making a demand while expressing its intent to vote against it.
Shares in Toshiba closed down 0.9% on Thursday, compared with a 2.9% decline in the overall Tokyo market. 
Weakened by a 2015 accounting scandal and the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear business, Toshiba has proposed the break-up to sharpen its focus on individual businesses. 
But 3D and other shareholders have pushed for a more thorough review that would take into account potential private-equity bids.
Toshiba's strategic review so far ""failed to consider a full range of alternatives,"" 3D said.
The company itself is preparing to hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting in March to gauge shareholder support for the break-up plan, set to be completed by March 2024.

But details of the meeting are unclear, including the level of shareholder support it will require to continue with the plan.
One alternative to seeking a direct vote on support for the breakup plan that has been floated among Toshiba's board is asking shareholders at the extraordinary meeting to instead vote on the reappointment of its board directors, people familiar with the matter have said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Three leading British retailers on Thursday underscored the threat they face from inflation this year, with their bosses battling to remain competitive as consumer finances come under pressure and prices surge. 
Next, Britain's most profitable clothing retailer, Greggs, a booming food-to-go chain, and discount group B&M need to absorb higher commodity, energy, labour and freight costs without pushing prices up to the detriment of sales. 
For Next, the worry is the gap between price rises and customers' wage increases, while Greggs has lifted its own staff wages to retain workers in a tight market, and now wants to pass through price rises without losing its 'value' tag. 
""This year is a more challenging year than most,"" outgoing Greggs CEO Roger Whiteside told Reuters. ""You've got inflation coming at you from both the ingredient side and the labour side."" 
Rising inflation is the big cloud on the horizon for the global economy, as supply chain disruption, higher energy costs, labour shortages and post-lockdown demand pushes up prices at rates not seen for decades.
British consumers have already seen food prices rise, with post-Brexit economic barriers pushing up the cost of trade, and hikes in taxes and energy bills are due in April. 
The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to hit 6% in April, its highest since 1992, before easing.
MOUNTING PRESSURE 
Next, a $15 billion retail giant that sells fashion, school uniforms and suits to millions of customers, expects its prices to rise by 6% in the second half of 2022. 
Boss Simon Wolfson told Reuters the gap between general wage rises and price increases would largely determine the company's fortunes this year.
""If wage inflation is in line with our price increases - I don't think it will be, but if it is - then it's not going to be nearly as much of a problem as if wage inflation is a long way behind."" 
Next has been hit by higher freight, and manufacturing costs, and by high staff costs, particularly for workers in areas where there are shortages such as warehousing. It said it had already seen customers buying fewer items at a slightly higher price. 
Greggs said its biggest ""lumps"" of costs were staff wages, which it has hiked ahead of a government-mandated rise in the minimum wage, and soaring ingredient costs. With order contracts in place, it has visibility for the next four to six months.
Whiteside, who built Greggs up to 2,181 stores across the country, said he was watching rivals and would only increase prices where they can remain below others. ""Some of our prices have moved, but so have our competitors,"" he said. 
French caterer Sodexo (PA:EXHO) said purchasing contracts had helped it to contain UK inflation but the challenge would come in the second half of the year as they come up for review. 
B&M, a discount retailer that upgraded its profit forecast on Thursday, said 2022 would bring further supply chain disruption, inflationary pressures and uncertainty from COVID-19. 

ING Developed Markets Economist James Smith said inflation would pose challenges, but noted many higher earners had conserved cash in the last two years, though they had also spent on items when unable to travel, potentially limiting future demand.

The government introduced the tax warehousing scheme at the start of the pandemic and last month extended the period whereby liabilities arising can be deferred to the end of March, as it cut the opening hours of hospitality venues and shut nightclubs in another tightening of restrictions.
The 100,900 firms on the scheme will not have to pay any interest on the debt until the end of March next year, after which a rate of 3% will apply to any amount outstanding.
Some 23,000 firms are also availing of a separate wage subsidy scheme, with the state helping to pay the wages of 267,700 employees or just over 10% of Ireland's workforce, the data from Ireland's Office of the Revenue Commissioners showed.
The finance ministry's chief economist said on Wednesday that the scheduled withdrawal of the scheme at the end of April represented a risk to the economy as some firms are surviving because of the state supports and may not be viable thereafter.
""There will be scarring effects,"" Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath told the same news conference on Wednesday.

LONDON (Reuters) -Greggs retail director Roisin Currie will take over as chief executive in May, the British food-to-go retailer said on Thursday as it reported a rise in fourth-quarter sales despite the spread of Omicron in the run-up to Christmas.
The company, known for its sausage rolls, savoury bakes and sandwiches, said it expected its 2021 profit to be slightly ahead of its previous expectations and that it would be able to pay a special dividend of 30 to 40 million pounds ($54 million).
Greggs said a strong October performance was followed by more challenging conditions as the Omicron coronavirus variant surged in December but like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter as a whole were still up 0.8% from 2019.
Chief Executive Roger Whiteside, who is retiring this year after nine years at the helm, said Greggs now had the playbook for COVID after dealing with the pandemic for two years.
""Our suburban stores started to do better again as people stayed at home, our city centre, office based and mass transport hub areas fell back,"" he said. ""But we still managed to stay positive.""
Greggs said conditions at the start of 2022 were likely to remain challenging with increased costs also in the mix.
""We've got reasonable visibility of what we're looking at from four to six months forward because we typically buy on a contract,"" Whiteside said, adding that the inflationary outlook for the full year would be clearer by March.
Shares in Greggs, which were about 480 pence when Whiteside started as CEO, were trading 1.6% lower at 3,316 in early deals, which was still an increase of 44% over the past 12 months. 
Some analysts welcomed the decision to appoint Currie as Whiteside's replacement.
""This looks a solid internal appointment, particularly given her key role in developing the delivery business,"" analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note.
Greggs said total sales in 2021 were 1.23 billion pounds, up from 811 million pounds in 2020 and 1.17 billion pounds in 2019.
The company has cash of 198 million pounds, which it said would allow it to open about 150 new stores this year, develop digital channels and extend its trading day.
Whiteside said Omicron was putting pressure on workers at its 2,181 stores but was manageable from a financial perspective and Greggs had brought forward a pay rise for them.

(Reuters) - Silicon Ranch Corp, the U.S. solar project developer backed by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), on Thursday said it raised $775 million in equity capital from new and existing investors.
The announcement comes as renewable energy, and in particular solar, is experiencing a dramatic expansion in the United States. Financial institutions are seeking to capitalize on that growth and satisfy growing investor demand for assets that address climate change.
The round was led by new investor Manulife Investment Management, a division of Canada's biggest life insurer, Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC) Corp, which contributed $400 million.
Existing investors Shell, TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund and Mountain Group Partners also participated in the round. The deal is expected to close in the current quarter.
Silicon Ranch, based in Nashville, Tennessee, owns and operates more than 150 solar energy facilities in 15 states. Its customers include rural electric cooperatives, utilities and major corporations like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Shell invested in Silicon Ranch in 2018 and owns about 45% of the company.
The new funding will enable Silicon Ranch to build about 2 gigawatts of solar projects over the next 24 to 36 months, doubling its current built capacity, Chief Executive Reagan Farr said in an interview. 
Two gigawatts of solar can power about 380,000 homes. 
Silicon Ranch is also interested in making more acquisitions like its purchase last year of Clearloop, a company that sells carbon offsets to corporations to fund solar projects in low-income communities.

""It really enables us to continue to grow and scale and execute being not just a renewable energy solution provider, but increasingly a carbon solution and ESG (environmental, social and governance) provider as well,"" Farr said.
The United States is on track to install 348 GW of solar over the next decade, more than three times the nation's current solar capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Industries Association.

1437,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 07:01AM ET</span>","U.S. Futures Mixed; Jobless Claims, Retail Sector in Focus","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening in muted fashion Thursday, stabilizing after the previous session’s sharp selloff as investors digest the Federal Reserve’s increasingly hawkish stance.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 100 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 60 points, or 0.4%.
The major indices on Wall Street closed steeply lower Wednesday after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting signalled the possibility of faster-than-expected U.S. rate hikes and stimulus withdrawal. 
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped almost 400 points, or 1.1%, after earlier hitting an intraday record high, while the broad-based S&P 500 fell 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite, an index which includes a lot of growth-sensitive stocks, suffered the most, falling 3.3%, its biggest one-day loss since February.
“So now, the Fed wants to end QE early, wants to raise rates sooner, and reduce the balance sheet,” said Michael Kramer, the founder of Mott Capital Management, “The market cannot be ok with this, nor should it be. Valuations across the market are too high to support this much monetary tightening.”
The Fed policymakers pointed to a ""very tight"" job market as a key factor pushing them towards lifting rates sooner than previously guided. ADP private payrolls soared last month, and attention now turns to weekly jobless claims data due later Thursday, ahead of Friday’s key nonfarm payrolls report.
In corporate news, the retail sector is likely to be in focus after Reuters reported that foot traffic grew at  Target  (NYSE:TGT) during the recent holiday season compared with two years earlier, while visits to both Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) stores fell overall.
Additionally, there will be quarterly earnings reports from Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) before the bell Thursday.
Oil prices strengthened Thursday, helped by escalating unrest in oil producer Kazakhstan and supply outages in Libya.
Russia sent paratroopers into Kazakhstan on Thursday to quell a countrywide uprising. Although there are no indications that oil production has been affected so far, the former Soviet state is currently producing 1.6 million barrels of oil per day.
Additionally, oil output is down by over 500,000 barrels per day in Libya due to pipeline maintenance and oilfield shutdowns.
Crude prices had weakened on Wednesday after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed gasoline inventories surged more than 10 million barrels, the biggest weekly build since April 2020, suggesting the U.S. public is becoming reluctant to travel as Covid cases surge.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $78.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $81.72. Both contracts have climbed to their highest levels since late November.
Additionally, gold futures fell 1.5% to $1,797.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded marginally lower at 1.1308.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 06:36AM ET</span>","Target holiday shopper traffic growth topped Walmart, Best Buy -data","By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Shopper foot traffic grew at  Target  (NYSE:TGT) during the recent holiday season compared with two years earlier, while visits to both Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Best Buy  stores fell overall, according to data provided exclusively to Reuters measuring shopper visits from Nov. 1 to Dec. 25. 
The store data could provide early clues to help investors separate winners from losers after a holiday season marked by the coronavirus pandemic and inventory shortages arising from a supply chain logjam.
Shopper traffic at Target stores rose 6.2% through the holiday period compared with two years ago, pre-pandemic, according to Placer.ai, a research firm that collects anonymized location data from 30 million mobile devices across the country. At rivals Walmart Inc and Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY), traffic declined by 0.1% and 11.5%, respectively, the data shows.

Target, Walmart and Best Buy declined to comment. 
U.S. November-December traffic was also eroded by people shopping earlier than usual in the 2021 holiday season.
Marshal Cohen, NPD Group’s head retail analyst, said traffic data is helpful to understand whether people are going to stores and making so-called impulse purchases that account for roughly 25% of retailers’ holiday sales.
Still, Cohen said that people worried about COVID-19 have changed the way they shop, increasingly going online which is “a challenge” for some retailers.
According to Refinitiv I/B/E/S, Target’s holiday quarter sales are expected to rise by more than a third versus 2019, while Walmart’s revenue is forecast to rise by about 7% and Best Buy sales are expected rise by about 10%.
Target store traffic increased in every part of the country except Hawaii and Washington D.C., with footfall rising nearly 24% in Vermont and Idaho, compared with 2019, according to Placer.ai.

Despite Target’s strong holiday season traffic, the retailer's fourth-quarter profit margin is expected to narrow to 25.35% from 27.10% two years ago, due in part to supply-chain logjams.
WHERE PEOPLE SHOPPED
Walmart traffic declined in 20 states – mostly coastal areas, with the retailer harder hit in Florida, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware. It had higher traffic in several parts of the country, with shoppers going to its stores in many midwestern and southern states.

Best Buy’s footfall fell in all but four U.S. states during the period. Analysts have said the electronics retailer was likely unable to source enough products, including TVs and consoles, amid a global chip shortage.
For a related graphic, click https://graphics.reuters.com/RETAIL-HOLIDAYSHOPPING/USA/akpezeqwjvr/chart.png
Traffic does not always reflect trends in sales. “It's very hard to draw a straight line between store traffic and total sales and retail,” said John Mercer, advisory firm Coresight Research’s head of global research. 

Overall foot traffic to U.S. stores fell each week from Nov. 1 to Dec. 25 compared with the same weeks in pre-pandemic 2019, according to data from Sensormatic. 
“Ever since the COVID lifestyle began, Target has pretty much led the way,” Cohen said. “They’ve had fewer out-of-stocks; they were aggressive with promotions even when Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) minimized them; they invested in private-label merchandise; they’ve been a leader in curbside and buy-online-pick-up-in-store.”

(Reuters) -  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) on Wednesday canceled sailings amid rising fears of Omicron-related coronavirus infections that have dampened the nascent recovery of the pandemic-ravaged cruise industry.
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd called off its Spectrum of the Seas cruise for Jan. 6 after nine guests on its Jan. 2 trip were identified as close contacts to a local Hong Kong COVID-19 case.
The contacts have tested negative but the cruise ship will return to Kai Tak Cruise Terminal in Hong Kong on Jan. 5 to test all guests and crew who must take a second test on Jan. 8, the company said.
A similar decision to cancel trips by  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  was made against the backdrop of the United States reporting the highest daily tally of any country for new coronavirus infections on Monday.
""Due to ongoing travel restrictions, we've had to modify a few sailings and unfortunately have had to cancel,"" the 17-ship strong cruise operator said, with the embarkation dates for a few canceled sailings as far out as late April.
The cruise line, which requires everyone on board to be vaccinated, has also had to cut short a 12-day round trip from Miami on its Norwegian Pearl ship, citing ""COVID related circumstances.""
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had last week advised people to avoid cruise travel after launching investigations into onboard cases on more than 90 ships. The health agency starts a scrutiny if at least 0.1% of the guests test positive.
Norwegian Cruise said guests, who were supposed to embark on the canceled sailings on the eight ships, will receive full refunds and bonus credits for future bookings.
The Omicron-led travel uncertainty is also causing guests on other sailings to cancel their bookings as a few ships have also had to skip ports due to onboard infections.

""We booked the cruise last March and assumed that things would be getting back to normal... by mid-December, I was mentally prepared for a change of plans,"" said Holly Bromley, a consulting arborist, who canceled her booking on Norwegian Epic.
Meanwhile, bigger rival Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp said it has not canceled any upcoming voyages, but its shares fell on Wednesday to close down 2.6%. Royal Caribbean lost 2.1% and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings 3.6%.

(Reuters) -California's second largest ever wildfire, which scorched just under 1 million acres last year, was sparked by a tree coming in contact with cables operated by Pacific Gas and Electric power utility, state authorities said https://files.ctctusercontent.com/fac05d5d601/9a535be5-0634-487a-9cb1-5cdf4a42acc6.pdf?rdr=true on Tuesday.
The cause of the fire was identified west of Cresta Dam, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement to the Butte County District Attorney's Office.
PG&E (NYSE:PCG) did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
The Dixie fire erupted on July 13, 2021, and destroyed 1,329 structures and damaged 95 additional structures.
In November, PG&E acknowledged that it had received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney's office seeking documents related to the Dixie Fire, and the Californian utility expected to take a loss of $1.15 billion.
California Public Utilities Commission had voted unanimously in April https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/california-toughens-pge-oversight-over-wildfire-safety-work-2021-04-15 last year to toughen oversight of PG&E, saying the utility had largely failed to perform required tree-trimming work near power lines in areas with the highest risk of wildfires.

PG&E's equipment also caused a deadly fire in California in 2017 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-fire-idUSKCN1J501C that claimed 46 lives, devastated at least 245,000 acres and incinerated 8,900 homes.
The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2020. It had sought protection from creditors after wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018 drove the utility's potential liabilities into tens of billions of dollars.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 06:21AM ET</span>",CDC recommends Pfizer's COVID-19 booster for ages 12 to 15,"By Michael Erman
(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday it expanded the eligibility of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s booster doses to those 12 to 15 years old.
The move came after a panel of outside experts advising the CDC voted earlier to recommend booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine be made available for ages 12 to 15.
The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted 13 to 1 to recommend that the U.S. health agency support booster shots for those aged 12 to 15 at least five months after their second dose. 
The panel also said the CDC should strengthen its recommendation for boosters for ages 16 and 17. The agency had previously made the shots available to those teenagers, but had stopped short of suggesting that all of them should receive the additional jab.
The CDC said in a statement it now recommended that adolescents age 12 to 17 years old should receive a booster shot 5 months after their initial Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination series.
COVID-19 cases in the United States have hit record levels in recent days due to the fast spreading Omicron variant of the virus. Infection rates are surging as many workers and school children return from holiday vacations, raising the prospect of overwhelmed health systems as well as closed businesses and schools.
""COVID is overwhelming our hospitals and our children's hospitals,"" said panel member Dr. Katherine Poehling, a professor at Wake Forest School of Medicine. ""This is a tool we need to use, and help our children through this pandemic.""
Data from Israel's Health Ministry presented at the meeting suggested that vaccinated children aged 12 to 15 who were five to six months past their second dose were being infected at the same rate as unvaccinated kids by the Omicron variant of the virus. After receiving a booster shot, the infection rate dropped sharply, according to the data.
Dr. Peter Marks, a top regulator at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said that it is reasonable to extend the boosters down to 12- to 15-year-olds given the current surge in cases.
The FDA had authorized the additional doses U.S. FDA authorizes Pfizer's COVID-19 booster for 12- to 15-year-olds for the age group on Monday, but the CDC sign-off was needed before the shots can be administered.
""This booster dose will provide optimized protection against COVID-19 and the Omicron variant,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in the statement.
Some scientists have expressed concerns about the booster shots due to rare cases of heart inflammation called myocarditis that have been linked to both the Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines, particularly in young men. 

While there is limited data on myocarditis after booster doses for ages 12 to 15, the FDA has said evidence from both the United States and Israel indicates that the risk of myocarditis in men aged 18-40 is significantly lower after booster shots than after the second vaccine dose.
Only two cases of myocarditis were reported in Israel among 44,000 adolescents aged 12 to 15 who received a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the Israeli Health Ministry said on Wednesday.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 06:12AM ET</span>",TPG executives to pocket potential $1.4 billion tax windfall after IPO,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - TPG's top dealmakers will force the buyout firm to pay them the cash value of tax savings it expects to receive, currently estimated to be worth $1.44 billion, in the years following its initial public offering (IPO), a regulatory filing shows. 
The practice has been popular with buyout firms going public since Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc deployed it in its IPO in 2007. Private equity firms argue the arrangement is justified in rewarding their partners. Critics say it strips their public shareholders of value that should have gone to them.
Robert Willens, a tax expert and professor of finance at Columbia Business School, said there was a risk that IPO investors may not fully appreciate how much value in the private equity firm is being transferred to its founders because of the complexity of the process involved. 
""Public investors could be overpaying for the stock, it is hard for them to understand the implications,"" Willens said.
A TPG spokesperson declined to comment.
The tax benefits TPG will enjoy stem from its reorganization as it goes public. In acquiring the interests of its founders in its operating partnership, TPG expects to see a step-up in its tax basis, allowing it to take depreciation and amortization deductions that reduce its taxable income, the filing shows.
TPG has entered into a ""tax receivable agreement"" with its founders to pay them 85% of the cash value of these tax savings, according to the filing. 
The Fort Worth, Texas-based firm said that value, currently pegged at $1.44 billion, ""may materially differ"" by the time the tax savings will be realized. It added that it expects the payments it will have to make under the agreement to be ""substantial"" and that they could have a ""material negative effect"" on its cash position. 
TPG disclosed on Tuesday it expects to be worth $9.5 billion in its IPO, so the tax receivable agreement would transfer an estimated 15% of that value to TPG's top dealmakers, primarily founders David Bonderman and Jim Coulter and Chief Executive Jon Winkelried. 
Bonderman and Coulter are already billionaires, and the estimated $1.44 billion payout would boost their fortunes further. Forbes pegs Bonderman's and Coulter's net worth at $4.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. 
If it does not have enough money to make the tax receivable agreements payments in time, TPG will be charged interest equal to the one-year LIBOR rate plus 5%, the filing shows. And if a change of control occurs, such as its founders giving up their dual-class shares, TPG will owe them the remaining estimated value of the tax savings.
This happened in the last two years when the founders of peers KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc, Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc gave up voting control by turning the firms into corporations with a single class of stock.
This triggered a $560 million payment for KKR's founders under their tax receivable agreement, which the New York-based firm said it would pay in the form of stock. 
LAWMAKER SCRUTINY
Apollo's founders and executives secured a payout of at least $584 million over four years in similar fashion under its tax receivable agreement when the firm announced last year it would eliminate its dual-class structure, regulatory filings show. The executives elected to receive the payout in cash rather than Apollo stock.
A source familiar with the matter said the payout was worth only half the value of the accrued tax benefits owed to the founders, who agreed to forego the other half in the interest of Apollo's shareholders.
Carlyle was the first among the major publicly listed private equity firms to get rid of special voting rights for its executives in 2019. The change triggered a $346 million cash payout over five years for the Carlyle executives under its tax receivable agreement, regulatory filings show.
The use of tax receivable agreements by private equity firms attracted U.S. lawmaker scrutiny in 2007, when Blackstone disclosed in its IPO filings that its executives could receive tax benefits totaling $863.7 million over the next 15 years under the arrangement.

However, U.S. Congress never passed into law proposed legislation that would have taxed payments made through tax receivable agreements as ordinary income. The use of tax receivable agreements expanded in popularity, and some private equity firms used them to extract value from portfolio companies they took public.
""Private equity firms use expensive tax lawyers a lot for their portfolio companies. It is therefore not surprising that they use convoluted tax tricks to their direct benefit as well,"" said Ludovic Phalippou, a finance professor at the University of Oxford's Said Business School.

China Credit Trust Co said in the letter, confirmed by two sources familiar with the matter, that 755 million yuan of the trust loan had been repaid. However, the absence of the remaining payment meant the loan was now in default, it added in the letter to investors in the loan.
Shimao and China Credit Trust Co did not respond to requests for comment.
Separately, smaller rival Guangzhou R&F Properties said it did not have sufficient funds to buy back a $725 million bond as sales of its assets had not come through as planned. 
Chinese developers are facing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze due to years of regulatory curbs on borrowing, causing a string of offshore debt defaults, credit-rating downgrades and sell-offs in developers' shares and bonds.
The offshore default last month of China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted developer with more than $300 billion in liabilities, has exacerbated a debt crisis looming over the world's second-largest economy.
Shimao had already seen sharp falls in its shares and debt in December, triggered by worries over an asset sale and cancelled apartment deals.
For R&F, it said in a filing late on Wednesday that the funds available to settle its tender offer for an offshore bond were materially less than the $300 million it previously expected, due to continued volatility in the property sector. 
Last month, R&F proposed two tender offer options to bondholders of the 5.75% notes, while seeking their consent to extend by six months the maturity of the bond due Jan. 13.
The options were buying back the notes at a 17% discount, or $830 for every $1,000 in principal; or buying back at most half of bondholders' notes in full, both with accrued interest.
R&F said in the filing that 71.7% of the bondholders had tendered for the first option and 24.2% for the second - but it added that it expected to have ""materially less"" than the $300 million previously anticipated to buy back the bonds.
""Proceeds from certain asset sales contemplated by the group may fail to materialise by the settlement date,"" it said, adding the settlement date has been postponed by two days to around Jan. 12.
In the document last month, R&F said it would accept tendered notes on a pro rata basis, and any notes not accepted for purchase would be returned to the bondholders. Holders that tendered would also be deemed to have approved the maturity extension. 
As of 0935 GMT, the bond was trading at 56.5 cents on the dollar, down from 66.5 overnight, according to data from Duration Finance. R&F's other international bonds also fell.
Shimao's bond due July 2022 plunged to 47.625 from 70.6. 
Onshore, most of the yuan bonds of the two developers also tumbled, with a Shimao bond due Sept 2022 tumbling 11%.

Shares of Shimao listed in Hong Kong closed down 5.2%. R&F shares gained 2.3%.

Omicron appears to be far more easily transmitted than previous strains of the virus, though the World Health Organization has said that the evidence so far suggests the variant is causing less severe illness.

Recently, countries including the United States and Britain have expanded their booster shot programmes, with numerous studies showing that an initial course of vaccines may not be enough to halt infection from Omicron, but a booster shot may help.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's data privacy watchdog CNIL said on Thursday it had fined Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google a record 150 million euros ($169 million) for making it difficult for internet users to refuse online trackers known as cookies.
Meta Platforms' Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was also fined 60 million euros for the same reason, the CNIL said. 
Internet users' prior consent for the use of cookies -- tiny snippets of data that help build targeted digital ad campaigns -- is a key pillar of the European Union's data privacy regulation and a top priority for the CNIL.
""When you accept cookies, it's done in just one click,"" said Karin Kiefer, CNIL's head for data protection and sanctions. ""Rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them"".
In its statement, the watchdog said it had found that the facebook.com, google.fr and youtube.com websites didn't allow the refusal of cookies easily, citing Google's video-streaming platform. 
The CNIL said the two companies had three months to comply with its orders or face an extra penalty payment of 100,000 euros per day of delay.
These include the obligation for Google and Facebook to provide French internet users simpler tools for refusing cookies, in order to guarantee their consent. 
The CNIL said that while Google and Facebook provided a virtual button to allow the immediate acceptance of cookies, there was no equivalent to refuse them as easily. 
""People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision,"" a Google spokesperson said.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CNIL's previous record fine in 2020 also targeted Google and amounted to 100 million euros. 
At the time, the CNIL found that Google's French websites didn't seek the prior consent of visitors before advertising cookies were saved on computers and failed to provide clear information about how it intended to make use of them.
Kiefer said the issues have been resolved since then. 
In 2020, the CNIL strengthened consent rights over ad trackers, saying websites operating in France should keep a register of internet users' refusal to accept cookies for at least six months.

It also said internet users should be able to easily reconsider any initial agreement concerning cookies via a web link or an icon that should be visible on all the website pages.

Expensive software makers, biotechs and newly minted stocks have born the brunt of the damage, while Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund, the poster-child of hyper-growth names, has tumbled 9%.
Declines may not be over yet: Nasdaq 100 futures point to a further 0.3% drop on Thursday after the worst two-day rout since March. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were hovering near to 1.75%, the highest in about 10 months. Volumes on the main indexes remained thin and well below levels of mid-December when the Federal Reserve’s hawkish tilt turned markets volatile.
Higher rates reduce the present value of future earnings, weighing especially on shares of highly valued, fast-growing companies. Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) Inc., Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) Inc., Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc. and Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. have lost between 10% and 18% this week. Megacaps haven’t been spared either: the NYSE FANG+ Index has fallen 2.8%, led by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).
eToro Global Market Strategist Ben Laidler said that while he’s positive on 2022, the year will see lower returns than 2021, with more volatility.
Hedge funds, which spent December unloading high-growth, high-valuation stocks, began the new year by jettisoning software and chipmakers at a furious pace. In the four sessions through Tuesday, these sales reached the highest level in dollar terms in more than 10 years, according to data compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s prime broker.
A correction, however, might not be a given. Tech stocks took a similar beating in March, but bounced back right after.
“The dip in stocks seems a bit overdone,” UBS Global Wealth Management strategists led by Mark Haefele said in a note. “The normalization of Fed policy shouldn’t dent the outlook for corporate profit growth, which remains on a solid footing due to strong consumer spending, rising wages, and still easy access to capital.”

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 03:56AM ET</span>","Size not the main aim, shippers say, as MSC overtakes Maersk","COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Swiss-based container group MSC has overtaken Denmark's Maersk as the world's biggest shipper, the company said, confirming data from intelligence provider Alphaliner.
After taking delivery of several ships last year, MSC or Mediterranean Shipping Company has capacity to move the equivalent of 4,284 million twenty-foot containers, Alphaliner said. That compares with Maersk's 4,282 million.
Both companies, which according to Alphaliner hold markets share of around 17%, said size was not the objective.
Asked for comment, Maersk, which has been the biggest shipper for decades, referred to comments made by CEO Soren Skou in May.
""I would like to be CEO of the world's largest shipping and logistics company, and I believe I have a good chance of holding on to that for some time to come,"" Skou said.
""Our goal isn't to be number 1. Our goal is to do a good job for our customers, delivering strong returns and not least be a decent company for all other stakeholders doing business with Maersk.""
Bottlenecks caused by a surge in demand for consumer goods as the world emerges from the initial pandemic impact has driven container shipping rates to record highs.
MSC, privately owned by the Aponte family, said in an emailed statement it emerged at the world's biggest container carrier after investing in new ultra-large vessels ""to meet the acceleration of global trade and specific client demand for our services"". 
""At MSC, we never set a specific target to be the biggest. Growth, profitability and supporting customers are what have driven us,"" said MSC Chief Executive Soren Toft, who joined the company from Maersk in late-2020.
Since 2016, Maersk has sold its oil and gas business and bought such as warehouses to transform itself into an integrated logistics company rather than a conglomerate. 

It owns the majority of its container shipping capacity, while MSC has chartered some two-thirds of its capacity, Alphaliner said.
Alphaliner says CMA CGM and Cosco are the third and fourth biggest container shipping companies with 12.6% and 11.6% market share, respectively.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Banks in Hong Kong including  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) are taking steps to reduce the number of people at the workplace after having operated at near full capacity for the past few months, as the city faces a spike in COVID-19 cases.
HSBC, which is one of the biggest employers in Hong Kong with about 30,000 people, will maintain a maximum of 50% staff occupancy in its offices from Friday, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. A spokesperson for HSBC confirmed the memo's content. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has encouraged its staff to work from home from Jan. 7-24, according to the U.S. bank's internal memo seen by Reuters. A bank spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo that was sent on Thursday.
Earlier, UBS said in a memo to staff that it would split its 2,500 Hong Kong workforce into two groups, with each returning to the workplace on alternate weeks.
The moves come amid worries of a fifth wave of COVID-19 infections in the Asian financial hub. Hong Kong has announced a two-week ban on some inbound flights, slapped curbs on indoor dining and closed swimming pools, bars and other venues.
The city recorded 38 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/hong-kong-hunts-covid-patients-contacts-orders-cruise-ship-back-port-2022-01-05. 
Staff at HSBC and UBS have been told to minimise cross floor travel in their offices and not to socialise with members not in their own team, according to the memos.
HSBC, UBS and Bank of America also said staff had to wear masks when not at their desks, according to their memos.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) divided its 6,000 workforce https://www.reuters.com/business/stanchart-splits-hong-kong-workforce-concerns-about-new-covid-19-outbreak-2022-01-05 into teams earlier this week.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Thursday, extending the global selloff after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting pointed to early interest rate hikes amid inflation concerns. 
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 1.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 1%. 
European indexes, like their Asian counterparts, took their lead from the sharp selloff on Wall Street late Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plunging more than 3% in its biggest one-day percentage drop since February. The broad-based S&P 500 also fell almost 2%, its biggest daily percentage decline since late November.
These losses followed the publication of minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting, in which the policymakers said a ""very tight"" job market and elevated inflation might require the central bank to raise rates sooner than previously guided. Some policymakers also pressed for the Fed to start unwinding its massive bond purchases, something that would put further upward pressure on long-term interest rates.
Adding to Thursday’s woes, France reported a new record of Covid-19 cases, around a third of a million daily cases, while the likes of Portugal, Turkey, Italy and the Netherlands also registered record rises. Italy has announced a vaccination mandate for all those over 50 years old.
There was some good news though as German factory orders rose 3.7% month-on-month in November, driven by a sharp rise in demand from abroad, after declining a revised 5.8% in the previous month. 
In corporate news, Sodexo (PA:EXHO) stock fell 1.3%, weighed by the overall weakness despite the French catering and food services group reporting a 17% jump in its first-quarter organic sales that was helped by the reopening of schools and universities.
 Next  (LON:NXT) stock fell 2.3% even after the British clothing retailer raised its full-year profit outlook for the fifth time in 10 months on the back of strong sales in the run-up to Christmas.
 Greggs  (LON:GRG) stock fell 2.2% after the British bakery chain reported continued disruption to staffing and supply chains in the quarter, and said conditions in the first few months of 2022 were likely to remain challenging. 
Oil prices fell Thursday after U.S. gasoline stockpiles surged last week, implying weakening demand at the world’s largest energy consumer.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude inventories fell by just over 2 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 31, less than expected, while gasoline inventories surged more than 10 million barrels, the biggest weekly build since April 2020.
The rise in gasoline stocks suggested that the public is reluctant to travel, with the United States reporting nearly 1 million Covid-19 cases on Monday, setting a global record.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $77.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $80.48. Both contracts had climbed to their highest levels since late November on Wednesday after a group of top producers increased output, suggesting confidence over demand in the first quarter.
Additionally, gold futures fell 1.5% to $1,798.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1300.

Caterers have been hit hard by the pandemic and are looking for new ways to adapt to recurring lockdowns, more working from home and fewer events.
Chief Finance Officer Marc Rolland said during a call with journalists that catering for the white-collar sector could decrease a little.
The French parliament approved on Thursday the government's latest measures to tackle COVID-19, including a vaccine pass, and barring unvaccinated people from hospitality venues and trains.
Rolland said it was too early to say if the group could achieve its annual forecasts, but noted first-quarter organic growth of 17.5% was at the top end of its 15-18% full-year guidance range.
""At this stage, we maintain our annual guidance and remain confident in the continued recovery,"" chairwoman and interim Chief Executive Officer Sophie Bellon said in a statement.
The Paris-based firm, one of the world's biggest catering companies alongside Britain's Compass, said revenues reached 95% of pre-COVID levels in the first quarter, with recovery visible in all activities, segments and geographies.
Revenues rose to 5.26 billion euros ($5.95 billion) from 4.43 billion a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected 5.24 billion euros, according to a company-provided consensus.
Sodexo, which in July launched a search for a new chief executive to replace Denis Machuel, said the process was moving forward, but its was taking time to choose the right person.

Sodexo shares were down 1.8% to 79.58 euros at 0802 GMT.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Vietnam's VinFast plans to build electric vehicle battery cells and packs in a new U.S. manufacturing complex, its global chief executive told Reuters, as the company pledged to transform itself into an all-electric automaker by the end of this year.
VinFast, part of Vingroup JSC, the largest conglomerate in the Communist-ruled country, became the country's first full-fledged domestic car maker when gasoline-powered models built under its own badge hit the streets in 2019. 
The company, which began selling EVs in Vietnam at the end of 2021, said in a statement on Thursday it planned to become what it said would be the first car company to cease making gasoline-powered cars and transition to all-electric vehicle production from late 2022.
VinFast is betting big on the U.S. market, where it hopes its electric SUVs and a battery leasing model will be enough to tempt consumers away from the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and General Motors (NYSE:GM). 
""We will build our gigafactory in the U.S. as well,"" Le Thi Thu Thuy, Vingroup vice chair and VinFast Global CEO said, referring to the new battery facility in an interview during her U.S. visit to attend the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 
The company will continue to source batteries from its suppliers, she added.
Thuy said VinFast will initially assemble battery packs with cells sourced from its supplier at its U.S. complex before starting its own production there.
""We have narrowed down from I think, over 50 sites to about three sites,"" she said.
She will visit some sites during her trip before making a decision this year, adding that the ""mega site"" would also include an electric bus factory.
In December, Vingroup said it had started building a battery cell plant in Vietnam. The company is looking to initially produce 100,000 battery packs per year, with $174 million in investment, and then upgrade capacity to one million.
VinFast previously told Reuters it had plans https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vietnams-vinfast-plans-us-listing-couple-years-ceo-2021-11-17 to start producing electric cars in the U.S. in the late 2024.
The company said prices for its VF8 sport utility vehicle (SUV) started from $41,000 in the United States, and that it would apply blockchain technology to record orders and confirm ownership. By comparison, a Tesla SUV sells for around $50,000. 

Vingroup said it was targeting global electric vehicle sales of 42,000 next year.
Shares of Vingroup rose as much as 5.8% on Thursday after it revealed three VinFast's electric vehicles line-up and the plans to go all-electric. VinFast is eyeing a share listing in the United States this year.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison, facing a federal election before May, is under pressure over his handling of the Omicron outbreak due to stock shortages of antigen tests and hours-long wait times at testing centres.
Having successfully kept a lid in its COVID-19 caseload through aggressive lockdowns earlier in the pandemic, Australia is now suffering infections rates far higher than elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, and some epidemiologists in the country predict that the worst is yet to come.

To ease the pressure on businesses, the New South Wales (NSW) government urged firms to avoid asking staff, who might have been exposed to the virus, to get themselves tested if they do not exhibit any symptoms.

Those workers in April announced they had formed a union representing about 650 employees, including software engineers and product managers.
The company declined to voluntarily recognize the Times Tech Guild, forcing the issue to proceed to a formal election through the NLRB.
In the complaint, the NLRB alleged that management in May, during a virtual hearing held by Zoom, told employees they were barred from showing union support while acting as ""intern managers"" and has continued to maintain that rule.

The Times Tech Guild in a series of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posts on Wednesday said the NLRB had offered the company the chance to settle the charge but it declined. The NLRB will now prosecute the case before an administrate judge during a hearing in March.
""It's frustrating to see this response, yet another example of a pattern of delays we've experienced at every step of our campaign,"" the Times Tech Guild said.

(Reuters) - The chief executive of the blank-check acquisition firm that plans to merge with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s new social media venture is chasing retail investors to save another of his deals from falling apart.
According to regulatory filings and a person familiar with the matter, Benessere Capital led by Patrick Orlando has postponed its special shareholders' meeting to extend its deadline to complete a merger because not enough investors sent in their votes.
The special shareholder meeting has been rescheduled to Jan. 7, the previously set date for Benessere to close a deal, from Jan. 5. If Benessere Capital can’t secure enough shareholder votes to extend the deadline by then, the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) will face the risk of being dissolved.
Orlando’s other SPAC, Yunhong International, liquidated last year, citing its ""inability to consummate an initial business"" within the deadline stipulated as per the company’s regulations in its filings.
As retail participation in SPACs rose since 2020, it can post challenges for SPACs to chase down individual investors and gather enough shareholder votes from them. Lucid Group(LCID.O), a highly popular SPAC target among retail investors, had struggled to get enough votes to approve its merger last year.
SPACs usually hire proxy solicitors to contact retail investors to vote through mails and by phone. Retail investors account for over 60% of Benessere's shareholders, according to the source.
When Orlando's other SPAC, Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC.O), announced its plan to merge with Trump's new social media company, many retail investors flocked into the stock as well as Benessere.

Benessere has agreed to combine with hydrogen fuel supplier eCombustible in November, valuing the energy firm at $805 million.
A SPAC is a publicly listed shell company that raises funds intending to merge with a private company within a deadline ranging from 12 to 24 months.

He will remain in his role until a new director is appointed.
Michael Carvajal has served for three decades in the agency known as the BOP, which houses more than 135,000 federal inmates. He was appointed director in February 2020 under Republican former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. 
Carvajal faced pressure from members of both parties on the Senate Judiciary Committee over pandemic protocols at the agency, including a lack of adequate testing.
Nearly 42,000 inmates and just under 9,000 staff have recovered from COVID-19, while 275 federal inmates and seven BOP staff have died with the disease. 
In November Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on Carvajal to be dismissed, including for ""failing to protect BOP staff and inmates from the COVID-19 pandemic.""
""His resignation is an opportunity for new, reform-minded leadership at the Bureau of Prisons,"" Durbin said on Wednesday. 

The BOP declined to comment.
Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley said in a statement that Carvajal's operational experience and knowledge of the BOP ""helped steer it during critical times, including during this historic pandemic.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Wednesday narrowed but refused to dismiss a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit accusing Morningstar Inc of letting analysts adjust credit rating models for about $30 billion of mortgage securities, resulting in lower payouts to investors.
U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams in Manhattan said the SEC plausibly alleged that Morningstar Credit Ratings failed to provide users with a general understanding of its methodology for rating commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), and lacked effective internal controls over its ratings process.
The judge also dismissed an SEC claim that Morningstar failed to identify the version of the methodologies used to determine individual credit ratings.
Abrams also rejected an SEC request for an injunction, noting that Morningstar Credit Ratings no longer operates as a credit rating agency after its operations were integrated with those of DBRS Inc, under the brand name DBRS Morningstar.
Based in Chicago, Morningstar is also known for its investment research, including for mutual funds, and asset management. Morningstar, its lawyers, and the SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ratings agencies were widely criticized by investors and politicians during and after the 2008 global financial crisis, following a U.S. housing bubble fueled in part by inflated ratings for mortgage securities.
In a complaint https://www.reuters.com/business/us-sec-sues-morningstar-over-ratings-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-2021-02-16 last February, the SEC said Morningstar violated securities laws by letting analysts make undisclosed adjustments to ""key stresses"" underlying ratings for 30 CMBS transactions in 2015 and 2016.
The SEC said this sometimes benefited issuers that paid for the ratings by lowering the resulting interest rates owed to investors. 
In May 2020, Morningstar agreed to pay $3.5 million to settle SEC charges it violated conflict of interest rules designed to separate ratings work from sales and marketing.
The case is SEC v Morningstar Credit Ratings LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-01359.

Researcher Springboard said its data, which ran from Nov. 28 to Jan. 2 showed shopper numbers, or footfall, declined from 2019, before the pandemic impacted trading, by 22.2% on high streets, 24.1% in shopping centres and 4.9% in retail parks.
""The natural boost in shopper activity which typically occurs in the run-up to Christmas did not materialise, due to a blend of consumers' nervousness around the rapid rise in infections and the risk of missing out on Christmas, households isolating due to infection and the re-introduction of working from home (guidance),"" said Springboard director Diane Wehrle.
The researcher noted that in the fourth week (the week beginning Dec. 19) the gap from 2019 narrowed to 13.8% across all UK retail destinations from down 19.1% in the week before, as consumers made the most of the six available trading days in the week running up to Christmas Day.
It said the biggest challenge for the retail sector in the weeks to come will be the ongoing working from home guidance that suppresses footfall, combined with increasing staff shortages due to COVID-19 isolation rules and the ""great return"" of goods purchased over the Christmas period.

Data published on Dec. 21 showed British retail sales growth fell sharply in the first half of December as concerns about Omicron kept shoppers away.
However, data published on Wednesday showed UK supermarkets performed well.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 07:08PM ET</span>",Electric cars hit 65% of Norway sales as Tesla grabs overall pole,"By Victoria Klesty
OSLO (Reuters) - Electric cars made up nearly two thirds of Norway's new sales in 2021, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) the top selling automobile brand overall, as the country pursues its goal of becoming the first to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars.
While Norway, with a population of 5.4 million, has the world's highest proportion of electric vehicles, China with its 1.4 billion people is by far the biggest overall car market.
Oil-producing Norway has encouraged the switch to zero emission cars by exempting battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from taxes imposed on internal combustion engines (ICE (NYSE:ICE)). 
This tax break is expected to help drive the proportion of overall electric sales as high as 80% in 2022, ahead of a deadline to end petrol and diesel powered car sales by 2025.
Overall new sales in Norway rose by 25% in 2021 to a record 176,276 cars, of which 65% were fully electric. This market share was up from 54% in 2020.
While small, affluent Norway is seen as a key market in which to gain a foothold for new BEV players, including China's Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Swedish Volvo Cars affiliate Polestar. 
Tesla had an 11.6% share of Norway's overall car market in 2021, making it the number one brand for the first time on a full-year basis ahead of Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) with 9.6%, the Norwegian Road Federation (NRF) said on Monday. 
For a related graphic on Norway new car sales, click: https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-ELECTRIC/NORWAY/gdvzykqrgpw/chart.png 
The U.S. automaker on Sunday reported quarterly deliveries far exceeding Wall Street estimates, riding out global chip shortages as it ramped up China production, which lifted its shares to a one-month high on Monday.
The Tesla Model 3 was the single most popular model of the year in Norway ahead of Toyota's hybrid RAV4, the sole car among the top-10 with an internal combustion engine, and Volkswagen's electric ID.4 in third place.
Industry representatives said they expect EV sales to grow to as much as 80% of the total market in Norway in 2022, although supply chain problems could put the brakes on this.
""We believe we will exceed 80% electric cars next year,"" said Christina Bu who heads the Norwegian EV Association. 
""But there is big uncertainty in that forecast, and it is dependent on the shipping conundrum - many car producers have delivery problems,"" she added.

WELCOMING 
""Norway is the country with the biggest openness to EVs, the biggest understanding of what it is to drive an EV and the most welcoming for having an alternative,"" Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters.
Polestar's luxury sedan was the 10th most popular car model in Norway in 2021 and it will debut its Polestar 3 SUV in 2022.
""To launch this premium SUV ... will definitely change the way people will perceive Polestar so I have really big expectations for moving the brand forward,"" Ingenlath said.
Chinese EV makers have been looking to push up exports in line with Beijing's ambition to build a world-class auto industry and compete with traditional auto firms.
Nio launched lavish showrooms in central Oslo in 2021, its first overseas, aiming to sell its ES8 sport-utility vehicles and ET7 sedans as part of plans to expand globally.
It also plans charging and battery swapping stations. 
""Our swapping station strategy we will expand quite strongly (in 2022),"" Marius Hayler, head of Nio Norway, said, adding that he expects some 75% of overall car sales to be electric in 2022.
While tax exemptions help cut emissions of greenhouse gases, they cost the state 30 billion Norwegian crowns ($3.41 billion) in lost revenue last year, finance ministry estimates show. 

So the ruling centre-left coalition plans to gradually start taxing the most expensive BEVs from 2023, while taxes on petrol, diesel and hybrids are rising this year.

Cocks, who joined the company in 2016 from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), is currently president and operating chief of its Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming division, which makes the ""Dungeons and Dragons"" and ""Magic: The Gathering"" games.
Under his watch, the division doubled its revenue to surpass $1 billion in 2021, as the company focused on boosting digital offerings of its popular games, creating new ones and overseeing digital licensing for the entire business.
Last year, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) restructured its business into three divisions to transform into a ""global play and digital entertainment company"" rather than just a toymaker.
At Microsoft, Cocks served in product management and marketing leadership positions at MSN and Xbox, working on hit franchises like ""Halo"" and ""Fable"", Hasbro said in a statement.
The 48-year old will take over as chief of the Nerf and Power Rangers toymaker on Feb. 25, replacing interim CEO Rich Stoddart, who will become chairman of the board.
Hasbro said it expects to name a new president for Wizards of the Coast in the coming weeks.

On Wednesday, the company also named Eric Nyman, who has been with Hasbro for almost two decades, as its chief operating officer. 
Hasbro shares rose 1.6% in aftermarket trading on Wednesday. The stock has risen about 9% in 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell sharply on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq plunging more than 3% in its biggest one-day percentage drop since February, after U.S. Federal Reserve meeting minutes signaled the central bank may raise interest rates sooner than expected.
The S&P 500 fell more than 1%, its biggest daily percentage decline since Nov. 26, the first day of trading after news of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq quickly extended their declines after the release of the minutes, which investors viewed as more hawkish than they had feared. The Dow, which hit a record high earlier in the day, reversed course and ended down more than 1%.
The selloff was broad, with all S&P sectors ending in the red, and Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility index, closing at its highest level since Dec. 21.
In the minutes from the Fed's Dec. 14-15 policy meeting, central bank policymakers said a ""very tight"" job market and unabated inflation might require the Fed to raise rates sooner and begin reducing its overall asset holdings as a second brake on the economy.
""Indications that the Fed is very concerned about inflation could quickly create a view that the Fed will aggressively tighten in 2022,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York, calling the minutes ""more hawkish than expected.""
The S&P 500 technology sector fell 3.1% and was the biggest drag on the benchmark index, while the rate-sensitive real estate sector dropped 3.2% in its biggest daily percentage decline since Jan. 4, 2021.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 392.54 points, or 1.07%, to 36,407.11, the S&P 500 lost 92.96 points, or 1.94%, to 4,700.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 522.54 points, or 3.34%, to 15,100.17.
Rising interest rates increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and higher rates can depress stock multiples, especially for technology and other growth stocks. 
Growth shares have been under pressure from a recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields.
The Russell 2000 index also suffered its biggest one-day drop since Nov. 26, while the S&P 500 financials index fell 1.3%, a day after it registered an all-time closing high. 
Policymakers in December agreed to hasten the end of their pandemic-era program of bond purchases, and issued forecasts anticipating three quarter-percentage-point rate increases during 2022. The Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate is currently set near zero.
Early in the day, an ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls increased by 807,000 jobs last month, more than double of what economists polled by Reuters had forecast.
The report comes ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched nonfarm payrolls data for December on Friday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.22-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 59 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 81 new highs and 307 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.18 billion shares, compared with the 10.4 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Virginia's Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday announced he will appoint former President Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency administrator to become the state's top environmental regulator.
Youngkin, a Republican who won in an upset against a Democratic challenger in November, announced he has chosen Andrew Wheeler as the states's next secretary of Natural Resources and Michael Rolband as the next director of Environmental Quality.
  Wheeler, who served as Trump's second EPA administrator, led that administration's efforts to undo major environmental regulations for power plants and cars and downplayed the urgency of addressing climate change. Rolband is the founder of the environmental consulting firm Wetland Studies and Solutions, Inc.
“Andrew and Michael share my vision in finding new ways to innovate and use our natural resources to provide Virginia with a stable, dependable, and growing power supply that will meet Virginia’s power demands without passing the costs on to the consumer,” said Youngkin.
Wheeler served for years as a career staffer at the EPA under former President George W. Bush but also worked in the private sector, including as a coal lobbyist.
Youngkin last month pledged to remove Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a market-based program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in 11 U.S. Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.
Virginia passed a bill in March 2020 under Democratic Governor Ralph Northam to join RGGI, which brought in $228 million to Virginia to fund state programs on energy efficiency and flooding.
Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups raised concerns about how Wheeler's track record at the EPA will affect Virginia's environmental policies and growth as a leading renewable energy producing state. 
Virginia was the fourth-biggest market for new solar installations in 2020 and the first three quarters of 2021 behind Texas, California and Florida, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie. It was 19th in 2019. 
""We are concerned about Administrator Wheeler’s track record of rolling back key environmental protections at the EPA,"" said Elly Boehmer, policy director at Environment Virginia, adding that her group will continue to press Youngkin and the legislature to uphold environmental laws and stay in RGGI. 
“Putting an anti-environment ideologue in this important position would be a far cry from the kind of consensus-based, pragmatic leadership the Governor-elect promised,"" said Democratic Congressman Don Beyer. 

Wheeler did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
A resident of Fairfax county, Virginia, Wheeler last year spoke out against a county effort to place a 5 cent tax on single-use plastic bags.

(Reuters) -Walmart Inc workers in the United States who must isolate or who have tested positive for COVID-19 will receive one week of paid leave instead of two under a new policy that aligns with a change in U.S. health guidance. 
A memo, seen by Reuters, sent on Tuesday to U.S. hourly store employees and long-haul drivers said COVID-19 positive workers and those required to quarantine - by Walmart (NYSE:WMT), a health care provider or a government agency - are eligible for one work week of paid time off. 
The company's guidelines follow the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's updated recommendations last week that people isolate for five days after a COVID-19 infection, instead of 10 days.
The retailer, the largest private employer in the United States with about 1.6 million workers, is among the first major retailers to reduce paid leave for COVID-19, and could serve as a bellwether for other major employers. 
The move comes as a spike in COVID-19 cases is causing significant labor shortages across an industry that is already battling supply-chain snarls, product shortages, rising inflation and rocketing transportation costs.
A Walmart spokesperson confirmed the COVID-leave policy change. Workers who continue to be sick can potentially receive additional COVID-related pay for up to 26 weeks. 
The spokesperson added that Walmart was asking corporate employees to work primarily from home until Jan. 30, rather than Jan. 10 previously announced.
The company operates 600 Sam's Club stores and more than 4,700 Walmart U.S. stores in the United States. On Monday, the company said it temporarily shut 60 stores in COVID-19 hot spots in December to sanitize them against the virus.
""A lot of people don't want to come into work as they're either afraid or getting coronavirus,"" Peter Naughton, 46, a Walmart electronics salesperson in Baton Rouge and member of labor non-profit United for Respect. ""I can't afford not to come to work.""

Like other mass retailers, Walmart has witnessed a boom in sales during the pandemic as more people shopped for groceries and home goods. The company raised its full-year annual sales and profit forecast in November but disappointed investors with higher labor and transportation costs that eroded margins. 
The company's stock is nearly flat over the past one year compared to the broader S&P 500 retailing index's 20.6% rise over the same period.

U.S. financial firms have also been more aggressive than other industries in encouraging employees to return to offices. However, a number of big banks, including Bank of America, have advised employees to work from home for at least part of this month to avoid the highly infectious Omicron variant, which has caused COVID-19 cases to skyrocket.
Bank of America has encouraged its workers to get vaccinated and boosted since last summer, and has offered other incentives, including paid time off, to get the shots and $500 credits toward their health benefit premiums.

BOSTON (Reuters) -U.S. stocks slid and Treasury yields jumped on Wednesday after meeting minutes released by the Federal Reserve indicated that it might not only raise interest rates sooner than expected but could also reduce its overall asset holdings to tame high inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 392.54 points, or 1.07%, to 36,407.11; the S&P 500 lost 92.96 points, or 1.94%, to 4,700.58; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 522.54 points, or 3.34%, to 15,100.17 -- led downward by shares of technology titans Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The Fed minutes from December, released on Wednesday, offered more details on the Fed's shift last month toward a more hawkish monetary policy. Policymakers agreed to hasten the end of their pandemic-era program of bond purchases, and issued forecasts anticipating three quarter-percentage-point rate increases during 2022.
""Today's FOMC minutes make clear that discussions about more than three rate hikes and outright quantitative tightening this year are on the table,"" Dave Donabedian, chief investment officer for CIBC Private Wealth, U.S., said in an email.
U.S. Treasury yields soared on Wednesday after the Fed meeting minutes came in more hawkish than expected. 
U.S. 2-year and 5-year yields, which mirror rate hike expectations, climbed to their highest since March and February 2020, respectively. The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield rose to its strongest level since April 2021, at around 1.7%, while 30-year yields climbed to more than two-month peaks.
One positive economic indicator on Wednesday was the ADP National Employment report, which showed private payrolls increased by 807,000 jobs last month, more than double what economists polled by Reuters had forecast.
Citing an optimistic corporate earnings forecast, market analysts at Citi raised their 2022 S&P 500 index price target to 5,100, a 7% gain from year-end 2021. 
""We remain moderately constructive on the broader market outlook, while acknowledging valuation headwinds as the Fed moves down a more hawkish path,"" the Citi analysts wrote before the Fed minutes were released.
Citi's target was toward the higher end of other banks, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) at 4,400 and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also at 5,100. 
Oil prices rose modestly on Wednesday, extending gains even after OPEC+ producers stuck to an agreed output target rise for February and U.S. fuel inventories surged due to sliding demand as COVID-19 cases spiked.
U.S. crude rose 0.09% to $77.06 per barrel and Brent was at $80.08, up 0.1% on the day.
The dollar fell on Wednesday but pared losses to a 0.091% dip after the Fed minutes were released.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell about 3.5% to $44,201 -- still significantly below its most recent all-time high of $69,000 reached in November.

Goldman Sachs said in a research note on Tuesday that bitcoin would likely take market share away from gold as a ""store of value"" as digital assets become more widely adopted and that its price could hit $100,000 in five years.
Spot gold dropped 0.3% to $1,809.58 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.06% to $1,824.60 an ounce.

Salesforce closed the session down 8%.
The analyst set a $575 price target on Adobe, down from $635. The analyst said they spoke to 14 large businesses about their Adobe spending outlook for 2022 to assess why its growth metrics have now disappointed for two straight quarters. 
The analyst then explained that ""bottom line, we worry that more ""front-office/marketing"" tech spend was pulled-forward in 2020/2021 than most investors think, pressuring Adobe's growth rate in 2022.""
Keirstead set a price target of $265, down from the prior $315 on Salesforce. 
Speaking on the company, the analyst explained that ""spending on front-office sales, marketing and customer engagement software accelerated over the last 18 months, not surprising given the dislocation in post-COVID customer buying behavior.""
However, the UBS analyst added that while many of Salesforce's customers are planning similar levels of front-office spending growth in 2022, numerous others are already beginning to moderate their spending. 
""It seems likely that Salesforce's organic growth will moderate in 2022, which may out-weigh the positive associated with the improving margin narrative,"" Keirstead stated."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Nike Inc on Wednesday filed a lawsuit accusing  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc of patent infringement for making and selling the Mirror Home Gym and related mobile apps without authorization.
In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,  Nike  accused its smaller rival of infringing six patents, including through technology that enables users to target specific levels of exertion, compete with other users, and record their own performance.
Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, is seeking triple damages for Lululemon's alleged willful infringement, and a variety of other remedies.
Mirror gyms start at $1,195 https://www.mirror.co/shop/packages?utm_source=lululemon_site&utm_medium=lululemon&utm_campaign=story_page_bundles_shop_mirror, according to Lululemon's website.
Lululemon said in a statement: ""The patents in question are overly broad and invalid. We are confident in our position and look forward to defending it in court.""
In a Dec. 10, 2021 letter to Nike, a lawyer for Lululemon said the Vancouver, British Columbia-based company ""respects intellectual property"" even as it rejected Nike's claims.
Lululemon bought Mirror, an at-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform featuring live and on-demand classes, for about $453 million in July 2020.
Athletic apparel makers have benefited during the pandemic as people forced to work or spend more time home ditched dressier clothing for hoodies, leggings and other casual wear.
But Lululemon warned https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/lululemon-raises-annual-revenue-forecast-sustained-athleisure-boom-2021-12-09 last month that the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant could reduce sales of its apparel because of supply chain issues and potential store closures.
It also halved its fiscal year sales forecast for Mirror to a range of $125 million to $130 million.

In late afternoon trading in New York, shares of Lululemon were down 4.5% at $363.62, while Nike was down 2.1% at $162.91.

Investing.com -- Stocks tumbled Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve signaled it might be more aggressive in combating inflationary pressures with rate hikes as it eases off its stimulus. 
Already investors were expecting rate hikes as early as March, pushing Treasury yields higher this week. Wednesday’s private payrolls report, which comes a couple of days before the government’s monthly employment report, showed companies added 807,000 jobs last month. That was more than twice the number that economists had forecast.
Tech stocks slumped because rising inflation tends to dampen the prospects for growth companies, but the broader index also fell as did blue chip stocks.
Thursday brings the weekly jobless claims for the previous week, another gauge used by investors to measure progress in the recovery.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Fed outlook
After their meeting last month, Federal Reserve officials called the labor market “very tight"" and signaled it may need to raise interest rates sooner than they might have earlier last year.
""It may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate,"" the minutes said.
2. Oil market
Oil rose for a third-straight day after unexpectedly large builds in fuel stockpiles.
While crude stockpiles fell by 2.114 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said on Wednesday. Analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a draw of 3.283 million barrels instead.
Gasoline stocks jumped by 10.128 million barrels last week, the EIA said, compared with expectations for a rise of 1.775 million. Historical EIA showed that to be the largest weekly surge in gasoline stocks since April 2020, during the height of the coronavirus crisis. 
3. Chinese stocks
ADRs and stocks of Chinese companies traded weaker as China's cyber regulatory body issued draft rules Wednesday that, if implemented, will mean a heavier compliance burden for apps whose functions are perceived as influencing public opinion.
In an unrelated development, but one which still reflects the tightening of oversight of China’s internet giants, the country’s markets regulator fined units of  Alibaba  Group Holdings Ltd ADR (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Ltd ADR (OTC:TCEHY), and  Bilibili Inc  (NASDAQ:BILI) for failing to properly report about a dozen deals.

(Reuters) - Volvo Cars and self-driving sensor maker Luminar Technologies Inc said on Wednesday a hands-free driving system called ""Ride Pilot"" will be first released in California, though the companies did not give a specific date.
Volvo is planning to deploy the technology, which will allow the car to fully take over driving tasks in some limited situations, in a forthcoming all-electric SUV that Volvo plans to announce later this year. 
Volvo plans to offer the self-driving feature as a subscription upgrade to customers after vehicles have already hit the road. Alexander Petrofski, vice president of strategy and business ownership at Volvo, said during a press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show that the cars will go on sale in 2023, but Volvo has not set a date for when Ride Pilot will be available. 
Instead, Volvo has said Ride Pilot will not be turned on for customers until it has undergone a ""rigorous verification and testing protocol.""
The companies said they want to begin testing Ride Pilot later on pre-production vehicles this year in California, pending regulatory approvals. But when production vehicles hit the road starting next year, they will come standard with simpler driver-safety technologies that will help gather up data to validate the Ride Pilot technology before it is released. 
""I'm envisioning we will steer some of our sales to California in order to get the vehicle density"" to help collect data, Petrofski said.
Volvo declined to say how much the subscription to upgrade to Ride Pilot will cost. 

""We believe a large portion of our revenue in the future will come from software sales,"" Petrofski said.
Luminar will provide what is known as a lidar sensor, a key part of the system that helps the car gain a three-dimensional map of the road. But the vehicle will also rely on an array of five radar sensors, eight cameras and sixteen ultrasonic sensors, all tied together with software from Swedish firm Zensact.

(Reuters) -The Boy Scouts of America fell short of winning the support it sought from sex-abuse victims for a nearly $2.7 billion settlement that could bring the organization out of bankruptcy, according to court papers.
The proposed settlement of more than 82,000 claims of childhood sexual abuse earned the support of just over 73% of those who cast votes, below the 75% the Boy Scouts sought.
Nearly 54,000 survivors cast ballots, according to preliminary results released in a Tuesday court filing. The current tally is not final.
The nonprofit organization said in a statement on Wednesday that it is still negotiating with key parties to garner more support for the deal.
""We are encouraged by these preliminary results,"" the Boy Scouts said.
The 111-year-old youth group based in Irving, Texas, filed https://reut.rs/3JID2bO for bankruptcy in February 2020 after being hit by a flood of sexual abuse lawsuits when several U.S. states passed laws allowing accusers to sue over allegations dating back several decades.
Those claimants are now creditors of the organization, so they must sign off on any plans to restructure and exit bankruptcy. The deal must also eventually be approved by the Delaware judge who has been overseeing the case for the past two years. While the assent of two-thirds of creditors is all that is typically required for a Chapter 11 plan, judges often look for ""overwhelming"" creditor support in large, complex Chapter 11 cases before giving them the green light. 
Representatives of some of the victims have pushed for larger settlements.
""We hope the BSA and the lawyers who supported this plan will take this result as sending a message that the plan they proposed was fundamentally unacceptable to a large bloc of survivors,"" Irwin Zalkin of Zalkin Law Firm, who represents more than 150 victims, said in a statement.
John Humphrey, the co-chair of the committee representing abuse claimants in the bankruptcy, called the settlement ""historically low"" from the perspective of individual victims.
But a group representing tens of thousands of victims called the Coalition of Abused Scouts for Justice said on Wednesday that the plan provides victims the ""best and fastest avenue to closure, as well as just, fair and equitable compensation.""

The Boy Scouts https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/boy-scouts-bankruptcy-judge-rule-850-million-sex-abuse-deal-2021-08-19 has apologized and says the organization is committed to fulfilling their ""social and moral responsibility to equitably compensate survivors.""
As negotiations over a deal have dragged on, the Boy Scouts' lawyers had warned it would have to begin selling off assets, which would otherwise be used to compensate abuse claimants, to pay legal fees.

Barrack, 74, chaired Trump's 2017 inaugural fund and was a frequent guest at the White House. He pleaded https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-ally-barrack-pleads-not-guilty-uae-lobbying-case-2021-07-26 not guilty in July to seven criminal counts related to allegations he secretly lobbied the Trump administration for the UAE between 2016 and 2018, and lied to investigators about his ties to the country.
U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan said jury selection in Brooklyn federal court would begin on Sept. 7, with the trial beginning shortly thereafter. Assistant U.S. Attorney Hiral Mehta said he expected the trial to last three weeks, though he said that was a ""cautious"" estimate. 
The ruling came after Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Barrack, asked that a trial begin as soon as possible, arguing the time that has gone by since his July 2021 arrest https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-ally-barrack-pleads-not-guilty-uae-lobbying-case-2021-07-26 had taken an ""excruciating and devastating toll on Mr. Barrack.""

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 01:37PM ET</span>","GM to chase Ford, Rivian with a $105,000 electric Silverado pickup","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s $35 billion electric-vehicle strategy will face its biggest test in 2023 when it launches an electric version of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup with a six-figure price tag, more than a year after rivals Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Rivian Automotive launched their own electric pickups.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told the annual CES technology conference via video on Wednesday that the electric Silverado will launch in two stages in 2023, starting in the second quarter with a $39,900 WT work truck that will be delivered to a limited group of commercial fleets. In the fall of 2023, GM plans to start delivering a consumer, outdoor adventure-oriented model that will start at $105,000 - more than an electric Mercedes EQS sedan.
By 2035, Barra said, GM plans to offer an electric heavy-duty pickup truck, which would use batteries to replace the carbon-intensive diesel engines currently favored in trucks used primarily for heavy trailer hauling. Chevrolet also plans an off-road ""Trail Boss"" version of the electric pickup, she said.
Retail customers will see less expensive versions of the electric Silverado roll out in 2024 and beyond, Chevrolet officials said in briefings ahead of Barra's online CES speech.
GM shares were down 1.7% in afternoon trading following Barra's presentation.
The electric Silverado's debut escalates a battle for sales and customer loyalty in a segment that includes some of the most profitable vehicles sold by the Detroit automakers. Startup Rivian Automotive's electric R1T pickup, first shown in 2018, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk's polarizing vision for an all-electric pickup called the Cybertruck, spurred the Detroit Three to accelerate development of electric pickups. 
The Cybertruck's launch date remains uncertain. Stellantis NV's electric Ram truck is due in 2024. For now, the first lap of the electric pickup race is a contest among Ford, GM and Rivian, which began shipping the first of its $67,500 and up R1T models late last year.
The electric Silverado is built on the same architecture as the GMC Hummer EV, and has design and functional features that hark back to the automaker's Avalanche truck, a hybrid of an SUV and a pickup GM launched in the early 2000s. Like the Avalanche, the electric Silverado has a ""mid-gate,"" which opens up the back of the cab and slanted wings on the back of the cab.
The electric Silverado will enter the race for both fleet and consumer buyers a year or more behind the electric Ford F-150 Lightning. That gap reflects contrasting strategic choices by the longtime rivals.
Barra and GM President Mark Reuss are betting GM will win in the long run by first developing dedicated electric-vehicle architectures and a vertically integrated battery and motor production chain, then launching electric-vehicle models in high volume during the middle and latter part of this decade. By then, GM executives expect the costs of the company's proprietary Ultium battery technology will be lower than rivals, conferring a decisive advantage.
Ford took a different path. The F-150 Lightning due for delivery starting this spring is a modified version of the current, gasoline F-150 that is part of the best-selling vehicle line in the United States.
Ford's approach was faster, and Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley last month said the company had to cap at 200,000 the number of reservations it will take from consumers for the truck. 
Farley is pushing aggressively to build as many Lightnings as possible before GM's Silverado and other rivals hit the market. On Tuesday, Ford said it planned to double capacity for building Lightnings at its Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan, to 150,000 vehicles a year. Ford last September said it was increasing Lightning capacity to 80,000 vehicles from 40,000. 
Ford also is starting work with battery partner SK Innovation on an $11.4 billion network of vehicle assembly and battery-making plants in Tennessee and Kentucky.
Ford and GM are both targeting commercial fleet customers with electric pickups priced just below $40,000. 
GM said the WT, or work truck, version of the Silverado EV will have a 400-mile (644 km) driving range and will first go to a select group of fleet customers under deals already negotiated. GM expects to deliver ""tens of thousands"" of electric work trucks, said Steve Carlisle, head of GM's North American operations. 
Ford and GM are taking different paths to winning retail customers. The F-150 Lightning for retail customers has a 300-mile range, a 400-liter capacity front trunk that can function as a drink cooler and an option that enables the truck to power a house during a blackout. It can carry 1,800 pounds (816 kg) of stuff. The consumer Lightning had a starting price of $52,974, excluding tax breaks, before Ford capped orders.
The electric Silverado RST for retail buyers has a 400-mile range, a ""mid-gate"" in the back of the cab that can accommodate kayaks and surfboards, but carries less cargo and will not have backup generator capability when it launches. 
Carlisle said the generator function is ""very much on the radar."" A Chevrolet spokeswoman said bi-directional charging to power a home will be available within the first year of production.

GM executives said they will emphasize the Silverado's superior range in advertising that will start this year. 
GM's decision to charge European luxury car prices for the first Silverado RSTs mirrors the strategy for the first Hummer EVs, which started at over $110,000 and are now available for starting prices of $99,995 - more than double the average transaction price for a GM vehicle.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 01:36PM ET</span>",Explainer-Do 5G telecoms pose a threat to airline safety?,"(Reuters) - U.S. telecom companies and airlines have been fighting for weeks over the potential impact of 5G wireless services on aircraft, in stark contrast to the rollout of new-generation services elsewhere, which has broadly gone ahead without airing new safety concerns.
Here is some background on the dispute, in which  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) agreed on Monday to a two-week delay in using newly acquired wireless spectrum, drawing back from a standoff that threatened to disrupt flights. The agreement promises to avert most, but not all, potential disruption to air travel from 5G deployment
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
The U.S. auctioned mid-range 5G bandwidth to mobile phone companies in early 2021 in the 3.7-3.98 GHz range on the spectrum, known as C-Band, for about $80 billion.
U.S. aviation industry groups in recent months stepped up concerns and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a formal warning in November of the risk of interference with flight equipment.
In the airline industry, radar altimeters, which measure altitude, operate in the 4.2-4.4 GHz range and there are concerns that there is not a big enough buffer from the frequencies to be used by the telecoms companies.
The companies have faced pressure from the White House, airlines and aviation unions to delay the deployment amid concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters.
WHY IS THAT POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT FOR AVIATION?
Radio altimeters help to minimize the risk of accidents or collisions by giving an accurate reading of the proximity to the ground. The readouts are also used to facilitate automated landings and to help detect dangerous currents called windshear.
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THE FREQUENCY MAKE?
In short, the higher the frequency in the spectrum, the faster the service. So in order to get full value from 5G, operators want to operate at higher frequencies.
Some of the C-Band spectrum auctioned in the United States had been used for satellite radio but the transition to 5G means there will be much more traffic.
IS THIS A PROBLEM ELSEWHERE?
Following years of international discussions, the European Union in 2019 set standards for mid-range 5G frequencies in the 3.4-3.8 GHz range.
They have been auctioned and taken into use in many of the bloc's 27 member states so far without issue.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which oversees 31 states, said on Dec. 17 the latest discussion was specific to U.S. airspace. ""At this stage, no risk of unsafe interference has been identified in Europe,"" it said.
AT&T and Verizon have agreed to adopt exclusion zones around many U.S. airports similar to those used in France for six months.
FAA officials noted the spectrum used by France (3.6-3.8 GHz) sits further away from the spectrum (4.2-4.4 GHz) used for radio altimeters than in the United States and France's power level for 5G is also much lower than what is authorized in the United States.
But Verizon said it will not use spectrum that closer than what France is using for several years.
In South Korea, the 5G mobile communication frequency is 3.42-3.7GHz band and there has been no report of interference with radio wave since commercialization of 5G in April 2019.
Currently, 5G mobile communication wireless stations are in operation near airports, but there have been no reports of problems.
CTIA, a U.S. wireless trade group, said in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission that ""wireless carriers in nearly 40 countries throughout Europe and Asia now use the C-Band for 5G, with no reported effects on radio altimeters that operate in the same internationally designated 4.2-4.4 GHz 
band.""
It added ""each day U.S. aircraft, carrying thousands of U.S. citizens, land in these countries without incident and with no expression of concern by the FAA or foreign aviation regulators. This is the classic dog that did not bark. The laws of physics are no different in the United States than in Europe or Asia.""

But airlines had warned that without an agreement the safety precautions could disrupt up to 4% of daily flights. An airline group said the issue had the potential ""to divert or cancel thousands of flights every day, thus disrupting millions of passenger reservations, causing substantial disruptions.""
United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said last month that left unresolved the interference issue would mean that at major U.S. airports in the event of bad weather, cloud cover or even heavy smog ""you could only do visual approaches essentially.""

The order marks what one analyst, reacting to purchase plans first reported by Reuters https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/exclusive-us-carrier-allegiant-air-buy-50-boeing-737-max-jets-sources-2022-01-04 on Tuesday, called a stark change of approach by the fast-growing domestic carrier, which had previously relied mainly on used Airbus aircraft.
Allegiant ""has experienced one of the strongest recoveries of U.S. airlines,"" Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote, adding that the order is evidence of post-pandemic confidence in leisure travel ""vastly outperforming corporate travel.""
The Las Vegas-based carrier will buy 30 737 MAX 7 aircraft and 20 737 MAX 8-200 aircraft, making it the launch customer for that larger variant in the United States, Chief Financial Officer Greg Anderson told Reuters.
It will take delivery of 10 of the jets in 2023, 24 in 2024, and 16 in 2025, he added in an interview on Wednesday.
The deal is a boost for  Boeing Co  after two key medium-haul customers, Qantas and several affiliates of Air France-KLM, switched to Airbus in December.
""With this deal, and these new MAX aircraft, it will provide the ability to grow into 400 more routes,"" Anderson said.
He declined to name city pairs targeted under the expansion but said the planes would add seating capacity and 20% fuel savings compared to Allegiant's older Airbus aircraft. 
Boeing's shares were up 1.3% in midday trade while the stock of airline parent Allegiant Travel Co fell more than 8%.
Colin Scarola, vice president at CFRA Research, reckons that the Boeing order could undermine Allegiant's cost advantage as differential and mixed fleet tends to result in ""significant"" operating costs.
Scarola said the order also suggests that market inventory might be depleted for the much-cheaper highly used planes the low-cost airline typically likes to buy. 
MIXED FLEET
Allegiant has until now relied mainly on cheaper second-hand planes to reduce costs - a strategy that allows it to use jets less intensively and attack thinly populated routes, with some planes flying no more than twice a week, according to Jefferies.
Raymond James analysts said this approach is well suited for what is expected to be a ""choppy recovery"" but warned of the operational inefficiencies caused by having a mixed fleet. 
Allegiant currently operates 110 Airbus A319s and A320s and will continue buying A320s in the used market, Anderson said. It has some 50 aircraft – 20 A320s and 30 A319s - that it may need to retire over the coming decade.
Analysts said the deal for new jets pointed to an aggressive offer from Boeing while experts have said Airbus remains hampered by high parts costs for the A220, another type examined by Allegiant. Boeing has denied slashing prices to win deals.
Wednesday's expansion is the latest sign of growth among ""ultra-low-cost"" carriers that combine rock-bottom fares with optional charges. Such carriers are expected to emerge in a position of relative strength from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Our bookings are greater than they were in 2019,"" Anderson said, referring to pre-pandemic travel levels. 

Still, like many airlines, Allegiant has voiced uncertainties over fuel prices, labor and supply chain problems as well as mounting inflationary pressures.
Mexico's Viva Aerobus in December announced a commercial alliance with Allegiant to offer flights between the United States and Mexico.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) aims to introduce a ""personal autonomous vehicle"" by mid-decade, Chief Executive Mary Barra said on Wednesday.
The self-driving vehicle for personal use is being co-developed with GM's majority-owned Cruise, Barra said at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, in a remote keynote message focused on the twin themes of vehicle electrification and autonomy.
Barra said GM's expanding portfolio of electric vehicles, including the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup and the BrightDrop commercial vehicle range, also features two new Chevrolet crossovers, a $30,000 Equinox EV and a slightly larger Blazer EV, both of which will be introduced in 2023.
GM's new Ultra Cruise hands-free driving system will also debut in 2023 on another new EV, the Cadillac Celestiq ultra-luxury sedan. Barra said Ultra Cruise will use Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s new Snapdragon Ride compute platform for advanced driver assistance. 

At last year's CES, Cadillac raised a few eyebrows with two futuristic concepts, including a flying car. At this year's event, Barra unwrapped a third Cadillac concept, the InnerSpace, described as a self-driving, two-passenger luxury coupe.
A fourth Cadillac concept, the OpenSpace, was teased in a brief video as a ""vision for the next decade and beyond."" It was described by a GM insider as a ""luxury hotel room on wheels.""

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 12:56PM ET</span>",Rare winter wildfire to cost insurers about $1 billion - KCC,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Carolyn Cohn
(Reuters) - Catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Company (KCC) said on Wednesday it expects insured losses of about $1 billion from the rare winter wildfire that roared through two towns in Boulder County, Colorado, and destroyed a 1,000 homes.
In Colorado, the wildfire season does not typically extend into the winter thanks to snow cover and cold temperatures, but the Marshall Fire is part of a general trend of longer fire seasons and drier kindling in the Western U.S. as global temperatures rise, KCC said.
""The Marshall Fire became the most destructive fire in Colorado's history partially due to its location in the wildland-urban interface — the region where unmanaged (or natural) vegetation meets urban expansion,"" Jeff Amthor, assistant vice president of research at risk modelling firm AIR, said.
There are 1,725 homes within the Marshall burn area, with a total value of $825 million, AIR said, citing local officials. 
The Marshall fire burned about 6,000 acres, with nearly 1,000 structures destroyed and over 100 damaged as of Tuesday, KCC said. It follows the Pine Gulch Fire in 2020, Colorado's largest. 
In 2018, the Colorado State Forest Service reported data indicating nearly half of the state's population now lives in areas at risk from wildfires, an almost 50% jump in just five years, Amthor said. 
Climate change has been driving more so-called ""secondary peril"" weather events that are smaller than hurricanes, for instance, but less predictable. Other secondary perils include small- to mid-size localized events like wildfires, winter storms and hail storms.

""We do see this (Marshall Fire) as part of a broader trend of more acute, 'secondary' perils,"" said David Flandro, head of analytics at broker Howden. 
These events create risk management challenges for insurers and ultimately inflate premiums, according to insurance experts.

The company's signal processor is being showcased at its invitation-only event during CES 2022 in Las Vegas this week — it runs on its CV2 edge AI perception systems on chip (SoCs).
Elsewhere, analysts at Deutsche Bank, Stifel, and Wells Fargo increased their stock price targets for Ambarella.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Ross Seymore raised the firm's price target to $175 from $155, telling investors that the company's 2022 analyst meeting detailed a ""compelling technological CV-focused roadmap."" The analyst currently has a Hold rating on Ambarella.
Stifel's Tore Svanberg increased the price target on Ambarella to $230 from $215, keeping a buy rating. Svanberg said the company's pathway to $1 billion in revenues is ""shored by large and growing"" available markets.
At  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Gary Mobley said that for the first time, Ambarella's management articulated a path to $1 billion in annual revenue, while there was also additional design wins with Rivian. 
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore reiterated an overweight rating and $229 price target. However, the analyst said, ""the most tangible data point was the company pointing to 45% of revenues next year coming from computer vision, up from 25% this year - implying over 100% growth in computer vision given overall growth expectations, coming earlier than our estimates.""

Citing bitcoin's $700 billion market capitalization, compared to the around $2.6 trillion worth of gold owned as an investment, Goldman Sachs said that the cryptocurrency currently has a 20% share of the ""store of value"" market.
Bitcoin will ""most likely"" become a bigger proportion over time, Goldman Sachs said, in a list of 2022 predictions.
In a hypothetical scenario in which bitcoin grabs a 50% share of this market, its price would reach just over $100,000, the note said.
Bitcoin was trading around $46,073 on Wednesday, having struggled to make gains after falling sharply in early December. In November, it had hit an all-time high of $69,000.
""Bitcoin may have applications beyond simply a ""store of value"" - and digital asset markets are much bigger than Bitcoin - but we think that comparing its market capitalization to gold can help put parameters on plausible outcomes for Bitcoin returns,"" Pandl wrote. 

The term ""store of value"" usually describes assets which can maintain their worth over time without depreciating, such as precious metals or some currencies. 
Goldman Sachs restarted its cryptocurrency trading desk in 2021.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s electric commercial vehicle business, BrightDrop, said on Wednesday it has signed a new deal to supply EVs to retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and expanded its supply agreement with delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).
Financial terms of the deals, announced in conjunction with the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, were not disclosed.
The commercial EV business is attractive because governments around the world are pushing companies to slash CO2 emissions, and companies like FedEx, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) have pledged to shift their large delivery fleets to EVs. In addition, EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has yet to enter that market. 
Those large customers will be key to determining winners and losers as established automakers compete with startups to electrify the world's package delivery system. Amazon earlier on Wednesday said it will collaborate with Stellantis to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards, and deploy electric vans made by the automaker in Amazon's delivery network.
GM, which announced it was entering the EV van business last January, has estimated the U.S. market for parcel and food delivery vehicles will climb to more than $850 billion by 2025. 
The Detroit automaker started delivering the EV600 van last month and will add the smaller EV410 in late 2023. It will open a plant dedicated to BrightDrop vehicles in Ingersoll, Ontario, in Canada in the fourth quarter of this year.
Under the deal with GM, Walmart will reserve 5,000 of BrightDrop's EV600 and smaller EV410 delivery vans as part of its goal to operate a zero-emission logistics fleet by 2040, the companies said. 
Walmart plans to use the GM vans as part of its InHome delivery service, which it said on Wednesday it was rapidly expanding. The first BrightDrop vans will be delivered in early 2023.
Meanwhile, FedEx, which had begun taking delivery of 500 EVs from GM last year, is reserving another 2,000 over the next few years and is negotiating to take up to an additional 20,000 after that. FedEx also wants to achieve a carbon-neutral footprint for its global operations by 2040.
FedEx expects to add more than 200,000 electric medium-sized delivery vehicles by 2040, and GM's current two named models cover two-thirds of those needs, FedEx Express Regional President of the Americas Richard Smith said on a conference call. Fedex expects by 2030 that all new delivery vehicles purchased will be electric.
FedEx also has discussed GM supplying the larger vehicles with more cargo space that would meet the company's needs required by the remaining one-third, he said. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra previously said BrightDrop would offer a full-size van. 

""BrightDrop's real, they're here now, their trucks are on the road for us in California delivering packages,"" Smith said. ""That's another reason we're leaning in to them.""
FedEx and Walmart officials both said their deals with GM are not exclusive and they have talked with other EV makers.

By Joice Alves
LONDON (Reuters) -European automobile stocks rose more than 2% to a record high on Wednesday as investors turned increasingly bullish on the sector on growing expectations for stronger car sales in 2022. 
Investors' interest in car stocks across the region has ignited over the past few months with Europe's auto and auto parts index up more than 8% this week alone, surpassing a previous record high in November. 
The sector has gained 33% in a year, outperforming the pan-European index, which has gained 23% over the same period. 
After carmakers had to deal with high inventories over the past two years caused by a pandemic-induced slowdown in sales, things have started to turn around for the sector despite a 2021 shortage in chip supply, which forced some to cut production.
Shares in Germany's BMW rose 2.3% after the group said it achieved record sales of over 2.2 million vehicles from its BMW brand in 2021, outstripping 2019 levels. 
BofA expects European light vehicle production and sales to increase by 10% this year, with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Stellantis leading the pack with projected growth rates at around 20%. 
""We argue there is still substantial catch-up potential left and we remain positive on light vehicle sales growth in FY22,"" said Horst Schneider, research analyst at BofA. 
ROOM FOR GROWTH 
Higher car prices in 2021 offset an increase in costs in the second half of the year, analysts said. Yet European car stocks are much cheaper than U.S. peers. 
Europe's auto sector is trading at just seven times forward earnings. That compares to 16.8 times for the STOXX 600 benchmark and a whopping 42.4 times for the U.S. auto sector. U.S. carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s market capitalization alone is more than twice the size of the entire STOXX 600 index.
""Autos are very cheap, but profitability is strong given excellent price mix, even on lower volumes, and chip shortages should ease,"" said Emmanuel Cau, equity strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
Shares in Renault climbed 4.4% as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) said it had struck deals to supply the French carmaker and Volvo Cars.
Stellantis shares rose 3.4% as the Milan-listed company partnered with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards and deploy electric vans on the online retail giant's delivery network.
Daimler's shares also rose 3% despite reports the company informed owners of its luxury cars of a technical defect that could spark a fire.

Not everyone is bullish, JP Morgan cut its production growth forecast for European light vehicles to 4% and 6% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, citing consumers' hesitancy towards buying internal combustion engines, postponing purchases of electric vehicles and the chips shortage.
But with demand still outstripping supply amid ongoing shortages of raw materials, the auto and auto parts space is poised for growth, according to Barclays.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Stellantis NV said Wednesday they will collaborate to develop cars and trucks with Amazon software in the dashboards, and deploy electric vans made by Stellantis on Amazon's delivery network. 
The agreements expand Amazon's efforts to get a bigger foothold in the transportation industry, and could help Stellantis close the gap with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in developing vehicles with sophisticated, software-powered infotainment features that are connected to the data processing cloud.
Stellantis shares were up more than 3% in Milan.
The agreements between Stellantis and Amazon, the online retailer and cloud computing power, announced in conjunction with the CES technology conference, are wide ranging, involving software and hardware.
Amazon and Stellantis said they will work together to develop software for the ""digital cockpit"" infotainment systems of Stellantis vehicles that will start launching in 2024. Stellantis said it will use Amazon's Alexa technology for voice controlled features, ""navigation, vehicle maintenance, ecommerce marketplaces, and payment services."" 
Big ecommerce delivery fleet operators such as Amazon will be key to determining winners and losers as established automakers compete with startups to electrify the world's package delivery system. 
Stellantis Chief Software Officer Yves Bonnefont said during a conference call Wednesday that the automaker's use of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Android software for vehicles will ""evolve over time.""
Amazon will also help Stellantis speed up development of new digital products and ""upskill Stellantis' global workforce."" Stellantis and other established automakers are scrambling to match Tesla's ability to rapidly deploy new vehicle features and revenue-generating subscription services using software delivered over the air.
As part of the partnership, Stellantis will use Amazon as its ""preferred cloud provider"" to provide the mobile network and computing power future vehicles will need.
Under what Stellantis said is a separate agreement, Amazon will be the first customer for Stellantis' new line of electric delivery vans due to launch in 2023. The companies said they plan to put thousands of Stellantis Ram ProMaster electric vans on the road every year.

Amazon has a previous agreement to buy up to 100,000 electric vans from startup Rivian Automotive. 
Stellantis in May had agreed with iPhone assembler Foxconn to create a joint venture to supply in-car and connected-car technologies across the auto industry.

The delay is being sought due to the ""current operational status"" of the issuer, Hengda, the flagship property arm of Evergrande, said in a statement on Wednesday. It didn't provide any further details on why the delay was sought.
The online meeting with the yuan bondholders will vote on a few proposals on Jan-7-10. 
Evergrande is seeking to defer redemption and coupon payments of Hengda Real Estate Group's 4.5 billion yuan 6.98% January 2023 bond to July 8 from Jan. 8, which gives bondholders the option to sell bonds back to the issuer this weekend.
Trading in the bonds will be halted from Jan. 6 ahead of the meeting with bondholders, Hengda said. 
Evergrande, the most indebted developer in the world, has not yet missed any bond payments onshore, which are more senior than the offshore debt. The firm failed to make $82.5 million in offshore interest payments at the end of a month-long grace period early last month.
The developer's publicly announced meeting with the onshore bondholders is in sharp contrast to the silence it continues to maintain about the status of its offshore credit since missing payment on its dollar coupons for the first time in September.
In another resolution to be passed during the online meeting, Hengda must promise to meet its debt obligation, and it will have to formulate a reasonable repayment plan as soon as it expects a failure to make a payment on time, according to the statement. 
Chinese authorities have repeatedly reassured markets that Evergrande's woes can be contained, and stressed that paying workers' wages and delivering homes to buyers are priorities for developers in order to maintain social stability.
""A postponement is expected,"" said a holder of the bonds in question on condition of anonymity. ""Given the company is under pressure to prioritize wages ...and apartments."" 
Evergrande reiterated in a filing on Tuesday it would continue to actively maintain communication with creditors, strive to resolve risks and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all parties. 
The developer set up a risk management committee led by senior officials from state companies in December to study potential restructuring plans.

Evergrande shares listed in Hong Kong traded down 2.5% as of 0552 GMT, versus a 1.2% drop in the broader market.

Investing.com — On Wednesday, at CES 2022 —the Consumer Electronics Show —Chrysler revealed it will become an all-electric auto company, unveiling its Chrysler Airflow model.
Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA), which owns Chrysler, said at the show in Las Vegas that it plans to become an all-electric vehicle company by 2028. Stellantis shares have risen 2.66%, to $20.84, so far in Wednesday's session.

Investing.com —  Wayfair Inc  (NYSE:W) Inc shares sank more than 5% Wednesday after Wedbush analyst Seth Basham downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform, telling investors in a research note that ""results in 2021 have been underwhelming.""
Basham cut the price target on Wayfair shares to $160 from $290.
The analyst noted that there have constantly been ""yellow flags"" in key performance metrics for the American e-commerce company, such as net customer adds, customer acquisition costs and orders per customer. The metrics have been trending below pre-pandemic levels, according to Wedbush.
Basham said the issues have weighed on the company's shares, which are down 27% in the past three months. 
""We believe pressure has intensified due not only to softer category sales trends in December (and despite consumers’ renewed reluctance to shop at stores due to Omicron), but also due to a less attractive value proposition and supply chain challenges,” explained Seth Basham wrote.
In addition to the Wedbush downgrade, Wells Fargo slashed its price target on the stock to $195 from $250, saying Wayfair is among the most rate-sensitive companies."

(Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co envisions an interactive and partly virtual future it calls ""metamobility,"" where a variety of robotic devices interact with humans to provide a broad range of mobility services, from automated individual transportation to remote control of robots in ""smart"" factories.
Hyundai executives, led by Chief Executive Euisun Chung, elaborated on that vision in a media briefing at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday.
Buzzwords aside, Hyundai expects to leverage its growing expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence to build out a future mobility network that links human beings in the real world with objects and tasks in the virtual world.
The concept is related to the so-called metaverse, a term coined 30 years ago by author Neal Stephenson, but which gained attention recently when social media company Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) changed its name to Meta Platforms Inc. It refers to shared virtual world environments which people can access via the internet, and which can make use of virtual reality or augmented reality.
Hyundai offered several examples of how it might link the metaverse and the real world:
- A vehicle that can be transformed into a work space or an entertainment room that includes a 3D video game platform.
- A ""smart"" factory where humans outside the plant remotely control robots that interact with machines and products inside the plant.
- Automated personal transportation devices for people with disabilities or individuals who want to maintain social distances while traveling.
To make all this work, the automaker said it was building a Mobility of Things ecosystem that will link modular robotic platforms to perform different mobility services.

One module called Plug & Drive or PnD is a single-wheel robotics platform that combines intelligent steering, braking and suspension with in-wheel electric drive, cameras and lidar sensors for automated operation.
For larger logistics tasks and other mobility services, Hyundai can bundle four PnD modules, including one application that pairs with a robot dog called - what else? - Spot.

Investing.com —  Roku  Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) shares have fallen over 5% Wednesday after analysts at research firm Atlantic Equities initiated the stock with an underweight rating.
Analyst Hamilton Faber set a $136 price target on the stock, well below the current price of $211.23 per share.
Faber told investors in a research note that he expects account adds to be below the current expectations due to the company's low penetration in markets outside of the U.S.
""We estimate that 80% of Roku's active accounts are located in the US, implying 34% penetration in that market and just 6% in the other markets in which it operates (Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the UK, France and several other Latin American countries),"" explained Faber.
The analyst added that Roku is currently the operating system provider for 38% of U.S. smart TV sales, and Atlantic estimates total U.S. penetration will reach 40% by the end of 2025.
""We estimate annual US adds will ease from a pre-pandemic figure of around 8m in 2019 to an average of 2.3m over the next four years. Meanwhile, we expect international to pick up to average 3.2m adds from around 2m in 2019. Overall, we see global adds averaging 5.5m for the next four years (with 8m in 2022, declining thereafter), meaningfully below consensus of 10.5m million,"" concluded Faber."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Wednesday, as markets absorbed  a strong-looking report on private-sector hiring that did little to calm nerves about the pace of monetary policy tightening this year.
Payrolls processor ADP reported that private-sector companies added another 806,000 jobs in the month through mid-December, with little sign of an impact from the latest seasonal wave of Covid-19 infections. That was the strongest monthly rise since May and bodes well for the official labor market report on Friday - even if the two reports have diverged since the start of the pandemic. 
""It looks as though December survey week fell in something of a sweet spot, after the Delta wave faded but before the Omicron surge began,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients. Shepherdson thinks the overall nonfarm payrolls number for December will top 1 million, rather than the 424,000 consensus forecast.
Tightness in the labor market was also in evidence in the less-closely watched Markit Services PMI, where the subindex for input costs hit a new record high. Labor is typically the biggest input cost of many services businesses.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was effectively flat, losing a mere 5 points to 36,795 points. The S&P 500 was down more clearly, by 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite, which has underperformed as rising bond yields put pressure on 'long-duration' tech stocks, was down another 0.6%.
At 2 PM ET (1900 GMT), the Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its December policy meeting, when it decided to speed up the winding down of its bond buying program and set a course for interest rate increases this year.
Concerns about tech valuations were evident in declines in Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock after UBS downgraded both to 'neutral', saying that business software growth is slowing. Salesforce traded at 135 times 2020 earnings as of Tuesday's close, while Adobe traded at a multiple of 55 times. 
Going in the other direction was Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock, one of last year's fallen angels, after brokerage Piper Sandler predicted a robust rebound for the stock in 2022. Pinterest stock rose 2.1%.
 Beyond Meat Inc  (NASDAQ:BYND) stock was another early gainer, rising 5.3% after KFC owner Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) said it would offer Beyond Meat chicken products in KFC restaurants. 
Elsewhere, Uranium Energy (NYSE:UEC) rose 9.5% as civil unrest in Kazakhstan, one of the world's biggest uranium exporters, cast doubt over the stability of operations at key facilities there. Workers have also gone on strike at Kazakhstan's biggest onshore oilfield at Tengiz, operated by an affiliate of  Chevron  . Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stock shrugged off the developments, however, rising 1.6% as crude prices rose in response to other signs that OPEC will again not deliver on its promised output increase in February."

A spokesperson for BMW said the company could not comment on an ongoing case. 
According to the Munich court, damages to BMW amounted to 2.7 million euros ($3.06 million).

Meta said last month it had lodged an appeal against the decision by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to block its 2020 acquisition of Giphy. 
It was the first time the British regulator had blocked a major digital acquisition, and it signalled a step change in its scrutiny of ""big tech"" companies.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal on Wednesday published a summary of Meta's application, outlining its challenge on six grounds.
The U.S company, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), said the CMA had failed to assess its offer to ensure Giphy could continue to provide services to competitors like Snapchat and TikTok on the same terms.

The regulator's decision was also procedurally flawed, Meta said.
The CMA ordered Meta to sell Giphy, which it acquired for a reported $400 million in May 2020, in November after it decided the remedies offered by the U.S. company did not answer its concerns.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 07:46AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Walmart arm did not deliberately remove Xinjiang goods, China exec tells analysts","BEIJING (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc arm Sam's Club, responding to the furore in China over what local media said was its deliberate removal of Xinjiang-sourced products from its app, denied the move in a call with analysts and termed it ""a misunderstanding"".
Chinese social media users and local news outlets criticised Sam's Club, a members only warehouse club that offers products and services, last week for the removal of the products from its domestic online stores. China's anti-graft agency accused the U.S. retailer and Sam's Club of ""stupidity and short-sightedness"" over the matter. 
A Sam's Club representative told local analysts in a call organised by a domestic securities firm last week that Chinese consumers failed to find products from Xinjiang because the app does not support searches for products based on names of places. 
The call, a full recording of which was shared with Reuters by a participant, introduced the representative as Sam's Club regional e-commerce leader surnamed Zhang. 
""This matter is a misunderstanding,"" Zhang said on the call.
""We didn't defend ourselves, because, there is no reason to be afraid of things we haven't done,"" Zhang added. A second participant corroborated Zhang's comments made on the call, which also talked about Sam's Club's plans in China. 
Walmart did not respond to a request for comment. Neither Walmart nor Sam's Club has commented publicly so far on the backlash against them in China and Zhang did not comment on the situation at Walmart, which was also accused of removing products from the far western Chinese region, from both its offline stores and app.
The controversy, which prompted a wave of Sam's Club shoppers in China to cancel their memberships, underscores the tightrope foreign companies walk in China as they balance geopolitical tensions between China and the west with China's importance as a market and supply base.
Xinjiang has become a growing point of conflict between Western governments and China, as U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps there.
China has rejected accusations of forced labour or any other abuses in Xinjiang, describing the camps as vocational centres designed to combat extremism, and in late 2019 said all people in the camps had ""graduated"".
MEMBERSHIPS CANCELLED
Besides Walmart, Swedish fashion retailer H&M and U.S. chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have come under fire in China in recent months for making adjustments to their businesses over Xinjiang. In contrast, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was criticised by U.S. rights groups for opening a showroom in Xinjiang on Dec. 31. 
Chinese social media users turned against Sam's Club shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation on Dec. 23 banning imports from Xinjiang over concerns about forced labour.
Zhang said that Sam's Club, which has 4.4 million members in China, saw around 500 shoppers cancel their membership cards in its central region. He did not give a nationwide number.
""It has negative impact on our membership base, but time will prove everything in the future,"" he said.

""We think the potential in China is very big."" 
China is a huge market for Walmart, generating revenue of $11.43 billion during the company's fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. Of 423 retail units Walmart operates in China, 36 are Sam's Club stores, according to its website.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 07:41AM ET</span>",Stellantis' Chrysler brand to go all electric by 2028 -executive,"By Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - Automaker Stellantis' Chrysler brand said on Wednesday it plans to shift to an all-electric lineup by 2028 and introduce new products, including a utility vehicle, as it moves forward, the North American brand's chief executive said.
Chrysler is scheduled to show the Airflow concept vehicle at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, offering a view into the brand's design direction as it looks to remake itself and boost sales, Chris Feuell said in an interview. The plan is for the brand to offer its first EV by 2025 and add additional electric vehicles as it shifts from a lineup with gasoline-powered engines.
""We are completely transforming the portfolio for Chrysler between 2025 and 2028, and beyond,"" Feuell said in an interview. 
Chrysler first used the Airflow name on a sleek, streamlined sedan in the mid-1930s. 
Stellantis said last July it planned to invest more than 30 billion euros ($33.87 billion) through 2025 on electrifying its vehicle lineup. Alfa Romeo is scheduled to be the first Stellantis brand in North America to be all electric in 2027. 
The company, formed in January 2021 from the merger of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, said it is targeting more than 70% of sales in Europe and over 40% in the United States to be low-emission vehicles - either battery or hybrid electric - by 2030. 
It previously said all 14 of its vehicle brands, including Chrysler, would offer fully electrified vehicles. 
The automaker has said its EVs will be built on four electric platforms and have driving ranges of 500 to 800 km (300 to 500 miles) on a single charge. Most new Chrysler vehicles will be built on the large EV platform, Feuell said.
Last May, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said each of the company's brands would receive funding over the next 10 years to prove themselves.
Feuell, who joined the automaker last September, declined to say how much investment the Chrysler brand will receive, but said the lineup will expand beyond the 300 sedan and Pacifica minivan. 
Chrysler sold over 115,000 vehicles last year in the United States, mostly the 300 and Pacifica. That was a far cry from the almost 650,000 vehicles sold in 2005, when the lineup also included the Crossfire sports car, PT Cruiser compact car and Sebring car.
According to research firm AutoForecast Solutions, Chrysler will end production of the 300 sedan in December 2023 and begin production of a utility it has listed as the Airflow in July 2024 at its Belvidere, Illinois, plant. Chrysler has not confirmed those plans.
And the existing models will get remakes meant to improve the consumer experience, including new seating configurations and integration of such technology as over-the-air software updates and artificial intelligence-based applications like navigation, voice assistance, e-commerce and payment services, Feuell said. Customization will be a key element.

""Chrysler hasn't been a brand that's been invested in over the last 10 years,"" she said. ""Part of restoring and revitalizing the brand is about product but it's about the customer experience as well.""

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) 5,200 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) 5,100 
Morgan Stanley: ""While earnings for the overall index remain durable, there will be greater dispersion of winners and losers and growth rates will slow materially... 2022 will be more about stocks than sectors or styles, in our view.""
Wells Fargo: ""Persistent supply shortages and inflation pressures lead us to adjust the magnitudes of some 2022 targets, but we believe the global economy should still mark an above-average pace next year. More importantly, our tactical preferences for the next 6 to 18 months are nearly all unchanged."" 
Goldman Sachs: ""Decelerating economic growth, a tightening Fed, and rising real yields suggest investors should expect modestly below-average returns next year.""
""In contrast with our expectation during the past year, corporate tax rates will likely remain unchanged in 2022 and rise in 2023. Corporate earnings will grow and lift share prices. The equity bull market will continue."" RBC: ""We continue to see 2022 as a solid year for the U.S. equity market, but with more moderate gains than we've experienced in 2021.""
""While we remain vigilant on margins, we don't think it makes sense to assume the worst on this front given the strong track record that companies have had managing through cost pressures even before the pandemic.""

Credit Suisse: ""This constructive outlook is based on robust projections for economic growth in both real and nominal terms, further margin upside in cyclical groups, a pickup in buybacks and a favorable discount rate despite Fed tightening.""
Citigroup: ""Earnings-related target setting inputs justify the new target. Thus, we remain moderately constructive on the broader market outlook, while acknowledging valuation headwinds as the Fed moves down a more hawkish path.""

Investing.com –  Pfizer  stock  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech stock (NASDAQ:BNTX) were up 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively, in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the two companies said they will work together to develop an mRNA-based vaccine against shingles.
While there are vaccines for shingles, a debilitating and painful disease, the two companies aim to make an improved one that shows higher efficacy and better tolerability, and is more efficient to produce globally.
Product candidates will be based on Pfizer’s antigen technology and on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology used in the companies’ highly successful Covid-19 vaccine, according to a joint release by the companies.
Clinical trials are expected to start in the second half of 2022, the release said.
Under the agreement, Pfizer will pay BioNTech $225 million upfront, including $75 million in cash and an equity investment of $150 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $200 million. BioNTech will pay Pfizer $25 million for the company’s proprietary antigen technology.
Shingles affects about one in three people in the U.S. during their lifetime. It is a chronic form of the varicella zoster virus which causes an initial chickenpox infection. Even after being treated, the chickenpox virus can remain dormant in human nerve cells and re-activate later, due to stress or a compromised immune system.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Wednesday, stabilizing just below record levels ahead of the release of the keenly-awaited minutes of the December Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 5 points, or less than 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or less than 0.1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 50 points, or 0.3%.
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed over 200 points, or 0.6%, higher on Tuesday, while Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3% as higher U.S. Treasury yields prompted a rotation out of growth-sensitive stocks, such as tech firms, into ones that offer income, such as financials.
The move by the Federal Reserve, at its December meeting, to accelerate the winding up of its bond-buying program, coupled with strong economic data since, has led investors to look for the central bank to begin hiking interest rates earlier this year.
Fed Funds futures suggest interest rates will start rising by May, but investors will look to the release of the minutes of the December Fed meeting for further clues to the central bank’s timetable for rate hikes.

PARIS (Reuters) -A French court ruled on Wednesday that families of victims of Depakine, an epilepsy drug that caused birth defects and learning difficulties when taken during pregnancy, could join a class action lawsuit against drugmaker  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY).
Sanofi said it would appeal against the decision. 
""This is a great victory. This decision acknowledges the responsibility of the laboratory,"" Marine Martin, head of victims association APESAC, told Reuters.
APESAC, which represents 7,500 families, launched the class action in September 2021 against Sanofi, which was placed under formal investigation in 2020 on charges of manslaughter over Depakine https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sanofi-depakine-idUSKBN24Z14C.
Sanofi denied those charges at the time and said it would challenge the merits of the investigation.
It said on Wednesday the decision of the court, the Tribunal Judiciaire de Paris, contradicted previous ones in this case. 
""The laboratory will appeal this decision. It is partly based on questionable conclusions of an expert's report submitted during the criminal proceedings,"" the drugmaker said in a statement.
French health authorities have estimated Depakine was responsible for deformities in between 2,150 and 4,100 children and neuro-developmental defects in up to 30,400 children.

The class action would be a first in France's health sector. APESAC has said families could obtain hundreds of millions of euros in compensation.
Sanofi's shares were up 0.67% at 88.66 euros at 1130 GMT, compared with a 0.5% rise on France's benchmark CAC 40.

LONDON (Reuters) -Tesco, Britain's biggest supermarket group, outperformed its major rivals over Christmas, achieving its highest grocery market share since January 2018, industry data showed on Wednesday.
Market researcher Kantar said Tesco (OTC:TSCDY)'s grocery sales over the 12 weeks to Dec. 26 fell by 0.9% versus the same period in 2020, when several areas in Britain faced COVID-19 restrictions that boosted food sales. On a two-year basis, Tesco's sales were up 10.1%.
Its UK grocery market share rose 0.6 percentage points to 27.9%, a four-year high.
Rivals Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons saw their sales fall by 4.4%, 3.9% and 6.5% respectively over the 12-week period compared with 2020, though they were up 5.8%, 3.5% and 5.8% respectively on a two-year basis.
Tesco's increasing dominance reflects the unmatched scale of its store and online operations, the success of its ""Clubcard Prices"" loyalty scheme and its ability to withstand supply chain disruption.
In October, Tesco raised its full-year earnings forecast. Some analysts believe it may raise that again when it updates on trading on Jan. 13. Its shares were up 0.9% at 0950 GMT, extending year-on-year gains to 24.7%.
Shares in Sainsbury's, which updates on trading on Jan. 12, were up 1%.
Kantar said total UK grocery sales were 31.7 billion pounds ($42.9 billion) over the 12 week period, down 3% versus 2020 but up 8% on 2019.
""The data suggests that while there weren't formal (COVID-19) rules in place across the UK this year, many people celebrated at home again due to Omicron,"" said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight.
He noted that premium own-label sales broke records this Christmas with shoppers spending 627 million pounds on supermarkets' own upmarket lines over the four weeks to Dec. 26, an increase of 6.8% versus 2020.
Kantar said grocery price inflation reached 3.5% in December, its highest since spring 2020, adding nearly 15 pounds to shoppers' average monthly grocery bills.
It said prices were rising fastest in markets such as fresh beef, savoury snacks and skincare, while falling in fresh bacon, bath and shower products and spirits.
Last month, the Bank of England revised up its inflation forecast to predict consumer price inflation would peak at a 30-year high of around 6% in April.

Investing.com – Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ:BYND) surged 9% in Wednesday’s premarket trading on news that Yum! Brands-owned KFC will be selling the former’s plant-based fried chicken at its U.S. restaurants Monday onward.
Yum! (NYSE:YUM) operates around 4,000 KFC restaurants in the U.S. Its stock is yet to begin trading after closing 0.5% higher Tuesday. It was mostly flat in after-hours trade.
Prices for KFC’s Beyond fried chicken at KFC will start at $6.99 in most places but will vary by location, Reuters said.
In February 2021, Yum! and Beyond announced a global partnership to create plant-based menu items for KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut outlets over ""the next several years.""
Beyond Meat has had a tough time bringing its products to market, with delays marring several of them. Consumers have not adopted faux meat at the pace that some expected them to, in part due to high prices. That has been reflected in a stock price that has declined by more than half in the last year while benchmark indices have made record highs.
The news came on the same day as BofA reiterated its ‘underperform’ on the stock while cutting its price target. Analyst Peter Galbo lowered his target for the stock to $55 from $70, according to various reports. It had closed 5% lower at $61.62 Tuesday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd is likely to post a record fourth-quarter profit thanks to solid demand for server memory chips and higher margins in contract manufacturing, analysts' estimates showed. Operating profit for the world's biggest memory chip and smartphone maker likely hit 15.2 trillion won ($12.7 billion) in the quarter ended December, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate from 14 analysts, weighted toward those who are more consistently accurate. That would be up 68% from 9.05 trillion won a year earlier and narrowly beat the previous Q4 record profit of 15.15 trillion won reported in 2017. 
Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics' shares have climbed about 12% in the last two months in anticipation of higher memory chip prices this year, boosted by new data centres and demand for videos, games, conferencing and other streaming services. 
""Contrary to previous concerns, the semiconductor industry is likely to see demand increase significantly from customers in both memory and non-memory sectors,"" said Jeff Kim, analyst at KB Securities.
""As of December, major data centre companies in North America such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta have steadily increased their memory chip orders ... And Samsung's foundry business appears to have won two years' worth of orders until 2023.""
This view was supported by its peer Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)'s stronger-than-expected earnings results in December and its positive forecast for the following quarter.
Samsung's chip contract manufacturing business, which competes with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), has also seen sharply improved profitability from the previous quarter to reach an operating margin between 10% and 20% due to more deliveries and higher prices, analysts said. 
Samsung's overall Q4 chip profit is likely to reach 9.7 trillion won, more than double the previous year's 3.85 trillion won, according to an average forecast of five analysts. 
The South Korean tech giant will announce preliminary results on Friday.
For Samsung's mobile business, which was recently merged into a single Device Experience (DX) division with TV and home appliances, analysts said shipments likely rose slightly from the previous quarter due to easing component shortages.
The mobile business likely reported an operating profit of about 3 trillion won, up about 24%, according to five analysts' averaged forecasts. 
Market participants will be tuning into Samsung's full results later this month for any updated impact on its Xian NAND flash chip manufacturing facilities, after the company said it would temporarily adjust operations there due to strict COVID-19 curbs in the Chinese city. 

Data firm TrendForce said last week Samsung's Xian plant was manufacturing without significant disruptions for now.

At 0945 GMT, Valneva shares were down 3% at 17.10 euros, meaning the stock has now lost close to 40% since its Dec. 27 close of 26.38 euros.
It did gain more than 200% a year in 2021 and 2020 as Valneva's COVID-19 vaccine candidate came increasingly closer to approval. It is still awaiting a green light for its shot in the European Union and Britain.
""The decline of the share price seems to be mostly driven by retail investors who think that there will be no need of a new vaccination campaign after the Omicron wave"", a Paris-based analyst said.

Companies whose COVID-19 vaccines have already been approved have also seen their shares dip since the start of the year, with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) losing 7.65% over the last two days and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) down 8.2%.

Investing.com – ADRs and stocks of Chinese companies traded weaker as China's cyber regulatory body issued draft rules Wednesday that, if implemented, will mean a heavier compliance burden for apps whose functions are perceived as influencing public opinion.
In an unrelated development, but one which still reflects the tightening of oversight of China’s internet giants, the country’s markets regulator fined units of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) and Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) for failing to properly report about a dozen deals.
The twin developments came at a time when 'long-duration' tech stocks - whose profitability is skewed toward the long tem - are under pressure from the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates. China's tech sector is only partly protected from that process by the fact that its home country's central bank is currently easing monetary policy.
Meituan stock (HK:3690) slumped 11.2% in Hong Kong while Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) shed 4.3%. Alibaba ADRs traded 1.4% lower in premarket.  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and Bilibili were also weaker in premarket, by around 3% each. Didi ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) fell 1.4%.
The public is expected to submit its views on Cyberspace Administration of China’s proposals by January 20.
According to Reuters, proposals suggested by the CAC require application providers to carry out a security assessment before launching ""new technologies, new applications, and new functions"" capable of influencing public opinion.
The regulator added that app providers must not carry out activities that endanger national security, or force users to share unimportant personal information.
News apps must obtain licenses granting permission to publish news, it said.
On Tuesday, CAC issued new rules that tighten regulation of platform companies with over 1 million users before listing overseas. This norm comes into effect next month.
The new rules are in line with a series of steps the Chinese authorities have undertaken over the last year to protect data on their citizens that they are not comfortable sharing with overseas regulators, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission. That concern has resulted in Didi delisting from the NYSE and its various apps having to stop onboarding new customers pending security reviews of their data handling practices."

(Reuters) -The United States reported nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily tally of any country in the world and nearly double the previous U.S. peak set a week ago as the spread of the Omicron variant showed no signs of slowing.
The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients has risen nearly 50% in the past week and now exceeds 100,000, according to data collected by Reuters, marking the first time that threshold has been reached in a year.
The latest surge, which forced waves of cancellations from commercial airlines flights to Broadway shows in recent weeks, was disrupting plans for public schools to welcome students back from winter vacation.
Chicago Public Schools, the nation's third-largest school district, said it would cancel classes on Wednesday after the teachers' union voted in favor of a return to remote learning.
In Los Angeles County, the presiding judge of one of the country's largest court systems ordered a two-week postponement of criminal trials due to the latest wave of infections.
Nationally, the United States https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR has seen a daily average of 486,000 new cases over the past week, a rate that has doubled in seven days and far outstrips that of any other country https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi. 
The 978,856 new infections documented on Monday included some cases tallied on Saturday and Sunday, when many states do not report.
The average number of U.S. COVID-19 deaths has remained fairly steady throughout December and into early January at about 1,300 a day, according to a Reuters tally, though deaths typically lag behind case numbers and hospitalizations.
Omicron appears to be far more easily transmitted than previous iterations of the virus. The new variant was estimated to account for 95.4% of cases identified in the United States as of Jan. 1, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Tuesday. 
The World Health Organization said https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-sees-more-evidence-that-omicron-affects-upper-respiratory-tract-2022-01-04that evidence suggested Omicron is causing less severe illness. Nevertheless, public health officials have warned that the sheer volume of Omicron cases threatens to overwhelm hospitals, some of which are already struggling to handle COVID-19 patients, primarily among the unvaccinated. 
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared a 30-day state of emergency on Tuesday and mobilized 1,000 National Guard members to pandemic response operations as COVID-19 hospitalizations in the state hit a record high of more than 3,000, up more than five-fold in seven weeks, Hogan said.
""The truth is that the next four to six weeks will be the most challenging time of the entire pandemic,"" Hogan told reporters. He said projections show COVID hospitalizations could surpass 5,000, far higher than Maryland's previous peak of 1,952 last year.
Delaware, Illinois, Ohio, Virginia and Washington, D.C., have also reported record numbers of hospitalized COVID patients in recent days.
'UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE SEEN' 
In Kentucky, where Tuesday's total of 6,915 new cases was the highest daily figure since the start of the pandemic, Governor Andy Beshear urged residents to get vaccinated and wear masks.
""Omicron is causing a surge unlike anything we've seen and at this rate our hospitals will fill up,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The unrelenting surge has prompted more than 3,200 schools to close this week, according to the website Burbio, which tracks school disruptions. Schools that have remained open are facing staff shortages and renewed concerns about virus spread.
In Boston, where more than 54,000 students returned to class on Tuesday following the holiday, Superintendent of Schools Brenda Cassellius told reporters there were 1,000 staff members out, including 461 teachers and 52 bus drivers.
""It does make for a difficult start to the day,"" she said.
Rank-and-file members of the Chicago Teachers Union voted 73% in favor of working remotely, after the union's House of Delegates voted 88% in favor of the resolution.
Earlier, the union urged its members to stay out of the classroom and work remotely through Jan. 18, or until the city reaches minimum health-safety thresholds set last year as a condition for in-person learning, whichever comes first.
The union has called for more rigorous COVID-19 safety protocols, including school-based coronavirus testing and mandatory student vaccinations. 
District chief executive officer Pedro Martinez said the school system would agree to further COVID-19 safety measures. But he said classes for Chicago's 340,000 students would be canceled on Wednesday if teachers voted against reporting to work, with no remote instruction being made immediately available.
The union has cited data showing that vaccination rates remained especially low among minority students - with just 7% of Black youngsters and 13% of Latino children aged 5-11 fully inoculated. 
But school officials said hospitalization rates of children are low and that distance learning has hit minority and poor students particularly hard, as many depend on school-based meals and have working parents with fewer childcare options. 

Dr Allison Arwady, Chicago's Public Health Commissioner, joined district officials and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in pressing to keep classrooms open. Arwady cited data showing Chicago averaging just seven pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations a day out of 550,000 children who live in the city.
More than 325,000 COVID-19 cases among children were reported in the United States for the week ending Dec. 30, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association, a new high and almost double the count from the previous two weeks.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in subdued fashion Wednesday, helped by continued recovery confidence but with higher U.S. Treasury yields weighing on the tech sector. 
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, while the CAC 40 in France and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 were largely flat. 
European indexes have started the new year on the front foot, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index climbing to an all-time high as hopes for an early end to the pandemic bring cyclical and value stocks back into vogue.
However, benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields touched a six-week high on Tuesday, five-year rates hit a pandemic-era high, and two-year note yields hit their highest since March 2020 on Monday. That's weighing on tech companies, particularly those whose payoff is further out into the future.  For example, Dutch-listed Prosus (OTC:PROSF) stock fell 3.3%. 
On the data calendar, French consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in December to reach its highest level since September, while the final composite PMI for the Eurozone was revised down slightly to 53.3 in December, from an initial estimate of 53.4.
Elsewhere, Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) stock rose 0.3% after data from market researcher Kantar showed Britain's biggest supermarket group outperformed its major rivals in the key Christmas period, achieving its highest grocery market share since January 2018.
Repsol (OTC:REPYY) stock rose 1.2% after the Spanish energy giant bought shale oil and gas assets from U.S. firm Rockdale Marcellus for $222 million, while Amundi (PA:AMUN) stock rose 0.8% after the French asset management company announced the completion of its acquisition of of Lyxor from Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) creating the second largest ETF business in Europe.
Later Wednesday, investors looking for clues as to when the Federal Reserve will first raise interest rates will study the minutes of the central bank’s meeting last month.
Oil prices stabilized Wednesday as traders digested a mixed report for U.S. petroleum stockpiles at the same time as a group of top producers gradually lifted global output.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed a draw of 6.4 million barrels of crude for the week ended Dec. 31, significantly more than expected, while gasoline inventories rose by a hefty 7.1 million barrels.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.
Earlier Tuesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a group called OPEC+, decided to stick to its plan of increasing output by 400,000 barrels per day in February, suggesting confidence that overall demand wouldn’t be hit too badly by the fresh Covid outbreak.
By 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $76.66 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $79.73. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,817.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1302."

Lauterbach said he’ll propose additional measures that will be discussed at Friday’s talks with regional leaders led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, without providing details. He said his goal is to prevent as many as possible of the millions of Germans yet to get vaccinated from ending up in intensive care.
“My appeal to the unvaccinated is to get at least one shot as soon as possible, so that they at least have effective protection against very serious symptoms,” the Harvard-trained professor of epidemiology told RND.
Germany has so far been spared the rapid increase in Covid infections seen in countries like France, the U.K. and Ireland, though the seven-day incidence rate has started to rise again after falling through most of December.
European officials are trying to tackle the latest outbreak by tightening curbs already in place while avoiding the kind of sweeping lockdowns imposed earlier in the pandemic.
Germany is already in what some officials have termed a “lockdown of the unvaccinated,” with limits on the size of public gatherings and on access to non-essential stores, restaurants and theaters. 
The country is also looking to follow other countries in easing quarantine rules to protect critical infrastructure from staff shortages, Lauterbach said.
“Studies show that the generation time -- including the phase in which the virus spreads in the body and the phase in which a person is contagious -- is much shorter with omicron,” he told RND. “So we can reduce the length of the quarantine period to a certain extent without taking any risks.”
Meanwhile, street protests against the government’s pandemic strategy are intensifying across Germany, with some demonstrations turning violent.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the government respects the right of peaceful demonstration but warned that authorities would crack down on protesters who use violence.
“Only a very small minority are radical and resort to threats and violence,” Faeser said Tuesday in an interview with ARD television. “When people become radical and abusive, then I think a limit has been reached,” she added. “Then the rule of law must be imposed with full force.”

Volvo, which has been heavily impacted by sector-wide supply-chain constraints and semiconductor shortages, warned in November that the chip shortage would continue into 2022.
Global sales at the firm fell to 64,436 cars in December, with sales in Europe dropping 15.1%, while they fell 26.7% in the United States.
""The result was significantly influenced by continued component supply shortages, which affected production and consequently deliveries to customers,"" Volvo said in a statement, adding that demand for its products remained strong.
Sales at the Gothenburg-based company grew 5.6% last year to 698,693 cars, of which 27% were Recharge models with a fully electric or plug-in hybrid powertrain.

Volvo's 2021 full-year outlook is for sales volume and revenue growth with improved profitability to pre-pandemic levels. It is due to post fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 11.
The company, which is majority owned by China's Geely Holding, listed on Nasdaq Stockholm in October after wrapping up Europe's biggest IPO of the year.

1535,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 01:54AM ET</span>",Hong Kong Bans 5 More Flight Routes as Covid Besieges City,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong is rushing to plug holes that have seen the highly infectious omicron Covid-19 variant finally break through the city’s defenses, banning five more individual airline routes -- including ones from Seoul, Vancouver and Delhi -- after discovering infected passengers. 
Embattled flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd., as well as Air India Ltd., Air Canada, Thai Airways International Pcl and Philippines AirAsia have had routes suspended from Jan. 4 to Jan. 17, the government said. That’s the most flights Hong Kong has banned in a day since omicron emerged in November. 
Authorities have suspended two dozen routes in less than six weeks, throwing holiday travel into chaos. Hong Kong, which has been largely virus-free for over seven months, has some of the strictest travel curbs in the world in order to prevent imported infection. But there are fears the city’s low vaccination rate makes it uniquely vulnerable to a new outbreak as omicron arrives.
Infected travelers are being sent to North Lantau Hospital for treatment and isolation, but the facility appears to be reaching capacity already.   
Garry Frenklah, a salesman who tested positive upon return from Australia, said staff told him he was put in a ward with three other Covid patients because there wasn’t enough space. The 54-year-old, who is not showing any symptoms, had asked to at least be put with other asymptomatic patients as he has a compromised immune system. 
Staffing has also been an issue, Frenklah said, with sample collection -- scheduled for 8 a.m. -- more than an hour late, breakfast only provided at 10 a.m., and no doctors available at night. 
The Hospital Authority, which operates public hospitals in Hong Kong, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
“It’s a system that’s been cobbled together in total haste without any consideration or safeguards, and it’s been carried out by people who are genuinely well-meaning and sympathetic but who are just cogs in the wheel,” he said. 
In addition to the individual flight route bans, carriers worldwide are scrapping services to Hong Kong due to the crackdown. 
In the past week, 159 flights into the Asian financial hub have been pulled from this month’s schedules alone, cutting planned inbound flights in January to 872, according to aviation data company Cirium. Smaller cuts have been made to monthly schedules stretching out to at least November, the data show.
Based in Hong Kong, Cathay is bearing the brunt of the government’s strict Covid countermeasures and a Covid Zero strategy that is increasingly strained as omicron spreads around the globe, accounting for the majority of new infections. The airline has had seven routes suspended since Christmas Day, including London, Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
The latest ban is for Cathay’s Seoul services after three passengers tested positive on arrival from the South Korean capital on Jan. 2.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 01:26AM ET</span>",China Huarong halves in value as trading resumes,"HONG KONG (Reuters) -Shares of China Huarong Asset Management Co Ltd plunged as much as 55% in Hong Kong on Wednesday to a record low, after trading resumed following a nine-month hiatus, even as the bad loan company said its restructuring had paved the way for healthy growth.
Huarong, which counts China's finance ministry as its largest shareholder, suffered huge losses and its former chairman was convicted of bribery, leading to a state-backed bailout last year. 
Huarong shares traded as low as HK$0.46 ($0.0590) on Wednesday, more than halving the company's value during its previous trading session on March 31, 2021. 
The price is also the lowest since Huarong's listing in 2015, and represents a nearly 50% discount to the company's net asset value, reflecting investor pessimism. 
In an apparent effort to inject some optimism, Huarong's management said on Wednesday that recent capital injections by strategic investors would breathe new life into the company. 
Huarong has raised 42 billion yuan from investors led by Citic Group in a state-backed restructuring.
Strategic investors have replenished capital and ""laid the ground for sustainable and healthy growth,"" Vice President Wang Wenjie said in a speech that was posted on Huarong's website. ""The company has the ability, and condition, to generate returns for our shareholders."" 
SHARE SUSPENSION 
Huarong, one of four major state-owned distressed-debt managers, halted trading in its shares in April 2021 after missing a March 31 deadline for filing its 2020 earnings.
In August, Huarong announced a nearly $16 billion annual loss for 2020, and in November, it unveiled its restructuring plan.
Huarong said on Wednesday that it had sold shares through private placement to strategic investors at 1.02 yuan apiece, boosting the company's net asset value (NAV) per share by 60% to 0.75 yuan.
The placement price, which is much higher than the NAV, reflects ""investors' optimism toward the company's long-term growth prospectus,"" and is good for small investors, a Huarong official said. 
The company reiterated on Wednesday that it will focus on its core business going forward, and seek synergies with strategic investors. 
Huarong has previously announced a slew of asset divestment deals, including stake sales in its consumer finance, securities and distressed asset exchange businesses, amid a regulatory push to sell non-core assets in its business revamp.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Our Next Energy (ONE), a two-year-old Michigan startup, said on Wednesday it had tested a prototype of its new battery in a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S, driving 752 miles (1,210 kilometers) before recharging.
ONE aims to begin producing battery packs that will deliver similar range — about double that of most existing electric vehicles — by late 2023, according to Mujeeb Ijaz, ONE’s founder and chief executive.
“We plan to build (batteries) in North America, and believe it can be done economically,” Ijaz said in an interview.
ONE has focused on developing an advanced long-range battery that uses safer and more sustainable materials, while packing more energy into a smaller, less expensive package.
Ijaz, a 30-year industry veteran, is a former senior executive at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and A123 Systems, where he led teams developing battery systems for electric vehicles.
For ONE’s Gemini battery, Ijaz said: “We want to eliminate both nickel and cobalt, but we don’t want to give up energy density. We aim to re-invent battery chemistry as well as the cell architecture” in order to provide at least 750 miles of range between charges.
“If you put that much energy on board, you are ready for anything the customer asks – a round trip from Detroit to Chicago, or towing a trailer.”
ONE’s range target is well beyond even the best of current electric vehicles, including the Lucid Air, which offers just over 500 miles of range in the top version.

Ijaz said ONE chose a Tesla Model S to showcase its prototype battery because “it has fairly high efficiency and a fairly large battery pack” which provided enough space to fit ONE’s battery.
The testing was done in a road test across Michigan in late December, at an average speed of 55 miles per hour, ONE said.

(Reuters) - Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp plans to launch a company this spring to examine entering the electric vehicle market, looking to harness its strengths in entertainment and sensors to play a bigger role in next-generation mobility.
The new company, Sony Mobility Inc, comes as the Japanese tech giant is ""exploring a commercial launch"" of electric vehicles, Sony chairman and president Kenichiro Yoshida told a news conference, speaking ahead of the CES technology trade fair in the United States.
""With our imaging and sensing, cloud, 5G and entertainment technologies combined with our contents mastery, we believe Sony is well positioned as a creative entertainment company to redefine mobility,"" he said.
Although its once-dominant position in consumer electronics has been eroded by Asian rivals like South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co, Sony still has an arsenal of sophisticated technology in areas such as sensors critical to autonomous driving.
It also remains one of the world's biggest entertainment companies, home to prominent video game and movie franchises. Audio and entertainment systems are increasingly a focus for next-generation vehicles. 
Shares in Sony jumped 4.2% in Tokyo after the electric vehicle plans were announced, easily outpacing a flat Nikkei index.
Yoshida unveiled a prototype sport utility vehicle (SUV), the VISION-S 02, which uses the same electric vehicle platform as the previously announced VISION-S 01 coupe that began testing on public roads in Europe from December 2020.
He said the company saw mobility as an ""entertainment space"" where passengers could chose individual entertainment options and use 5G internet connection.

Wall Street is betting heavily on electric cars and the global auto industry has been upended by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, now the world's most valuable automaker. Many investors also expect Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to launch its own vehicle within the next few years.
Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp in December committed $70 billion to electrify its automobiles by 2030.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Tuesday it plans to hire more than 3,000 U.S. delivery drivers and build out a fleet of all-electric delivery vans to support its ""in-home"" grocery delivery service, its latest investment in its last-mile fulfillment network.
The retailer, which said it has about 100 drivers at present, expects to be able to reach 30 million homes by the end of the year. It now services 6 million homes.
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart in 2019 launched its InHome delivery service through which workers deliver groceries directly into shoppers’ homes, sometimes placing items straight into kitchens or garage refrigerators when people are not in the house.
The driver uses a one-time access code to unlock the customers' doors or garages through an app that pairs with a ""smart"" entry lock. 
Fearing COVID-19, many shoppers have turned to online grocery delivery since the start of the pandemic, sparking aggressive competition in the industry from the likes of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Whole Foods, Instacart and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.

Walmart has experimented for years with last-mile delivery options. In 2017, for instance, Walmart established a program through which its own store employees would bring online orders directly to shoppers’ homes after completing their usual shifts on sales floors.
In August, ahead of the U.S. holiday shopping season, Walmart launched a last-mile delivery service for other merchants. Last year, it also tested company-branded ""last-mile"" delivery vans, taking a page from Amazon's playbook as online demand pressures  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and the U.S. Postal Service.

Investing.com – China Huarong Asset Management Co. Ltd.’s Hong Kong shares had a hard fall on its first trading day resuming from a nine-month suspension.
The shares dived 52.94% to HK$0.480 ($0.076) by 11:49 PM ET (4:49 AM GMT), a record low since China Huarong debuted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in October 2015.
The company, one of four state-owned bad-asset managers, halted trading in its shares in April 2021 after missing its Mar. 31, 2021 deadline to file its 2020 earnings. After that, it reported in August 2021 a profit of CNY158.3 million ($24.9 million) for the first six months of 2021, compared with a loss of CNY106.274 billion in 2020.
The share trading resumption came after its announcement in November that a recapitalization of CNY42 billion, or $6.6 billion, from a group of state-back investors led by Citic Group. Citic Group is now China Huarong’s second-largest shareholder after China’s Ministry of Finance.
China Huarong said in its announcement that it had fulfilled the requirements to resume shares trading, including the disclosure of all material information on its business, financial performance, and operations.

Meanwhile, some investors were of the view only way from such a hard fall is up.

Hengda Real Estate will hold a meeting online with investors starting Friday as it tries to delay a Jan. 8 put option, it said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange. Two developers meanwhile are delaying dividend payments to hoard cash.
Evergrande shares were little changed a day after trading resumed as the company said it would work with authorities to demolish 39 apartment buildings in Hainan province that were deemed illegal. The demolition is the latest move by local governments to seize some of Evergrande’s prized land assets.
Key Developments:
Chinese Developers Delay Dividends Amid Payment Pressure (11:20 a.m. HK)
Two Chinese real estate firms are delaying interim dividend payments by months, the latest step by companies in a sector facing mounting bills and limited fundraising options.
Zhongliang Holdings Group Co. and DaFa Properties Group Ltd. both said in Hong Kong stock exchange filings dated Tuesday that the payments were being pushed back to preserve cash. 
 
Condemned Towers on China’s Hawaii Show New Threat (11:15 a.m. HK)
The wrecking ball headed for 39 apartment blocks on a tropical island at the southern tip of China poses the latest threat for Evergrande as local governments race to reclaim land ahead of a looming restructuring of the embattled developer.
The government of Danzhou, a city in the province of Hainan, has asked Evergrande to tear down what it says are illegal buildings within 10 days. The order was signed Dec. 30, meaning the company could start demolition work on the near-complete condos by Jan. 9.
The Hainan order is among the most extreme in a spate of government actions to seize Evergande’s property and land holdings, underscoring risks to its most-prized assets as the firm prepares for what could be the largest restructuring ever in China. In recent months, at least 11 land parcels have been targeted for confiscation by local authorities for reasons ranging from idle projects to missing fee payments. 
Evergrande Unit Proposes Delaying Yuan Bond Repayment (11:10 a.m. HK)
China Evergrande Group’s onshore unit will hold a meeting for holders of one of its local yuan-denominated bonds, as it seeks to delay an option for investors to demand early repayment.
Hengda Real Estate will hold the meeting online Jan. 7-10, it said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange. The bond concerned is its 4.5 billion yuan ($706 million) 6.98% security due 2023, which has a Jan. 8 put option. The company is proposing to change that option date as well as an interest payment also due that day this year to July 8.
The note will be suspended from trading from Jan. 6. Bondholders will review the company plan for the changes and the adjustment wouldn’t trigger default, according to the statement. 
Huarong to Resume Trading After a $6.6 Billion Bailout (8:15 a.m. HK)
China Huarong is set to resume trading in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning after the troubled financial giant raised $6.6 billion in a state-orchestrated rescue that brought it back from the brink of a crisis. 
The Beijing-based distressed asset manager applied to resume trading as it fulfills share resumption guidance, according to a statement filed with the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company said it has taken measures to return to its core business, simplify its structure, reduce capital consumption and increase returns.
China Huarong reported profit of 1.62 billion yuan ($255 million) in the first six months of 2021, which compares with a loss of about 106.3 billion a year earlier. Chairman Wang Zhanfeng is expected to hold a press briefing on Wednesday.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. high performance chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp said Tuesday it has landed more deals with Chinese electric vehicle makers that want to use the company's technology to power software-driven features that could lure customers away from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Nvidia vice president Ali Kani used a presentation to the CES technology conference to list several Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers that will use Nvidia's DRIVE technology as part of the computer brains of new vehicles, including Polestar, Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), NIO, IM Motors, Li Auto and R Auto. 
Nvidia said auto suppliers and contract manufacturers Desay, Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX), Quanta,  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and ZF also will use its Drive platform as the foundation for automated driving systems in vehicles they engineer for EV brands.
Nvidia has said previously that is has $8 billion in automotive revenue booked over the next six years. Tuesday's presentation underscored the importance of China's dynamic EV sector to the U.S. chip company's effort to expand its automotive business, now a small part of its total annual revenue, projected at more than $26 billion.
Nvidia is also looking for growth in the emerging automated truck business, and earlier Tuesday said robo-truck developer TuSimple will use Nvidia chips to develop self-driving semi trucks.
Nvidia must navigate through U.S.-China tensions, and Chinese regulations that effectively prohibit data generated by vehicles in China from being exported. Nvidia uses Chinese partners and Chinese data centers to assure data used to train the artificial intelligence in cars stays in China, said Danny Shapiro, Nvidia's vice president for automotive.

Automakers new and old are racing to match the software-powered features pioneered by Tesla, which can change the way vehicles perform, the range of the battery or the level of self-driving capability via over-the-air updates. 
High-powered on-board computers are essential to what the industry calls ""software driven vehicles."" That is creating new markets for companies such as Nvidia, whose core business is designing powerful chips for data processing centers and videogame equipment.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Wednesday morning, with investors awaiting the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest meeting for clues on the central bank’s interest rate hike moves.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.05% by 9:04 PM ET (2:04 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.32%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.26% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1%.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.67% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.55%, after their worst New Year debut since 2019 on Tuesday. An index of Chinese companies trading in New York also fell the most in more than two weeks.
U.S. Treasuries steadied after yields rose for a second day over increasing bets that the Fed will hike interest rates at least three times beginning in May 2022. Yields on long maturities rose due to a cascade of new corporate bonds following a year-end pause.
Investors now await the minutes from the Fed’s meeting in December, due later in the day, and the U.S. jobs report, due to be released on Friday, for clues on the Fed’s potential pace of the hikes. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he supports two rate increases in 2022 to curb high inflation.
“Earlier we thought that rate hikes wouldn’t be on the table until mid-2022 but the Fed seems to have worked up a consensus to taper assets faster and hike sooner rather than later,” Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) head of global G-10 FX research Steve Englander said in a note.
“But we don’t think inflation dynamics will support continued hiking. We suspect the biggest driver of asset markets will be when inflation and COVID-19 fears begin to ebb,” the note added.
Comments from more Fed officials are due throughout the week, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speaking at an event on Thursday and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly speaking on a separate panel a day later.

1545,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 08:27PM ET</span>",China Huarong Falls 40% as Trading Resumes After 9-Month Halt,"(Bloomberg) -- China Huarong Asset Management Co. slumped 40% in Hong Kong as a nine-month trading suspension was lifted following a $6.6 billion state-orchestrated bailout of the troubled bad asset manager.
The Beijing-based firm slid HK$0.41 to HK$0.61 as trading opened in Hong Kong.
The company said late Tuesday that it had taken measures to return to its core business, simplify its structure, reduce capital consumption and increase returns. It reported a profit of 1.62 billion yuan ($255 million) in the first six months of 2021, compared with a loss of about 106.3 billion yuan in all of 2020.
Huarong last week completed a recapitalization of 42 billion yuan from a group of state-back investors led by Citic Group, and has also embarked on disposals of none-core assets to pare back its sprawling empire. After roiling Asian credit markets with a delay in earnings and a record loss, Huarong proved to be too big to fail for Chinese authorities at a time of slowing economic growth and rising debt defaults.
Citic Group is now Huarong’s second-largest shareholder after the Ministry of Finance, while China Insurance Rongxin Fund is the third-biggest.
Huarong is holding a media briefing Wednesday morning with some of its strategic investors.
Hong Kong-traded shares of Huarong have been suspended since the beginning of April, when the company spooked the market with a delay in announcing its 2020 financial results, sending its dollar bonds to record lows. The bonds have mostly recovered.
Huarong is now seeking buyers for its banking, financial leasing and securities units. The firm last month agreed to transfer a 70% stake in Huarong Consumer Finance to Bank of Ningbo Co. for about 1 billion yuan.
“The valuation achieved by the disposals will determine its capital buffer relative to the minimum regulatory requirement and will be key in absorbing losses,” Fitch Ratings said in a report last month. “We believe near-term asset risk at its core business and leverage will stay elevated due to its weak asset quality and business nature.” 
Together with China Cinda Asset Management Co., China Great Wall Asset Management Co. and China Orient Asset Management Co., the company was created to buy bad loans from banks in the aftermath of the late 1990s Asian financial crisis, when decades of government-directed lending to state companies had left China’s biggest lenders on the brink of insolvency.
The bad-debt firms later expanded beyond their original mandate, creating a maze of subsidiaries to engage in other financial businesses and borrow billions from the bond market. Huarong was the most aggressive of the four under former Chairman Lai Xiaomin, who was executed in January last year for crimes including bribery.

(Reuters) - Bloomberg Media Chief Executive Officer Justin Smith and New York Times media columnist Ben Smith are departing their respective news organizations to start a new media firm, the two confirmed on Tuesday.
Ben Smith will be the editor in chief of the as yet unnamed venture, which will build a newsroom and target ""200 million people with college degrees, who read in English, who nobody is really thinking of as an audience,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.
While at the Times, Smith said, he felt that many readers are “in some ways alienated from the way news is done now, who maybe feel that they’re being talked down to or that what they’re reading is kind of in a feedback loop with social media.” 
They want news that “treats them with respect.” 
The two Smiths are not related. Their plans came together over the last ""month or two,"" Ben Smith said.
Ben Smith - who was editor-in-chief of Buzzfeed and a reporter at Politico prior to joining the Times in 2020 - declined to provide details on funding for the new venture, or the size of the newsroom he and his partner plan to build.
The New York Times first reported the news of Ben Smith's departure and plans earlier on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news of Justin Smith's departure and plans. 
In a tweet on Tuesday, Justin Smith wrote: ""After 8 years at Bloomberg Media, and more than 25 years in quality journalism, I’ve decided to pursue a personal dream, and a market opportunity, to launch a new kind of global news media company that serves unbiased journalism to a truly global audience.""
In the wake of Justin Smith's departure from Bloomberg Media, the CEO role will be taken on by Scott Havens, Bloomberg Media's chief growth officer, the Journal reported, citing a statement from Michael Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg L.P. 
Justin Smith, who moved to Bloomberg from Atlantic Media in 2013, will remain at Bloomberg as an adviser in the coming months to assist with the transition, the Journal added. 

Justin Smith and Bloomberg Media did not respond to requests for comment. 
Bloomberg Media competes with Reuters, the news division of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp, in supplying news to media outlets.

1548,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 07:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive-U.S. carrier Allegiant Air to buy 50 Boeing 737 MAX jets -sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -Allegiant Air is poised to order 50 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets worth $5 billion at list prices, people familiar with the matter said, rejecting offers by traditional supplier Airbus as the no-frills carrier seeks to capture a boom in post-pandemic U.S. tourism.
The surprise deal stems a series of setbacks for  Boeing Co  and overturns the airline's previous strategy of picking up second-hand jets at bargain prices, which had helped it accumulate over 100 jets built by Boeing's European rival.
The switch of suppliers is the third such airline defection in as many weeks, this time working in Boeing's favor after the U.S. planemaker lost hard-fought medium-haul contests to Airbus at Dutch KLM https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-wins-dominant-share-air-france-klm-jet-purchase-sources-2021-12-16 and Australia's Qantas https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-wins-order-renew-qantas-fleet-sources-2021-12-15.
Such ""flips"" are rare due to the cost of retraining pilots, but reflect fierce competition for new business as the aerospace industry seeks to recover from its worst-ever recession.
Boeing, Airbus and Allegiant Air, a unit of Allegiant Travel Co, all declined to comment. 
The deal is the latest sign of accelerated growth among ""ultra-low-cost"" carriers that combine rock-bottom fares with optional charges. Carriers like these are expected to emerge in a position of relative strength from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The leisure market is coming back in droves relative to the business market,"" said one of the people familiar with Allegiant's plans. 
ORDER RACE
The Las Vegas-based carrier operates a total of 122 A319 or A320 jets, only 13 of which were ordered directly from Airbus, according to European data.
The 737 MAX planes will help Allegiant's growth strategy and replace aging aircraft over the coming years, though it will continue to be an Airbus operator.
The order comes after a contest waged at least partially between the 737 MAX 7 and the Airbus A220, two of the people said, though some larger 8200 variants may also be involved.
""This is huge. Allegiant was in line to order the A220,"" Leeham Co analyst Scott Hamilton said, adding that the outcome suggested Allegiant had received a ""screaming deal"" from Boeing as well as the ability to get deliveries more quickly.
The new Boeing planes would replace retired jets and feed Allegiant's growth plans over the coming years. 
Mexico's Viva Aerobus in December announced a commercial alliance with Allegiant to offer flights between the United States and Mexico.
The deal, which is likely to be counted in December's orders for Boeing, caps a tight annual order race with Airbus.

Boeing bounced back from a safety crisis to sell some 700 MAX through end-November, only to lose two of the industry's most widely watched contests to rival Airbus at Qantas and various subsidiaries of Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM.
Both planemakers are due to publish 2021 data next week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Japanese automaker  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp outsold General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in the United States in 2021, marking the first time the Detroit automaker has not led U.S. auto sales for a full year since 1931.
Toyota sold 2.332 million vehicles in the United States in 2021, compared with 2.218 million for General Motors, the automakers said on Tuesday. 
GM's U.S. sales were down 13% for 2021 - and down 43% in the fourth quarter - while Toyota was up 10% for the year. GM last had lower sales in 2010 at 2.202 million.
For all of 2020, GM's U.S. sales totaled 2.55 million, compared with Toyota's 2.11 million and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's 2.04 million.
Last year was marred by a shortage of semiconductors used heavily in vehicles, forcing automakers to focus on their most profitable models.
GM said on Tuesday it expects U.S. economic growth will boost U.S. total light-duty vehicle industry sales from around 15 million in 2021 to around 16 million in 2022.
GM has been the largest seller of vehicles in the United States since 1931, when it surpassed Ford, according to data from industry publication Automotive News. 
Toyota is not boasting about the accomplishment. Senior Vice President Jack Hollis said the automaker is ""grateful"" for its loyal customers, but ""being No. 1 is never a focus or priority.""
The Japanese automaker does not see it as sustainable that it can retain its U.S. sales lead and had no plans to use the 2021 accomplishment in any kind of advertising, he added. Toyota had been credited by analysts for weathering the chip shortage better than other automakers.
GM spokesman Jim Cain said the Detroit automaker had a very strong sales year in the United States in full-size SUVs and pickup trucks as it has focused on profitability, and as the supply of semiconductors improves, so will sales.
""I wouldn't rush out if I were (Toyota), and get a 'We're No. 1' tattoo,"" he said.
GM under Chief Executive Mary Barra also has emphasized profitability over volume, abandoning such money-losing markets as Europe and Russia. 
BULLISH ON 2022
For the entire industry, sales finished 2021 at just under 15 million vehicles, according to Wards Intelligence, with the annual sales rate in the month of December finishing at 12.44 million. The full-year number was well below the five-year average of 17.3 million from 2015-2019.
IHS Markit forecasts U.S. sales are expected to reach nearly 15.5 million in 2022. Toyota sees industry sales jumping to 16.5 million this year, with demand even higher if the industry can boost production further, with its own sales topping 2.4 million.

""If you would have asked me to predict how the year was going to go at the beginning of (last) January, I would have gotten it all wrong because this whole microchip shortage just came out of left field and it wreaked a lot of havoc,"" Hyundai Motor America sales chief Randy Parker said in an interview. ""But at the same time, it sharpened our skill set.""
""I'm very bullish on 2022,"" he added. Hyundai's U.S. sales last year rose 19% to more than 738,000 vehicles, including a record number on the retail side.

The U.S. central bank said last month it would end its pandemic-era bond buying in 2022, signaling at least three interest rate hikes for the year. Minutes from the meeting are expected to be released on Wednesday.

(Reuters) -Nevada has agreed to back a proposed nationwide settlement worth up to $26 billion resolving lawsuits against three large drug distributors and the drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) over the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic, the state's attorney general said on Tuesday.
Nevada was among a handful of states that until now was not participating in the landmark agreements to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits against J&J, McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH).
The settlement's backers had agreed to extend to Jan. 26 a deadline for cities and counties in states that backed the proposal to opt-in to the settlements, citing the potential for more states to join.
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said he was optimistic the state's local governments would join the settlements, allowing Nevada to receive more than $285 million.
""There is no question that the opioid epidemic has devastated Nevada and money is needed now to address comprehensive statewide remediation,"" he said in a statement.
J&J said it agreed to a $63 million settlement with Nevada consistent with its proposal to pay up to $5 billion to resolve cases against it nationally.
AmerisourceBergen and McKesson declined to comment. Cardinal Health did not respond to requests for comment.
More than 3,300 lawsuits largely by state and local governments are pending seeking to hold those and other companies responsible for an opioid abuse crisis that led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over two decades.
The companies deny wrongdoing.

The distributors said in September that 42 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., had agreed to participate in their $21 billion settlement. A similar number backed J&J's proposal.
The extent state and local governments participate will shape how much the companies ultimately must pay and how much outstanding litigation they face. New Mexico, another holdout state, on Dec. 7 signed on.

Norton joined Wells in June of 2018, just months after the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an unprecedented asset cap on the bank and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a sweeping consent order related to Wells' sales of mortgage and auto-insurance products.
Norton, who joined from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), took on the job of overhauling the bank's risk management framework at a time when it was still facing costs and restrictions from its years-old sales practice scandals.
""Under (Norton's) leadership, we have made tremendous progress, and our risk organization is completely different from what existed when she arrived,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Chief Executive Charlie Scharff wrote in a memo to staff on Tuesday. 
""Mandy has strengthened all areas of risk management – financial and non-financial – and enabled heightened oversight of our lines of business, with Chief Risk Officers aligned to each one,"" Scharff wrote.
Wells Fargo has frequently struggled over the past four years to satisfy regulators that it has adequately remediated customers harmed by its various product mis-selling scandals. 
In 2019, the OCC, for example, took the unusual step of saying publicly it was “disappointed” by the bank’s efforts to make risk management fixes and repay customers to whom it had improperly sold mortgages and auto insurance as required by its consent order with the regulator. Last year, the OCC fined https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/wealth/banking-regulator-fines-wells-fargo-250-mln-over-remediation-shortcomings-2021-09-09 Wells Fargo $250 for failing to meet the requirements of that order.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest U.S. Muslim advocacy organization, said Tesla was ""supporting genocide"". Similar criticism came from a U.S. trade group, the Alliance for American Manufacturing, and U.S. senator Marco Rubio. 
""Elon Musk must close Tesla’s Xinjiang showroom,"" the Council on American-Islamic Relations said on its official Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account, referring to Tesla's founder. 
Xinjiang has become a significant point of conflict between Western governments and China in recent years. U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps there.
U.S. President Joe Biden and members of the U.S. Congress have stepped up pressure on companies to distance themselves from Xinjiang. On Dec. 23, Biden signed a bill barring imports of goods made in the region. 
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she would not comment directly on Tesla’s action, but generally the “private sector should oppose the PRC human rights abuses and genocide in Xinjiang.
“The international community, including the public and private sectors, cannot look the other way when it comes to what is taking place in Xinjiang."" 
The United States has labeled China's treatment of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang as genocide. The United States and a few other countries plan a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February over the issue. 
China has rejected accusations of forced labour or any other abuses there, saying that the camps provide vocational training and that companies should respect its policies.
Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, announced on Dec. 31 that it was opening a showroom in Xinjiang's regional capital, Urumqi. ""On the last day of 2021 we meet in Xinjiang,"" Tesla said in a post on its official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account.
Other U.S. and European automakers or their Chinese partners have showrooms in Urumqi, a city of some 3 million people. German automaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) has a car factory near Urumqi. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. The carmaker operates a factory in Shanghai and is ramping up production there amid surging sales in China. China has also become an export hub for Teslas headed to Europe and other markets.
Musk last year had to smooth over relations with Chinese authorities after Teslas were banned from government properties because of concerns that data collected by the vehicles' cameras was being transferred out of China.
CHINA'S CONSUMER POWER
A slew of foreign firms in recent months have been tripped up by tensions between the West and China over Xinjiang, as they try to balance Western pressure with China's importance as a market and supply base.
""There is this tension between global investors and the Chinese government. The global investors want market access. And the Chinese government says the cost of access is acquiescence,"" said Michael Dunne, chief executive of Zo Zo Go, an investment advisor that works with automotive and technology companies doing business in China.
In July, Swedish fashion retailer H&M reported a 23% drop in local currency sales in China for its March-May quarter after it was hit by a consumer boycott in March for stating publicly that it did not source products from Xinjiang.

Last month, U.S. chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) faced similar calls after telling its suppliers not to source products or labour from Xinjiang, prompting it to apologise for ""the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public"". 
Although some have been trying to reduce their supply chain exposure to the region, especially as Washington bans imports such as Xinjiang cotton and blacklists Chinese companies that it says have aided Beijing's policy there, many foreign brands operate stores there.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit against AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and other companies over allegations their contracts with Iraq's health ministry helped fund terrorism that killed Americans during the war in Iraq.
The plaintiffs contend that the militia group Jaysh al-Mahdi, sponsored by Hezbollah, controlled Iraq's health ministry and that the 21 defendant U.S. and European medical equipment and pharmaceutical companies made corrupt payments to obtain medical-supply contracts.
Representatives from the five corporate groups - AstraZeneca, GE Healthcare USA Holding, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Pfizer and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc said in a joint statement ""further proceedings will show the companies are not responsible in any way.""
The lawsuit revived by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was brought by family members of victims of attacks in Iraq by the Mahdi group. A federal trial judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2020.
Lawyer Kannon Shanmugam, who argued the appeal on behalf of the companies, did not immediately comment.
The lawyer for the family members, Joshua Branson, also did not immediately comment.

Lawyers for the companies told the appeals court that they provided the Iraqi government ""life-saving breast cancer treatments, hemophilia injections, ultrasounds, electrocardiogram machines, and other medical goods"" after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq toppled strongman president Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Shanmugam said in court in September that a ruling against the companies ""would have a severe chilling effect on the willingness of companies and non-governmental organizations to conduct essential activities, often at the government's request, in troubled regions.""

The U.S. company raised its holding by 99.3% to 602,060 sponsored American Depository Shares as of Dec. 31, Daily Journal said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday, making the stake worth about $72 million as of Jan. 4. 
Munger, 98, has long been bullish on China. The vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) had previously praised the country's crackdown on Jack Ma's Ant Group, the fintech giant whose record $37 billion IPO was derailed by regulators in November 2020.
China's technology giants have come under heavy regulatory pressures and are grappling with major fines, with Alibaba paying $2.75 billion for anti-monopoly violations.

Amid an onslaught of competition in the e-commerce space, a slowing economy and a regulatory crackdown, Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares had in 2021 lost more than 48% of their value.
On Tuesday, the shares pared losses and closed down 0.7% at $119.56.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc's stock market value peaked on Tuesday for a second day above a $3 trillion, but the iPhone maker's shares again failed hold that gain by the session's end.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended down 1.3% at $179.70, leaving its market capitalization at $2.95 trillion.
On Monday, Apple's stock market value rose briefly above $3 trillion for the first time ever, and it repeated that again on Tuesday before losing ground. The world's most valuable company has yet to end a session at that level.
Apple accounts for nearly 7% of S&P 500 index's value, according to Refinitiv data, the highest for a single stock in the index at a time when the benchmark is perched at a peak.
Surging demand for iPhones, MacBooks and iPads during the pandemic helped push the Cupertino, California company's market capitalization past $2 trillion in August 2020.
""Apple has been one of the key pandemic trades for a lot of people and as we exit the pandemic. ... the iPhone maker is going to struggle a little bit,"" warned Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda in New York.
Apple's massive share repurchases in recent years have also fueled its stock rally. 
The company has bought back $348 billion worth of shares in the five years through the September quarter of 2021, reducing its share count by 23% over that period, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
""You know there's going to be buying,"" Silverblatt said. ""From an investor point of view, it's very important.""
With Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) now the world's most valuable automaker as Wall Street bets heavily on electric cars, many investors expect Apple to launch its own vehicle within the next few years as it looks to reduce its current reliance on iPhones for about half of its revenue.

Notably, Apple is worth more than any of Europe's main regional indexes including Britain's FTSE 100, France's CAC 40, Germany's DAX, Spain's IBEX 35 and Italy's FTSE MIB.
Apple's stock is now up 1% in 2022 after gaining 34% last year. It is trading at about 31 times expected 12-month earnings, which is expensive compared to its five-year average of 20 times expected earnings, according to Refinitiv data.

Most major U.S. banks have had staff working in offices since the summer, but some are now choosing not to host holiday parties and others are strongly recommending staff to get booster shots. The following are the pandemic-related rules among Wall Street's biggest banks and financial firms. 
For a FACTBOX on Canadian financial firms, click on
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)
The bank is encouraging employees to work remotely in the first week of January, according to a person familiar with the matter. It will host on-site vaccine booster clinics for its staff across the country.
Since late summer, the bank has also been encouraging employees to get fully vaccinated and more recently to get their booster shots when eligible. It offers onsite clinics in several locations.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
Citigroup has asked staffers to work from home during the first few weeks of 2022, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
On Dec. 15, the bank told employees at its New York City office they could work from home if they were able to through the holidays, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The bank has been requiring employees in the United States to be vaccinated but is not mandating boosters. It is providing rapid test kits and encouraging testing for employees going into the office, a source said earlier.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
The German lender has made COVID-19 boosters available to staff at its new midtown headquarters in New York City since early November, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
Goldman Sachs is encouraging its eligible U.S. staff to work from home until Jan. 18, a spokesperson for the bank said.
Its offices will continue to remain open with previously announced COVID-19 safety protocols - a vaccine requirement, booster for all eligible populations effective Feb. 1, bi-weekly testing effective Jan. 10 and mandatory masks.
As infections flared up in August due to the spread of the Delta variant, the Wall Street bank mandated vaccines for all staff and visitors entering its offices in the United States.
Goldman in December postponed its remaining holiday parties in New York due to COVID-19 concerns, a source familiar with the matter said last month.
Jefferies 
The investment bank has asked staff to work remotely until Jan. 31, according to a post on Instagram from the investment bank's chief executive officer, Richard Handler. 
The bank requires all workers who want to enter its offices to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and has said it will require boosters by Jan. 31, unless the person concerned is not yet eligible for the additional shot. Jefferies does not perform onsite testing.
The bank has also canceled all but essential travel.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
JPMorgan has offered its staff the option of working from home for the first two weeks of 2022, with a caveat that all employees are expected to return to office no later than Feb. 1, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The biggest U.S. bank, which has been one of the most aggressive in bringing employees back to the office, mandated face coverings for its U.S. employees in August, saying they would be required to wear masks in public indoor settings and in common areas regardless of vaccination status.
The lender in October said that it would restrict business travel for employees who are unvaccinated or have not disclosed their vaccination status. Such employees are required to get tested twice a week and contribute more of their pay toward medical insurance. It also mandated vaccines for new recruits in client-facing roles.
In December, JPMorgan instructed unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home. It also relaxed mask requirements for vaccinated staff working in its Manhattan offices. And, it told managers that they should evaluate more often ""who should revert to working from home."" 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
Morgan Stanley is asking employees, contractors and visitors to show proof of vaccination before entering its New York headquarters. The bank does not require additional COVID-19 testing for staff or visitors, a spokesperson said.
The bank expects staff who are not required to be in the office to take advantage of the ability to work from home and to spend more time with their families. But it is not sending staff home and does not have a work-from-home policy, a source familiar with the situation said.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
Last month, the lender delayed its plans for employees to return to the office ""given the changing external environment."" It said it would announce new plans for a full return in the new year.
Wells Fargo has said its offices are open to those who have been vaccinated and choose to use them. The bank is providing all employees with four hours of paid leave to get the booster shot, if eligible.
The bank also requires employees to either document that they are fully vaccinated or get tested regularly.
Fidelity Investments
The company said it had paused its voluntary return-to-office plans in New England, citing a rising risk from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP)
The company has decided to delay the launch of its return to office program, ""Amex Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX)"", in the United States which was scheduled for Jan. 24, extending its hybrid work plans.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)

The asset manager is providing flexibility through Jan. 28 and allowing U.S. employees to work from wherever they are most comfortable, according to a source familiar with the matter.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Wall Street's optimistic start to the New Year continued on Tuesday as prices for some stocks, oil and the dollar advanced, but investors dialled back risk-taking elsewhere as data showed U.S. manufacturing slowed and COVID-19 spread. 
The S&P 500 was flat Tuesday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.59% to 36,799.65, a fresh record, as bank stocks surged with U.S. Treasury yields.
At the same time, the Nasdaq Composite reversed Monday's strong gains to fall more than 1.33%, with declines in shares of high-flyers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
""While seats are filling up again on Wall Street, we think that market players will be slow to increase risk,"" Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Charlotte-based wealth management firm Horizon Investments, wrote in an email. 
The mixed picture was underscored by U.S. manufacturing activity: fresh data showed it had slowed in December amid cooling demand for goods, but supply constraints were starting to ease and a measure of prices paid for inputs by factories fell by the most in a decade, according to The Institute for Supply Management.
The United States also set a global record of almost 1 million new coronavirus infections reported on Monday, according to a Reuters tally, nearly double the country's peak of 505,109 hit just a week ago.
Global equities were up earlier on Tuesday. The Euro STOXX 600 gained 0.82% to hit a record of 494.02 points. Asian stocks also gained, with MSCI's gauge of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan up around 0.4%. 
The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen to hit a five-year peak as investors anticipated the Omicron variant would not derail the global economy or delay the Federal Reserve's expected rate hikes.
The dollar index rose 0.097%, with the euro down 0.11% to $1.1282.
U.S. Treasury yields also rose as bond investors geared up for rate hikes from the Fed by mid-year to curb stubbornly high inflation.
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari on Tuesday said he expects the U.S. central bank will need to raise interest rates twice this year, reversing his long-held view that rates will need to stay at zero until at least 2024.
Benchmark 10-year yields advanced to a six-week high of 1.649%.
Oil prices rose again on Tuesday as OPEC+ agreed to stick to its planned increase in oil output for February, sources from the group told Reuters, because it expects the Omicron variant to have a short-lived impact on demand.
U.S. crude rose 1.16% to $76.96 per barrel and Brent was at $79.95, up 1.23% on the day.

In a sign of investors hedging their bets, gold consolidated above the key $1,800 per ounce level on Tuesday, after a sharp retreat in the last session.
Spot gold added 0.8% to $1,814.43 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.83% to $1,814.00 an ounce.

Investing.com -- Blue chip stocks hit another record, their second of the year, while technology stocks slid and weighed down both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Investors had new data on Tuesday to analyze, showing that factory activity expanded while the labor market remained tight. 
The World Health Organization said more evidence is emerging that the Omicron coronavirus variant is causing milder symptoms than previous strains, though it is highly infectious. New cases in the U.S. alone on Monday reached 1 million.
It was banks that helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with the sector adding 3.7%. Interest rates are expected to rise this year after the Federal Reserve said it would end its pandemic-era bond buying and begin raising rates, perhaps as many as three times this year. Minutes from its December meeting are expected to be released on Wednesday.
Reuters reported that new data showed U.S. manufacturing slowed in December amid some cooling in demand for goods, but investors found signs of supply constraints easing.
It remains a data-light week, and earnings have yet to begin in a big way. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Airline stocks
Airline shares traded higher Tuesday as diminishing concerns about the impact of Omicron and a truce with telecom companies overcame the headwinds confronting the sector.
However, Covid-related absenteeism led thousands of additional U.S. flights to be canceled, and weather and Covid infections are expected to continue to vex airline schedules.
2. Communications truce
 Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) had an amicable settlement with U.S. authorities and airlines over the launch of new 5G services.
After first ignoring the advice of the Department of Transportation, both the firms agreed Monday to delay the rollout of a new 5G service until January 19. This is expected to give aviation regulators time to address safety concerns at airports arising from the use of new frequencies by 5G carriers. The telecom carriers have offered to reduce the power of their new 5G service for six months, beyond levels the companies had previously agreed upon.
The Federal Aviation Administration had prepared to issue flight restrictions that would have hampered both passenger and cargo flights in the country. That prospect is now off the table, at least temporarily.
3. Auto wars
Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)plans to nearly double the output of its all-electric pickup F-150 Lightning.
The company said it will now make 150,000 units of the vehicle every year at its Dearborn factory in Michigan to meet soaring customer demand.
Beginning Thursday, the company will invite the first group of reservation holders to place their orders for the F-150 Lightning. Reservation holders are being asked to watch for an invitation via email or log into their Ford account over the next few months. Those who don’t receive invitations to convert for the 2022 model year will have an opportunity to order a future model year vehicle in due course, the company said.

Investing.com — Renalytix AI (NASDAQ:RNLX) had a positive start to Tuesday. In the early part of the European session, the company announced a joint program with the American Diabetes Association to improve kidney health in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Then in premarket, BTIG initiated the stock with a buy and $24 price target. Analyst Mark Massaro said the company can expand its test label to around 37 million patients from 12 million and broaden its market opportunity. 
In a research note, Massaros said: ""RNLX addresses a large initial $11B market, and we are not aware of any competition. We believe RNLX can expand its test label from ~12 million patients to ~37 million patients and expand its market opportunity. We believe RNLX is positioned to benefit from the rising tide of implementing proactive precision medicine, which is well understood in early cancer detection, but hasn't yet been applied to kidney disease.""
Renalytix's U.S. listed shares jumped at the open, reaching a high of $17.83, but the momentum was soon lost, and its stock price ended the day down 0.26%. In addition, the company's London listed shares closed the session flat at 620p per share. "

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc-owned Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said on Tuesday its cloud division had acquired Israeli cybersecurity startup Siemplify, as the U.S. tech giant expands its security offerings amid rising cyber attacks.
Financial details of the deal were not disclosed by the companies, but a source familiar with the matter said Google paid about $500 million in cash for Siemplify.
The deal came after Google made a pledge to U.S. President Joe Biden last August to invest $10 billion in cybersecurity over the next five years, amid a significant rise in cyber attacks and data breaches.
Siemplify, led by co-founder and chief executive Amos Stern, provides security orchestration, automation and response solutions. It has raised $58 million from investors including G20 Ventures and 83North.
With a partnership with Google Cloud, Siemplify attracted the buyer's interest as it was in the process of raising a new round of private capital, the source added. 
Since the pandemic started in 2020, Google's revenue from the cloud business has nearly doubled to around $5 billion as companies shifted to working from home. The need to protect and hedge against security threats has shot up in tandem, with big corporates also beefing up on cybersecurity products. 
Google said Siemplify's platform would be integrated into its cloud and serve as the foundation for the capabilities it will invest in.

The buyout, Google's first Israeli cybersecurity firm deal, will help the tech giant take advantage of the Middle Eastern nation's deep pool of cybersecurity talent. 
Guggenheim Securities advised Siemplify on the transaction.

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc on Tuesday said it is working with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on custom chips that would control lightweight augmented reality glasses for use by both consumers and businesses for metaverse apps.
At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said during a press conference that the two companies will work together to mate the custom chips with the software that developers need to create virtual worlds in which people can work and play. 
He said that future devices from the collaboration will work with a Microsoft software product called Mesh that allows users to beam a realistic likeness of themselves into the headset of another user so that it feels like the two people are in the same room. 
The future hardware will also use software from Qualcomm called Snapdragon Spaces that helps perform basic augmented reality functions like mapping out physical spaces so that digital objects can be overlaid on them and hand-tracking so that users can manipulate those digital objects with hand gestures.
""We've been talking for years about the possibility of having wearable augmented reality devices that will gain scale,"" Amon, one of the few major tech executives not to cancel his physical presence at the trade show, said from a live-streamed talk on stage in Las Vegas.

The two companies did not give details about when the chips and headsets would be available.
“Our goal is to inspire and empower others to collectively work to develop the metaverse future – a future that is grounded in trust and innovation,” Rubén Caballero, corporate vice president for mixed reality at Microsoft, said in a statement.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Shares of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) surged on Tuesday, lifted by investors' growing enthusiasm about their future electric pickup offerings.
Ford's stock jumped more than 11% to its highest level since 2001 after the Detroit automaker said it will nearly double production capacity for its red-hot F-150 Lightning electric pickup to 150,000 vehicles. It said the model has already attracted nearly 200,000 reservations ahead of its arrival this spring at U.S. dealers.
GM rallied 7.3% a day ahead of its public debut of the Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup, which is slated to go on sale in early 2023. GM CEO Mary Barra is set to unveil the Silverado EV at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s announcement on Sunday that it delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, crushing analysts' forecasts of 263,026, also heightened excitement about electric vehicles, one of the hottest investment themes on Wall Street. Tesla shares climbed more than 13% on Monday, but gave back 4.4% on Tuesday.
Ford has now gained nearly 17% over two days, a strong start to the year after surging 136% in 2021. GM has climbed 12% over two sessions, adding to its 41% gain last year.
Not all of Wall Street's EV makers got a lift on Tuesday. Rivian dipped 0.8%, leaving its gain since its initial public offering in November at 31%. Lucid Group lost 4%, while Nio (NYSE:NIO) dipped 5%.

The rally in GM shares came even after Japanese automaker  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp released data showing it outsold GM in the United States in 2021, marking the first time the Detroit automaker has not led U.S. auto sales for a full year since 1931.

DETROIT (Reuters) - John Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co said on Tuesday it will start commercial delivery this year of technology that enables a tractor to till a field without an operator in the cab, a first for the top North American tractor manufacturer after years of effort to automate farm work.
Deere plans a low-volume launch this year delivering systems for 12 to 20 machines, and then scaling up, Jahmy Hindman, Deere's chief technology officer, told Reuters. The company is weighing whether to sell the technology, lease it, or offer it to farmers in a subscription package that could allow for upgrades as hardware and software evolve, he said.
The cameras and computers for automated tilling can be installed on an existing tractor and tiller machine in a day, Hindman said.
Deere and other equipment makers such as  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) have invested heavily in technology to automate off-highway vehicles such as farm tractors and mining machines. In the farm sector, finding workers to operate tractors is a chronic problem made more acute by the pandemic. 
For the farm equipment industry, Deere's commercial launch is a significant step in a journey that has been underway for nearly two decades, beginning with the use of satellite positioning and later hands-free operation with a driver still in the cab. Deere has been testing fully autonomous tractors for three to four years, Hindman said. 
While automated tractors do not have to contend with pedestrians, the chaos of urban traffic or highway safety regulations, Hindman said self-driving tractors do need to be able to navigate accurately, avoid obstacles and precisely control equipment such as a tiller.
Deere's initial automated tractors will use stereo cameras in the front and rear, and can send images of what the cameras see via a smartphone app to a farmer or equipment operator. The operator can take the tractor to a field, swipe the smartphone screen and the machine will start on a programmed path.

The tractor's computerized vision system will monitor the tiller, which will have mirrors installed on the shanks that churn plant stubble into the ground. If one of the shanks hits a rock and gets tipped up, the change in the reflection from the mirror will be visible to a remote operator.
Deere is working on automating other farm operations, with spraying likely the next target for automation, Hindman said.

Investing.com — The share price of social media company  Pinterest Inc  (NYSE:PINS) has tumbled over 10% Tuesday after Guggenheim said they are downgrading the stock to neutral from buy, lowering their price target to $39 from $46.
Analyst Michael Morris told investors in a research note that the downgrade was because of concerns over user growth based on data from Ads Manager and Apptopia download trends. 
The analyst believes the company's aggregate users came in at 218.1 million in December, down from 226.9 million in November. Morris also said the platform lost 24 million users in the second quarter and a further 10 million in the third quarter.
Guggenheim's rating is similar to Wolfe Research. Wolfe started Pinterest with a peer perform rating. However, analyst Deepak Mathivanan told investors the company has significant monetization upside over the long term.
""We are currently on the sidelines on PINS. We like the ongoing product transition at the company, which should not only improve the content and engagement on the platform but also provide PINS significant monetization upside long-term. However, the near-term uncertainties on its revenue and MAU growth trajectory are likely to keep multiples under pressure,"" said Mathivanan."

(Reuters) - The Biden administration doubled its order for  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s oral COVID-19 antiviral treatment, the company and the White House said on Tuesday, providing the government a total of 20 million courses as it fights a record surge in COVID-19 cases.
The White House now expects some 4 million treatment courses of the pills to be available by the end of January and 10 million by June, three months sooner than previously planned, according to an administration official.
""We're getting them as soon as they come off the line,"" the official said.
Details of the expanded deal, Pfizer's largest yet for the pill, were not disclosed by the company.
For the first order of 10 million courses in November, the U.S. government had said it would pay Pfizer $5.29 billion.
""These pills will be delivered in the coming months and have been shown to dramatically decrease hospitalization and death from COVID-19,"" the White House said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Pfizer's two-drug regimen called Paxlovid, which is meant to be taken at home for five days soon after onset of COVID symptoms, was authorized last month for people aged 12 and older. In a clinical trial, it was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness.

The U.S. official said Washington could activate the Defense Production Act or use other extraordinary powers to speed deliveries if Pfizer encounters any production difficulties.
A rival antiviral pill from Merck & Co also won regulatory authorization last month. The U.S. government has a deal for as many as 5 million courses of the pill, molnupiravir, at a price of $700 per course.

However, the 9% estimate is below his initial 10% to 15% growth forecast for December. Daryanani said it makes December ""the first month of single digit App Store growth over the last 10 years.""
However, he warned investors not to look too much into the single-month data, noting that revenue was up 20% for the year. As a result, Daryanani maintained an Outperform rating and $200 price target on the stock.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 02:34PM ET</span>",WHO sees more evidence that Omicron causes milder symptoms,"By Emma Farge and Mrinalika Roy
GENEVA (Reuters) - More evidence is emerging that the Omicron coronavirus variant is affecting the upper respiratory tract, causing milder symptoms than previous variants and resulting in a ""decoupling"" in some places between soaring case numbers and low death rates, a World Health Organization official said on Tuesday.
""We are seeing more and more studies pointing out that Omicron is infecting the upper part of the body. Unlike other ones, the lungs who would be causing severe pneumonia,"" WHO Incident Manager Abdi Mahamud told Geneva-based journalists.
""It can be a good news, but we really require more studies to prove that.""
Since the heavily mutated variant was first detected in November, WHO data shows it has spread quickly and emerged in at least 128 countries, presenting dilemmas for many nations and people seeking to reboot their economies and lives after nearly two years of COVID-related disruptions.
However, while case numbers have surged to all-time records, the hospitalisation and death rates are often lower than at other phases in the pandemic.
""What we are seeing now is....the decoupling between the cases and the deaths,"" he said.
His remarks on the reduced risks of severe disease chime with other data, including a study from South Africa https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/safrica-study-suggests-lower-risk-hospitalisation-with-omicron-versus-delta-2021-12-22, which was one of the first countries where Omicron was detected. 
However, Mahamud also sounded a note of caution, calling South Africa an ""outlier"" since it has a young population, among other factors.
And he warned that Omicron's high transmissibility meant it would become dominant within weeks in many places, posing a threat to medical systems in countries where a high proportion of the population remains unvaccinated. 
VACCINATION, NOT VACCINES, ARE THE CHALLENGE
While Omicron seemed to be slipping past antibodies, evidence was emerging that COVID-19 vaccines still provided some protection, by eliciting a second pillar of the immune response from T-cells, Mahamud said. 
""Our prediction is protection against severe hospitalization and death (from Omicron) will be maintained,"" he said, saying this also applied to vaccines developed by Sinopharm and Sinovac that are used in China, where Omicron cases remain very low.
""The challenge has not been the vaccine but the vaccination and reaching those vulnerable populations.""
Asked about whether an Omicron-specific vaccine was needed, Mahamud said it was too early to say but voiced doubts and stressed that the decision required global coordination and should not be left to manufacturers to decide alone.
""You may go ahead with Omicron and put all your eggs in that basket and a new variant that is more transmissible or more immune-evasive may appear,"" he said, adding that a WHO technical group had held recent meetings on vaccine composition.
The best way to reduce the impact of the variant would be to meet the WHO's goal of vaccinating 70% of the population in each country by July, rather than offer third and fourth doses in some countries, he said.
As case numbers due to Omicron have soared, some countries, including the United States https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cdc-cuts-quarantine-time-all-americans-with-covid-19-5-days-2021-12-27, have cut down isolation or quarantine periods in a bid to allow asymptomatic people to return to work or school. 
Mahamud said that leaders should decide based on the strength of the local epidemic, saying Western countries with very high case numbers might consider trimming isolation periods to keep basic services functioning.

However, places that have largely shut it out would do better to maintain the full 14-day quarantine period.
""If your numbers are very small, you better be invested in keeping that number very, very low.""

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Corp on Tuesday announced deals to supply chips to automakers Volvo Group, Honda Motor Co Ltd and  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY), accelerating its push to partner with legacy automotive firms digitizing their product lines.
The San Diego, California, company once known for its mobile phone chips has created a range of automotive offerings, from self-driving car brains to chips that operate digital dashboards and infotainment systems. But the chips are all aimed at the same goal of helping automakers transform their vehicles into rolling computers that can be updated over the air with paid upgrades that generate revenue for carmakers long after a vehicle has left dealer lots, a business model pioneered by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 
At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm said it has reached a deal with Geely Holding-backed brands Volvo and Polestar to use Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon Cockpit"" chips and an operating system from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google in vehicles starting later this year.
The deal will allow Volvo’s electric SUV, which is to begin production this year, to tap into hands-free use of Google Assistant and navigation with Google Maps. The companies said that future upgrades will be sent out over the air.

Qualcomm also said that Honda will start using its ""cockpit"" chips in vehicles that will hit roads in 2023. Qualcomm also said Renault (PA:RENA) has agreed to use its automotive technology, but did not give specifics of which chips or when vehicles using them would arrive.
Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it has created a new chip and system for computer vision, which uses cameras on the car and artificial intelligence to help with safety functions like automatic lane control. The new ""Snapdragon Ride Vision System"" uses software from Arriver, which was part of Qualcomm's $4.5 billion purchase of automotive technology firm  Veoneer  (NYSE:VNE) Inc last year.

Bowie, who pushed the boundaries of music and his own sanity to produce some of the most innovative songs of his generation, died in 2016 aged 69. 
The deal between Bowie's estate and Warner Music includes songs from the 26 studio albums released during his lifetime, as well as the posthumous studio album release ""Toy"".
Warner Music did not disclose the financial terms of the deal in its announcement on Monday, but a person familiar with the matter said the purchase was worth about $250 million.
Bowie's estate had in September signed a deal that gave Warner Music global rights to the artist's catalog from 1968 through 2016.
Bowie shot to fame in Britain in 1969 with ""Space Oddity,"" whose words he said were inspired by watching Stanley Kubrick’s film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" while stoned.
But it was his 1972 portrayal of a doomed bisexual rock envoy from space, ""Ziggy Stardust"", that propelled him to global stardom. 
The deal for his catalog is the latest in the media rights sector, where companies have sought to boost royalties by purchasing artists' catalogs after the pandemic hit physical revenue streams and delayed release of new recordings.

Warner Music, home to musicians such as Cardi B, Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars, has also partnered with popstar Madonna to relaunch her entire catalog over the next few years.
Its deal with Bowie's estate comes days before the rock star's 75th birth anniversary on Jan. 8.

The move marks the end of an era as the phones, which sported a tiny QWERTY physical keyboard, pioneered push email and the BBM instant messaging service.
Former U.S. President Barack Obama, one of its most celebrated users, made headlines in 2016 when he was asked to give up his BlackBerry and replace it with an unnamed smartphone.
Blackberry (TSX:BB) lost favor with users with the advent of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s touchscreen iPhones and rival Android devices. In recent years, the company pivoted to making cybersecurity software and embedded operating systems for cars.
Social media was alight with tributes. One Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) user reminisced it was a ""fabulous machine"" and hoped the company's phones would be resurrected.

In a document published in 2020, the company said it would take steps to decommission legacy services for BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry OS operating systems and added devices running on them would no longer be supported and may not be able to receive or send data, make phone calls or send messages reliably.
A U.S. judge on Monday rejected the company's bid to dismiss a lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders by inflating the success and profitability of smartphones using BlackBerry 10 OS, and said the class-action case could go to trial this fall.

Investing.com — Shares of Avrobio Inc (NASDAQ:AVRO) are down 33% Tuesday after the company announced that it is shifting its portfolio priorities — deprioritizing the Fabry disease program — to focus on other clinical-stage programs and extending its cash runway into the first quarter of 2024.
Avrobio shares have declined over 81% in the past 12 months.
The company told investors it is deprioritizing the Fabry disease program because of new clinical data and an increasingly challenging market and regulatory environment for Fabry disease.
""Following steady progress in 2021, we have reset our corporate priorities and will extend our cash runway to strengthen our ability to deliver on the promise of our gene therapy programs,"" said Geoff MacKay, president and CEO of Avrobio.
As a result of the move, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten more than halved his price target on the stock to $14 from $30. However, the analyst continues to be bullish on the company, maintaining an outperform rating.
Nierengarten explained in a research note that Avrobio's ""programs in Pompe disease and Hunter syndrome are now expected to enter the clinic in 2023. As a result of shifting its pipeline priorities, AVRO now expects that its cash position is sufficient to fund operations into 1Q24.""
He added that despite removing Fabry from their valuation, Wedbush believes the ""shares are significantly undervalued on the basis of its programs in Gaucher and Cystinosis."""

""Expansion to European markets will begin this year. Stay tuned for country-specific delivery information,"" the California-based electric carmaker tweeted.
Reservations for the company's Lucid Air luxury sedan rose to 13,000 in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, reflecting an order book of about $1.3 billion and since then rose to beyond 17,000 when the company reported quarterly results in mid-November.
Lucid had said that it saw significant demand for the car as it ramps up production at their factory in Arizona and was confident of achieving 20,000 units in 2022.

Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson had said in October 2021 that the launch of the Lucid Air sedan was set to happen in the Middle East and Europe in 2022 and China in 2023.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 01:35PM ET</span>","Mobileye, Zeekr aim for self-driving car in China in 2024","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s autonomous driving unit, Mobileye (F:0ME), said on Tuesday it plans to work with Geely Holding-backed Zeekr to launch in China what the companies claim will be the world's first mostly self-driving car in 2024.
The two companies said at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that the car will have what automotive engineers call level 4 autonomy, meaning that it will still have a steering wheel and require a licensed driver but will be able to drive itself in many situations. It will use six of Mobileye's ""EyeQ 5"" chips and also employ Mobileye's road-mapping data.
Intel, which is hungry for cash to build chip factories and racing to catch up with rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co that have taken away Intel's lead in making the fastest chips, said last month it plans to spin out a portion of Mobileye in an initial public offering. Geely, the fast-growing Chinese automaker, has recently explored manufacturing cars in Korea that could be exported to the United States duty-free, Reuters reported last month.
Mobileye on Tuesday also said that it is deepening its relationship with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. The two firms said that Ford will use Mobileye's road-mapping data system, which is drawn from all vehicles on the road with Mobileye hardware, in future versions of Ford's ""BlueCruise"" that allows hands-free driving in some situations. 

Mobileye said that Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) will also start using some of its mapping data products for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s driver-assistance features, such as automated lane keeping. 
Mobileye on Tuesday also unveiled the next generation of its flagship computer chip, which will be called the ""EyeQ Ultra"" and is designed to use minimal electricity, which is becoming more important as self-driving systems compete with drive trains for limited battery capacity in electric vehicles. The company said that prototypes of the chip will be ready next year, with automotive production of the chips expected in 2025.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 01:26PM ET</span>",Explainer-How Tesla weathered global supply chain issues that knocked rivals,"By Hyunjoo Jin
San Francisco (Reuters) -Tesla Inc's ability to design components in-house gave the automaker agility in making tweaks to parts and coping with supply chain issues that hit other automakers much harder, sources and experts said.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boosted its deliveries by 87% to a record high in 2021, pushing its shares up over 13% on Monday. 
Here are some of the ways Tesla navigated supply chain challenges. 
HOW TESLA COPED WITH THE GLOBAL CHIP SHORTAGE
Tesla told some customers they could take vehicle delivery with some missing parts, such as Bluetooth chips and USB ports. Tesla also removed some features such as radar sensors and lumbar support for front passenger seats, which made the car less complicated to build. Tesla did not respond to Reuters' request for comments. 
Tesla also increased vehicle prices to address higher costs, including ""expedite costs"" for parts. American consumers have to wait for seven months if they order a Model Y version, whose prices went up 18% last year. 
Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tesla was also able to substitute alternative chips for some that were in short supply. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Herbert Diess said Tesla's ability to rewrite software to support the new chips in 2-3 weeks was impressive.
HOW TESLA IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER AUTOMAKERS 
Tesla designs more hardware and writes more software than many rivals, which rely on auto suppliers. Musk has called the company ""absurdly vertically integrated compared to other auto companies.""
""We design circuit boards by ourselves, which allow us to modify their design quickly to accommodate alternative chips like powerchips,"" a Tesla insider said. 
In-house engineers design the bulk of the complex software that runs the Tesla vehicles, which Musk has described as a ""computer on wheels"". 
Some traditional automakers are also conservative about modifying chips or using different chip factories, because of a risk associated with the change, Kevin Anderson, Principal Consultant at Write-Tek, said. 
""They have been burned many times in the past and unintended consequences of those changes. A company like Tesla doesn't have that long experience,"" he said. 
HOW MUCH IS TESLA VERTICALLY INTEGRATED? 
Tesla also designs the chips used in its driver assistant systems and makes parts ranging from seats to battery cells in-house. It also owns its own direct sales, service and charging networks. 
""We're designing and building https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-batteryday-technology-insight/the-musk-method-learn-from-partners-then-go-it-alone-idUSKBN2680K4 so much more of the car than other OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) who will largely go to the traditional supply base and like I call it, catalog engineering. So it is not very adventurous,"" Musk said. 
Ambrose Conroy, CEO of Seraph Consulting, said: ""They control what's going on in that vehicle at a level that no other automaker wants to do it. It is much more aligned to the integration that Henry Ford had originally with the Model T.""
HOW TESLA SECURED CHIP ORDERS
In 2020, many automakers cut chip orders as the pandemic and lockdown measures hit demand. But Tesla never reduced its production forecast with suppliers, since it expected rapid growth, which helped it weather the chip shortage, Tesla chief financial officer Zach Kirkhorn has said. 

""They've just been smarter about it than other companies in terms of making sure there's buffer stock,"" a Tesla supplier executive said. 
Tesla's direct ties with chip suppliers allowed it to move faster than traditional automakers, which rely on first-tier suppliers who have relationships with chipmakers, Anderson said.

Investing.com — Agrify Corp (NASDAQ:AGFY), a provider of premium cultivation and extraction solutions for the cannabis and hemp industry, saw its shares surge nearly 15%, to $11.08 a share Tuesday. 
The rise was on the back of news the company has signed an agreement for its most significant Agrify Total Turn-Key Solution partnership to date with Gold Leaf Florida, a licensed medical marijuana treatment center.
The agreement — the first for Agrify in the Florida cannabis market— could generate up to $400 million in revenue for the company over the 10-year term, with more than $140 million in revenue expected over the first three years of cultivation. 
The deal will see Agrify install 1,510 of its Vertical Farming Units at Gold Leaf's 200,000-square-foot facility, with 100,000 square feet dedicated to VFU cultivation. Gold Leaf also plans to build four additional 200,000-square-foot facilities in Florida, with Agrify hoping to support Gold Leaf through its expected future growth with further unit installations. 
""Our partnership with Gold Leaf is a milestone achievement that represents even further validation of our novel TTK program given the scale and economic value of this customer engagement,"" said Raymond Chang, Chairman and CEO of Agrify.
Adding: ""We are also excited about entering the robust Florida medical cannabis market, the nation's largest, with a premier partner like Gold Leaf, and we look forward to leveraging our position for additional growth opportunities in this highly attractive market.""

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 12:16PM ET</span>","Nvidia embraces the metaverse with new software, marketplace deals","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp on Tuesday said that it would give away software for free to artists and other creators building virtual worlds for the metaverse and that it has made technology deals with several marketplaces where artists sell the three-dimensional content they create. 
The metaverse - a loosely defined term that can refer to virtual worlds made more lifelike by the use of augmented and virtual reality headsets - relies heavily on graphics computing technology like Nvidia's flagship semiconductors. 
Nvidia is seeking to turn its leading position in supplying the computing hardware for the metaverse into a set of software tools for creating and selling content within virtual worlds, a business opportunity that has helped Nvidia shares more than double in value over the past year.
At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Nvidia said that it plans to distribute a free version of its ""Omniverse"" software for creating virtual worlds to individual artists. Nvidia in November said it would charge prices starting at $9,000 per year for corporate customers.
Once artists create three-dimensional content that can be used in virtual worlds, they can sell that content on several marketplaces and content libraries. 

Nvidia on Tuesday said it had reached deals with four such marketplaces - TurboSquid by  Shutterstock  (NYSE:SSTK) , CGTrader, Sketchfab and Twinbru - to allow their marketplace content to show up in Nvidia's Omniverse software suite. Nvidia also said that marketplaces Reallusion’s ActorCore, Daz3D and e-on software’s PlantCatalog will soon release their own Omniverse-ready assets.
Nvidia did not disclose the financial arrangements of its deals with the content libraries and marketplaces. Technology companies with large audiences for their software platforms often charge commissions or other costs to creators who want to sell to their users.

The issue was traced to possible leakage in the coolant pump that could heat up components, Daimler said.
The news was first reported by the mass-selling Bild newspaper, which published a copy of a letter Daimler sent to some 800,000 Mercedes-Benz owners affected by the defect that said ""the risk of a fire could not be ruled out.""
Daimler confirmed the letter was authentic.
It added in the letter that the parts needed to fix the problem were not immediately available so a recall was not possible at the moment, but would be launched as soon as the components became available.
""In the meantime the affected vehicle should be driven in a particularly prudent manner and usage reduced to the bare minimum,"" the letter said.
Daimler could not confirm Bild's report that 800,000 vehicles were affected.

""The owner of a vehicle affected by a recall should always contact the nearest Mercedes-Benz service partner immediately,"" the company said in a statement. 
The affected models are certain GLE/GLS (167 platform), C-Class (205 platform), E-Class (213 platform), S-Class (222 platform), S-Class (223 platform), E-Class Coupe/Convertible (238 platform), GLC (253 platform), CLS (257 platform) and G-Class (463 platform), Daimler said.

Investing.com –  Foot Locker  stock (NYSE:FL) fell more than 3% Tuesday after JPMorgan downgraded the stock to underweight with a target of $42, down 30% from analyst Matthew Boss’ previous target of $60.
The stock touched a low of $42.51 during the session that’s still underway. Boss was earlier neutral on the stock.
The analyst cited the combination of market share compression in an expanding addressable market for athletic wear and “multi-year margin pressure points” for his pessimism on the stock. Higher cost of goods sold and elevated selling, general administrative expenses including fatter wages and direct costs are likely to weigh on the company, according to Boss.
According to reports, the analyst believes the company faces risks from  Nike  's (NYSE:NKE) direct-to-consumer strategy.
When it announced its third-quarter numbers in November, the footwear retailer handed out a less-than-confident outlook heading into the busiest time of the year.
""We expect global supply chain constraints to persist throughout the fourth quarter,” the company said, although it insisted that it has ""positive momentum and inventory levels ready to meet customer demand.""
Total sales in the third quarter rose 4%, to $2.18 billion. Comparable sales were up only 2.2%. Adjusted profit per share came in at $1.93 compared to $1.21 in the same period last year."

Investing.com — Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) shares rose 0.4% Tuesday after it was named Wells Fargo's ""favorite large-cap growth idea for 2022.""
Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall reiterated an overweight rating and raised the price target on the shares to $196.
Despite explaining that the past few months have shown Disney will face some ""serious content obstacles"" to meet FY24 subscriber guidance, the analyst is confident in the company being able to meet expectations.
""Given DIS's history in delivering the content goods, we think it's an attractive setup, so it's our favorite large-cap growth idea for 2022,” explained Cahall in a client note.
Cahall continued by saying that for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) every $2 billion or more in content amortization equals 25 million net adds historically. 
""DIS's step-up in content suggests that amort growth will be at least that punchy. And, while we can't quantify the content value going to general entertainment (GE), we remind investors that DIS bought 21st Century Fox specifically to address its lack of prowess in content outside its core genres. So, we think DIS knows its weaknesses and will be throwing everything and the kitchen sink at it,"" added the analyst."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden hailed a deal between wireless carriers and U.S. regulators that will allow the deployment of new 5G wireless in two weeks and averted an aviation safety crisis.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) agreed late Monday to delay C-Band wireless spectrum deployment until Jan. 19 but won key assurances that they will be able to start service this month, according to a Transportation Department letter seen by Reuters.
The delay came after pressure from the White House, aviation unions and a threat by airlines to file suit to block the deployment that could have disrupted thousands of daily flights.
Biden said the ""agreement ensures that there will be no disruptions to air operations over the next two weeks and puts us on track to substantially reduce disruptions to air operations when AT&T and Verizon launch 5G on January 19th.""
The aviation industry and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters that could disrupt flights.
Verizon Chief Executive Hans Vestberg told employees Tuesday in an email that it sees no aviation safety issue with 5G, but said the FAA ""intended to disrupt an already difficult time for air travel if we move ahead with our planned activation... We felt that it was the right thing to do for the flying public, which includes our customers and all of us, to give the FAA a little time to work out its issues with the aviation community.""
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator chief Steve Dickson told AT&T and Verizon in a letter Monday, seen by Reuters, the agencies will not seek any further delays in deployment of 5G wireless service beyond Jan. 19 absent any ""unforeseen aviation safety issues.""
The agreement ""will give us additional time and space to reduce the impacts to commercial flights,"" they wrote.
The attached ""final term sheet"" said unless ""unforeseen aviation safety issues"" arise the U.S. agencies ""will not seek or demand any further delays of C-Band deployment, in whole or in part, including a delay of return to routine operations.""
Airlines for America, a group representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and others, had been preparing to file suit late Monday absent a delay, industry officials told reporters.
A wireless industry official told Reuters the deal gives them assurances they will be able to begin deployment this month.
AT&T and Verizon had agreed Sunday to adopt exclusion zones for six months around some airports in a bid to mirror safeguards adopted by France, but had rejected Buttigieg's request for a delay of up to two weeks.
The letter said that by Friday regulators will provide the carriers ""with a list of no more than 50 priority airports that they would propose to be subject to the C-Band exclusion zones"" that AT&T and Verizon had proposed Sunday.
Additional requests may be made for ""voluntary surgical mitigation measures at any individual airport"" but AT&T and Verizon ""shall have sole discretion to determine if any requested mitigations, adjustments or alterations will be made.""

AT&T and Verizon won nearly all of the C-Band spectrum in an $80-billion auction last year. In total, Verizon paid $52.9 billion for the spectrum, including incentive payments and clearing costs, to reach more than 100 million Americans, while AT&T paid $23.4 billion.
AT&T and Verizon in November initially agreed to delay the deployment by 30 days to Jan. 5 after the FAA raised safety concerns and the carriers adopted voluntary precautionary measures for six months.

Investing.com –  General Electric  stock (NYSE:GE) traded 3.5% higher Tuesday after Credit Suisse rated it outperform with a target of $122, up 22% from the current level of $100.
GE’s shares have lost around 14% since the company’s Nov. 9 decision to split into three businesses – healthcare, energy and aviation. The company plans to keep around 20% in the healthcare business.
Analyst John Walsh believes the pullback has created an opportunity for an outperformance in 2022 as GE reaps the benefits of a cyclical recovery in 2022.
“We also see potential for a “rush for propulsion” as airline customers have managed green time throughout the pandemic. In December, GE noted that aviation revenue and FCF (free cash flow) could return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. We think cyclical recovery and FCF execution will drive the stock higher, despite a “lack of catalyst” narrative into the spinoffs,” Walsh said in his note, according to StreetInsider.
Walsh points out that unlike other large conglomerate simplification, GE has positively revised guidance.
GE is aiming for all three units to have investment grade debt ratings. It said in November it was on course to reduce debt to 2.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the end of this year, which is the rough rule of thumb for corporate investment grade debt.

GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Investors in financial products issued by China Evergrande Group protested outside the cash-strapped company's offices in Guangzhou on Tuesday, with many worried that their returns would be sacrificed to keep real estate projects afloat.
Members of the crowd of roughly 100 people shouted ""Evergrande, return our money!"", reprising a chant used by disgruntled investors and suppliers last autumn as the deterioration in its financial position became apparent. 
On Friday, Evergrande announced a dial-back of plans to repay investors in its wealth management products, announcing that each could expect 8,000 yuan ($1,256) per month in principal payment for three months starting in January, irrespective of when their investment matures. [L4N2TG17J]
Once China's top selling developer but now reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, Evergrande had previously agreed to repay 10% by the end of the month when the product matured, without specifying an amount.
The change sparked investor fear that they won't get their money back.
""I think it's hopeless, and I'm scared, but if we don't fight for our rights, that's worse,"" said a retired woman surnamed Du who was among those outside Evergrande's offices in the southern Chinese metropolis and said she had invested one million yuan in Evergrande wealth management products.
""The economy's not good at the moment, these are ordinary people and they need this money for kids, for supporting their parents,"" she said.
China Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment on the protest or on the concerns of the investors.
By midday, about 60 of those protesting had been hemmed in by rows of security personnel. Videos circulating in WeChat groups showed several people being detained at the scene. 
In the afternoon, a group of 20 remaining protesters were told to leave a street near Evergrande's offices, while security stopped and took the details of at least three people who tried to describe their experiences to a Reuters reporter.
HIGH YIELDS AND GUCCI BAGS
Lured by the promise of yields approaching 12%, gifts such as Dyson air purifiers and Gucci bags, and the guarantee of China's top-selling developer, tens of thousands of investors bought wealth management products through Evergrande. [L1N2QN2YG]
More than 80,000 people – including employees, their families and friends as well as owners of Evergrande properties - bought products that raised more than 100 billion yuan in the past five years, said a sales manager of Evergrande Wealth, launched in 2016 as a peer-to-peer (P2) online lending platform that originally was used to fund its property projects.
""We worry we will be sacrificed,"" said a 34-year-old protester who works in e-commerce and would only give her name as Sophie, for fear of reprisal from authorities.
""It's okay for younger people like me, we can still earn it back, but I’m worried about the older ones who put everything into this,"" she said. 
Protesters and members of messaging groups of people owed money by Evergrande have said they had been told by police not to cause trouble, and had seen their chat groups blocked.
Sophie said police had taken her to the station four times since she joined protests at Evergrande's headquarters in the nearby city of Shenzhen in September.

""We don't know what happens to our money but we're expected to keep quiet, it's not right,"" she said.

At greatest risk are deals that create lenders with more than $500 billion in assets, but even smaller tie-ups may be in jeopardy amid increased scrutiny by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. 
“We are in a period of transition to a new standard for merger approvals, where there is a greater focus on how deals affect the convenience and needs of the community and whether they increase systemic risk,” Seiberg wrote. “Deals that historically would have secured regulatory approval are now at risk. How much risk will depend upon how the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC revise their approach to merger reviews.”
Seiberg pointed to a number of recent steps by Democrats to reassess rules for bank deals. Those include House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) calling for a moratorium on deal approvals until regulators finish a merger-policy review, and the resignation of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Jelena McWilliams following a dispute with Biden appointees over launching a public-comment period on overhauling bank-merger guidelines.
The moves toward increased financial regulation follow the busiest year for bank mergers and acquisitions since 2007, with more than $61 billion in deals announced through Dec. 9, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
Pending deals include U.S. Bancorp’s planned $8 billion acquisition of MUFG Union Bank NA, which is scheduled to be completed in the first half of the year and still needs regulatory approval. Agencies were slow to approve a number of deals last year, with three mergers that had awaited action for months not receiving sign-off until Dec. 17, Seiberg wrote.

Investing.com – Coca-Cola stock (NYSE:KO) rose 2% on Tuesday after Guggenheim upgraded its target price to $66.
The new target is 9% than the $60.47 touched by the stock in the session that’s underway.
Analyst Laurent Grandet had a target of $61 for the stock earlier, according to reports.
According to Grandet, 2021 was transitional for the company and it should see a much stronger 2022. Emerging markets, despite their low vaccination rates, are offering good growth, he points out. He argues the company’s on-premise sales are recovering faster than expected and that restructuring and portfolio rationalization have led to a more focused and agile organization. That should help the gross margins, according to the analyst.
After the company’s relative underperformance to PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and the consumer staples-focused XLP Index (NYSE:XLP), Grandet finds Coa-Cola’s valuations compelling. 
Coca-Cola raised its forecast in October, revising its adjusted organic revenue growth target to 13.5% at the center of the fiscal year 2021 range from the previous 13%.
The company expects its annual adjusted profit per share to rise 16%, compared with a prior forecast calling for a 14% increase at center of the range.
The company successfully executed price hikes and rode strong demand for its soda and beverages in the three months ended Oct. 1. Revenue jumped 16% to $10.04 billion as the reopening of the economy drove people to theaters and restaurants. Consumers, conscious of health risks in the pandemic, sought its bottled soda, juices and water.
Unit case volumes were up 6%, driven by sales in Europe, West Asia, Africa and Latin America."

Investing.com — Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) was started with a buy at Cantor Fitzgerald on Tuesday, resulting in a 3% gain in its share price.
Analyst Mike Colonnese — who also put a $45 price target on the stock — explained that RIOT is one of the best ways for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the digital asset because the company holds most of its Bitcoin on its balance sheet.
""Riot Blockchain is one of the largest, vertically integrated cryptocurrency mining companies in North America with 350 MW of developed Bitcoin (BTC) mining capacity and a deployed fleet of nearly 30,000 Bitcoin miners producing an aggregate hash rate of 3 exahash per second (EH/s),"" said Colonnese.
""This means that RIOT is currently capable of mining ~16-17 Bitcoin per day, on average, which equates to ~$825,000 in daily Bitcoin mining revenue (assuming BTC price of $50,000),""he added.
Cantor believes RIOT is in a unique position to continue to gain a share of the Bitcoin mining industry in 2022 and further afield. The company plans to more than double its developed mining capacity to 750 MW by the second quarter and triple its total hash rate to 9 EH/s by the end of this year."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened at fresh record highs again on Tuesday, extending a rally that has spanned the end of the old year and the start of 2022 as investors look beyond a short-term spike in Covid-19 cases.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 225 points, or 0.6%, at 36,810 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite took a breather, edging down by less than 0.1%.
The divergence between value and growth continued even after the release of the day's economic data, which showed job vacancies falling slightly in November and a sharper-than-expected slowdown in manufacturing activity in December. The Institute of Supply Management's Purchasing Managers Index fell to 58.7, its lowest in a year. The survey showed the PMI's 'prices' subindex falling sharply for a second straight month, suggesting that inflationary pressures may be unwinding.
Both Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ran out of steam after Monday's rallies, Tesla stock inching up 0.5% and Apple stock effectively flat.  AT&T (NYSE:T) stock and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock both rose around 1% after agreeing to a two-week delay in the launch of their 5G services to appease airline industry and aviation regulators' concerns about safety.
Cyclical and value stocks appeared to be coming back into vogue, despite a surge in reported Covid-19 cases that threatens to wreak fresh havoc in the short-term on the services industry in particular. The U.S. reported over 1 million new cases on Monday, far surpassing the one-day record for any country in the world. However, even in countries where the new Omicron strain has become dominant, such as South Africa, the wave of infections has peaked without overwhelming local the local healthcare system. As such, many market participants are prepared to bet that Omicron will signal the beginning of the end of the pandemic, resulting in faster progress toward herd immunity with only minor associated economic damage.
Among early movers, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stood out with a 7.1% gain after the Detroit giant said it plans another big increase in output of its all-electric F-150 pickup truck. The company said it aims to be in a position to produce 600,000 electric vehicles (not just the F-150 model) within two years. Ford still has a window to build a solid position in the electric truck market, given the slow progress in Tesla's Cybertruck project. That's in contrast to the market for sedans and SUVs, where Tesla's record fourth-quarter deliveries underlined how strong its first-mover advantage is in those segments. 
Elsewhere, Warner Music (NASDAQ:WMG) fell 4.7% after strategic shareholder Access Industries offloaded a 1.6% stake in the company, while in ADRs, Internet giants continued their retreat from empire under pressure from antitrust regulators in Beijing. Sea ADRs fell 9.7% to their lowest in over a year as Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) said it will convert its class B voting stock in the company into class A stock. That makes it fungible with the southeast Asian company's ADRs and increases the likely market overhang on them.

Investing.com – Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit the $3 trillion market cap again Tuesday, following its first surge above the coveted mark in the previous session.
Wedbush sees the stock crossing $200 a share in 2022. Analyst Daniel Ives has a $225 bull case scenario for Apple, which will give the world’s most valuable company a market cap of $3.69 trillion.
The stock touched a high of $182.90 before giving up some of the gains on Tuesday. The 16.40 billion share company needs a $182.86 a share price to be at the $3 trillion mark. It had touched a high of $182.88 Monday and $182.90 today.

MADRID (Reuters) - The ride-hailing app Cabify, one of Spain's few 'unicorn' tech startups, risks losing ground to foreign rivals such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) or Bolt in its home base Madrid due to a row over exclusivity with a company which employs 1,100 of its drivers.
Entrepreneur Felix Ruiz, co-founder of the privately-held firm Auro which owns the cars and licences and employs the drivers, told Reuters Auro had decided to switch them to either Uber or Bolt or both from Jan. 20.
The Spanish company could fall to No.2 in its home turf, as Cabify and Uber have about the same market share in Madrid, according to Auro estimates.
Uber and Cabify declined to comment on their respective market shares. 
On Monday, Cabify said that an arbitration court ruling in June obliged Auro's fleet to keep working with the app, but Ruiz, although acknowledging that Cabify had won the arbitration, said the contract with Cabify had been cancelled and his company was prepared to defend its decision in courts.
Ruiz doubted the two could still reach an agreement.
""We are not aligned,"" he said, adding that he considered Cabify's rival Uber to be ""more efficient as its algorithm allows for higher earnings"", while Bolt's advantage was charging less in a bid to gain market share. 
Auro's pool of 2,500 delivery riders is already working with Uber Eats and other retailers.
Madrid, where Cabify started operating a decade ago, has about 8,000 vehicles licensed for ride-hailing services, and competition is rife between apps which have been branching out into scooters, bikes and grocery deliveries.

Cabify, which is considering going public but has not announced any firm plan to issue shares yet, had global revenues of $516 million in 2021, and over 5.4 million registered users.
It uses the services of 230,000 drivers across its markets in Europe and Latin America. It has 441 direct staff in Spain, according to a recent company presentation.

Rowan, currently CEO at U.S-based Ember Technologies, is taking over just months after Volvo wrapped up its initial public offering, the biggest in Europe last year.
He will face the task of steering the carmaker towards its goal to sell 50% pure electric cars by the middle of this decade and electric cars only by 2030.
""Volvo Cars is going through a rapid transformation of digitalization which is why we wanted to bring in someone with global CEO experience from outside the automotive industry,"" Volvo Chairperson Eric Li said in a statement.
Samuelsson joined Volvo's board in 2010 and has been CEO at the firm for almost 10 years, with his contract coming to an end this year.

Volvo, majority owned by China's Geely Holding, said Samuelsson will stay in his role until Rowan starts in March. He will also leave the board, while continuing as chairman of electric vehicle maker Polestar.
Polestar, in which Volvo owns 49%, aims to go public through a reverse merger with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Gores Guggenheim. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 09:21AM ET</span>",Farming for the climate: Off-season 'cover' crops expand as U.S. growers eye low-carbon future,"By Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois farmer Jack McCormick (NYSE:MKC) planted 350 acres of barley and radishes last fall as part of an off-season crop that he does not intend to harvest. Instead, the crops will be killed off with a weed killer next spring before McCormick plants soybeans in the same dirt.
The barley and radishes will not be used for food, but  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) will pay McCormick for planting them as the so-called cover crops will generate carbon offset credits for the seeds and chemicals maker.
The purpose of cover crops is to restore soil, reduce erosion and to pull climate-warming carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. The carbon trapped in roots and other plant matter left in the soil is measured to create carbon credits that companies can use to offset other pollution. 
The practice shows how the agriculture industry is adapting as a result of climate change. Farmers no longer make money merely by selling crops for food and livestock feed - they may also be paid for the role crops can play in limiting planet-warming emissions.
More and more U.S. farmers are planting cover crops, from grasses like rye and oats to legumes and radishes. While some are converted into biofuels or fed to cattle, most are not harvested because their value is greater if they break down in the soil.
Cover crops are a pillar of regenerative agriculture, and they are generally seen by environmentalists as an improvement over traditional agriculture. It is an approach to farming that aims to restore soil health and curb emissions through crop rotation, livestock grazing, cutting chemical inputs and other practices.
Rob Myers, director for the Center for Regenerative Agriculture at the University of Missouri, estimates cover crop plantings swelled to as much as 22 million acres in 2021. That is up 43% from the 15.4 million acres planted in 2017, according to the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data.
""There are so many things pushing cover crops forward. The carbon payments are the newest thing. We've seen a tremendous farmer interest in soil health,"" he said. 
Myers estimates that by the end of the decade between 40 million and 50 million acres of cover crops will be planted annually.
The surge will likely accelerate as government and private conservation programs expand, experts say. 
An even greater expansion of cover crop acreage in coming years could be a boon to seed and fertilizer companies, though the companies say it is hard to predict which cover crops farmers will decide to plant.
Companies including Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), Land O'Lakes and Cargill Inc have launched carbon farming programs over the past two years that pay growers for capturing carbon by planting cover crops and reducing soil tillage.
Land O'Lakes subsidiary Truterra paid out $4 million to U.S. farmers enrolled in its carbon program in 2021 for efforts the company says trapped 200,000 metric tons of carbon in soils. 
Others are expanding from small pilot programs, including Cargill, which aims to increase its sponsored sustainable farming programs to 10 million acres by the end of the decade, up from around 360,000 acres currently. Seedmaker  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc boosted its carbon offering from three U.S. states to 11 for the 2022 season.
Federal conservation programs have for years paid farmers to set aside environmentally sensitive lands such as flood plains or wildlife habitat, and the Biden administration plans to expand those programs. President Joe Biden's Build Back Better legislation targeted some $28 billion for conservation programs, including up to $5 billion in payments to farmers and landowners for planting cover crops, though the bill's fate remains unclear.
'WANT TO DO IT'
Much of the growth in cover crop plantings to date has been led by a limited number of conservation-conscious farmers pursuing other goals such as soil fertility or water management. Program payments rarely cover the cost of seeds and labor.
""You've got to want to do it,"" said McCormick, who has increased his cover crop acres more than tenfold over the past six years and received his first payment from Bayer this autumn.
""If somebody wants to hand me a couple of bucks an acre for something I'm doing, I'll take it. But I wouldn't do it just for the incentive. I don't think the incentives are great enough,"" he said, adding that his main motivation is the role played by cover crops in improving soil and making his farm more drought tolerant.
Similarly, Ohio farmer Dave Gruenbaum rapidly increased his cover crop plantings beginning five years ago after liquidating his dairy herd, expanding to all of his 1,700 acres in each of the past two years.
""It's about having something green growing year-round,"" he said. ""It's amazing how the soil is changing.""
Gruenbaum enrolled in a program administered by Truterra, which has helped to offset a portion of his planting and labor cost.
Some experts caution that the shift to planting more off-season cover crops could result in narrower planting windows for farmers' main cash crops, particularly if climate change triggers more volatile spring weather.
Cover crop seed shortages are also likely.
""There's an incredible pulse of demand coming ... The demand for seed is going to exceed supply so there's going to be a huge supply challenge,"" Jason Weller, president of Truterra, told an American Seed Trade Association conference in Chicago last month.
While emissions from destroying the crops are minimal, some critics still say the practice will increase applications of farm chemicals as acres expand.

Environmentalists say cover crop planting is still an improvement on traditional agriculture, which normally leaves fields fallow for half the year and foregoes an enormous amount of plants' carbon-capture potential.
""Cover crops can be a really important part of organic and regenerative farming systems,"" said Amanda Starbuck, research director with Food and Water Watch. ""But it all depends on how they're being implemented.""

Investing.com – Warner Music stock (NASDAQ:WMG) slipped 4.2% in Tuesday’s premarket following the news that stakeholder Access Industries and its affiliates will sell 8.56 million shares of the company.
Morgan Stanley, the underwriter to the transaction, will sell the shares from time to time in one or more transactions on Nasdaq, Warner said in a statement.   
The prospect of a rise in the public float of the shares – around 1.6% of the company’s equity – put pressure on the stock. The selling stockholders are disposing all the class A common stock they hold through the offering, the statement said. 
The shares will be sold at $41 apiece, a discount of 4.5% from the stock’s closing price of $42.95 on Monday. Warner is not selling any shares of its own nor will receive any of the proceeds. The company’s equity base comprises over 514 million shares.

Investing.com – Stock in gaming and e-commerce firm Sea (NYSE:SE) plunged nearly 7% in Tuesday’s premarket trading after Tencent Holdings' (OTC:TCEHY)  decision to cut its voting stake to below 10% left it without the support of one of its top backers. 
Tencent (HK:0700) stock closed 0.8% lower in Hong Kong.
The Chinese company and its affiliates, which together hold over 21% stake in Sea, have given notice to convert all their class B ordinary shares into class A, according to a statement by Sea. It did not mention the size of the voting stake previously held by Tencent.
However, once complete, the move will lead to Forrest Li, the founder, chairman and CEO of southeast Asia's most valuable company, having around 57% of voting rights in the company, up from 52% currently. 
Sea is proposing to increase the voting power of each class B ordinary share to 15 votes from three.
The development marks Tencent’s second withdrawal from an online platform in less than a fortnight, against a backdrop of increasing pressure on China's biggest Internet groups from antitrust regulators. Last month, it said it will distribute about 457 million shares of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), worth over $16 billion, in the form of a special dividend to its own shareholders. The exercise will cut Tencent’s holding in JD.com to 2.3% from 17%.

(Reuters) - TuSimple Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it has partnered with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp to use the company's vehicle chips to design and build an advanced autonomous driving computer for its self-driving trucks.
The computer, known as a domain controller in the automotive industry, will be specifically engineered for TuSimple's commercial self-driving trucks, and will power sensor perception and vehicle operation.
Nvidia will provide artificial intelligence expertise and its Drive Orin hardware, a chip specifically designed for autonomous driving capabilities.
The controller powered by Nvidia's chip will be installed in the autonomous trucks TuSimple is currently developing in partnership with manufacturer Navistar (NYSE:NAV), targeted for production in 2024.
""We believe this move provides us a significant competitive advantage in speeding time to market,"" TuSimple Chief Executive Officer Cheng Lu said in a statement.
TuSimple said it will own usage rights to the controller's design, adding that it planned to work with an unnamed third party manufacturer to produce it.
Considered crucial in the development of self-driving, controllers allow automakers to centralize compute-intensive instruments such as cameras, radars and lidar sensors.
Instead of each sensor being equipped with an individual electronic control unit, the domain controller handles computing tasks centrally, saving cost and space and allowing software updates to take place remotely.

Other chipmakers, including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Mobileye (F:0ME) and NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) are also offering domain controller chips for the automotive industry.
Self-driving freight trucks, while still operating largely in pilot projects, have become a focus of the autonomous industry in recent years, facing fewer regulatory and technological hurdles and potentially offering a faster way to generate returns than passenger robotaxis.

The company said it will now make 150,000 units of the vehicle every year at its Dearborn factory in Michigan to meet soaring customer demand.
Beginning Thursday, the company will invite the first group of reservation holders to place their orders for the F-150 Lightning. Reservation holders are being asked to watch for an invitation via email or log into their Ford account over the next few months. Those who don’t receive invitations to convert for the 2022 model year will have an opportunity to order a future model year vehicle in due course, the company said.
Ford recently announced the tripling of production for the Mustang Mach-E and expects to reach 200,000-plus units per year by 2023. Ford’s all-electric van, the E-Transit, goes on sale early this year.
The automaker’s pivot to electric vehicles – it is investing more than $30 billion in them through 2025 – has been rewarded well by the market. It was S&P 500’s fifth best stock in 2021, and surpassed General Motors' (NYSE:GM) market cap for the first time since 2016.

1615,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 07:00AM ET</span>",Are 2021’s 3 Best Performing Asian Stock Markets Still Buys In 2022?,"By Nick Chen
Investing.com - In looking back on 2021, we can see the tug of war between fighting the pandemic and maintaining an open economy as a global game. How countries responded to COVID-19 and how they struck a balance between the pandemic and openness became an important factor in the divergence of global stock indices.
Major global stock indices finished up overall. In Asia, Vietnam, India, and Taiwan were the three best performing stock markets last year, with Vietnam’s VN 30 up 43% for the year, India’s Nifty 50 up 24%, India’s BSE Sensex 30 up 22%, and the Taiwan Weighted Index up 24%.
Therefore, this article will focus on the reasons for the bright performance of the three major stock markets in Vietnam, India and Taiwan in 2021 and whether investors can still invest profitably in these markets in 2022.
Vietnam's performance on pandemic prevention and control was a global model. But as we entered 2021, the outbreak in Vietnam increased dramatically, with the Delta mutant strain beginning to wreak havoc in May and the capital city of Ho Chi Minh City undergoing several social lockdowns. Surprisingly, however, the Vietnamese stock market was not greatly affected, with the VN30 index rising all the way to a new all-time high on Nov. 26.
Just like the meme stock boom in the U.S. that emerged in January and left a large mark on 2021, the contribution of domestic retail investors is a big part of what made the Vietnamese stock market so hot. According to local media reports, data from the Vietnam Securities Depository showed that in November 2021, the number of new accounts opened in the Vietnamese stock market exceeded 220,000, up 70% from a year earlier, setting a new single-month high. By the end of November, the overall total number of securities account openings in Vietnam reached 4.03 million, already accounting for 4.09% of the country's total population. By December, retail investors had opened 1.3 million accounts in Vietnam, three times the number in 2020.
Interestingly, the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Vietnam, saw its system break down on June 1, forcing it to close for half a day due to excessive trading volume caused by the influx of retail investors.
As a barometer of the national economy, the rapid rise of the stock market in the long run is certainly inseparable from the support of the economy. Some market participants believe that although Vietnam's GDP fell by 6.17% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, the largest quarterly decline on record, the fundamentals of Vietnam's economy are positive in the long run, so the long-term performance of Vietnam's stock market should also be positive.
The Vietnamese government, as well as local institutions, are optimistic about a strong rebound in Vietnam's economy this year. Vina Capital, a local Vietnamese investment firm, expects Vietnam's GDP growth to soar from 2.5% in 2021 to more than 7% in 2022, while the Vietnamese government set a 2022 GDP growth target of 6-6.5% year-on-year in October.
Currently, Vietnam is following the path of the ""East Asian model,"" a government-led, export-led economic development model that has been practiced by East Asian countries in the past. During the pandemic, Vietnam became an integral part of the global supply chain reconstruction, and analysts believe that Vietnam's demographics, position in the Asian production chain and attractive valuations provide upside for stocks.
It is important to be aware of the fact that as Vietnam's stock market has been rising, foreign investors have been selling stocks. Bloomberg data shows that a record $2.7 billion worth of stock was sold in Vietnam's stock market in 2021.
Similar to Vietnam, the coronavirus pandemic has posed a serious challenge to the Indian economy.
In order to reverse the economic downturn, India injected liquidity into the market by maintaining low interest rates, and the Reserve Bank of India kept the key repo rate at a record low of 4% throughout 2021. In terms of funding, there was no shortage of money in the Indian stock market, and it was expected that the stock market would move higher throughout the year.
It is also worth noting for investors that at India's Independence Day celebrations on August 15, 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India would launch a INR100 trillion infrastructure plan in order to adapt to and recover from the pandemic and its economic impact. Market participants observed that the majority of the infrastructure plan is focused on transportation construction, with half of the overall funds invested in railroads and roads. Therefore, our next conclusion is that in addition to the economy getting a boost, the Indian stock market will also benefit a lot from the infrastructure plan, especially the infrastructure sector stocks.
Nomura Securities also mentioned the Indian stock market in its 2022 stock market outlook. The bank said it continues to reiterate its ""neutral"" rating on Indian equities for 2022, saying that the strong performance of Indian equities in 2021 has attracted its attention. Nomura believes that the strong earnings of Indian companies in 2022 can support the high price-to-earnings ratio of Indian stocks.
In May, Taiwan stocks plunged more than 8% at one point, the biggest drop ever, due to panic over the Delta strain of the Covid-19 coronavirus, but they bottomed out as pandemic fears dissipated.
Looking at the data, since 2019, Taiwan stocks have gained more than 20% for three consecutive years, with a three-year cumulative gain of more than 90%. Unlike Vietnam and India, Taiwan's surge in 2021 is mainly due to the global semiconductor crisis.
The Taiwan Weighted Index, a benchmark index for Taiwan stocks, is compiled by weighting stocks by market capitalization, with the larger the market capitalization, the greater the impact on the index. The top three constituents of the Taiwan Weighted Index are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM), MediaTek Inc (TW:2454), and  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317), which account for one-third of the overall market capitalization of the broad market. Therefore, these three stocks have a big impact on the performance of the Taiwan Weighted Index. In 2021, TSMC, MediaTek, and Hon Hai shares rose 16%, 59%, and 13%, respectively.
By the numbers, TSMC and MediaTek have been on a fierce roll. TSMC's third quarter revenue rose 22.6% year-over-year to $14.88 billion, and third quarter net profit rose 20% year-over-year to $5.614 billion, with single-quarter revenue and net profit both hitting record highs. MediaTek has topped the global smartphone system on chip market share for four consecutive quarter, since the second half of 2020, with an impressive 43% share in the second quarter of this year, a jump of 17 percentage points year-on-year.
Even as the semiconductor industry continues to boom, the semiconductor crisis remains a major challenge, but Taiwan's stock market is still worth investing in this year. HSBC Global Private Bank, in its outlook report for 2022 released late in the year, continued to be optimistic that Taiwan will continue to benefit from the growth of the global semiconductor industry. The bank's North Asia investment director He Weihua pointed out that some semiconductor companies increased prices in 2021 and the benefits will be reflected in 2022. In addition, the semiconductor industry has a wide range of end markets, including big data, 5G, AI, medical technology, financial technology, meta-universe and other areas, which all have room for growth, therefore, there is reason to stay bullish on semiconductors and Taiwan stocks.
U.S. wealth management firm Prudential advised investors to buy stocks affected by the pandemic, such as textiles, travel, and tourism. At the same time, the agency also mentioned that Taiwan stocks may drop in anticipation of the U.S. Fed’s interest rate hikes, though historically they recover to hit new highs after the hikes are made. 
Although the outlook for 2022 for the three major Asian stock markets mentioned above is positive, there is no denying that risks are also increasing in the market.
On the one hand, the global pandemic has yet to see its end due to the continued emergence of new coronavirus mutant strains. In the medium to long term, the pandemic will be the ""sword of Damocles"" hanging over the market, and global stock markets, including Asian stocks, will be affected by this uncertainty.
On the other hand, global central banks have already started the process of tightening monetary policy, and liquidity is one of the potential risks to the stock market this year. In December, the Federal Reserve hinted at at least three interest rate hikes in 2022, the Bank of England raised interest rates by 15 basis points, and the Norwegian central bank announced an increase in interest rates. For India, Vietnam, Taiwan and other emerging markets, international ""hot money"" may exit, which would cause stock market returns to decline.
An economist at the American Enterprise Institute pointed out in an interview with Xinhua that expectations of rising interest rates in the U.S. this year have led to a gradual reduction in international capital flows to emerging markets, and if the Fed raises interest rates faster than the market expects, international capital will accelerate the flow back to the U.S. from emerging markets, and emerging economies will face serious challenges.
Historically, in 2013, when the Federal Reserve began to scale back its asset purchase program it triggered a “taper tantrum” where Asian emerging market economies experienced capital outflows and currency devaluations. It remains to be seen if history will repeat in 2022.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Tuesday, continuing the start of year rally based on faith in sustained growth and earnings momentum, looking through the short-term surge in Omicron Covid cases.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 125 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 0.4%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 50 points, or 0.3%.
The major indices closed higher on Monday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining almost 250 points, or 0.7%, to close at a record high. The broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.6%, also to a record close, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared 1.2%.
This fast start to the new year followed last week’s strong close to 2021, which allowed the S&P 500 to close with a gain of nearly 27% in 2021.
Recent U.S. economic data have pointed to a robust recovery, and this week includes a set of numbers that will provide important signposts for the state of the labor market at the start of a year of potential Federal Reserve policy tightening.
The November Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey is due at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT), and precedes Wednesday’s ADP payrolls release for December, Thursday’s weekly initial jobless claims and Friday’s official nonfarm payrolls report. 
The U.S. registered a record number of new Covid cases on Monday, with a total of over a million infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Turning to the corporate sector, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are likely to be in the spotlight after agreeing Monday to delay the rollout of a new 5G service until Jan. 19. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also likely to be in focus after the iPhone maker topped the $3 trillion threshold in market value, a little more than one year after breaking through the $2 trillion mark, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it has opened a showroom in Xinjiang, making it the latest foreign firm to be caught up in controversy over alleged human rights abuses in the far-western Chinese region.
Oil prices edged higher ahead of a meeting of top producers to discuss future output levels.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping called OPEC+, will meet virtually later in the day, with the cartel expected to stick to its plan to increase output by 400,000 barrels per day in February. The group has fallen short of its quota allowances repeatedly in recent months, despite its official policy proclamations.
Investors also await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.

Investing.com – Airline shares traded higher in premarket Tuesday as diminishing concerns about the impact of Omicron and a truce with telecom companies overcame the headwinds confronting the sector.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were up 1% each while both Delta Air (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest (NYSE:LUV) gained 0.8%.
While daily infections touched a record 1 million Monday in U.S., that hasn’t as yet resulted in higher hospitalizations in most places, giving rise to hopes that Omicron won't overwhelm healthcare systems and cause damaging lockdowns. Concerns about the new mutant have ebbed for other reasons too -- with approvals to boosters and two oral drugs in place.  
However, Covid-related absenteeism led thousands of additional U.S. flights to be canceled Monday. Tuesday is expected to be no different with Delta planning to cancel an additional 200 flights on the day after cancelling 4% of its schedule the previous day, according to The Wall Street Journal.
American Airlines cancelled 5% of its schedule Monday and United Airlines 6%.
The disruption would have been more severe had the telecom companies not agreed to delay the rollout of a new 5G service. The airlines had threatened to sue the wireless carriers if they went ahead with the launch plans. That prospect will have to wait for at least two weeks.
In the event of telecom firms going ahead with the rollout, the Federal Aviation Administration had prepared to issue flight restrictions that would have hampered both passenger and cargo flights in the country. That prospect is off the table for now while aviation regulators try address safety concerns at airports arising from the use of new frequencies by 5G carriers.

The ruling came after Future urged a New Delhi judge that given India's antitrust agency had suspended a 2019 deal used by Amazon to assert rights over Future, there was no legal basis for the arbitration between the two sides to continue.
Justice Amit Bansal at the Delhi High Court said on Tuesday that the filings were dismissed, without giving any further details.
A written order will be released later Tuesday.

Amazon and Future have been locked in legal battles for several months. The U.S. company has successfully used the terms of its $200 million investment in a Future unit in 2019 to block the Indian retailer's attempt to sell retail assets to rival Reliance Industries, alleging breach of certain contracts.
Future denies any wrongdoing.

Investing.com – Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock and AT&T stock (NYSE:T) both rose in Tuesday’s premarket trading on hopes of an amicable settlement with U.S. authorities and airlines over the launch of new 5G services.
After first ignoring the advice of the Department of Transportation, both the firms agreed Monday to delay the rollout of a new 5G service until January 19. This is expected to give aviation regulators time to address safety concerns at airports arising from the use of new frequencies by 5G carriers. The telecom carriers have offered to reduce the power of their new 5G service for six months, beyond levels the companies had previously agreed upon.
The Federal Aviation Administration had prepared to issue flight restrictions that would have hampered both passenger and cargo flights in the country. That prospect is now off the table, at least temporarily.
Verizon was up 0.5% and AT&T was up 0.3% in response.
The launch of new 5G services is crucial for telecom companies, who need to generate returns on the billions of dollars they have invested in prized spectrum bands and network infrastructure.  
According to reports, lobby group Airlines for America had planned to appeal to a federal court to block Wednesday’s 5G rollout, concerned that it could interfere with cockpit safety systems.
Interference between spectrum bands used by different end-users for their services is a long-standing issue, particularly between telecom service providers and airlines. "
1621,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 04:26AM ET</span>",China to order cybersecurity reviews for some firms seeking overseas listings,"By Brenda Goh and Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China said on Tuesday it will put in force new rules to increase its oversight of plans by Chinese platform firms to list on overseas stock markets in the latest move to tighten its grip on its sprawling technology sector.
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said the new rules come into effect on Feb. 15 and require platform companies with data on more than 1 million users to undergo a security review before listing their shares overseas.
""With stock market listings there is a risk that key information infrastructure, core data, important data or a large amount of personal information could be impacted, controlled or maliciously used by foreign governments,"" said the CAC in a statement, reiterating a concern flagged in July when the changes were first proposed. https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-widens-clampdown-overseas-listings-with-pre-ipo-review-firms-with-large-2021-07-10
In a separate statement, the CAC said it would also implement new rules on March 1 on the use of algorithm recommendation technology to increase oversight of news providers that use the technology to disseminate information. The rules will also give users the right to switch off the service if they choose.
Both sets of rules were proposed last year and are expected to potentially impact a large swathe of companies, such as TikTok owner ByteDance, e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and many more smaller players. 
ByteDance and Alibaba did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.
The CAC move comes amid a slew of regulatory changes in China over the past year that have dampened the appetite of firms to list overseas but bankers hope the new rules will provide more clarity in 2022.
The CAC did not specify whether the rules will apply to companies seeking listings in Hong Kong. 
But lawyers and bankers said that based on the wording of the rules, it appeared that Chinese companies with more than 1 million users seeking to list in the city would not be required to seek the cybersecurity review.
""Hong Kong is being treated as part of China, offshore though not foreign market, and this paves the way for more deals to return to Hong Kong,"" one investment banker at a Western institution told Reuters, asking not be named as he was not permitted to speak to the media.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index closed up 0.06% after trading in negative territory for most of the session but the city's tech index lost 1.04%. 
Shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, the operator of the Hong Kong stock exchange, closed down 1.1%. They fell as much as 2.4% following the announcement.
""If this is not retrospective then it would only affect listing aspirants and not companies already listed. Having said that, companies in the latter camp already have a lot on their minds,"" said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at investment adviser United First Partners in Singapore.
The rules published on Tuesday did not specify whether the planned changes would be retrospective.
NARROWED SCOPE
Alex Roberts, who tracks data policy at law firm Linklaters in Shanghai, said the new rules appeared to have shrunk the scope of the companies likely to be affected by the changes, as compared to the proposal made in July.
""The most significant change in these cybersecurity review measures seems to be the narrowing of the review's application to only critical information providers, data processors that may impact national security, or platform operators holding over 1 million individuals' personal data,"" said Roberts.
Based on the rules, however, it was still not clear which types of companies would be affected, he added.
""This ambiguity will be a real concern for successful multi-channel businesses in China's digital economy given the current uncertainty of the review process.""
The CAC changes come after a slew of recent moves by Chinese authorities to boost oversight of Chinese companies' offshore listings.

China's state planner said last week it would demand regulatory clearance https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tightens-scrutiny-offshore-listings-sectors-off-limits-foreign-investment-2021-12-27 for overseas Chinese listings in sensitive sectors such as internet news and publishing.
Separately, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on Dec. 24 it would require companies wishing to list overseas to submit filings to the agency first for registration, under a system that also involves close coordination among various regulatory bodies.

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 04:26AM ET</span>","Verizon, AT&T to delay 5G deployment, averting aviation standoff","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) said late on Monday they had agreed to a two-week delay in deploying C-Band wireless spectrum, averting an aviation safety standoff that threatened to disrupt flights starting this week.
The carriers had faced pressure from the White House, airlines and aviation unions to delay the deployment amid concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters that could disrupt flights.
The agreement pushes back the deployment date to Jan. 19. Verizon said the delay ""promises the certainty of bringing this nation our game-changing 5G network in January."" AT&T said it agreed to the delay at the request of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
""We know aviation safety and 5G can co-exist and we are confident further collaboration and technical assessment will allay any issues,"" AT&T said.
Over the next two weeks, regulators, airlines and wireless carriers will look at ways of minimizing the potential impact of interference on flight operations. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) praised the wireless carriers agreeing to a delay and the safety measures they offered. ""We look forward to using the additional time and space to reduce flight disruptions associated with this 5G deployment,"" the FAA said.  Earlier on Monday, groups representing U.S. airlines, aircraft manufacturers and airports had urged the White House to intervene to delay the use by wireless carriers of C-Band spectrum for 5G, which the carriers won in an $80 billion government auction.
The delay came after the chief executives of AT&T and Verizon on Sunday had rejected a request to push back the planned Jan. 5 introduction of new 5G wireless service over aviation safety concerns but offered to temporarily adopt new safeguards.
Buttigieg and FAA chief Steve Dickson had asked AT&T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg on Friday for a delay of up to two weeks. 
In December, the FAA warned that interference from the planned use of 5G wireless spectrum posed an air safety risk and could result in flight diversions. But it had not yet issued formal notices that would further outline potential impacts.
AT&T and Verizon in November had agreed to delay the commercial launch of C-band wireless service for 30 days to Jan. 5 and to temporarily adopt some safeguards.
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, had said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that ""if medicine delivered to hospitals and homes is delayed"" Verizon would be responsible.
""If passengers are stranded, thank @Verizon,"" Nelson said. ""Their incentive is money. Our incentive is safety. It’s the purest form of profits over people.""

The wireless companies Sunday said they would not deploy 5G around airports for six months and said it was comparable to safeguards employed in France but had rejected any broader limitation on using C-Band spectrum. That exclusion zone around airports is not as large as the FAA wants.
The trade group Airlines for America, representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and other carriers, had asked the Federal Communications Commission to halt deployment around many airports, warning thousands of flights could be disrupted daily.

Reinsurers insure the insurers, and reinsurance rate rises are often passed onto insurers' customers.
Flooding in July in Germany and other countries including Austria, Belgium and Switzerland caused over 12 billion euros ($13.55 billion) in insured losses, Gallagher Re said in the report on renewals on one of the most important dates in the reinsurance calendar.
Europe also suffered heavy hail and other storm damage last year.
In areas hit by natural catastrophes, reinsurance rates in Germany rose by between 15% and more than 50%, with the same rate rises in Europe as a whole. In Switzerland, such rates rose between 20% and over 50%.
""Reinsurers have managed to achieve further improvements in pricing to build on the increases of the past 18 months,"" said James Kent, global CEO of Gallagher Re.
Some reinsurers cut their exposure to the region, Gallagher Re said.
In the United States, which last year suffered a major winter storm as well as wildfires, hurricanes and tornadoes, rates rose 10-25% for catastrophe-hit areas.
Natural catastrophes caused global insured losses of $105 billion last year, the fourth highest on record, reinsurer Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) said last month.

Global property catastrophe reinsurance rates rose by 10.8% on average this year, reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter said in a separate report this week.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, continuing the positive start to the new year with strong German retail sales boosting hopes of a steady economic recovery despite a surge in Covid-19 cases. 
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7% to an all-time high, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 1.3%. The pan-European STOXX 600 also climbed to a record, up 0.9%.
German retail sales rose unexpectedly in November, climbing 0.6% on the month, lifting annual retail sales to a record high despite renewed Covid-19 restrictions which held back a consumer-led recovery in Europe's largest economy.
French inflation also stabilized in December, with the 3.4% year-on-year increase in the Eurozone’s second largest economy slightly less than the 3.5% expected. The European Central Bank has argued that price pressures may be near their peak in the Eurozone, and the French figures support that view. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday that the country's growth would be significantly higher this year than the government's current forecast of 6.25%.
This optimism, which added to data earlier showing an improvement in China’s factory activity in December, exists despite the continued uncertainty around the Covid-19 pandemic, with many European countries, as well as the U.S., reporting record numbers of daily cases, prompting the reimposition of restrictions to stop the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant. 
European indices posted strong gains on Monday, the first trading day of the new year, with the STOXX 600 index ending at a record close. Wall Street followed suit, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closing at record levels, while Asia was largely on the front foot Tuesday.
In corporate news,  Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) stock rose 0.4% after a U.S. court of appeals upheld the validity of a patent for the Swiss drugmaker’s multiple sclerosis treatment Gilenya.

Under Tim Cook, who in 2011 became chief executive following Jobs' death, Apple has sharply increased its revenue from services like video streaming and music. That helped Apple reduce its reliance on the iPhone to about 52% of total revenue in fiscal 2021 from over 60% in 2018, pleasing investors worried the company relied too much on its top-selling product. 
Still, some investors worry Apple is hitting the limits of how much it can expand its user base and how much cash it can squeeze from each user, with no guarantees that future product categories will prove as lucrative as the iPhone.
The rapid embrace of technologies such as 5G, virtual reality and artificial intelligence has also increased the allure of Apple and other Big Tech companies.
In China, the world's largest smartphone market, Apple continued to lead for the second straight month, beating rivals such as Vivo and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), recent data from CounterPoint Research showed. 
With Tesla now the world's most valuable automaker as Wall Street bets heavily on electric cars, many investors expect Apple to launch its own vehicle within the next few years.

""The icing on the cake, which may turn out to be the cake, is the potential for an EV car,"" Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management said.
Just as Apple's market capitalization hits the $3 trillion milestone, its share price as a percentage of the Nasdaq 100 index's value is bumping up against a key technical level. In recent prior times, the stock price has risen above such a level and then subsequently declined.

U.S. 10-year break-even rates -- which are market estimates for the average rate of inflation over the next decade -- climbed to as high as 2.65% on Tuesday, the most since November, and up from as low as 2.36% on Dec. 14. The extra yield on Treasury 10-year notes over two-year securities also jumped, indicating the bias may be switching back to a steeper yield curve.
The U.S. announced a new daily record of more than 1 million virus cases on Monday, further damping optimism that supply chains will return to normalcy in the near future. The annual U.S. inflation rate has climbed for three straight months to reach a four-decade high of 6.8% in November.
“Inflation continues to be the major theme of the market given life with the coronavirus,” said Makoto Noji, chief currency and foreign bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. There is speculation that “the widening spread of the virus will lead to a decline in labor participation and supply constraints,” he wrote in a research note.
Overnight-index swaps are now suggesting the Federal Reserve will start to raise its policy rate as soon as May, earlier than the July liftoff projected a month ago.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Tuesday morning, despite the S&P5 500’s record close to kick off the first trading day of 2022 in the U.S.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.64% by 10:09 PM ET (3:09 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.09%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index for December was a better-than-expected 50.9.
Separate data showed that property companies saw sales drop in 2021 could lead to further policy easing, which contributed to the drop in Chinese shares.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.46%, following its worst start to the year since 2019 on Monday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.37%, while South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.37%. In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.59%.
The Japanese, Chinese and Australian markets all re-opened after a holiday.
In benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, the yield on the 10-year note topped 1.60%, the worst start to a year since 2009, as investors brace for a slew of U.S. Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes throughout the year.
Increasing volatility is also likely as the market kicks off 2022. Some investors expect headwinds from the omicron COVID-19 variant, supply-chain disruptions, and more central banks tightening their monetary policies that drove a third year of double-digit returns for equities.
“We expect 2022 to be far more challenging from an investment perspective,” Bel Air Investment Advisors vice president Heather Wald said in a note.
“Rarely has a market delivered three consecutive years of double-digit returns, as we have seen from 2019 to 2021. With the Fed set to accelerate tightening and a fairly valued stock market, we anticipate more muted returns for the S&P in 2022 but still expect equities to remain attractive versus other liquid asset classes,” the note added.
U.S. data, including December’s job report and the minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, could justify an earlier-than-expected monetary policy tightening. The Fed minutes will be released on Wednesday, with the jobs report, which includes non-farm payrolls, due on Friday.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will discuss the U.S. economy and monetary policy at an event on Thursday, and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly will discuss monetary policy on a panel a day later.

The pipeline, led by Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), has been completed since September and is waiting for final certification by the German network agency, which has said that no decision would be taken in the first half of 2022.
This has burdened diplomatic relations that are already strained by the risk of open conflict between Russia and Ukraine, fuelling speculation the pipeline could be used to exert political pressure on Moscow.
""I don't see any political interference, the network agency is reviewing as planned. It could happen in mid-2022. Nord Stream 2 is important,"" Klaus-Dieter Maubach, CEO of Uniper, told Germany's Rheinische Post.
Uniper is among five European energy firms - the others being Wintershall Dea, Shell (LON:RDSa), OMV and Engie - that have paid half of the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 has cost.

""Every additional import possibility helps to ease the situation in the gas market,"" Maubach said.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc's shares started the year with stellar gains after the electric carmaker reported record deliveries for the fourth quarter, allaying fears of supply chain woes that have hit automakers.
Shares of the world's most valuable carmaker ended up 13.5% at $1,199.78 each on Monday, marking the biggest daily percentage gain in nearly 10 months. 
Analysts expect the strong delivery numbers to bolster 2022 expectations and see the pace of expansion of its new factories in Berlin and Texas to be large determinants.
""We expect a gradual ramp of Berlin and Austin and anticipate those ramps will lead to a deceleration of exports from Shanghai, many of which have been bound for Europe in 2021,"" Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said. 
The company, like others, faces component shortages as a global logistics crunch and factory closures due to the pandemic limited supply. But Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) managed to overcome much of the problems by reprogramming software to use less scarce chips.
Tesla delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, higher than analysts' forecasts of 263,026 vehicles, which includes its Model 3 compact cars and Model Y sport-utility vehicles and flagship Model S and Model X vehicles, the company reported on Sunday.
RBC Capital Markets revised its quarterly revenue estimate, bumping it up by $2.3 billion. J.P. Morgan boosted its profit estimates.
Still, analysts said Tesla has a lot to watch out for in 2022 as competition heats up with several startup EV companies scheduled to launch their first cars on the road. Legacy automakers such as Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM) also are shifting focus to electric cars.

""We see 2022 being a more challenging year than 2021 was in light of increasing competition, and we believe the design of the four vehicles on the road are getting long in the tooth which likely decelerates growth,"" Osborne said.
Some analysts also said Tesla's stock is over-valued, given its relatively smaller production volume. Tesla, which produced some 930,000 vehicles last year, is about four times more valuable than  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) which aims to produce 9 million vehicles in the year that ends in March.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) temporarily shut almost 60 U.S. stores in COVID-19 hotspots in December to sanitize them against the virus, in a sign the new Omicron variant is disrupting the retail industry. 
The Walmart stores – in locations including Texas and New Jersey – were closed for two days for cleaning “to present a safe and clean in-store environment for our associates and customers,"" a company spokesperson told Reuters in a statement. Walmart has more than 4,700 U.S. locations in total. 
The company made no comment on the potential impact of the closures.
It adopted a policy two years ago at the start of the coronavirus pandemic of closing stores for fewer than two days to “get ahead” of potential outbreaks.
“We’ve been closely monitoring our stores across the country, making the decision to temporarily close locations on a store-by-store basis through a collection of market-related data,” the Walmart spokesperson said, declining to confirm that there were staff COVID-19 cases at the closed locations. 
The world’s biggest retailer also did not comment on whether it was seeing an increase in workers testing positive for COVID-19.
The United States has seen a spike in cases of the Omicron variant, leading retailers and restaurant chains to temporarily shutter stores and limit access to customers.
One Laurel, Maryland, Walmart facility was closed last week because that community was experiencing coronavirus cases, according to a memo shown to Reuters by two Walmart workers. They said several people at the store had contracted COVID-19, which Walmart declined to confirm. If COVID-related store closures disrupt Walmart’s operations into late January, they could begin to worry some investors, said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, which invests in Walmart,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and several other retailers. Walmart rival Target told Reuters it had not closed any Target stores for sanitization or other COVID-related reasons since the start of December. CVS said it had temporarily closed “fewer than 10 locations” for “enhanced cleaning” in that period. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that retailers “close off areas used by the person who is sick and do not use those areas until after cleaning and disinfecting”. The CDC does not strictly recommend shutting stores. Rising COVID-19 cases led Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to limit service at some New York-area stores, including its iconic Fifth Avenue flagship. The iPhone maker reduced operational hours from Monday to Thursday and limited the number of customers allowed into the store, according to its website. The site also showed that some Apple stores were temporarily closed in Georgia, Tennessee and California. 

It was not immediately clear why the stores were shut and Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Apple gets about 5% of its total sales from its retail locations, according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. With 516 stores around the world, that amounts to about $35 million in sales per store, according to Reuters calculations. Some restaurant owners said their businesses have been affected, too. In mid-December, when COVID-19 cases began to skyrocket in New York City, pizzeria Bravo Pizza was forced to close for an entire day because six employees were out sick, Bravo’s owner said. Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, said “dozens” of the city’s restaurants had temporarily closed.
Dan Jacobs, co-owner of DanDan and two other Milwaukee restaurants, said his locations lost $80,000 of business between Christmas and New Year’s Day as staff caught COVID-19 or called out because they were afraid of getting sick.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average posted closing record highs on the first trading day of the year on Monday, helped by gains in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and bank shares.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) became the first company to hit a $3 trillion market capitalization but ended the day slightly below that. Its shares ended up 2.5% at $182.01 after rising as high as $182.88 during the session.
Tesla's shares jumped 13.5% after the electric car maker's quarterly deliveries beat analysts' estimates, riding out global chip shortages as it ramped up production in China.
The two stocks gave the biggest boosts to the S&P 500, but market watchers said easing investor worries about the economic impact of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus also helped market sentiment, even with rising COVID-19 case numbers.
""The real news is people feel like this latest round of COVID is not going to be economically debilitating in that a lot of restrictions and lockdowns are going to be required,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.
Among the latest developments, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a third dose of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 12 to 15.
Thousands of U.S. schools have delayed this week's scheduled return to classrooms following the holiday break or switched to remote learning as the Omicron variant drives record levels of COVID-19.
Massocca said market strength is not surprising as a new year starts, given the January effect, or belief by some investors that stocks will rise that month more than in other months.
""It bodes well to see the market so resilient,"" he said.
All of Wall Street's main indexes ended 2021 with monthly, quarterly and annual gains, recording their biggest three-year advance since 1999.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 246.76 points, or 0.68%, to 36,585.06; the S&P 500 gained 30.38 points, or 0.64%, at 4,796.56; and the Nasdaq Composite added 187.83 points, or 1.2%, at 15,832.80.
Energy and financial sectors were among top gainers, with bank shares rising along with U.S. Treasury yields as investors braced for what could be an earlier-than-expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year despite the recent jump in COVID-19 cases.
Energy shares climbed with crude oil prices and upbeat prospects for demand.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)'s shares advanced 5.7%, also helped by their upgrade to ""overweight"" by  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The benchmark S&P 500 added 27% in 2021 and reported 70 record-high closes, its the second-most ever, in a tumultuous year hit by new COVID-19 variants and supply chain shortages.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 89 new highs and 55 new lows.

The company was expected to deliver between 133 and 139 jets in 2021.
Last year, two new countries – Switzerland and Finland – selected Lockheed's F-35 for their new fighter jet programs. The company added that Denmark received its first F-35 in 2021 and the Royal Netherlands Air Force became the eighth nation to declare their F-35 fleet ready for initial operational capability.
Finland in December said it planned to order 64 F-35 fighter jets with weapons systems in a $9.4 billion deal. Earlier last year, Switzerland had picked Lockheed's F-35A Lightning II as its next-generation fighter jet.

In 2022, Lockheed plans to deliver 151 to 153 of the fighter aircraft, fewer than the 169 jets it had hoped to deliver. The weapons maker also said it was expecting to deliver 156 aircraft to the U.S. beginning 2023 and for the ""foreseeable future"".

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Monday ordered mediation in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy, calling for the company, the Sackler family members that own it and nine states to determine whether they can reach a new opioid litigation settlement by Jan. 14.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, issued an order directing the parties to negotiate changes to a previous deal rejected by another judge in December that provided the Sacklers protection against future opioid litigation. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman is serving as the mediator.
If they do not reach agreement by then, the mediation will end and an appeal by Purdue against the deal's rejection will continue.
Chapman presided over prior mediation that led to the earlier settlement, under which the Sacklers said they would contribute $4.5 billion to Purdue’s reorganization plan, which directs money toward opioid abatement programs. In exchange, the Sacklers, who have denied wrongdoing, received legal protections known as nondebtor releases.
Purdue, the maker of OxyContin, filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and the Sacklers of fueling the opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing.
Representatives for the Sacklers and Purdue did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a lawyer representing most of the states that opposed the prior deal.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon on Dec. 16 reversed Drain's approval of Purdue's reorganization plan and the underlying settlement.

Following McMahon's ruling, Drain urged the parties to negotiate in good faith.
Purdue has taken steps to appeal McMahon's decision to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Starbucks Corp will require its U.S. workers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing in order to comply with new federal mandates, the company said in an update sent to employees on Monday.
The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a new date of Feb. 9 for large employers to require either full vaccination or weekly testing as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads quickly throughout the United States.
The explosion of new cases has sidelined workers across the country, delaying the start of some schools, closing some restaurants and causing major disruptions at airlines.
A company source told Reuters that Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is not currently seeing broad closures of its cafes as a result of Omicron - unlike in the first half of 2020, when the pandemic forced the coffee chain to temporarily shut at least half of its U.S. stores and convert remaining locations to drive-thru and carry-out only.
Starbucks' approximately 220,000 U.S. employees must disclose their vaccination status by Jan. 10, according to a letter from Chief Operating Officer John Culver sent to employees on Dec. 27 and repeated in a weekly update on Monday.

If workers choose not to get vaccinated, they can be tested weekly instead and are responsible for acquiring their own OSHA-approved tests and submitting results.
Starbucks experienced spot outages of certain products - as did many other restaurant chains - last year amid a supply chain crunch ignited by the pandemic.

(Reuters) -The United States will issue new rules and $1 billion in funding this year to support independent meat processors and ranchers as part of a plan to address a lack of “meaningful competition” in the meat sector, President Joe Biden said on Monday.
The initiative comes amid rising concerns that a handful of big beef, pork and poultry companies have too much control over the American meat market, allowing them to dictate wholesale and retail pricing to profit at the expense of their suppliers and customers.
“Capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation,"" Biden said. ""That’s what we’re seeing in meat and poultry industries now.”
A recent White House analysis found that the top four meatpacker companies https://www.reuters.com/business/how-four-big-companies-control-us-beef-industry-2021-06-17 - Cargill,  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN),  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), and National Beef Packing Co - control between 55% and 85% of the market in the hog, cattle, and chicken sectors.
The Department of Agriculture (USDA) will spend the $1 billion from American Rescue Plan funds to expand the independent meat processing sector, including funds for financing grants, guaranteed loans, and worker training, said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who was speaking at an event with Biden.
USDA will also propose rules this year to strengthen enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act and to clarify the meaning of ""Product of USA"" meat labels, which domestic ranchers have said unfairly advantage multinational companies that raise cattle abroad and only slaughter in the United States.
Attorney General Merrick Garland, also speaking at the event, said “too many industries have become too consolidated over time,” and that the antitrust division of the Department of Justice has been chronically underfunded.
The Biden administration issued an executive order last year that advocated a whole of government approach to antitrust issues. 
A central concern in agriculture has been meat prices, which have risen at a time when the White House is fighting inflation. An analysis in December by the White House economic council found a 120% jump in the gross profits of four top meatpackers since the pandemic began. 
The meat industry has said the White House analysis was inaccurate and criticized the new plan.
National Chicken Council President Mike Brown called the plan “a solution in search of a problem.” 
North American Meat Institute spokesperson Sarah Little said staffing plants remains the biggest issue for meatpackers and that the White House plan would not address it. 
“Our members of all sizes cannot operate at capacity because they struggle to employ a long-term stable workforce,” she said. “New capacity and expanded capacity created by the government will have the same problem.”
Eric Deeble, policy director at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, cheered the plan, calling it a “very positive step to ensure farmers and ranchers receive fair prices.”
The anticipated rulemaking under the Packers and Stockyards Act “could have a significant impact,” said Peter Carstensen, emeritus professor of law at University of Wisconsin-Madison and former antitrust attorney at the Department of Justice. But he noted that investment in independent processing itself would not address market concentration.

Austin Frerick, deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, an antitrust research center, said the plan does not go far enough to tackle the power of the top meatpackers.
""I do not believe this (plan) will meaningfully change the concentration numbers,"" he said.

U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan said ""genuine issues of material fact"" remained in dispute in the more than eight-year-old case, including over BlackBerry's accounting, and that ""battle-of-the-experts"" issues precluded her from ruling for one side or the other.
While the BlackBerry 10 won positive reviews from critics, the public preferred Android-based smartphones and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone, eventually leading to BlackBerry's 2016 decision to stop making phones.
Shareholders accused the Waterloo, Ontario-based company, which now focuses on cybersecurity, of concealing BlackBerry 10's true sales prospects in public statements during 2013, resulting in an inflated share price.
McMahon said that while criminal trials will maintain precedence over civil trials in her courthouse during the COVID-19 pandemic, she would ""prioritize"" the BlackBerry case because of its age.
The judge said her ""best guess"" was a trial could begin in September or October.
BlackBerry and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The shareholders' lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Other defendants include former BlackBerry Chief Executive Thorsten Heins, former Chief Financial Officer Brian Bidulka and former Chief Legal Officer Steve Zipperstein.

In her 24-page decision, McMahon did strike four alleged BlackBerry misstatements from the case, saying the shareholders waited too long to object to them.

1645,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 04:30PM ET</span>","Tesla Gains, Apple's Value, Vaccine News: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Stocks rose on the first trading day of 2022, fueled by Apple’s climb above $3 trillion in market value, the first-ever to reach that milestone.
The markets were trying to extend a rally into the new year. Elsewhere, Tesla shares rose 9% after the electric car maker revealed fourth quarter deliveries that were far and away above Wall Street expectations, despite a chip shortage.
Even airline stocks were on the rise despite the cancellation of thousands of flights over the New Year’s weekend, when travelers were trying to return home from holiday trips. The cancellations and delays happened because of winter weather snarling airports across the Midwest and East Coast and staffing shortages because of Covid cases.
Wall Street's main indexes ended 2021 with monthly, quarterly and annual gains, recording their biggest three-year advance since 1999, Reuters reported on Monday.
The S&P 500 rose 27% last year, with 70 record-high closes.
It’s a light week for data and earnings, though Tuesday will see the latest job openings report.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Tesla deliveries
While the news of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s successful fourth quarter in terms of vehicles delivered came out over the weekend, the stock reacted positively on Monday and was likely to continue to react on Tuesday. Stocks and ADRs of Chinese rivals gained as well as their latest sales numbers reflected strong demand for electric vehicles.
Tesla delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, much higher than analysts' forecasts of 263,026 vehicles, according to Reuters.
2. Apple’s meteoric rise
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares topped the $3 trillion threshold in market value on Monday, just a little more than one year after topping the $2 trillion mark. The iPhone maker has shown resilience during the reopening trade despite chip shortages. Analysts believe it sold a record number of iPhones during the last quarter and more positive news is expected this year from a virtual reality headset.
3. Vaccine news
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) continued its momentum after the U.K.’s approval of the company’s Covid-19 pill, which boosts chances of the oral drug finding wider acceptance amid omicron surge.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s nod came Friday. The pill already has the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval.
Meanwhile  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock got dinged after the FDA expanded the use of the Covid-19 booster shots made by rivals  Pfizer and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) for younger teenagers.

Investing.com —  Intevac  Inc (NASDAQ:IVAC) shares rose 20% after it announced the sale of its photonics business to Eotech LLC on Monday.
The supplier of thin-film processing systems said the transaction is valued at up to $100 million, with optical technology company Eotech making a cash payment of $70 million and future earn-out payments of up to $30 million.
Intevac said it will continue its strategic review process and shift its entire focus onto its thin-film equipment business. 
“We are extremely proud of the long history of innovation and leadership that the Photonics team has delivered over the years,” stated Wendell Blonigan, president and CEO officer of Intevac. 
“Intevac Photonics, as envisioned by our late founder Norman Pond, pioneered the night vision technologies that have become the standard for most advanced digital night vision programs for the U.S. military, as well as many foreign nations,"" added Blonigan.
Intevac shares hit a high of $5.98 on Monday, a level that was last seen in August."
1649,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 03:07PM ET</span>",Tesla surmounts supply chain woes with blockbuster Q4 deliveries,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Tesla Inc on Sunday reported record quarterly deliveries that far exceeded Wall Street estimates, riding out global chip shortages as it ramped up China production. 
It was the sixth consecutive quarter that the world's most valuable automaker posted record deliveries. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were up 10% to a one-month high in early trading on Monday.
Tesla, led by billionaire CEO Elon Musk, delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, far higher than analysts' forecasts of 263,026 vehicles.
Tesla's October-December deliveries were up about 70% from a year earlier and nearly 30% higher from record deliveries the preceding quarter. 
""Great work by Tesla team worldwide!"" Musk wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
His electric car company ramped up production in China even though competition rose and regulatory pressure mounted following consumer complaints over product safety. 
Tesla ships China-made models to Europe and some Asian countries. 
On an annual basis, the automaker boosted its deliveries by 87% from a year earlier to 936,172 vehicles in 2021. 
Musk said in October last year that Tesla will be able to maintain an annual growth rate of more than 50% for ""quite a while."" 
NEW FACTORIES 
""They have beaten all the odds,"" Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said on Sunday.
""The first is the demand for their products is through the roof. And the second is they're doing a great job of meeting that demand,"" he said. 
Munster said he expected Tesla's deliveries to grow to 1.3 million vehicles this year despite headwinds in production at its new factories and supply chain problems. 
Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said in October that it was difficult to predict how quickly the company will be able to boost production at new factories in Texas and Berlin, which will use new vehicle technologies and new teams. 
Tesla said in October that it aimed to build its first production cars at both facilities by the end of 2021, but it is not known whether it met that target. Tesla did not respond to a question from Reuters about the plants. Its Berlin factory had initially been scheduled to begin production last summer. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a report on Friday that it expected Tesla to make nearly 1.5 million vehicle deliveries this year, although chip shortages remain a risk to production.
'SUPER CRAZY' SHORTAGES
In 2020, automakers cut chip orders as the pandemic and lockdown measures hit demand. But Tesla never reduced its production forecast with suppliers to support its rapid growth plan, which helped it weather the chip shortage, Kirkhorn has said. 
Tesla, which designs some chips in-house unlike most automakers, also reprogrammed software to use less scarce chips, according to Musk. 
Musk, who previously said, ""2021 has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages,"" said in October that he was optimistic that those issues would pass in 2022.
The strong sales came even after Tesla hiked U.S. vehicle prices sharply this year to offset higher supply chain costs.

Tesla hit over $1 trillion in market capitalization in October after rental car company Hertz said it ordered 100,000 of its vehicles. The company's shares lost some ground after Musk wrote on Twitter in November that he was considering selling 10% of his stake in Tesla.
Overall, Tesla shares gained 50% last year.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 03:06PM ET</span>",U.S. FDA authorizes Pfizer's COVID-19 booster for 12- to 15-year-olds,"By Ahmed Aboulenein and Ankur Banerjee
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized the use of a third dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 15, and narrowed the interval for booster shot eligibility to five months from six.
The agency also authorized a third shot for children aged 5 through 11 years who are immunocompromised.
The regulatory decisions come with COVID-19 cases surging due to the Omicron variant of the virus and just as many workers and school children return from holiday vacations, raising the prospect of overwhelming health systems. Some businesses and schools closed Monday as staff called in sick. 
""Based on the FDA's assessment of currently available data, a booster dose of the currently authorized vaccines may help provide better protection against both the Delta and Omicron variants,"" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
The U.S. government has been urging vaccinated Americans to get boosters and for the unvaccinated, who are at much higher risk of severe COVID-19 and death, to be inoculated.
An advisory panel to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is due to meet on Wednesday to discuss the changes, according to the agency's website.
New U.S. COVID-19 infections have doubled in the last seven days to an average of 418,000 a day, according to a Reuters tally. 
So far, 62% of the eligible U.S. population is considered fully vaccinated with a third of them also having received a booster dose. 
In making its decision, the FDA said it reviewed real-world evidence from Israel, including safety data from more than 6,300 individuals aged 12 through 15 years who received a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least 5 months following completion of the primary two-dose vaccination series. 
Two shots of the mRNA vaccine are about 35% effective against infection from the Omicron variant, but a booster dose restores effectiveness to 75%, according to the CDC, based on data from South Africa and the United Kingdom. 
The FDA will weigh boosters for 5- to 11 year-olds after more children receive two doses, Marks said.
""Last I looked, only about 25% of eligible 5- to 11-year-olds have been vaccinated. So would be great to get a larger percentage of those vaccinated and then we'll see how many months afterwards we need to get them boosted,"" he said during a call with media.
The FDA said giving the shot at 5 months instead of 6 may provide better protection sooner against Omicron. The agency said the interval between  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s second dose and a booster remains unchanged at six months. 
Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said a third shot is essential to protect against Omicron for severe disease.
""A good thing here is also the change on the timing of the booster to five months instead of six. That's a big step for this country, which has been resistant to the data,"" he added.
Countries including the United Kingdom and Israel have narrowed their window for boosters from six months to three or four following the second shot.

Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Health Security, said he does not believe a booster is necessary for most people since two doses of the vaccine have been effective at preventing hospitalizations and severe disease in all but older people. 
""When I work at the hospital, I don't see patients there because they lack a booster. I see patients because they lack first and second doses,"" Adalja said.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday it had reached a settlement agreement with a unit of home rental firm Airbnb Inc for violations of U.S. sanctions on Cuba.
""Airbnb Payments agreed to remit $91,172.29 to settle its potential civil liability for apparent violations of sanctions against Cuba administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC),"" the department said in a notice.
The apparent violations included payments related to guests traveling for reasons outside of OFAC's authorized categories, as well as a failure to keep certain required records associated with Cuba-related transactions, the Treasury Department said.
Airbnb Payments' apparent violations were voluntarily self-disclosed and were non-egregious, the department added.
Airbnb launched its Cuba business in 2015 and the scaling up of its services in Cuba appeared to ""have outpaced the company's ability to manage the associated sanctions risks,"" according to the Treasury Department.

The United States has imposed restrictions on trade with Cuba since the 1960s, the longest-standing U.S. program of economic sanctions.
""We take sanctions compliance very seriously. We are pleased to have reached this agreement with OFAC"", an Airbnb spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Monday.

The tech powerhouse reached the milestone on the first trading day of 2022, taking just over one year to move from a market value of $2 trillion as the pandemic saw consumers continuously turn to tech gadgets during lockdown periods.
Earlier in the session, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives provided positive commentary on Apple for 2022. 
Ives told investors in a research note that demand outstripped supply for the company in December. The analyst added that he believes Apple sold over 40 million iPhones during the holiday season, a record number despite chip shortages. He added that China remains a major source of strength for the company.

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Monday became the first publicly traded company with a stock market value of over $3 trillion, marking the latest milestone in the Silicon Valley heavyweight's spectacular stock surge since introducing the iPhone in 2007.
Apple's shares have climbed around 5,800% since co-founder and former Chief Executive Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in January 2007, far outpacing the S&P 500's gain of about 230% during the same period.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have each briefly eclipsed Apple as the most valuable publicly listed U.S. company in the past three years, although Apple has recently pulled ahead. Microsoft's stock market value currently stands at about $2.5 trillion, while Amazon's is at around $1.7 trillion, having fallen behind Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), now at $1.9 trillion. (Graphic: Apple vs other Big Tech, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplgljzdvb/Pasted%20image%201639173927883.png) 
Several Big Tech firms saw their shares outperform Apple's 2021 gain of 34%. Microsoft and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) both rallied about 50% in 2021, while Alphabet jumped 65% and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) soared 125%, putting the chipmaker's stock market value at over $700 billion. 
Apple now accounts for about 7% of the S&P 500, up from as little as 5% in June and back in line with where it started 2021. (Graphic: Apple's weight in the S&P 500, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mopanqyzqva/Pasted%20image%201639174103861.png) 

Following its 2.9% gain on Monday afternoon, Apple is trading at about 30 times its expected 12-month earnings, down from a multiple of 32 in early 2021 but still at highs not seen since 2008, according to Refinitiv data. (Graphic: Apple's PE valuation, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znvnexjojpl/Pasted%20image%201639174241611.png) 
As Apple's stock has climbed in the past several months, so have analysts' price targets. J.P.Morgan and BofA Global Research in December each raised their price targets for Apple's stock to a street high of $210, according to Refinitiv. That price target would put Apple's market capitalization at about $3.45 trillion.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 02:17PM ET</span>","Analysis-Is Apple worth $3 trillion? Bulls, bears examine the case","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) really worth $3 trillion 16 months after becoming the first company valued at $2 trillion?
The answer depends on how one views the iPhone maker's ability to keep up the unprecedented growth of the past 15 years. In its last fiscal year ended Sept. 25, Apple delivered 33% revenue growth to $365.8 billion thanks to strong demand for 5G iPhone upgrades.
But that growth spurt came after a year of single-digit sales growth and a fiscal 2019 when Apple's sales declined.
The bull case for Apple is that it has built an ecosystem of 1 billion iPhone owners who spend money on services and that it is well-positioned for future categories like self-driving cars and augmented reality. 
The deep discount investors once ascribed to Apple's stock because of its dependence on the iPhone for sales growth has disappeared as Apple has proved that the device sits at the center of an expanding solar system that adds new gadgets like the Apple Watch and Apple AirTags and new, paid services like television and fitness classes.
""Apple has been and still is an incredible growth story anchored by must-have products and a growing portfolio of services. While years ago the stock price was a value investor's dream, I don’t think the current near-record high price should be a sell signal for long-term focused investors,"" said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners.
Moreover, Apple is trading at about 30 times its expected 12-month earnings, down a bit from a multiple of 32 in early 2021 but still at highs not seen since 2008, according to Refinitiv data. Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Apple has been a ""safety stock"" through the pandemic and that investors are likely expecting solid holiday sales.
Apple ""seems to be vaccinated against anything that Omicron can throw at it,"" Eddins said. ""I’m not complacent at this level, but there would have to be some nasty unforeseen events to rock the boat.""
Some analysts believe Apple has plenty of room to grow in coming years, with future products such as the Apple Car. 
""We see the prospects of Apple Car - representing the clearest path to doubling Apple's revenue and market cap - catalyzing a shift in investor narrative back toward the attractiveness of the platform (1 billion loyal customers) and long-term, sustainable growth,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Katy L. Huberty wrote in a November note.
NO GUARANTEES 
The bear case, however, is that Apple is hitting the limits of how much it can grow its user base and how much cash it can squeeze from each user, with no guarantees that future product categories will prove as lucrative as the iPhone.
In a December note to investors, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi warned that Apple's prospects in the augmented and virtual reality category are bright but likely to account for only 4% of its revenue by 2030. Moreover, the entire market for those devices is not likely to near the billion-unit mark until 2040, he wrote.
Sacconaghi also saw ""no obvious catalysts for multiple expansion"" in Apple's stock ""given slower expected growth"" in the next fiscal year. He has a market-perform rating on the stock.
Another concern is uncertainty over Apple's ability to lock in the same profits for paid services on its future hardware. Its App Store business model, which takes commissions on in-app purchases of digital goods, has been targeted by proposed legislation in the United States and Europe.
To be sure, one of the primary drivers of Apple's ballooning valuation is the goal it set in 2018 to get what at the time was nearly $100 billion in net cash off its balance sheet and become net-cash neutral.
That goal, for which Apple never specified a deadline, has been tough to meet because it simply keeps making money. Apple generated $104 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2021 and returned $106.5 billion to shareholders. But its net cash remained at $66 billion at the fiscal year's end.

With big acquisitions largely out of the question under current U.S. antitrust regulators, Apple has had few options but to shovel cash back to shareholders, said Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management and an Apple shareholder.
""They're fighting the fact they've got $100 billion of cash flow a year,"" Plumb said. ""You can't bet against a company that has this type of cash flow.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Jana Partners is increasing pressure on customer service platform Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) to drop plans to buy Momentive Global, the parent of SurveyMonkey, arguing the deal is too expensive and that shareholders oppose it.
Jana said new documents show that the acquisition of Momentive appears to have been made only after Momentive's advisors reached out to Zendesk at the end of August 2021. Jana wrote in a letter to the board, seen by Reuters, that it does not appear to be part of a long-considered strategy.
The New York based firm, which is a top 10 shareholder in Zendesk, also criticized Zendesk's plans to issue equity with a fair value of roughly $6 billion to Momentive shareholders to consummate the deal, the letter said.
Zendesk agreed in late October to buy Momentive in an all-stock deal, which at the time was valued at nearly $4 billion.
A representative for Zendesk was not immediately available for comment.
Zendesk chose to issue the equity at an ""artificially depressed price"" before reporting strong earnings, the letter said. Jana cites Zendesk's financial advisor, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), who calculated Zendesk's fair value at $176 a share, which compares to $103 per share in early trading on Monday. 
Jana also believes even if all goes well with a deal, the payoff would be slim, writing it would add a ""meager 1% to Zendesk's top line growth and about 10% to (its) future stock price""
""Zendesk's proposed acquisition of Momentive appears to be a reactive and impulsive decision,"" the letter said. Jana said it wants Zendesk to stop wasting time and money on a deal that it expects shareholders to reject and urged the board to ""immediately terminate the transaction and pivot to focusing on far more promising avenues to resolve Zendesk’s growing discount."" 
Jana wrote the letter after Zendesk filed its preliminary proxy in early December and roughly one month after the investment firm first pushed the board to scuttle the deal.
Both Zendesk and Momentive investors would have to agree to the deal. The vote is expected to occur in late February or early March.
Jana Partners said it has been in touch with more shareholders and wrote on Monday, ""It should now be glaringly obvious to Zendesk's board that shareholders do not support the proposed acquisition.""

Analysts at Goldman Sachs, UBS, KeyBanc, Morgan Stanley, Susquehanna, and Wolfe Research all provided positive commentary on Nu Holdings, the parent company of Nubank.
Morgan Stanley analyst Jorge Kuri started Nu at overweight with a $16 price target. The analyst said in a research note that he feels Nubank can build ""the largest and most profitable banking franchise in Latin America.""
Kuri also told investors Nubank is one of the ""largest and fastest growing digital banking platforms with a highly recognized and valuable brand; cross selling additional products should result in a significantly larger business over time.""

The law firm said that as of Dec. 30, the sum covered lawsuits from about 320 investors, both institutional and retail, that had been filed with the district court in Cologne.
This represents a significant jump from the 250-plus investors demanding damages of more than 1 billion euros that Tilp disclosed last month.
Tilp has said it believes Bayer deceived shareholders about the risks of consumer lawsuits pending in the United States linked to the weed killer Roundup, which was brought into the company with the $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto in 2016.
Bayer, in an emailed statement, said any complaints were unfounded, adding the company had complied with the law and disclosure requirements.
""In addition we are convinced that we have carried out adequate due diligence regarding the acquisition of Monsanto,"" Bayer said, adding it would defend itself accordingly.

In the United States, Bayer is defending itself against thousands of lawsuits by Roundup users because of the alleged carcinogenic effect of the product. Bayer has always rejected this.

Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), soon to be rebranded Mercedes-Benz, announced plans in 2021 to invest more than 40 billion euros ($45 billion) by 2030 to take on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in an all-electric car market, including building eight battery plants. From 2025, all its new vehicle platforms will only make EVs, it has said.
The VISION EQXX, dubbed the most-efficient Mercedes-Benz ever built, will have energy consumption of less than 10 kilowatt hours (kWh) per 100 km, said Daimler.
Tesla's Model S 60 currently consumes 18.1 kWh over the same distance, data on its website shows.
""The Mercedes-Benz VISION EQXX is how we imagine the future of electric cars,"" Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kaellenius said.
Daimler will test-drive the prototype before the middle of the year on various types of terrain, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Markus Schaefer told journalists on Monday.
Some components of the prototype would be available in Mercedes-Benz vehicles within two to three years, Schaefer said. However, the CTO declined to specify when the 1,000 km-range battery would be market-ready.
""We will likely be the first to show a 1,000 km-range car in real life, with such a small battery,"" Schaefer said.
When such a vehicle would go on sale is a ""market decision"" to be determined once the carmaker had established how much range customers expected and what they would be willing to pay, he said.
The prototype, built within 18 months, ""puts an end to range anxiety,"" Mercedes-Benz said, referring to one of the key obstacles for why EVs have not been in higher demand.

This required developing a new battery pack, which the company says would fit into a compact vehicle and whose energy density - measuring how much power batteries can hold compared to their size - stands at close to 400 watt hours per litre.

Investing.com — U.S. airline stocks are on the rise on the first trading day of the new year despite flight cancellations continuing to cause disruptions in the industry. 
According to FlightAware, there are over 2,200 total cancellations of flights within, into, or out of the U.S. on Monday. Meanwhile, 2,340 flights within, into, or out of the U.S. have been delayed.
It adds to the thousands of flights canceled over the weekend and last week due to extreme winter weather. In addition, the holiday period saw airline staff testing positive for the Omicron variant, resulting in an increasing number of crew members having to take time off from work to isolate, creating a staffing crunch that forced airlines to shuffle flight schedules. Reports over the weekend said some airlines were offering higher pay to flight crews during January in an effort to keep flights moving.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Cash-strapped property developer China Evergrande Group said on Monday it had been ordered to demolish 39 under-construction residential buildings on the resort island of Hainan, as its shares were suspended from trading.
Evergrande is struggling to repay more than $300 billion in liabilities https://www.reuters.com/business/what-analysts-have-say-about-evergrande-default-risks-rise-2021-09-21, including nearly $20 billion of offshore bonds deemed in cross-default by ratings agencies last month after it missed payments.
Once China's top-selling developer and now at the heart of an unprecedented liquidity squeeze in the property sector, Evergrande has been scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors.
The world's most indebted developer said late on Monday it had received an order from authorities at Danzhou city in Hainan province on Dec. 30 telling it to demolish 39 under-construction buildings at the Ocean Flower Island project.
It did not disclose the reason for the demolition order.
Reuters could not immediately reach the Hainan provincial authorities outside Asia business hours.
Local media reported earlier the buildings - stretched over 435,000 square meters - needed to be demolished within 10 days for illegal construction and environmental violations.
In a post on WeChat late on Monday, Evergrande said it had been rectifying the environmental issues since 2017.
It told the project's homeowners that it had spent 81 billion yuan ($13 billion) in the past six years to build over 60,000 homes, and the demolition order would not affect the rest of the development.
Ocean Flower Island is a mega resort development, comprising theme parks, convention centres and hotels.
'INSIDE INFORMATION'
Evergrande's shares were suspended from trading earlier on Monday pending the release of ""inside information"", it said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing without elaborating.
The developer missed new coupon payments worth $255 million due last Tuesday < VG162759965=>, though both have a 30-day grace period.
As the list of Evergrande's unpaid creditors and suppliers continue to grow, the firm has set up a risk management committee with many members from state companies, and said it would actively engage with its creditors.
On Friday, Evergrande dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products, saying each investor could expect to receive 8,000 yuan ($1,257) per month as principal payment for three months irrespective of when the investment matures.
""The market is watching the asset disposal progress from Evergrande to repay its debt, but the process will take time,"" said Conita Hung, investment strategy director at Tiger Faith Asset Management.
""And the demolition order in Hainan will hurt the little homebuyer confidence (that) remained in the company.""
Evergrande said last week 91.7% of its national projects have resumed construction. Many projects were halted after the developer failed to pay suppliers and contractors.
Shares of Evergrande shed 89% last year, closing at HK$1.59 on Friday.

Its electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group reversed early losses to rise 11% on Monday, while property management unit Evergrande Services also turned around from the red to rise 1%.

Bowie, who pushed the boundaries of music and his own sanity to produce some of the most innovative songs of his generation, died in 2016 aged 69. 
The deal between Bowie's estate and Warner Music includes songs from the 26 studio albums released during his lifetime, as well as the posthumous studio album release ""Toy"".
Warner Music did not disclose the financial terms of the deal in its announcement on Monday, but a person familiar with the matter said the purchase was worth about $250 million.
Bowie's estate had in September signed a deal that gave Warner Music global rights to the artist's catalog from 1968 through 2016.
Bowie shot to fame in Britain in 1969 with ""Space Oddity,"" whose words he said were inspired by watching Stanley Kubrick’s film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" while stoned.
But it was his 1972 portrayal of a doomed bisexual rock envoy from space, ""Ziggy Stardust"", that propelled him to global stardom. 
The deal for his catalog is the latest in the media rights sector, where companies have sought to boost royalties by purchasing artists' catalogs after the pandemic hit physical revenue streams and delayed release of new recordings.

Warner Music, home to musicians such as Cardi B, Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars, has also partnered with popstar Madonna to relaunch her entire catalog over the next few years.
Its deal with Bowie's estate comes days before the rock star's 75th birth anniversary on Jan. 8.

The company’s board said it continues to evaluate its future capital allocation plans and use of proceeds from the sale.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 10:25AM ET</span>","Jefferies staff to go remote until end Jan, financial offices empty out","(Reuters) -U.S. investment bank Jefferies Financial Group has asked staff to work remotely until Jan. 31, according to an Instagram post on Monday from its Chief Executive Officer, in another sign that New York's banking offices looked set for an empty start to the year as the Omicron variant spreads. 
Banks and financial firms have been grappling with how to react to the latest variant and how to communicate to staff and retain workers amid the uncertainty. A number of other banks have asked staff to work remotely for the beginning of the year due to the latest surge in cases.
""Realistically, we do not foresee us all having a safe opportunity to be together in our offices until at least Monday, January 31st,"" Jefferies CEO Richard Handler said in the message. 
Jefferies had called its staff back to offices in October, but was forced to return to work-from-home in December due to a spike in COVID-19 cases. It had also re-imposed a mask mandate in its offices, irrespective of vaccination status.
Handler also said the bank will not host indoor group events or other functions, and that it believes only ""the most critical business travel"" should occur.
As concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus grow, Wall Street banks, which have been aggressive in bringing employees back to offices, have been forced to rethink their plans. 
Among other banks,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said on Sunday it was encouraging eligible U.S. staff to work from home until Jan. 18.
Goldman was among the Wall Street banks that had pushed hardest to bring staff back into offices, and had been the last holdout trying to keep most staff working in the offices through the Omicron variant's surge.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), which was also among those pushing staff to work in its offices, told workers last week they could from home for the first two weeks of January. However, JPMorgan said in the memo to employees that all staff are expected to return to offices no later than Feb. 1.
A source familiar with JPMorgan said on Monday that most of its staff have availed the option to work from home this week, although the bank did have some employees who have never worked from home as their roles need to be done from the office.

 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) has also asked its employees to work from home during the first few weeks of 2022, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters late last month.
A source familiar with Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) on Monday reiterated that employees are encouraged to work from home the week of January 3 while the bank monitors the broader environment. The bank would be hosting several onsite booster clinics for employees across the country beginning this month.

Investing.com –  Novavax  stock (NASDAQ:NVAX) slipped 3% Monday as the company managed to only submit data related to the manufacturing processes of its Covid-19 vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration, a sign that the FDA’s emergency use authorization for the shot is still some time away.
The data submission, which is final now, is a prerequisite for the emergency use authorization application that the company will file with the regulator this month. The Friday submission includes the complete chemistry, manufacturing and controls module. The company was expected to file for EUA by December 31.
Novavax has had to delay its U.S. submission several times due to development and manufacturing setbacks, all of which are now resolved.  The shots also await approval in Japan, where its vaccine would be manufactured and distributed by Takeda Pharmaceutical.
Last month, the company’s vaccine secured approvals from the World Health Organization, the European Union, India, Indonesia and the Philippines.
The company’s filing includes only one manufacturing site, belonging to India’s Serum Institute. Novavax said it expects to file data from other sites at a later date.
The Novavax shot is protein-based, unlike messenger RNA (made by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX)) and viral vector vaccines (Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)) that were cleared earlier.

Investing.com —  Immix Biopharma  Inc (NASDAQ:IMMX) shares have more than doubled, up 116% to $7.70 on Monday, after the Food and Drug Administration granted the company's treatment for pediatric cancer in children Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) designation.
The drug, IMX-110, is used to treat a life-threatening form of pediatric cancer in children and is currently in phase 1b/2a clinical trial. 
Rare Pediatric Disease designation is granted for serious and life-threatening diseases that affect children aged 18 and younger and less than 200,000 people in the U.S.
The designation allows Immix Biopharma to receive a fast-track review and a priority review voucher once they have marketing approval.
According to the company, priority review voucher holders can benefit from an expedited six-month review of a new drug application for any disease by the FDA. In addition, they said that the vouchers are transferable to other companies and have historically sold for $67 to $350 million.
Immix's Chief Executive Officer Ilya Rachman said the company is ""pleased by FDA's acknowledgment of the urgent need for a safe and effective treatment for children with this devastating disease.""

Analyst Nicole Miller Regan is now overweight on the stock compared to being neutral on it earlier with a target of $232 for it.
Piper expects continued topline momentum which it believes can help drive consistent execution at the fast-food chain.
McDonald's is uniquely positioned to leverage its size, scale, operational capabilities, and ongoing investments to take share as it leans into the high-level consumer trends, the analyst wrote in a note.
The fast food burger chain's recent recommitment to share repurchases ""rounds out its total return policy,"" the analyst added.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 08:45AM ET</span>",Factbox-U.S. banks tighten COVID-19 precautions as Omicron variant spreads,"(Reuters) - U.S. banks have been more proactive than other industries in encouraging employees back to the office, but those plans have come under renewed scrutiny due to the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Most major U.S. banks have had staff working in offices since the summer, but some are now choosing not to host holiday parties and others are strongly recommending staff to get booster shots. The following are the pandemic-related rules among Wall Street's biggest banks. 
For a FACTBOX on Canadian financial firms, click on
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)
The bank is encouraging employees to work remotely in the first week of January, according to a person familiar with the matter. It will host on-site vaccine booster clinics for its staff across the country.
Since late summer, the bank has also been encouraging employees to get fully vaccinated and more recently to get their booster shots when eligible. It offers onsite clinics in several locations.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
Citigroup has asked staffers to work from home during the first few weeks of 2022, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
On Dec. 15, the bank told employees at its New York City office they could work from home if they were able to through the holidays, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The bank has been requiring employees in the United States to be vaccinated but is not mandating boosters. It is providing rapid test kits and encouraging testing for employees going into the office, a source said earlier.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
The German lender has made COVID-19 boosters available to staff at its new midtown headquarters in New York City since early November, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
Goldman Sachs is encouraging its eligible U.S. staff to work from home until Jan. 18, a spokesperson for the bank said.
Its offices will continue to remain open with previously announced COVID-19 safety protocols: a vaccine requirement, booster for all eligible populations effective Feb. 1, bi-weekly testing effective Jan. 10 and mandatory masks.
As infections flared up in August due to the spread of the Delta variant, the Wall Street bank mandated vaccines for all staff and visitors entering its offices in the United States.
Goldman in December postponed its remaining holiday parties in New York due to COVID-19 concerns, a source familiar with the matter said last month.
Jefferies 
The investment bank has asked staff to work remotely until Jan. 31, according to a post on Instagram from the investment bank's chief executive officer, Richard Handler. 
The bank requires all workers who want to enter its offices to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and has said it will require boosters by Jan. 31, unless the person concerned is not yet eligible for the additional shot. Jefferies does not perform onsite testing.
The bank has also canceled all but essential travel.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
JPMorgan has offered its staff the option of working from home for the first two weeks of 2022, with a caveat that all employees are expected to return to office no later than Feb. 1, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The biggest U.S. bank, which has been one of the most aggressive in bringing employees back to the office, mandated face coverings for its U.S. employees in August, saying they would be required to wear masks in public indoor settings and in common areas regardless of vaccination status.
The lender in October said that it would restrict business travel for employees who are unvaccinated or have not disclosed their vaccination status. Such employees are required to get tested twice a week and contribute more of their pay toward medical insurance. It also mandated vaccines for new recruits in client-facing roles.
In December, JPMorgan instructed unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home. It also relaxed mask requirements for vaccinated staff working in its Manhattan offices. And, it told managers that they should evaluate more often ""who should revert to working from home."" 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
Morgan Stanley is asking employees, contractors and visitors to show proof of vaccination before entering its New York headquarters. The bank does not require additional COVID-19 testing for staff or visitors, a spokesperson said.
The bank expects staff who are not required to be in the office to take advantage of the ability to work from home and to spend more time with their families. But it is not sending staff home and does not have a work-from-home policy, a source familiar with the situation said.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
Last month, the lender delayed its plans for employees to return to the office ""given the changing external environment."" It said it would announce new plans for a full return in the new year.
Wells Fargo has said its offices are open to those who have been vaccinated and choose to use them. The bank is providing all employees with four hours of paid leave to get the booster shot, if eligible.
The bank also requires employees to either document that they are fully vaccinated or get tested regularly.
Fidelity Investments

The company said it had paused its voluntary return-to-office plans in New England, citing a rising risk from the COVID-19 pandemic.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) agreed to pay $60 million to settle a lawsuit by customers who said the Wall Street bank exposed their personal data when it twice failed to properly retire some of its older information technology.
A preliminary settlement of the proposed class action on behalf of about 15 million customers was filed on Friday night in Manhattan federal court, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres.
Customers would receive at least two years of fraud insurance coverage, and each can apply for reimbursement of up to $10,000 in out-of-pocket losses.
Morgan Stanley denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, and has made ""substantial"" upgrades to its data security practices, according to settlement papers.
Customers accused Morgan Stanley of having in 2016 failed to decommission two wealth management data centers before the unencrypted equipment, which still contained customer data, was resold to unauthorized third parties.
They also said some older servers containing customer data went missing after Morgan Stanley transferred them in 2019 to an outside vendor. Morgan Stanley later recovered the servers, court papers show.
Morgan Stanley said in an email on Monday it had notified all customers who may have been affected and was pleased to settle the lawsuit.

In October 2020, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $60 million civil fine to resolve U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency accusations concerning the incidents, including that its information security practices were unsafe or unsound.
The case is In re Morgan Stanley Data Security Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-05914.

Investing.com – PayPal Holdings stock (NASDAQ:PYPL) traded nearly 2% higher in Monday’s premarket following an upgrade to ‘outperform’ by BMO on valuation, according to StreetInsider.
Analyst James Fotheringham sees the stock at $224, down from $278 to reflect the multiple compression that took place in 2021.
The new target is around 19% higher than the stock’s Friday close of $188.58. The stock lost over 19% in 2021 while the S&P 500 rose nearly 27%.
Fotheringham believes payment stocks are set up constructively for this year and expects PayPal to hold potential of a 21% annual organic revenue growth. He also noted that tax loss selling is done and investors are focused on more normalized 2023 estimates for valuation.
Besides PayPal, the brokerage also recommended buying  Nuvei  (TSX:NVEI) and  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in the sector. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) are also favored ‘buys’ as core holdings, according to the analyst.

Investing.com – Applied Therapeutics stock (NASDAQ:APLT) sank 25% in Monday’s pre-market trading after receiving bad news from the FDA for the company’s lead drug candidate.
The company was earlier expecting an accelerated approval for the drug AT-007, which aims to treat galactosemia, a rare genetic metabolic disease, from the Food and Drug Administration, but the regulator has now indicated that clinical outcomes data will likely be required for it, according to a company release. The company has thus decided to hold on submitting a new drug application for AT-007 for treatment of galactosemia pending additional discussions with the FDA. 
The first assessment of the clinical outcome will be completed in the first quarter of 2022, and then every 6 months thereafter until the study reaches statistical significance, the release said.
The company is developing AT-007 for treatment of galactosemia, a rare genetic metabolic disease resulting in an inability to metabolize the simple sugar galactose. When not metabolized properly, galactose is converted to the toxic metabolite, galactitol, which causes neurological complications, including deficiencies in speech, cognition, behavior and motor skills.
AT-007 is currently being studied in a phase-3 clinical outcomes trial (ACTION-Galactosemia Kids) in 2-17-year-olds suffering from galactosemia. There are approximately 3,000 patients with galactosemia in the US and 80 new births per year."

Investing.com –  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock traded 0.7% higher in Monday’s premarket as it continued its momentum from U.K.’s approval to the company’s Covid-19 pill, which boosts chances of the oral drug finding wider acceptance amid omicron surge.
The company has earlier said that lab data suggests the antiviral retains its effectiveness against omicron, the fastest-spreading mutant of coronavirus and the reason behind the all-time high daily infections in many countries over last few days, including in the U.S.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s nod came Friday. The pill already has the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval.
The company claims that its pill against the infection has near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients.
“We now have a further antiviral medicine for the treatment of Covid-19 that can be taken by mouth rather than administered intravenously. This means it can be administered outside a hospital setting, before Covid-19 has progressed to a severe stage,” an MHRA release quoted its Chief Executive June Raine as saying.
The at-home treatment can be prescribed to high-risk patients, 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg (88 lbs), who tested positive for Covid-19 — potentially helping patients avoid severe illness and reducing hospitalizations and deaths from the viral infection. 
The pill is a protease inhibitor, which blocks the activity of a key enzyme that the coronavirus needs in order to replicate. Protease inhibitors are also used to treat HIV, hepatitis C and other viruses.

1687,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 07:37AM ET</span>","EV Delivery Numbers, a 2021 Encore, Oil Jolt - What's Moving Markets","By Daniel Shvartsman
Markets seem set to start 2022 the way they performed in 2021, going higher. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other electric vehicles saw continued momentum in Q4. Airlines continue to grapple with cancellations. We've all turned the calendar one year ahead, but has anything changed? Here's what to watch in financial markets on Monday, January 3rd, 2022.
Tesla closed out 2022 with a smashing beat on Q4 deliveries, delivering 308,000 vehicles vs. analyst estimates of 263,026. Shares are trading up 6.8% as of 830am ET (1230 GMT) on what Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Daniel Ives called a ""jaw dropping” delivery number that ,""speaks to an EV demand trajectory that looks robust for Tesla heading into 2022.""
It wasn't just Tesla, as Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio (NYSE:NIO), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) each saw meaningful increases in their Q4 deliveries; Nio's grew 44% to 25,034 vehicles, a record for the company, while Li Auto's deliveries rose 143% to 35,221 vehicles, and XPeng saw the biggest increase, with 222% growth to 41,751 units. Each of those companies is trading 2+% higher in the pre-market.
And outside of EVs, auto stocks are trading well in Europe and in the U.S. pre-market. The trigger may be a forecast from  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) for 12.1% growth in 2022, encouraging given all the supply chain challenges the industry had to work through in the last year, which warped the market for used cars as well. A sign of things getting back to normal? Too early to tell, but investors seem to like the news regardless.
After each of the main U.S. indices finished 2021 with 20%+ gains, it should perhaps be no surprise that January kicks off in the green for U.S. futures. At 830am ET, Dow Jones Futures are up 150 points or .4%, while S&P 500 Futures are up .5%. Nasdaq 100 Futures, spurred by Tesla, are up .7%.
For some historical context, the last time the S&P 500 gained more than 25% in a year, it followed up with 16% growth; of course, that was in 2019 and 2020, an unusual period. The previous example was 2013 and 2014, where the S&P 500 finished up 29.6% and then 11.3%, respectively.
2012-2014 was also the previous three-year stretch where the S&P 500 finished in the green, and higher by 10%+ in each year, before this 2019-2021 period. The response? In 2015, the leading index finished down .7%.
While the two years of pandemic and governmental/central bank response certainly feel unprecedented, there are still parallels to find. Whether history will repeat, rhyme, or just faintly echo remains to be seen.

Amid a holiday season that saw quiet trading and low news, airlines' struggles have risen to the spotlight. Per flight tracking site FlightAware.com, there were 2700+ cancellations of flights in, into, or out of the United States yesterday, and another 1800+ already today.
The European trading session offers reason for hope for the industry, as jet engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) announced plans to hire 12,000 employees as their CEO said he expects demand to recover and is very confident ""the worst is behind us."" European airlines and airplane industry names are trading higher. On the U.S. side of things, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) is up .7% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is up .6% in pre-market trading.
Airlines will be issuing December traffic reports this week, which will give one last read on the degree of disruption over the end of the year and a preview for earnings reports, which start next week with Delta reporting on Thursday.
Crude Oil WTI Futures pulled back and is trading down .4% with Brent Oil Futures down .2% as Libya continues to struggle with a broken pipeline, restricting its supply to the market. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is set to meet tomorrow, and all expectations are that they will hold the line on a planned moderate production increase, in line with their expectations that demand will continue to recover through 2022 to pre-pandemic levels.
The Eurozone and several European nations issued their December Purchasing Manager Index reports, with the indicators all pointing towards manufacturing expansion in December. Most of the numbers met or beat expectations, with the overall Eurozone right on analysts' forecast of 58, where anything north of 50 indicates expansion. This was in line with the preliminary release from mid December.
With 2022 anticipated to be a year of monetary tightening to combat inflation, the question remains whether central banks can pull off that shift without dampening the global economic recovery from the pandemic. Confounding factors like resurges in Covid case counts and subsequent health and economic impacts remain in the mix. So continued economic expansion even as many countries in Europe saw new highs in Covid cases last month is encouraging, whether as a sign that the latest Covid variant is a milder one or that people have learned how to live around the issue.

Goldman's offices will continue to remain open with previously announced COVID-19 safety protocols, the spokesperson added. Those measures are: a vaccine requirement, booster requirement for all eligible populations effective Feb. 1, bi-weekly testing effective Jan. 10, and mandatory masks.
Financial firms have been grappling with when they can realistically get back to business-as-usual, and how to communicate to staff and retain workers amid the uncertainty. A number of other banks had asked staff to work remotely due to the latest surge in cases.
Goldman was among the Wall Street banks that had pushed hardest to bring staff back into offices, and had been the last holdout trying to keep most staff working in the offices through the Omicron variant's surge. 

JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), which was also among those pushing staff to work in its offices, told workers last week https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-citi-staff-start-2022-with-remote-work-2021-12-31 they could from home for the first two weeks of January.

Investing.com – Ross Stores stock (NASDAQ:ROST) traded 1.2% lower in Monday’s premarket following a downgrade by Wells Fargo, according to StreetInsider.
Analyst Ike Boruchow now rates the stock ‘equal weight’ with a target of $120, 11% down from his previous target of $135 when he was ‘over weight’ on it. The stock had closed at $114.28 Friday.
The analyst highlights the growing concern over the low-end consumer (where ROST plays more so than any other name under Boruchow's coverage). According to Boruchow, the stock is fairly valued.
The company operates Ross Dress for Less, an off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the U.S.
For the third quarter ended October 30, Ross reported a net profit $385 million on sales of $4.6 billion, with comparable store sales up a strong 14%.

1691,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 06:00AM ET</span>",Will 2022 Be the Year of Value Investing?,"By Marcin Jendrzejczak with Katarzyna Plewa 
The New Year 2022 is an opportunity to think more deeply and make resolutions. This also applies to investment decisions. In this context, it is worth refreshing one’s value investing philosophy and considering whether it will regain its former luster in 2022 after it fell out of favor in recent years.
Value investing is a classic investment strategy, along with its counterpart, growth investing. It consists of buying companies that are trading at a lower price than their actual value. The classic example is buying at a price below book value. In this case you are talking about buying a dollar for cents: the share represents a portion of the ownership of a particular company - its factories, patents and other assets, which in this case are bought at a price lower than their actual value as listed on the balance sheet.
Value investing is the investment strategy of Warren Buffett and his mentor, Benjamin Graham. Value investing requires a long-term view. Economists talk about low time preference here. The idea is that each person prefers present goods over future goods. This preference can be stronger or weaker. In the latter case, a person is capable of sacrificing some of his present income for future income under the condition of the chance of profit.
A value investor cannot be afraid to act against the crowd, as he follows the principle, “Buy when there is blood in the streets.” Sir John Templeton called this the principle of maximum pessimism. He encouraged buying stocks only when the market had come to the complete conviction of the total hopelessness involved. 
Value stocks don't always go up right away. As Benjamin Graham (NYSE:GHM) said, the market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term. Therefore, in the short run, stocks can fall even further. At the end of the day, however, stock prices and valuations should align. 
Value companies tend to win in the long term and also in the really long term. Since 1926, according to Bank of America, value investments have returned 1,344,600%. Over the same time period, growth investments have returned yields of ""only"" 626,600%.
As noted by Craig L. Israelsen in an article summarizing the research and published on the Financial Planning website, over a 25-year period (1990-2014) the cumulative annual growth of the S&P 500 index was 9.62% and the standard deviation was 18.25%. This means that investing $10,000 grew to $99,350 after 25 years (the real return was lower due to inflation). In the case of large U.S. companies, value investing yielded a premium of 86 basis points. For medium-sized companies, the premium was 99 basis points. For small companies it was as high as 224 basis points.  
Moreover, the author examined the situation in 21 periods of 5 years within the examined time range. Among the category of large companies, the value ones ""won"" in 52% of cases. Among small companies, value turned out to be the winner in 76% of 5-year periods (although in the period 1995-1999 when growth companies won, their advantage amounted to as much as 860 basis points).
Two principles therefore emerge from the research. First - the longer the periods, the higher the chance of value investing advantage. Second, the smaller the companies we take into account, the higher the advantage.
However, this has become less obvious. Recently, growth investing has surpassed value investing. Over the past decade, for example, the iShares Russell 1000 Growth index (NYSE:IWF) has returned 17% annually, while the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index (NYSE:IWD) has returned just 10%. Some analysts see this as a fundamental shift in the markets caused by technology companies. Others recall that the same argument was made just before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000.
So has the world changed? As proponents of the so-called new economics point out, today it is no longer physical capital that matters, but rather human capital. Consequently, traditional ratios such as price/profit or price/book value are becoming obsolete. An IT company may not have a lot of capital at its disposal, but it can still be a great business. This is because its capital is in people's minds. “Asset-light” is a positive for modern businesses, not a drawback.
So let's take a closer look at the case. Our ""backtest"" on the Portfolio Visualizer portal covering the period 2011-21 showed that a $10,000 investment in an ETF representing large (from the SP500 index) U.S. growth companies yielded $58,056 at the end of 2021. In contrast, an investment in the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSE:IVE) representing large U.S. value companies yielded $31,764 at the end of the period.
However, for the first half of the decade, the results were even. So the lion's share of the difference is accounted for by the latter part of the decade, especially the period since April 2020. After all, as recently as March 30, 2020, the growth advantage was only just under $8,882, rising to $26,292 by the end of 2021.
The comparison in the small-cap category is similar - the iShares S&P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF (NYSE:IJS) versus the iShares S&P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IJT). The cumulative annual returns are 11.56% and 13.64%, respectively, and the $10,000 investment yielded $7,383 more at the end of the period for the small-cap growth investments. Again, the two portfolios were very aligned until 2017. Only after that did the divergence begin.
In contrast, the iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF (NYSE:IJK) had an accumulated annual return of 12.49% and the $10,000 invested brought in $36,142, while the iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF (NYSE:IJJ) had an accumulated annual return of 11.27% and the $10,000 invested brought in $32,076 at the end of the period. In this case, the charts were very even until the end of March 2020.
The prevalence of growth companies in recent years appears to be not so much a trend change, but rather an anomaly. It has been shot through with non-standard monetary policy, such as asset purchase programs and negative real (and extremely low nominal) interest rates. The correlation with the Fed's spring 2020 decisions is striking here. It is hard to talk about coincidence here - rather, a cause-and-effect relationship is obvious. So it is not a paradigm shift in economics, but a change in Fed policy that is chiefly responsible for the gigantic valuations of growth companies in recent years, and especially after 2020.
Thus, the Fed's retreat from a radically dovish policy threatens a deep correction in growth companies. The higher the level of overvaluation, the greater the correction will be. Let us remember that the Fed currently anticipates ending the asset purchase program at the end of Q1 2022, followed by interest rate hikes spread over 2022 and 2023. Of course, one can imagine a situation where, in the event of an overly negative market reaction, the central bank will revert to its old policy. However, record high inflation will be a barrier difficult to overcome in recent years.
Thus, the recent strong growth of companies is in fact an additional argument for the fact that the next few years will once again belong to value companies. Similarly, overvaluation of the US market may lead to capital flow to less popular emerging markets. Value investors will find interesting companies not only on the expensive American market, but also on those located in Latin America, Russia, the Czech Republic or Poland.
It is worth remembering, however, that unrealistically high valuations of growth companies are not only a U.S. problem. As Anthony Luzio of Trustnet Magazine points out, the price/earnings ratio for the MSCI Growth index of global growth stocks is currently 37.7, which is 2.5X more than for its value counterpart. While in essence growth stocks are more expensive by definition, the difference has typically been 1.4X. It is now 2.5X. So even if we take a global perspective, we find that growth stocks are overvalued more than usual.
Of course, this is just a hypothesis. The only thing we know for sure about the future is its uncertainty. Moreover, in the shorter term, growth companies, often related to technology, can produce truly remarkable returns. Most experts also suggest diversifying your portfolio. In a diversified portfolio there is room for different types of companies, although nothing prevents one type from predominating.
Finally, it is worth remembering that even if we adopt a value investing philosophy backed by historical data, as well as common sense and big names, we should not limit ourselves to it. Low valuation is an important, but not the only, indicator determining the future success of a company. No less important turns out to be size (as a rule smaller companies give higher profit, but with higher volatility); quality (good finances of the company) and the momentum factor (what grew last year, often grows further in the next). Someone might advise that a portfolio should also include growth companies, but selected very carefully or that they should be invested in as part of ETFs. Then we do not depend on a single company, which can often transition from today’s market darling to tomorrow’s bankruptcy. Among today's growth companies are tomorrow's Amazons, but also many companies that will not thrive or perhaps even survive. 
In a way, the ideal seems to be a small, high-quality company - with good financials, cheap, but whose share price has already started to bounce back. As we can see, there are many indications that the year 2022 will usher in a return to value investing, and the new year is a good opportunity to create an investment plan based on professional valuation and analyst opinions. As always, the key to success remains patience, sticking to common sense, avoiding greed and investing only what you can afford to lose."

The electronics manufacturing services company said it will work with the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, known locally as Suhakam, after Dyson, the company's largest customer, cut ties with ATA after an audit of its labour practices and allegations by a whistleblower.
The British home appliance maker's contract with ATA ends on June 1. 
ATA said on Dec. 7 it had found instances of staff working excessive overtime and had taken action against a manager who coached employees for a labour audit.
ATA said Suhakam had visited its facilities on Sept. 27 to verify allegations of forced labour reported by media outlets, and provided feedback for improvement for the company's consideration.
It did not say what the feedback was but said it has implemented additional grievance channels for workers, terminated an agent that charged workers recruitment fees and improved communication issues at the company clinic treating workers.
Suhakam confirmed that it will be working with ATA to improve their practices.
ATA also said it ""looks forward to working closely ... with the government, the Ministry of Human Resources and other relevant bodies in its efforts to step up on its ESG and (corporate social responsibility) efforts.""
Malaysia charged ATA last month with four violations of labour law on accommodation for workers as it investigates complaints of forced labour.

ATA has asked for the charges to be dropped, saying any infractions were caused by the ""challenges presented during the pandemic"".

1696,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 04:45AM ET</span>","After a Year of Embargoes & Rising Costs, Brazilian Meat Producers Set to Rebound","By Jessica Bahia Melo
Investing.com - If 2021 was a year of serial difficulties for companies in the Brazilian meat sector, 2022 appears more promising. The resumption of beef imports by China, beef and pork imports by Russia, and the continued high demand for these commodities globally are encouraging factors for the main players in the sector globally and in Brazil. The European chains’ boycott of Brazilian brands due to deforestation, however, will remain a negative factor if it persists.
The four publicly listed meat producers on the Bovespa had very distinct performances during 2021, as did the prices of meat. Live Cattle Futures showed a strong appreciation in 2021. A year ago, they were quoted at $112, while on Wednesday December 22nd they passed $135. A different situation was that of Lean Hogs Futures, which had a significant increase in the middle of the year, at $122, and have fallen to around $82.
With this in mind, while companies like Marfrig (SA:MRFG3) (OTC:MRRTY) and JBS (SA:JBSS3) (SA:JBSS3) - whose consumer market is mainly in the United States - saw a year of high margins that analysts view as unsustainable, Minerva (SA:BEEF3) (OTC:MRVSY) suffered with the restrictions in China, and BRF (SA:BRFS3) (NYSE:BRFS) from the drop in income and unemployment in Brazil, because the latter has a greater focus on the domestic market than the other meat producers mentioned.
These contrasts reflect in their stock performance for the year. Mafrig rose 52% and JBS rose 66%, while BRF ended the year up only 2.2% and Minerva finished up only 4.1%. (Performance based on Brazilian listings)
The year ended with promising news on the trade front. In November, Russia announced zero import tariffs on beef and pork and import quotas for several countries, including Brazil. The expectation is that in the first quarter of 2022 the Russian government will carry out inspections to qualify new Brazilian plants for export.
In December, China lifted the embargo on Brazilian beef. The restrictions began after cases of mad cow disease occurred in the states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso in September. Brazilian beef exports registered consecutive drops in the following months given its largest buyer decided to suspend shipments. Hyberville Neto, market consultant at Scot Consultoria and columnist for Investing.com Brasil, believes that the embargo being lifted is related to China's need for meat due to the Chinese New Year, celebrated in February.
In a report on the global outlook for the meat sector, Bank of America (BofA) pointed out that the companies were able to sustain margins due to strong demand in the United States and Mexico. For 2022, BofA does not expect commodity costs to drop significantly, bringing cost pressure and limiting margin expansion. The withdrawal of stimulus in the United States may also affect the market, but the expectation is that yields will remain above historical levels.
For the Brazilian cattle cycle, the bank expects faster turnover of livestock inventory, increasing availability and reducing costs. For chicken, lower grain prices tend to benefit the sector. Inflation should also be a boon - as consumers face higher costs, they tend to switch to chicken, which is cheaper than beef.
At a domestic level, the expectation is that the improved weather will benefit the corn and soybean crops, reducing cost pressure. Hyberville Neto believes that even if China resumes part of its pork production, there is still room to expand Brazilian shipments - and that goes for other proteins as well.
""Expectations for meat production next year are not strong in China. While they rebounded in pork production in the last two years, the expectation is it drops in 2022,"" he adds.
The expert agrees that the trend is for an increase in the supply of cattle in the country, with less retention of females in the herd. ""We expect an increase in supply, but not in such an abundant way that it would bring down the market.""
Marfrig, which operates mainly in the U.S. beef market with plants installed there, benefited from the injection of U.S. government funds in the economy, achieving margins above their historical average - a situation that analysts expect to normalize.
In the third quarter, it recorded adjusted EBITDA of R$4.7 billion, up 115.6% year-on-year, and net income of R$1.7 billion, up 148.7%.
XP has a buy recommendation for the stock, with a target price of R$34.80. Leonardo Alencar, agro, beverage and food analyst at XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investimentos, believes that the supply and demand set up in the U.S. favors the company.
Itaú BBA classifies Marfrig as Outperform, with a target price of R$26. Gustavo Troyano, food and beverage analyst at Itaú BBA, agrees that the year was atypically positive and expects above-average results next year as well, but with lower margins. ""An average margin for the sector is around 4% to 7%, and this year there are companies with margins above 20%, which is very strong,"" he explains. The expectation, however, is that they will still be in the double digits.
More diversified in proteins and in the market of operation, the company recorded adjusted EBITDA of R$13.9 billion in 3Q2021 (+74.2% year-on-year). The net income of R$7.6 billion represents a growth of 142.1% in comparison with the same quarter last year. It also has great exposure to the United States, but exports to Europe and Australia, among other countries. It works with beef, pork, and now is even getting into fish. ""This diversification offers more security for the company. The U.S. was expected to have a stronger recovery, but now with inflation weighing more heavily there, it is already starting to become more uncertain, which could make shares less attractive,"" says Fabiano Vaz, analyst at Nord Research.
However, JBS is among BofA's top picks in the meat sector, as it believes that even with lower margins in the North American market, new acquisitions should boost the next year’s results. The target price is R$70.
XP has a buy recommendation for the stock, with a price target of R$51.80.
Itau BBA rates JBS as Outperform, with a target price of R$47. The up cycle in the American beef market and the company's diversification are factors that benefit the thesis.
Another diversified producer, BRF is one of the largest global food companies, owner of brands such as Sadia, Perdigão, and Qualy. The company is more focused on processing and is more exposed to the Brazilian economy, although it also exports to several countries, including in the Middle East. The company has been affected by the high prices of grain, necessary for the production of poultry and pork, squeezing their margins. BRF recorded a net loss of R$271 million in the third quarter of 2021, against a net income of R$219 million in 3Q20. However, revenue grew 24.6% year over year, reaching R$12.3 million. Itaú BBA classifies BRF as Market Perform, with a target price of R$24.
XP has a neutral recommendation for the stock, with a target price of R$30.40. Leonardo Alencar points out that even with the rise in meat prices, the company was unable to regain margins throughout the year. ""It exported more to Asia, but didn't manage to arbitrage this very well. It was very focused on the domestic market, which did not perform well and, with the pressure of production costs, had a weaker year,"" he points out. However, the cost pressure should decrease in 2022, according to the analyst.
There is also intrigue regarding Marfrig and BRF. In December, BRF announced a planned secondary offering of 325 million new shares. The estimate is that BRF will raise approximately R$6.6 billion with the operation, which would allow it to expand its activities and make strategic investments, in addition to improving the debt structure, lowering total cost and reducing leverage. The measure will be voted on at the General Shareholders' Meeting on January 17.
Brazilian analysts see the operation as an opportunity for Marfrig to take control of BRF. Currently, Marfrig holds 33.2% of BRF shares and, according to BRF's bylaws, the shareholder that achieves control of 33.3% of the shares will have to launch a public offer to buy all the remaining shares at a 40% premium over the average share price of the previous 30 or 120 days, whichever is higher. This could correspond to a price 65% above BRF's market value.
However, in the event of a capital increase, the rule in the bylaws limiting BRF's shareholder control would no longer be valid. Despite having an aggressive history of acquisitions, analysts have no clear view of how Marfrig's advance on BRF will play out. That is a story for us to watch in 2022.
Minerva is one of South America's leaders in the production and sale of fresh meat and meat byproducts, but it also exports live cattle. In the third quarter of this year, the company reported a year-on-year growth of 24% in Net Income, reaching R$72.4 million. EBITDA in 3Q21 was a record, reaching R$648.1 million, an increase of 17% compared to 3Q20.
Itaú BBA classifies Minerva as Outperform, with a target price of R$17. According to the Itaú analyst, the company is the biggest beneficiary of the Chinese government's lifting of the embargo, since it is the company with the largest market share in that market.
Nord Research has a buy recommendation for the stock, but does not have a price target. ""Marfrig is a great company and has super-interesting exposure in the United States, but it is a more competitive market there, with higher costs. Minerva has the advantage of exposure to China, a new market that is still growing. The middle class in recent years has increased income and people are improving their diet. Minerva is taking advantage of this and it is still a huge market,"" says Fabiano Vaz.

""We are in the process of coming out of the crisis and we've decided to relaunch our hiring, with 12,000 hires planned in 2022, of which 3,000 will be in France,"" he was quoted as saying.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 03:45AM ET</span>","Hyundai, Kia expect auto sales jump in 2022 amid chip shortage","By Heekyong Yang and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Corp on Monday forecast that their combined global sales will jump 12.1% in 2022, even as last year's sales fell short of target due to a global chip shortage.
The companies sold 6.67 million vehicles in 2021, about 3.7% less than their combined target of 6.92 million vehicles, largely due to supply problems including the chip shortage, which drove down vehicle shipment.
They said they would target global sales of 7.47 million vehicles this year.
""In 2022, Hyundai Motor plans to expand its market share and strengthen profitability through efforts to stabilise chip supply and demand, adjust vehicle production schedules, strengthen electric vehicle lineups as well as optimising sales profit and loss by region,"" Hyundai Motor said in a statement.
The shortage, due to supply problems and a surge in demand for consumer electric gadgets during the pandemic, has hit the auto industry hard, with millions of vehicles worldwide not being produced because important parts are missing.
Analysts said this year's target seemed reasonable.
Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities, expected demand for vehicles to stay strong in 2022, underpinned by pent-up demand from consumers unable to buy vehicles last year due to supply shortages.
""It appears that the chip shortage has been showing some signs of easing ... however, rising raw material prices would likely have (an) impact on their profitability,"" Lee added.

Shares in Hyundai Motor closed 0.7% higher, versus a 0.4% rise in the benchmark market KOSPI.
In October, Hyundai Motor cut its 2021 global sales target by about 4% to 4 million vehicles from 4.16 million vehicles.

1699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 03:32AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Gain; Asian Shares Mixed on Omicron: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equity futures gained, while Asian stocks were mixed in thin trading as investors mulled the impact of the omicron variant on the global recovery. Shares of troubled China Evergrande Group were suspended in Hong Kong.
S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts advanced at the start of the new year, with major markets including Australia, Japan and China all closed for holidays in Asia. Hong Kong’s benchmark gauge fell, dragged down by developers and tech companies, while equities pared gains in South Korea and Taiwan. Euro Stoxx 50 futures were little changed.
Last year “was simply a period of ‘risk on,’” Jefferies strategists led by Sean Darby wrote in a note. “Peering into 2022, we expect volatility to rise, meaning that the return per unit of risk comes to the forefront.”
All eyes are on the omicron variant of Covid-19, which is spreading rapidly but also appears to be less severe than some earlier variants based on the rate of hospitalizations. Investors are also focusing on the policy trajectory of the Federal Reserve and other central banks into 2022, particularly as inflation continues to present a challenge. 
There’s a “positive setup into 2022 with Fed and Covid headwinds to ease, and China policy tailwinds,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) strategists led by Mixo Das in Hong Kong, wrote in a report Sunday. “Overall, our economists see less disruption to economic activity and above trend global growth this quarter, particularly in Asia. In terms of Fed tightening, the moment of peak disruption for markets may also be passing.”
Asia’s factory activity continued to expand in December, according to a slew of data released Monday, boosted by resilient demand and the easing of supply-chain bottlenecks.
While no specific reason was given for the halt in Evergrande trading, Chinese developer shares sank amid local-media reports that the company had been ordered to tear down apartment blocks at a project in Hainan province.
Oil edged higher as Libyan output declined before an OPEC+ meeting on Tuesday to discuss production policy.
