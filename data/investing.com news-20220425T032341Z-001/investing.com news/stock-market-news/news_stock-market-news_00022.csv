Investing.com -- Investors have had plenty of reason to think that stock valuations have become detached from reality this year – and the reasons just keep coming.
The market for initial public offerings is still running ridiculously hot, especially in the U.S. and China, where retail investors, in particular, are piling into new offerings with little thought for traditional valuations.
Last week’s debuts by home rental company Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and food delivery group DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) set new standards for an exuberance for loss-making technology stocks not seen since 1999. While they’ve come off a little this week, DoorDash still trades nearly 60% above the IPO price and even further above the price that bankers – not generally known for under-selling their products – thought advisable. AirBnB, for its part, closed on Monday nearly 100% above its IPO price.
Even in a year full of magical thinking about stocks with a growth narrative, these two stood out. Neither is profitable, although DoorDash did eke out a small profit of $23 million in the second quarter and its numbers may look better again in 2021 when it no longer has to spend tens of millions of dollars to head off campaigns for its riders to be classed as employees.
But the most telling indication of how ludicrous things had got was when AirBnB CEO Brian Chesky was left lost for words when told how high the share price had gone on its debut visibly torn between regret at all the money he’d left on the table and the urge to explain to investors why they were wrong.
As recently as April, AirBnB had had to raise $2 billion fresh capital at a reported valuation of only $18 billion. At the end of its first day of trading, it was valued at $86.5 billion.
The contradiction implied in the blowout performance of both companies is stark: DoorDash’s business has been accelerated by a pandemic that has forced restaurants to close and deliver their meals if they want to stay afloat. Covid has been good for it. By logical extension, when restaurants reopen their doors again, DoorDash’s growth will falter.
By contrast, the pandemic has been a negative for AirBnB: gross bookings were down year-on-year by as much as 67% in the second quarter before rebounding. The company may claim credit for pivoting its business away from short-term holiday lets, but the fact is that the pandemic that has, almost certainly, flattened the growth curve for the travel business in all its forms, for the foreseeable future. The conquest of Covid will surely help its business recover.
So while it’s possible to make a case for one or the other having a blowout, it’s really hard to see how two blowouts can be explained, except by irrational exuberance.
It's not just in the U.S. that performance has been startling. China's stock market bears many of the same hallmarks - including a headlong rush by retail investors into new stocks that has pumped the Chinext growth index up more than 22% from its pre-pandemic levels. This month alone, the health arm of online commerce platform JD (NASDAQ:JD).com has nearly doubled in a week since floating, while toymaker Pop Mart rose 56% on its debut and has added to them since then.  Burger King's Indian franchise, meanwhile, rose 125% on its market debut on Monday, untroubled by any possible pitfalls in selling beef to a country of 1 billion Hindus.
In Latin America, Brazil's IPO market is on track for its best year since 2007, as a welcome rebound in the real has allowed companies to stick to listing plans that were largely drawn up during the period of relative stability under President Michel Temer. Only in Europe, it seems, is it impossible to cook up a growth story that can convince investors.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, with investors picking up some relative bargains after a four-day losing streak in which the spreading pandemic and the lack of fiscal action to support the economy have weighed heavily.
As of 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 188 points, or 0.6%, at 30,050 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.8%. 
The market was helped at the margins by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledging Joe Biden as President-elect for the first time, a day after the Electoral College confirmed Biden's victory in November. Investors were unfazed by figures showing that U.S. industrial production growth had slowed in November to 0.4%, leaving it down 5.5% on the year. By contrast, China overnight had reported output growing 7% on the year, at close to its pre-pandemic levels.  
Among early movers, Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock stood out with a 3.4% rise on the back of a report suggesting it will increase production of this year's suite of iPhones in response to strong demand.  Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) stock meanwhile edged 0.3% higher to a new 17-month high, still supported by speculation that the cloud storage company will be taken over.
By contrast, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock fell another 4.5% as the post-IPO lockup on insiders selling their holdings expired. While most IPOs come with a six-month lockup period, the enterprise software company's lasted only three. It's now down some 20% from its high last week, albeit still up more than 25% from its debut day.
Another stock in negative territory was  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which came off 4.0% in profit-taking after a run that saw it gain over 70% in the last three weeks. The Food and Drug Administration Tuesday released data analysing the stage 3 test of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine, putting it on track for a decision on emergency use authorization as early as the end of this week, according to the New York Times.
If approved, Moderna's vaccine would increase access to protection against the coronavirus at a time when it is still running almost unchecked through the U.S. The country posted a new record for people hospitalized with the virus on Monday, at over 109,000, while the seven-day average for deaths also hit a new record high.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday the city may need to move to a full lockdown again to stem the spread of the disease and take the pressure off the city's hospitals.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia flew a new passenger airliner with domestically-built engines for the first time since the Soviet era on Tuesday, the start of what it hopes will be a revival of a civil aviation industry to challenge Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus.
The medium-range MC-21 plane took off from a Siberian airfield powered by Russian-built PD-14 turbo-fan engines. The plane first flew in May, 2017, but with U.S.-made engines.
The MC-21 is built by Irkut Corporation, part of United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), and the engines are built by United Engine Corporation, all of which are majority owned by Rostec, Russia's state aerospace and defence conglomerate.
UAC said the plane carried out a range of flight tests in a maiden voyage that lasted one hour and 25 minutes.
The Soviet Union was a major builder of passenger airliners used widely at home and in allied countries. But after the fall of communism, airlines largely retired their fleets of Tupolevs and Ilyushins for Boeings and Airbuses.
The Kremlin has been pushing to make Russia less reliant on Western imports, particularly since 2014, when the United States and EU imposed some financial sanctions in response to Russian military intervention in Ukraine.
Moscow had planned to begin delivering the MC-21 to buyers in 2019, but that date was pushed back, with Rostec saying U.S. sanctions had forced manufacturers to replace composite materials in the wings with Russian-made equivalents. The first deliveries are now expected at the end of next year.
Two modifications of the plane, which can seat 130 to 211 passengers, will be made available for order - one with U.S. Pratt & Whitney PW1400G-JM engines and the other with the PD-14 engines, UAC said.

Orders have been placed for 175 of the aircraft, with state carrier Aeroflot accounting for 50, UAC said. It did not say how many would include the Russian-built engines.

(Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has put the spotlight on mental health tech startups, globally marking a record year for venture capital investment in the sector, according to data firm PitchBook.
PitchBook data showed 146 deals raked in nearly $1.6 billion in venture capital investments as of Dec. 10. Last year the total was $893 million from 111 deals. A decade ago there were only 3 deals, worth $6.6 million.
The investments come as employers are increasingly seen as customers for these startups. Consulting firm McKinsey reported last month that 52% of companies offer mental-health and bereavement counseling.
Sleep and mediation app Calm, which raised $75 million last week, said one primary driver for its business was from employer partnerships. It was valued at $2 billion, making it the top valued mental health startup, according to PitchBook.
Mental health and wellness platform Modern Health on Tuesday said it raised $51 million, with a valuation above half a billion dollars. Its services are offered through employers as well. Founder and Chief Executive Alyson Watson said since the onset of the pandemic, Modern Health doubled the number of customers to over 190 enterprises.
“The way that we think about this is the fourth pillar,” said Watson, adding that employers are increasingly offering mental health care in addition to medical, dental and vision benefits. 
Roger Lee, general partner at Battery Ventures, who will be joining Modern Health’s board, said the current size of the industry is just the “tip of the iceberg” and he expects huge growth in the mental sector. 
He said the use of social media, not just the pandemic, would continue to exacerbate the problem. “When the book of social media is written, people will realize this was this generation's tobacco,” said Lee.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s report earlier this year, two in five adults surveyed said they had at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) customers in the United States will have to pay the full $5.65 for a second grande Eggnog Latte this holiday season, as the company suspends two-for-one deals due to overcrowding concerns amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases.
Happy Hour events scheduled for Dec. 17 and Jan. 7 have been canceled, according to an internal memo to employees posted inside stores and seen by Reuters. The temporary suspension has not been previously reported.
Last December, the world's largest coffee chain held the events each week, totaling four that month. 
""Partner care and safety remains the top priority,"" the note said. ""However, with the anticipated rise in cases as a result of holiday travel and the latest guidance from the scientific community to not gather indoors in large groups for a prolonged period of time, we feel it is best to pause Happy Hours."" 
Rossann Williams (NYSE:WMB), Starbucks' president of U.S. and Canada retail, originally alerted employees to the pause on Dec. 1, the company confirmed in an email to Reuters.
Williams had told employees in a memo that they all shared a responsibility to ""protect each other, our customers and our business as we navigate this pandemic.""
A spokeswoman said the company would re-asses Happy Hour in early January. A Dec. 3 event was also cancelled.
Happy Hours helped lift Starbucks' slumping sales when the company re-introduced them in October 2018. Visits increased more than 11% during the events on average during the fourth quarter that calendar year, according to a January report from advertising platform inMarket.
The events boost foot traffic during a normally slow time of day – afternoons and evenings. But as the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States and Canada this year, Happy Hours in those markets also helped offset reduced visits during breakfast hours as people stopped commuting to work.
Happy Hours are on Thursdays from 2 pm to 7 pm, usually scheduled every few weeks, for customers who download the Starbucks app.

Starbucks had suspended Happy Hour and Double-Star Days promotions in the U.S. and Canada earlier this year as government restrictions shut dining rooms. It restarted the deals in June, according to media reports.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Aon (NYSE:AON)'s $30 billion bid for Willis Towers to create the world's largest insurance broker faces a full-scale investigation because of its complexity, two people familiar with the matter said.
The companies, which are the second and third-largest brokers globally after leader Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC), are looking to the deal to boost their pricing power. Analysts said this will likely trigger deep regulatory scrutiny.
The insurance industry is facing a host of issues, with rising claims and new threats from the global outbreak of coronavirus and climate change.
The European Commission, which will open the probe following the end of its preliminary review on Dec. 21, and Aon declined to comment. A full-scale EU investigation takes about five months.
Aon did not provide concessions on Monday, the deadline for doing so in the preliminary phase to address EU competition concerns, the EU competition enforcer's website showed.
The two companies put together insurance contracts for clients that involve a number of insurance providers, for anything from airlines to large sporting events.

This is Aon's second attempt at acquiring Willis Towers. It dropped an earlier bid last year after media reports broke the news.

7,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>","Covid Shined Light on Biotech, and Bulls See Even Brighter 2021","(Bloomberg) -- This year’s meteoric rise in biotech stocks is here to stay.
That’s according to money managers who expect fresh tailwinds after the industry climbed to records as the advancement of Covid-19 vaccines and therapies drew praise from Wall Street.
While the approval and deployment of vaccines from partners  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), as well as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc., have dominated talk by investors looking to bet on the economy’s rebound, the drug development industry has a range of other catalysts waiting in the wings.
“The outlook for 2021 for biotech is still very positive because the fundamentals are intact, innovation is continuing” and access to capital hasn’t been an issue, said Wendy Lam, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton. Industry success in quickly developing shots to fight the virus, “shine a light on how important the sector is for society,” she said.
Among the most closely tracked catalysts are the potential approval of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB).’s experimental drug for Alzheimer’s disease, expectations for a rebound in deal-making activity, and innovations from gene therapy updates to next-generation cancer technologies. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc’s $39 billion deal to buy Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:ALXN). showed deal making appears set to come roaring back after Covid-19 impacted appetite.
The benchmark Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has climbed 28% this year to trade at a record, and has gained more than twice that of the broader S&P 500. Industry strength, however, has been driven by smaller companies related to Covid-19 shots and therapies or earlier-stage experimental medicines. An ETF with more exposure to smaller biotechs, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI), has jumped 54% this year.
Biotech bulls are continuing to bet on emerging platforms to treat diseases like cancer. They’re also focusing on next-generation medicines such as gene therapies or those developed using technologies like the gene editing tool Crispr. Large-cap players in the space like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN)., Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX)., and  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD). are ripe to outperform in 2021, according to Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh.
‘Transforming Medicine’
For those who have followed the industry since it emerged as an investment vehicle in the 1980s or when it blossomed further at the turn of the century, public recognition of drug development’s value in society has been a long time coming.
Brad Loncar, chief executive officer at Loncar Investments, said the advancement seen with newer technologies like messenger RNA -- used in both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccines -- are the tip of the iceberg in terms of helping patients.
“As a biotech investor, for years and years, it’s been frustrating that we have all of these amazing new technologies that are transforming medicine that the general public doesn’t necessarily see,” he said in an interview. “You see a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) driving down the street or use a social media app so you see the advances in tech, but not necessarily in the biotech sector.”
Euphoria for biotechnology stocks has fueled demand for both initial public offerings and secondary offerings from companies looking to beef up their balance sheets. More than $95 billion has been raised so far this year -- that’s more than double the amount raised in 2019 and the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One of the biggest concerns for generalist investors looking to break into the space has been the unknown impact that a new administration under President Elect Joe Biden will mean for drug pricing. Many industry specialists argue that the ongoing pandemic and broader issues like social equality will trump plans to advance drug-pricing legislation.
Concerns surrounding plans to shake-up what drug developers can charge is “not a risk you want to ignore,” said Amy Kong, chief investment officer of Barrett Asset Management LLC.
Drug pricing is “always a concern and always a risk,” but investors must weigh those worries against the drug pipelines and growth trajectory of the stocks they’re buying, she said.
“Overall, Biotech is still a great place to invest and there’s a lot going on in terms of innovation that should continue to lead to value creation ex-Covid,” said Geoffrey Hsu, a biotech fund manager for OrbiMed Advisors. “This is not a sector that is dependent on Covid to generate returns.”

The euphoria sent investors' cash holdings down to 4% in December - to pre-COVID-19 levels - according to the survey of 217 fund managers with $576 billion in assets under management.
The drop triggered a contrarian ""sell signal"", BofA added. Global stock valuations are nearing the highs seen during the dotcom bubble, with the MSCI World index trading close to 20 times forward earnings.
A whopping 60% of the investors surveyed by BofA said they expected emerging markets to outperform in 2021 by a big margin amid a falling dollar, vaccine rollouts and rising expectations of a V-shaped economic recovery. Allocation to emerging market stocks hit the highest since November 2010.
""2020 was a year utterly dominated by COVID-19 which caused the quickest economic and financial market collapse of all time. However, just half a year later, recovery expectations have also surpassed prior recessions in both speed and magnitude,"" BofA wrote in a note.
COVID-19 was still seen as a threat with 30% of the investors in the survey citing it as a top tail risk, though lower than the 41% seen in November. Fears of inflation featured as the second top tail risk.
Long U.S. tech remained the ""most crowded trade"" for the eighth straight month. Short dollar and long bitcoin came second and third.
Bitcoin has gained 170% this year as hedge funds, family offices and even old-school insurers stormed into the cryptocurrency this year. Some Wall Street banks also began talking up its role in portfolios.

11,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Wall Street Braces for 2021 Oddity: Tech Stocks in the Back Seat,"(Bloomberg) -- As 2021 approaches, many on Wall Street are bracing for unfamiliar territory: A year when technology companies may not be the biggest stars of the stock market.
The Nasdaq 100 Index is on track for its best year in more than a decade with a 43% advance so far in 2020, led by companies with triple-digit gains and eye-watering valuations like  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc. and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) Inc. That’s raising speculation that the rally may fizzle at least for a while in 2021, when the group’s earnings growth is projected to lag behind less-expensive sectors like industrials.
“It’s a matter of what’s the more attractive portion of the market,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “Are you going to pay 40 or 50 times sales or buy something cheaper and wait for the business to normalize?”
Over the past few months, investors have already taken a shine to the latter group as they prepare for a post-pandemic world in 2021. Value, cyclical and small-cap stocks are surging thanks in part to a series of successful vaccine trials that have sent more economically sensitive sectors like energy and financials soaring. Despite notching a record last week, the Nasdaq 100 has done little since its previous high on Sept. 2. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Pure Value Index is up 16% and the Russell 2000 Index of small-cap companies has gained 20% over the same stretch.
Ironically, from an earnings-growth standpoint, value stocks in the S&P 500 are where the best expansion is expected, with profits forecast to expand 46% next year -- more than twice the rate of growth stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Companies in the benchmark index’s technology group are projected to see profits rise by 16%.
Last week, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) downgraded some of the hottest software stocks, saying investors would be better served by gaining exposure to companies that are more sensitive to broad economic growth ahead of an anticipated expansion later in 2021. The bank did raise ratings to overweight on several technology companies, including  Autodesk Inc  (NASDAQ:ADSK). and Altair Engineering Inc., that fit that profile.
Among those downgraded to neutral from overweight were cybersecurity companies Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. and Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) Inc. Both have more than tripled this year.
‘Sector Rotation’
“An expanding economy could cause sector rotation and potential performance headwinds for these types of stocks,” analyst Sterling Auty wrote in a research note.
The rally in technology stocks over the summer was fueled in part by stellar second-quarter earnings relative to other sectors, a performance that wasn’t matched in the third quarter, according to Sean Darby, chief equity strategist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). As the recovery accelerates next year, there’s a greater chance that investors will abandon 2020’s biggest winners in favor of cheaper stocks with greater potential upside, Darby wrote in a note last week. He cut the outlook on technology stocks to “modestly bearish.”
Investors, of course, have made fortunes buying weakness in technology and internet shares over the past decade and many see no reason to change their playbooks to favor stocks whose earnings growth may not be so spectacular once their businesses recover from the pandemic.
Those concerned about valuations are underestimating the growth potential of the best technology companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., argues Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. This year’s trends that benefited from the pandemic -- like e-commerce, cloud and cyber-security -- aren’t going away, he says.
“The winners and the secular growth stories, these are names that will continue to move higher as they grow into their valuation,” he said. “I think the Street is still under-estimating where these growth stories could go in the next two to three years.”
Wall Street analysts are nearly universally bullish on the biggest technology and Internet companies. Of the big five -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Apple,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and Microsoft -- only Apple has fewer than 80% buy ratings, according to Bloomberg data. Of the 56 analysts covering Amazon, 54 have the equivalent of buy ratings, the highest percentage in more than a year.
Ignore technology stocks at your own peril, says Needham analyst Laura Martin. The megacap group is poised to outperform again next year in part due to their scale and the “winner-take-all” nature of most of the markets they compete in, she said in an interview. Facebook and Alphabet are her top picks on expectations for growth in the market for digital advertising as budgets expand.
Even though the first part of the year is likely to be dominated by the re-opening trade, technology stocks are poised to regain market leadership as the economic recovery matures, according to Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager with Roosevelt Investment Group.
“Many of the same characteristics of the last cycle that benefited technology will persist into the next one,” he said, citing low interest rates and slower economic growth. “Once the reopening boost has faded, people will go back to the secular growth of technology.”

12,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",New kinds of loans and bonds could fill $28 billion COVID funding gap: WHO,"By Stephanie Nebehay and Emma Farge
GENEVA (Reuters) -The World Health Organization is looking at new financial instruments to help to fill a $28 billion funding shortfall for tools to fight COVID-19, a senior official said on Tuesday. 
The WHO and GAVI vaccine alliance aim to provide poor and middle-income countries with diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines through a fund known as the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which was set up last April.
Bruce Aylward, a senior WHO adviser and its ACT coordinator, said that new financing mechanisms - including concessional loans and catastrophe bonds - were discussed at a meeting of the ACT facilitation council on Monday, co-chaired by Norway and South Africa. 
""Right now financing is what stands between us and getting out of this pandemic as rapidly as possible,"" he told a U.N. briefing in Geneva. 
""It's a real challenge in today's fiscal environment despite the fact that this is the best deal in town,"" Aylward said, referring to the ACT Accelerator facility. ""This will pay itself off in 36 hours once we get trade and travel moving again."" 
Aylward said that the WHO and partners were in talks with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) to include its COVID-19 vaccine as part of an early global roll out.
He said that he saw a ""strong commitment"" on the part of Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to set prices at levels appropriate to poorer populations. Aylward expected some news on more manufacturers joining the list of providers to the COVAX vaccine facility in coming weeks, he said. 
Canada has pledged to spend C$485 million ($380 million) to support COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries, including antibody treatments, International Aid Minister Karina Gould said on Monday.

13,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>","Fund leader Vanguard pushes for diverse boards, but avoids targets","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Top mutual fund manager Vanguard Group on Monday said it will continue pressing companies to make their boards and workforce more diverse, but stopped short of setting specific targets as rivals have done.
John Galloway, who oversees stewardship efforts for the $6.2 trillion asset manager, said that calling for a certain number of women or ethnic minority directors could lead to unintended consequences such as putting a greater focus on women who are easier for investors to identify by name.
The all-white top ranks of many businesses have drawn growing investor attention because of social protests this summer and as funds focused on environmental, social and governance concerns take in record amounts of money. 
""We don't believe in quotas, because we believe they could be counter-productive,"" Galloway said in an interview late Monday.
Pennsylvania-based Vanguard will encourage boards to take other steps toward diversity such as looking for candidates among human-resources executives and other untapped talent groups, or increasing their sizes, he said.
Vanguard may vote against directors at companies not making any progress, Galloway said. By Vanguard's count among Russell 3000 company boards, some 200 lack gender diversity and about 500 appear to lack racial diversity.
Activists have pressed Vanguard and other top asset managers to cast their influential proxy votes more aggressively. Their traditional support has ""shielded boards from accountability,"" shareholder group Majority Action said on Tuesday. 
Vanguard's approach breaks with those of other big investment firms. For instance,  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS)'s asset management arm said last week that it would urge U.S. boards to have at least one woman and a second diverse director based on gender identity, sexual orientation or racial and ethnic background.
Among top U.S. companies 8% of directors are Black and 5% are Hispanic or Latino, well below the groups' share of the U.S. population, 13% and 19%, respectively.

Vanguard will also encourage companies to disclose workforce data such as by making public diversity information filed to the U.S. government, Galloway said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, as lawmakers attempt to negotiate another economic relief package while vaccines are rolled out across the country.
At 07:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract rose 168 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 22 points, or 0.6%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 63 points, or 0.5%.
The latest proposal for another round of coronavirus stimulus was revealed late Monday, with a previous bipartisan proposal for $908 billion of relief split into two parts, hopefully making at least some of the funding easier to pass through a divided Congress.
The first part will include a $748 billion proposal that has bipartisan support including aid for vaccine distribution and unemployed benefits, while the other is a $160 billion bill for state and local support and temporary Covid-19 liability protection, which may prove more controversial.
These latest steps toward a stimulus deal comes as the U.S. death toll from the pandemic tops 300,000. The most populous state California is already suffering badly, while New York is headed toward a second full shutdown if new infections and hospitalizations continue at their current pace, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday.
The rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is set to gather pace Tuesday, with another 425 locations set to be added to the 145 distribution centers that were authorised on Monday after the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization of the drug.
The Federal Reserve starts its final monetary policy meeting of 2020 later Tuesday, with a policy statement and press conference led by Chairman Jerome Powell scheduled for Wednesday.
On the economic data slate, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for December will provide investors with a read on that segment of the economy, ahead of November’s industrial and manufacturing production figures.
In the corporate sector,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) will be in focus as the Food and Drug Administration is set to release its analysis of data from the stage 3 trial of the biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine, a preliminary step toward the granting of emergency use authorization.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, despite tighter lockdowns exacerbating worries about a hit to demand even as Covid-19 vaccines began to be rolled out.
With this in mind, traders will look at inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later Tuesday and the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday for further guidance.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $47.02 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $50.34.

HAMBURG (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has defused a power struggle over measures needed to accelerate its expansion in electric vehicles, lifting its shares by 5% on Tuesday as investors welcomed Chief Executive Herbert Diess getting allies appointed to key roles.
The conflict had pitted Diess against Bernd Osterloh, Volkswagen's powerful labour boss, whose views differed on the pace required to turn the 83-year old automaker into more of a tech company modelled on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Volkswagen's supervisory board provided unanimous support for the 62-year old CEO in a statement on Monday, as well as backing key appointments he had requested, including Arno Antlitz taking over as finance chief from Frank Witter in June.
""The decisive factor is that he (Diess) was able to assert himself on the points that were important in terms of content,"" Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at savings fund company Deka Investment, said.
Diess, who became CEO in 2018, dropped his demand for an early extension of his contract, which runs until 2023, people close to the supervisory board said, in what was seen as a partial victory for Osterloh.
""Diess is strengthened because he has largely pushed through his demands when it comes to appointments to the board,"" Frank Schwope, an analyst at Norddeutsche Landesbank, said.
""Whether his contract is extended today or in a year's time is irrelevant.""
There was also board agreement that Lamborghini and Ducati will remain part of the Volkswagen Group, which also said it would cut overhead costs by 5% and procurement costs by 7% over the next two years.
VW said that Thomas Schmall would become board member in charge of a newly-created technology division from Jan. 1.
Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management in Bergisch Gladbach said Diess' position is ""not necessarily strengthened"" as he has suffered setbacks.

""When he has had to give in, frustration remains, and this is transferred to the managers,"" Bratzel said.

The search-engine leader, which also develops autonomous driving technology and internet connectivity infrastructure, is considering contract manufacturing, one of the people said, or creating a majority-owned venture with automakers.
The initiative would be a step up from internet peers such as Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, which have also developed auto-related technology or invested in smart-car startups.
Baidu has held preliminary talks - without reaching any decisions - with automakers including Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd, Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (GAC) and China FAW Group Corp Ltd's Hongqi, on a possible venture, the people said.
They declined to be identified as the talks are private.
Baidu declined to comment. GAC said it has a strategic partnership with Baidu and that any further cooperation was subject to discussion. Geely said it was not familiar with the matter. FAW did not respond to a request for comment.
Baidu established autonomous driving unit Apollo in 2017. The unit mainly supplies technology powered by artificial intelligence and work with automakers such as Geely, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
Baidu operates autonomous taxi service Go Robotaxi with safety drivers on board in Beijing, Changsha and Cangzhou, and plans to expand to 30 cities in three years. It gained approval last week to test five cars in Beijing without safety drivers.
Its talks regarding manufacturing come after Didi Chuxing last month launched a purpose-built van for ride-hailing services with automaker BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd. Meanwhile, tech giant Sony Corp (T:6758) in January unveiled an electric concept car with self-driving functions.
Building cars would represent a dramatic development in Baidu's push to diversify income streams as growth plateaus in its core search business, where revenue grew just 2% last year.

Baidu's Nasdaq-listed shares got a 5% boost in premarket trading. Shares of Geely's Hong-Kong-listed subsidiary, Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF), were up as much as 5% in the afternoon. Shares of GAC rose about 1%.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","Automakers urge U.S. support for EV charging, R&D, incentives","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major automotive trade association on Tuesday urged U.S. policymakers to back sweeping support for electric vehicles (EV), including new incentives for research and development and consumer purchases.
President-elect Joe Biden has made boosting electric vehicles a top priority and pledged to build 550,000 new EV charging stations. He also supports new tax credits for consumer purchases and retrofitting factories for EV production.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto trade group representing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and nearly all major automakers, called in a report released Tuesday for a series of steps to boost the EV market and to revamp regulatory oversight of self-driving vehicles.
John Bozzella, the group's chief executive, in an interview argued ""the future of the industry"" is at stake as it spends heavily on electric and self-driving vehicles.
The technologies ""will redefine motor vehicle transportation for decades,"" the alliance said in its report.
Congress has debated legislation to speed up adoption of self-driving cars and new incentives for EVs but has not approved either.
Automakers face significantly tougher emissions rules under Biden and the industry is split over whether to continue backing President Donald Trump's efforts to bar California from setting vehicle emissions rules. California Governor Gavin Newsom said in September he wants the state to bar the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035.
Automakers invest about $26 billion annually in R&D in the United States.
The alliance backs ""enhancing R&D incentives over the next 3-5 years"" and ""facilitating and expanding access to capital to support"" the industry's transformation over that period, it said in the report.
Automakers also back new incentives to transition factories to building cleaner vehicle technologies. 
The group said China ""has already established EV battery supply chain and manufacturing dominance"" and noted China is also moving aggressively to develop automated vehicles.
During his election campaign, Biden said China was on pace to dramatically outpace the United States in EV production.
""We can own the electric vehicle market — building 550,000 charging stations — and creating over a million good jobs here at home — with the federal government investing more in clean energy research,"" Biden said.
Last month, a group of major U.S. utilities, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Uber (NYSE:UBER) and others launched a group to lobby for EV-friendly policies.
The alliance noted the auto industry is spending $250 billion by 2023 on EVs. Bozzella said additional incentives are needed to boost EVs current 2% U.S. market share.
It called for revising building codes to make EV charging easier and boosting government EV fleet purchases.

Under Trump, the White House rejected new tax credits for EVs as it proposed to kill existing credits and made it easier to sell gas-guzzling vehicles.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish pharmaceutical Reig Jofre said on Tuesday it had agreed with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to produce the U.S. company's COVID-19 vaccine, becoming the third Spanish company to be chosen to take part in manufacturing coronavirus vaccines.
After the announcement, Reig Jofre's stock price surged 32% to 4.99 euros ($6.07) a share, on track for its best day ever.
J&J's Janssen subsidiary will transfer the technology required for large-scale manufacture of the vaccine candidate to Reig Jofre, allowing production at its plant in Barcelona to get underway once the shot receives regulatory approval, the Spanish company said in a statement.
Under the terms of the agreement, Reig Jofre said it will be responsible for the formulation, filling and packaging of the vaccine, while Janssen will handle distribution.

20,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 05:33AM ET</span>","StockBeat: H&M, Inditex Hit Speedbumps on the Road to Recovery","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s two biggest fast fashion groups confirmed an inevitable slowdown in their business on Tuesday as the winter wave of Covid-19 pandemic put the chills on store sales across much of the northern hemisphere.
However, both H & M Hennes & Mauritz  (ST:HMb) and Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) cast the development as essentially a mild disappointment on the road to a lasting recovery next year, with Inditex reiterating a dividend policy that includes the payment of a bonus dividend over the next two fiscal years.
Both had all-but managed to restore sales to pre-pandemic levels by the end of summer, but indicated they had faltered again in recent weeks, even though their online channels continued to flourish.
 Hennes & Mauritz  said that its sales slowed markedly toward the end of a fiscal fourth quarter that ran through November 30. In the first half of the quarter, sales had been down only 3% from year-earlier levels, but between October 27 and November 30, they were down 22% “as the recovery transitioned into a new slowdown,” the Swedish company said.
For Inditex, sales had returned to -6% year-on-year in October from a low point of -72% in April, but fresh lockdown measures across Europe and the U.S. meant that sales were 19% below 2019 levels in November and 13% below in the first 10 days of December. Things are likely to get worse from there, with Germany closing non-essential stores, London moving into ‘tier 3’ lockdown measures and Mayor Bill De Blasio warning New Yorkers on Monday to prepare for a full lockdown in the crucial period running up to Christmas.
The stocks of the two companies were reasonably relaxed. H&M stock fell 3.4% but are still up 24% since late October, when the rotation back into cyclical stocks began to crank up. Inditex stock fell 2.3% but is likewise up 26% since late October. The STOXX 600 eked out a 0.1% gain but remains essentially rangebound as the market waits for a resolution to the EU-U.K. trade talks.
Neither stock is cheap, with Inditex trading at 45 times trailing earnings and H&M at over 100 times, although that multiple is burdened by exceptional costs from a restructuring that the Swedish company has now largely completed.
However, both can make passable claims that they have used the pandemic to accelerate a structural shift that was necessary for both – away from expensive brick-and-mortar stores and on to the Internet. Inditex’s online sales were up 76% in year-on-year terms in the nine months through October and have sustained that pace of growth since, the company said.
In the case of Inditex, which put out the more detailed figures, pivoting to a more virtual model has gone hand in hand with a big increase in operational efficiency: it has managed to make do with 8% less working capital this year, and with 11% less inventory.
The next few weeks may still be rough on both, but unless the lockdowns continue long enough to affect the sales of spring catalogues, they are unlikely to be more than a couple of speedbumps on a road that becoming straighter and wider."

The 40% increase from $54 billion in 2019 dwarfed the $7 billion in man-made losses during 2020, the reinsurance company said in its sigma estimate for the year.
The total insurance industry losses of $83 billion made 2020 the fifth costliest year since 1970, the company said.
""Losses were driven by a record number of severe convective storms - thunderstorms with tornadoes, floods and hail - and wildfires in the U.S.,"" Swiss Re said.
In California, Oregon and Washington State, more than 800 wildfires burned close to 6 million acres, destroying thousands of structures and triggering billions in insured claims.
The North Atlantic hurricane season brought 30 named storms, causing $20 billion in insurance claims, the company said.
Five storms hit Louisiana alone, although most of the landfalls did not hit densely populated areas, reducing the total level of insured losses from the $97 billion level seen in 2017.
Climate change is expected to worsen the number of such events, as humid air and rising temperatures create more extreme weather conditions, Swiss Re said.
""As with COVID-19, climate change will be a huge test of global resilience,"" said Jerome Jean Haegeli, Swiss Re Group Chief Economist.
""But while COVID-19 has an expiry date, climate change does not, and failure to 'green' the global economic recovery now will increase costs for society in future.""

It noted its catastrophe loss estimates excluded claims related to COVID-19, which it said would take considerably longer than normal to assess and tally.

At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.3%. 
European Union negotiator Michel Barnier has said that sealing a trade pact with Britain is still possible, while European Commission Ursula von der Leyen noted there was some “movement” over sticking points.
The Times of London reported that the two sides had made progress on the issue of the 'level playing field' as regards regulatory standards, leaving fishing rights as the biggest obstacle to a deal.
This all increases hope that some form of a deal can be reached with just days to go before the U.K. leaves the trading bloc. 
This enthusiasm has outweighed worries about the economic damage being done to the region by the ongoing surge in coronavirus infections.
Late Monday, the U.K. government imposed tighter Covid-19 restrictions on London, citing increased infection rates that may be partly linked to a new variant of the coronavirus. Germany will enter a lockdown from Wednesday that will see the closure of non-essential stores, while the Netherlands has announced a new five-week lockdown and Italy is considering more stringent restrictions over the Christmas holidays.
The Federal Reserve starts its final policy-setting meeting of the year later Tuesday, to conclude on Wednesday. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan also close out their 2020 meetings this week.

Inditex  (MC:ITX) stock dropped 1%, hit by renewed lockdowns despite an improvement in sales in the third quarter compared with the previous one.  Staying in retail, JD Sports (NASDAQ:JD) stock rose 4% after Britain's biggest sportswear acquired U.S.-based shoe retailer Shoe Palace for $325 million, expanding its American footprint.
IG Group (LON:IGG) stock rose 1.9%, after the online brokerage recorded another strong quarter, with net trading revenues in the first half of the year around two thirds higher than last year.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse targets annual 10% jump in wealth earnings to hit profit target,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse is targeting 10% annual earnings growth in its wealth management business over the next three years as it tries to get back on track to hit its profit goals after loan losses and legal provisions threw it off course this year.
Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein, who took over as CEO in February as the coronavirus was surging in China, is reconfiguring  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s investment banking business and is targeting branch closures and a digital overhaul of its home business to cut costs.
Kicking off the bank's investor day on Tuesday, Gottstein said the bank expected to grow wealth-related pre-tax profit to 5.0 - 5.5 billion Swiss francs ($5.64- $6.20 billion) by 2023, from 4.0 billion francs in the first nine months of 2020, as it shifts more of its available capital into the core business and refocuses its investment bank to better serve rich private clients.
""We continue to believe wealth management is one of the most attractive segments in financial services, notably in Asia Pacific, and we also expect to further expand the connectivity between our investment bank and the wealth management-related divisions,"" he said in a statement.
Gottstein said he believed the measures would help the bank deliver on its main profitability goal in a ""normalised environment"", as the bank acknowledged further uncertainties in 2021 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but shied away from restating an ambition previously set for this year for a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of approximately 10%.
RoTE for the first nine months stood at 9.8% as a surge in investment banking failed to offset a slowdown in wealth management.
The bank said on Tuesday that business in the fourth quarter had continued the trend of the previous three months with investment banking revenues ahead of the last year's fourth quarter. In its wealth management division, stronger transaction business, especially in Asia, was offsetting headwinds from the stronger Swiss franc and negative interest rates.
The bank previously flagged two charges totalling nearly $900 million - one an impairment on a hedge fund equity stake, the other a legal provision - that will hit its earnings in the fourth quarter.
The bank confirmed a RoTE target of 10%-12% in the medium term.
In July, the bank had said it aimed to generate roughly 400 million francs in annual savings from 2022 onwards, primarily through the merger of its two investment banking units and a digital overhaul of its business in home markets, which is to include the closure of roughly a quarter of its branches.
It said on Tuesday it planned to reinvest most or all of those savings into technology as well as wealth management and investment banking growth initiatives, including a push to bring its wealth business onto onshore China, as well as expanding offerings for ultra-wealthy private customers and boosting mergers & acquisitions activity. 
Reuters earlier this month reported on a new team of senior dealmakers the bank set up in EMEA focused purely on bringing in business as part of its efforts to increase M&A revenue and market share.
Credit Suisse also said it expected to turn around its asset management business in 2021 by focusing more on alternative and private market offerings, and those related to sustainable investing.
Shares rose 1.1% in the first half hour of morning trading, against a slight fall in the overall Swiss blue chip index.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, said on Tuesday that local-currency sales fell 10% in its fourth quarter, with a pronounced slowdown in the final month as the second wave of coronavirus restrictions curbed spending.
The Swedish rival to Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) said a recovery seen in the previous quarter had continued through much of the fourth quarter but that sales had been hit again from the end of October.
""Between 22 October and 30 November sales decreased by 22 percent compared with the corresponding period last year, as the recovery transitioned into a new slowdown as a result of the pandemic's second wave,"" H&M said in a statement.
H&M said sales in the quarter fell to 52.5 billion Swedish crowns ($6.25 billion) from 61.7 billion a year earlier, although the local-currency drop from the beginning of September to Oct. 21 was only 3% versus a year earlier.
""H&M’s sales were showing good resilience prior to the latest wave of lockdowns, however they may now be affected by further restrictions on stores, such as in H&M’s largest market Germany,"" RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain said in a note.

JD Sports, which entered the U.S. market in 2018 with the acquisition of Finish Line, said the deal would also increase its appeal among Hispanic and Latino consumers, who form a significant proportion of Shoe Palace's customer base.
Shoe Palace is operated by four brothers from the Mersho family who will be issued equity in JD's U.S. unit, the British company said, adding the brothers would own 20% of the enlarged group in the United States.
The value of the issued equity is about $356 million, JD said. 
The owner of Footpatrol and Cloggs said the brothers would continue to manage Shoe Palace, but from next year the JD Finish Line and Shoe Palace teams would ""begin to share ideas and best practices"".
Founded in 1993, California-based Shoe Palace has 167 stores in the United States, and generated a pretax profit of $52 million last year on revenue of $435 million. 
""It's a great fit for JD: Finish Line has a weakness on the West coast and doesn't really connect with the shoppers SP is close to,"" Peel Hunt analysts said.

A new variant of the coronavirus has been identified in London, which may have partly contributed to increased infection rates, forcing the government to enforce the highest tier of restrictions in the city.
Italian media reported the government could decide to put the country under partial lockdown from Dec. 24 to at least Jan. 2, while in France, the number of people hospitalised for COVID-19 rose for the third day, just as the country planned to relax its lockdown.
After a strong session on Monday, the pan-European STOXX 600 index barely moved as investors weighed the prospect of restrained economic activity stalling any kind of recovery.

Of the total payment that was due on Dec. 14, about 30 billion won was owed to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), 20 billion won to  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) and 10 billion won to BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Mahindra said. 
Shares of the Indian automaker fell as much as 1.5% on Tuesday to their lowest since Nov. 23, while those of Ssangyong fell up to 7.72%. 
Mahindra has since June been looking for a buyer for all or most of its 75% stake in the South Korean sport-utility vehicle (SUV) maker, which it bought from near-insolvency in 2010 but has struggled to turnaround.
The move is part of a wider restructuring effort by Mahindra under which it is reviewing all of its loss-making businesses to cut costs and prioritise capital expenditure. 
Ssangyong has total outstanding loans of about 100 billion won ($92 million) to the three banks, Mahindra said.

While the Indian automaker had made a commitment to cover the loans, its final liability would be limited to the extent not recovered from the South Korean SUV maker, it added.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Lessor BOC Aviation says AirAsia X restructuring favours Airbus, calls for debt-to-equity swap","By Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Lessor BOC Aviation Limited (BOCA) has asked a Malaysian court to dismiss AirAsia X Bhd's debt restructuring scheme as it rules out a debt-to-equity swap and gives too much power to Airbus as a creditor, an affidavit filed by a top BOCA executive shows.
AirAsia X (AAX), the long-haul unit of budget airline AirAsia Group, has proposed to reconstitute $15.3 billion of debt into a principal amount of 200 million ringgit ($48 million) and have the rest waived. 
The airline, which has posted losses since June 2019, said the alternative was to face liquidation with no returns to creditors. It is now seeking court approval to convene a meeting with creditors to vote on the scheme.
In an affidavit filed at the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Nov. 26 seen by Reuters, BOCA Chief Operating Officer David Walton said the restructuring was unfair as it writes off 99.7% of claims without offering creditors an equity stake.
BOCA became one of Norwegian Air's top shareholders in May after agreeing with other lessors to convert debt to equity. The airline sought bankruptcy protection last month after failing to get more state support.
Walton also questioned AAX's unfair debt calculations, given most of the amount was tied to aircraft orders from Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) that have not been delivered. 
AAX had previously disclosed that BOCA had challenged the restructuring, but had not given the reasons for it.
""Aircraft purchase commitments cannot be considered as an accurate assessment of the accrued and crystallised debts,"" Walton said in the affidavit supporting the lawsuit by BOCA.
In other recent restructurings such as Thai Airways International PCL and Virgin Australia, the main creditors have been current financiers, lessors and suppliers, not plane manufacturers based on orders. 
AAX's restructuring plan needs approval from creditors holding at least 75% of the total value of the debt. 
A source with direct knowledge of the matter has told Reuters that Airbus has nearly 75% on its own, giving lessors relatively little say.
Walton said BOCA should be categorised as a financing creditor separately from an equipment manufacturer like Airbus as they have different interests.
AAX did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
BOCA declined to comment, saying it is engaged in legal action, while Airbus declined to comment citing confidentiality.
Last month, a court in Britain ordered AAX to pay BOCA $23.4 million for outstanding aircraft lease liabilities. BOCA registered the foreign judgment in Malaysia last week. 
AAX announced on Monday plans to raise $123 million through a rights issue from existing shareholders and share subscription from new investors.
The fundraising however is contingent on approval for the restructuring scheme and at least a dozen creditors have filed objections to it. AAX said it will continue to engage with creditors to allay their concerns.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely lower Tuesday, as worries about increasing Covid-related lockdowns overshadowed optimism about the rollout of coronavirus vaccinations.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded flat, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.1%. 
Late Monday, the U.K. government imposed tighter Covid-19 restrictions on London, citing increased infection rates that may be partly linked to a new variant of the coronavirus.
This follows news that Germany will enter a lockdown from Wednesday that will see the closure of non-essential stores, The Netherlands has announced a new five-week lockdown, while Italy is considering more stringent restrictions over the Christmas holidays.
Across the Atlantic, the number of coronavirus deaths in the United States passed 300,000 on Monday, with large parts of California closed down and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warning that the city should be prepared for a full shutdown. 
All of this has diluted the optimism generated by the United States authorizing the emergency use of its first Covid-19 vaccine, developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), on Friday. The vaccine has already been authorized in a handful of countries, including Britain and Canada.
Elsewhere, European Union negotiator Michel Barnier said that sealing a trade pact with Britain was still possible, increasing hope that a deal can be reached despite the fraught negotiations with just days to go before the U.K. leaves the trading bloc. 
The Federal Reserve starts its final policy-setting meeting of the year later Tuesday, to conclude on Wednesday. Expectations are growing that the Fed will feel the need to expand its bond buying program as U.S. lawmakers dither over a new fiscal stimulus package.
The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan also close out their 2020 meetings this week.
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) reiterated its key financial target while U.K. warehousing group Segro moved to raise its stake in France's Sofibus Patrimoine to 100%. On the economic data slate, the U.K. claimant count rose by 64,300, more than expected, but the unemployment rate only climbed to 4.9%, below the 5.1% expected.  
Oil prices weakened Tuesday, as the tighter lockdowns in Europe exacerbated worries about a hit to demand even as Covid-19 vaccines began to be rolled out.
With this in mind, traders will look at inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later Tuesday and the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday for further guidance.

Markets in Japan and South Korea, both grappling with surging infection numbers and growing public frustration, slipped 0.4% and 0.5%.
Australian stocks fell 0.4%, pulled down by heavyweight miners on fears of higher regulatory scrutiny over surging iron ore prices in top consumer, China.

Last week, the United States authorised the emergency use of its first COVID-19 vaccine, developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech. The vaccine has already been authorised in a handful of countries including Britain and Canada.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Tuesday morning, with tighter COVID-19 restrictions in many countries causing investors to hit the pause button on the recent vaccine optimism. U.S. shares were mixed overnight over dwindling optimism over the likelihood of the latest U.S. stimulus measures being passed.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 08:51PM ET</span>",Airlines warned over safety as jets return from pandemic storage,"By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Regulators, insurers and experts are warning airlines to take extra care when reactivating planes left in extended storage during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing potential pilot rustiness, maintenance errors and even insect nests blocking key sensors.
The unprecedented number of aircraft grounded as coronavirus lockdowns blocked air travel - at one point reaching two-thirds of the global fleet - has created a spike in the number of reported problems as airlines return them to service.
The number of ""unstabilised"" or poorly handled approaches has risen sharply this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Such mishaps can result in hard landings, runway overshoots or even crashes.  
Worried by IATA's data, insurers are questioning airlines about whether they are doing extra pilot training to focus on landings, said Gary Moran, head of Asia aviation at insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON) PLC. 
""They want to know about the circumstances of the training,"" he said. 
Approaches and landings place significant demands on crew for which training and regular experience are seen as vital.       
According to aircraft maker Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), the largest category of fatal accidents can be traced back to the approach to an airport, while the largest number of non-fatal accidents happen during landing.
In May, a Pakistan International Airlines jet crashed after an unstabilised approach, killing 97 people, while 18 died in an Air India Express crash on landing in August, also after an unstabilised approach.
INSECTS IN TUBES
Training is not the only concern.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has reported an ""alarming trend"" in the number of reports of unreliable airspeed and altitude readings during the first flight after a plane leaves storage. 
In some cases, take-offs had to be abandoned or the aircraft had to return to base. 
In most cases, the problem was traced back to undetected insect nests inside the aircraft's pitot tubes, pressure-sensitive sensors that feed key data to an avionics computer. 
In June, a Wizz Air Holdings PLC jet halted take-off after the captain found the airspeed was reading zero. 
Examination of the plane found insect larvae in one of the pitot tubes, with the aircraft having been parked for 12 weeks before the flight, the U.K. Air Accidents Investigation Branch said last month. No passengers were on board.
Insects blocking a pitot tube contributed to the 1996 crash of a chartered Birgenair plane in the Dominican Republic that killed all 189 people on board. 
Kate Seaton, a Singapore-based aerospace partner at law firm HFW, said flight crews need to be aware of potential defects that might not have been identified properly as planes return to service after an unprecedented grounding.
""We are in new territory - the industry must take steps to mitigate the risks but need to be prepared for the unexpected,"" she said. 
HONEST ASSESSMENT
EASA said last month that issues found after prolonged parking included an engine shutdown in flight after technical problems, fuel system contamination, reduced parking brake pressure and emergency batteries losing their charge. 
""We've got people returning to work who are quite rusty, which is a big issue,"" insurer Aon's Moran said.
Airlines have developed training programmes for pilots re-entering service ranging from theory refreshers to multiple simulator sessions and supervised in-flight checks, depending on the length of absence. 
Australia's aviation regulator said on Nov. 30 its inspectors would beef up surveillance on COVID-19 related risks involving the re-entry into service, pilot training and safety risk management for the remainder of the year through to June 30, 2021.
Pilots also need to make an honest assessment of their skills and confidence upon returning to work, International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations representative Peter Meiresonne said at an industry webinar in October. They may need to turn down offers like shorter landing approaches from air traffic control if they do not feel ready, he said.

""Maybe now is a good time to say, 'We are not able today' or 'Give us a six- or 10-mile lineup rather than a four-mile lineup', which you might accept when you are more proficient and (flight experience is) more recent,"" he said.

SEOUL/BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S.-based hedge fund Whitebox Advisors LLC publicly opposed a spin-off plan by South Korea's LG Corp, saying the plan ""sacrifices minority shareholder return in order to resolve a family succession issue"".
LG Corp said in November it would spin off five affiliates into a new holding company next year, the latest reorganisation at one of South Korea's family-led conglomerates as they pass to a new generation of leaders.
Analysts expected the new holding firm, to be headed by Koo Bon-joon, a son of LG's founder, will eventually be separated from LG Corp. LG Corp itself is led by Koo Bon-joon's nephew Koo Kwang-mo, who took over as LG Group chairman in 2018 after his father died. 
""The spin-off does nothing to address LG's most pressing issue, which is the unprecedented discount at which the company trades relative to its assets and, accordingly, inferior return to shareholders,"" Whitebox, which manages about $5.5 billion in assets, said. 
""We are deeply dismayed that the purported rationale for this transaction is to support Koo Bon-joon in developing his own business group,"" it added. 
Whitebox called for LG to stop current plans and propose a new spin-off that ""maximises value for all shareholders"", create a corporate governance committee, and implement a capital management plan. 
LG said shareholder value can be enhanced by the spin-off and independent management of businesses which have low strategic priority in the current LG Group but have high growth potential, which will allow their reevaluation by the market.
It will also offer options for shareholders including a share buyback, LG said in a statement.
Whitebox did not say how much of LG it owns, only that it is a ""long-term shareholder"" that has sought to contact LG's board and management in the past two years. The shareholders meeting for the proposal is expected in late March. 

LG Corp shares were flat in morning trade compared with a 0.3% decline in the wider market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Monday questioned a government lawyer over the Trump administration's efforts to ban Americans from downloading Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington on Sept. 27 blocked the Commerce Department order hours before it was to prohibit new downloads of the short video-sharing app. 
The ban would have required Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google to remove the app from their stores, preventing new users from downloading it or existing users downloading updated versions. It would not have stopped existing users from accessing the app on their devices.
Appeals Court Judges Judith Rogers (NYSE:ROG), Patricia Millett and Robert Wilkins questioned lawyers for TikTok and the government for nearly 90 minutes on Monday morning. All three judges were nominated by previous Democratic presidents.
Two of the judges expressed skepticism with a central government argument about whether a prior case is applicable.
""I know you say it but Congress wrote this language -- it seems to just fly in the face of that,"" Rogers said.
On Dec. 4, the Trump administration opted not to grant TikTok-owner ByteDance a new extension of an order requiring the company to divest TikTok's U.S. assets. A lawyer for TikTok, Beth Brinkmann, said during the court hearing there are ""ongoing talks"" over the app's fate.
President Donald Trump's order, issued in August, gave the Justice Department the power to enforce the divestiture order once the deadline expired. But over a week has passed and the department has not gone to court seeking to compel divestiture.
The administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China's government. TikTok, which has over 100 million U.S. users, denies the allegation.
Under pressure from the U.S. government, ByteDance has been in talks for months to finalize a deal with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to shift TikTok's U.S. assets into a new entity aimed to satisfy the divestiture order.
On Dec. 7, Judge Nichols separately granted a preliminary injunction blocking the U.S. Commerce Department from imposing restrictions on TikTok that would have effectively barred its use in the United States.
Nichols issued an order in a suit filed by ByteDance after U.S. District Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Pennsylvania earlier blocked the same restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12. 
Beetlestone also blocked the app store ban. A separate appeals court in Philadelphia is tentatively set to hold arguments on her ruling on Feb. 11.

The Commerce Department had sought to bar data hosting within the United States for TikTok, content delivery services and other technical transactions.

""While the entire market is pleased, is optimistic, is bullish about the arrival of the vaccine this morning into the U.S., I think the average investor is realizing that this roll-out, this distribution of the vaccine is not going to be a silver bullet, is not going to go as fast as one hopes,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:ALXN) was among the top boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, surging about 30% to a 4-1/2 year high after British drugmaker AstraZeneca said it would buy the U.S. biotech firm. AstraZeneca's U.S.-listed shares dropped 8%.
Walt Disney fell after BMO Capital Markets downgraded the stock following its recent gains and said Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was again its ""top pick."" Netflix climbed almost 4%.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said New Yorkers should ""prepare for the possibility for a full shutdown"" after Gov. Andrew Cuomo over the weekend warned that the city could enter a full shutdown within a month.
The U.S. has reported about 16 million total coronavirus cases, with rising deaths in recent days taking the tally above 300,000.  Fears other parts of the U.S. could be set for further restrictions in the coming weeks offset fresh hopes for a stimulus deal.
U.S. lawmakers have proposed to split the $908 billion stimulus bill into two parts: a $748 billion proposal that has bipartisan support including aid for vaccine distribution and unemployed benefits, and the other, a $160 billion bill for state and local support and temporary Covid-19 liability protection.
The proposed new path toward getting a stimulus deal over the line stoked investor expectations that lawmakers would be able to deliver some form of stimulus before the Congressional holiday recess on Friday.
Efforts in the ongoing battle against the pandemic received a major boost on Monday as the U.S. began rolling out the Pfizer-Biotech vaccine after the FDA granted on Friday granted emergency authorization.

Investing.com -- Stocks fell despite vaccinations starting in the U.S. on Monday, as the prospect of more Covid-19 shutdowns in major cities like New York weighed on sentiment.
It should have been a positive day for stocks after the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control cleared the way for the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). Another vaccine by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) could be approved soon, as well.
But cases are still surging throughout the country, and the U.S. death toll from the virus crossed 300,000. New York’s governor and the mayor of NYC warned a complete shutdown of nonessential activity would be ordered if hospitals started to get overwhelmed. 
Stimulus might ignite stocks, but agreement on Capitol Hill has remained elusive.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow.
1. Oil prices in view on Brexit negotiations and inventory data
The American Petroleum Institute is set to report its weekly inventory numbers for the industry at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT), after last week’s surprisingly massive 15 billion-barrel build. 
Oil prices have inched higher in recent days, with international benchmark Brent Oil Futures reaching above $50 a barrel, on demand concerns as well as on-again, off-again Brexit talks. {8849|Crude Oil WTI Futures}}, the American benchmark, is trading above $46.
2. Congress waffles around on stimulus, again
With the Federal Reserve’s periodic two-day meeting this week, Congress is still going back and forth on a new stimulus to help ailing businesses and households. 
Now lawmakers are talking about splitting the $908 billion stimulus bill into two parts: a $748 billion proposal that has bipartisan support including aid for vaccine distribution and unemployed benefits, and the other, a $160 billion bill for state and local support and temporary Covid-19 liability protection.
The catch here is they have to get it done by Friday, when Congress goes on recess. 
3. Three more stock debuts this week
Last week, investors were dazzled by the public stock debuts of Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) and DoorDash Inc (NYSE:DASH), both of which soared to ridiculous heights and then came back down closer to Earth.
On tap this week are three deals: BioAtla, which makes antibody therapies for cancer, is looking to price an IPO around $15 to $17 a share and raise $150 million. 
Cloud-based lending platform Upstart is looking to raise $252 million in an IPO set to price around $20 to $22 a share. The parent of ecommerce platform Wish -- Context Logic -- is looking to raise $1.1 billion in an IPO of $22 to $24 a share.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -Boeing Co quality inspections related to previously disclosed production flaws in its 787 Dreamliner found the same issue in other parts of the jet, the company said on Monday.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) said earlier this month that inspections for 787 production flaws were taking longer than expected, hampering the U.S. planemaker's ability to deliver jets to customers through December.
On Monday, Boeing added that inspections of assembled 787 aircraft found that some areas where fuselage segments are joined were potentially not as smooth as required. The engineering specifications at issue are roughly equivalent to the width of a human hair, the company noted.
Boeing also said the problem does not pose an imminent safety hazard.
The specific reason behind the broader quality-control checks, and the fact that they now cover areas where large sections of the fuselage come together rather than just certain sections around the jet's tail, was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. 
The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement on Monday that it ""continuously engages with Boeing through established Continued Operational Safety and manufacturing oversight processes to appropriately address any issues that might arise."" 
An FAA official told Reuters ""none of the issues raised recently are considered to be immediate safety concerns, adding that it ""takes these quality concerns seriously and continues to be involved in the discussions about any mitigations.""

(Reuters) - Two Sackler family members who previously served on OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP's board have agreed under pressure to testify this week before a U.S. House of Representatives panel examining the nationwide opioid epidemic, avoiding subpoenas threatened by the committee's chairwoman.
David and Kathe Sackler reached an agreement in recent days with the House Oversight Committee to appear at a hearing set for Thursday, according to a Monday memo from Democratic Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney to members of the panel. The two are among the Sackler family members who own Purdue.
Purdue Chief Executive Craig Landau is also slated to testify at the hearing, the memo said. Landau was not at any point threatened with a subpoena, two people familiar with the matter said.
In a statement, Purdue confirmed that Landau agreed to testify, adding that the company has ""consistently cooperated"" with the committee. Landau's testimony will include steps that Purdue is taking to address the opioid crisis, which includes a proposal to settle widespread litigation from U.S. communities that it values at more than $10 billion, the company said.
A spokesman for Kathe Sackler declined to comment. A spokesman for David Sackler did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The opioid epidemic has claimed the lives of roughly 450,000 people in the United States since 1999 due to overdoses from prescription painkillers and illegal substances such as heroin and fentanyl, constituting an enduring public health crisis. Purdue reaped more than $30 billion from opioid sales over the years that enriched Sackler family members, and it funneled illegal kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies, investigations have found.
Maloney in November invited four family members - David, Richard, Kathe and Mortimer D.A. Sackler - as well as Landau to testify. On Dec. 1, lawyers for the four Sacklers declined the invitation and did not respond to subsequent overtures from committee staff to move the hearing to January, the memo said. That prompted Maloney last week to threaten subpoenas unless family members voluntarily agreed to appear. 
After ""numerous consultations"" between committee staff and Sackler lawyers, the two sides reached agreement for the two family members to testify, Maloney said in the memo. 
The hearing, to be conducted remotely, was originally set for Tuesday. It was delayed by two days to accommodate scheduling concerns, which included Purdue bankruptcy proceedings also set for Tuesday. 
In her memo, Maloney pointed to documents the committee obtained in an ongoing investigation that she contends show the Sacklers closely involved in Purdue's efforts to expand market share for OxyContin, even after a company affiliate faced U.S. criminal charges of misbranding the painkiller in 2007. 
The scheduled hearing follows a far-reaching U.S. Justice Department settlement with the Sacklers and Purdue in October that drew criticism from congressional Democrats and state attorneys general suing the company and its owners over the opioid crisis.
The lawmakers and attorneys general have said the deal failed to hold the Sacklers more accountable and faulted its endorsement of a Purdue bankruptcy plan to restructure it as a public benefit company. The envisioned new entity, while no longer controlled by the Sacklers, would still sell OxyContin, the company's addictive prescription painkiller that has figured prominently in the opioid epidemic.
GUILTY PLEA
Purdue in November pleaded guilty to criminal charges over its handling of OxyContin, which included defrauding the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and paying illegal kickbacks to doctors and a healthcare records vendor, all to help keep opioid prescriptions flowing. The plea deal was part of a broader settlement allowing the company to effectively sidestep paying billions of dollars in penalties.
Sackler family members agreed to pay $225 million to resolve Justice Department civil claims that they disputed. They were not criminally charged.
The Justice Department contends that the settlement, which foregoes most of a $2 billion forfeiture on the condition Purdue receives court approval for its bankruptcy plan, allows more money to flow to U.S. communities suffering from the opioid epidemic.
Purdue and its Sackler family owners have been at the center of thousands of lawsuits and investigations for several years seeking to hold alleged perpetrators responsible for fueling the epidemic. 
Federal, state and local officials have outlined a longstanding effort by Purdue and Sackler family members to aggressively market opioids while minimizing their potential for abuse and overdosing. Sackler family members have said they acted ethically and responsibly while relying on assurances from Purdue management that the company's practices complied with regulations and legal requirements.

Justice Department officials have said recent settlements do not foreclose future criminal prosecutions of individuals associated with Purdue.

In a power struggle leading up to a board meeting on Monday, Diess had demanded an early contract extension and more backing for his reform efforts from the carmaker's non-executive board. He met resistance from powerful directors who represent employees and unions.
After the meeting, the non-executive supervisory board also said in a statement the carmaker would cut overhead costs by 5% and procurement costs by 7% over the next two years.
Diess had sought to lower costs in Germany to free up resources for a mass electrification push and to transform the 83-year old automaker into a tech company modelled on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
That led to a clash with Bernd Osterloh, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s chief labour representative, over issues including appointments to the management board and whether to extend Diess's contract beyond 2023.
The non-executive board, of which Osterloh is also a member, said it had unanimously voted to support the transformation to e-mobility and digital technologies. 
""Over the coming years, the executive board will implement this strategy under Herbert Diess' leadership,"" the supervisory board said. 
The statement said Arno Antlitz would become group finance chief, succeeding Frank Witter, who would quit in June 2021 as previously announced.
Thomas Schmall would become board member in charge of a newly-created technology division from Jan. 1

Also from next year, Murat Aksel, the head of procurement at the VW car brand will in addition take on the same role for the entire group.

WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) -The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit said Monday the United Auto Workers (UAW) union has agreed to independent oversight to resolve a five-year federal corruption investigation that ensnared two former UAW presidents. 
U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider said the UAW would pay $1.5 million to settle tax issues, make significant reforms and be overseen by an independent monitor for six years. Schneider said the civil settlement caps the investigation into the union, but said inquiries could continue against individuals.
""The union has had a problem with fraud, embezzlement and corruption,"" Schneider told a press conference. He added that UAW International President Rory Gamble, who was present, was not a target of the investigation.
Schneider's office has charged 15 former UAW officials as part of its investigation, and former presidents Gary Jones and Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB) both have pleaded guilty to embezzling union funds.
The UAW represents about 400,000 U.S. workers, including workers at Detroit's Big Three automakers and in other fields. At its peak in 1979, the union had a membership of some 1.5 million.
When Schneider and Gamble met in June, they discussed possible independent oversight of future labor agreements.
Gamble was appointed president in November 2019 when his predecessor Jones was forced out after being linked to the corruption inquiry. Gamble promised from the start that he would overhaul the UAW, and previously announced a series of ethics reforms, including increased financial oversight of the union's accounting department.
In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appointed a trustee because of the union's connection to organized crime. The government oversaw the Teamsters from March 1989 until 2015, and a five-year transition period ensued.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating allegations of illegal payoffs to UAW officials by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) NV.
That inquiry led to rival automaker General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) filing a lawsuit against FCA last year, accusing the Italian-American company's executives of bribing UAW officials to secure labor agreements that put GM at a disadvantage.

Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington will exchange 3.0028 of its shares for each TCF share, equating to a price of $38.83, the bank said in a document published on Monday.
Shares in Detroit-headquartered TCF were 3.5% higher at $36.01, while Huntington's stock slipped 5% to $12.27 after news of the deal, which was announced in a joint statement on Sunday.
""It's a great fit for us,"" Huntington Chief Executive Stephen Steinour told Reuters, adding the deal would allow it to invest $150 million more in digital and innovation strategies.
Looser financial regulations and lower corporate taxes under the Trump administration have emboldened regional U.S. lenders to pursue deals as they compete with bigger players such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
Also spurring tie-ups are low interest rates, which reduce profit from lending, as well as investment in technology.
PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) last month bought the U.S. business of Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) for $11.6 billion, while Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Corp, now the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, was created last year by a merger of BB&T Corp and SunTrust Banks Inc (NYSE:STI).
The new combination, centered on Ohio and Michigan, will operate under the Huntington brand and have around $168 billion in assets, making it a top-15 U.S. bank by that measure.
The deal gives Huntington entry into the Minneapolis and Denver metro areas, as well as a bigger Chicago presence.
Steinour, who will be chairman, president and CEO of the combined holding company, said talks began in late-October and the deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.

54,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 12:46PM ET</span>","Shine's Off IPO Darlings Airbnb, DoorDash","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Is the IPO boom sagging? Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB)b and DoorDash Inc (NYSE:DASH) are both falling more than 10% on Monday following their dazzling debuts last week.
The tech companies made their market premiers to a frenzy of demand that drove their stock prices to unbelievable heights, giving the companies valuations greater than peers -- and sometimes, greater than several of them put together.
The fever appears to be passing, but not before it scared off other companies eyeing the markets. Over the past few days, Roblox, which makes video games, had been preparing to go public this month, and decided to delay the move until 2021, The New York Times reported. That was followed by fintech Affirm's decision to do the same, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited a source familiar with the situation.
Last week, DoorDash jumped about 80%, to $182 upon trading for the first time on Dec. 9 after selling 33 million shares -- originally marketed between $90 and $95. The company raised $3.37 billion in its initial public offering. The company's market cap has fallen from $60 billion to $48 billion this week.
Meanwhile, Airbnb opened at $146 on the Nasdaq, above the IPO price of $68 per share, raising $3.5 billion and giving it a market cap of over $100 billion. That has since dropped to about $74 billion. That compares to Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR)'s $41 billion valuation.

Bafa said the departure of Ralf Bose was intended to ensure the integrity of the regulator, Apas, until the facts of the case have been clarified. 
There is no evidence that Bose broke any rules in trading shares of the payment processor while the federal agency was investigating the role of Wirecard auditor Ernst & Young (EY).
Bose told a parliamentary committee last week that he had dealt in Wirecard shares shortly before its collapse, buying them on Apr. 28 and selling them on May 20.
Reuters was not immediately able to contact Bose.
EY audited Wirecard's accounts for years until the company imploded following the discovery of a 1.9 billion euro ($2.3 billion) hole in its accounts. 

The Wirecard case has become an embarrassment for German officials and authorities, who have been accused of failing to sufficiently monitor the company, which was once worth $28 billion and was widely praised as a rare German tech champion.

The supervisory board meeting was brought forward to Monday from its original date of Thursday.
Diess has sought to lower costs in Germany to free up resources for a mass electrification push, seeking to transform Volkswagen into more a tech-focused company.

59,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",Death of World’s Wealthiest Banker Thrusts Heirs Into Spotlight,"(Bloomberg) -- Joseph Safra became the world’s richest banker by transforming a Brazilian lender into a global multibillion-dollar empire.
Now, after a long illness and death at 82, it falls to the next Safra generation.
What’s at stake is a conglomerate which comprises Banco Safra SA, Safra National Bank of New York and Switzerland’s J Safra Sarasin -- firms with about $85 billion in banking assets. There’s also a $2.3 billion real estate portfolio, that includes the Gherkin in London and 660 Madison Avenue in New York, a stake in banana company Chiquita Brands International and a 130-room mansion in Sao Paulo.
Together, his four children and widow stand to inherit a fortune estimated at around $17.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
The succession comes as the global pandemic has roiled markets and accelerated shifts that are upending traditional businesses, such as banking and real estate. Brazil has been particularly hard hit, with the world’s second-highest number of Covid deaths. The Safras -- famous for their cautious approach to business -- also have to contend with competition from upstart firms and foreign banks over wealthy clients.
“Safra’s importance in the financial system is smaller today then it once was. Other banks outgrew it,” said Rafael Schiozer, a professor of Finance at Fundacao Getulio Vargas. “The family now faces challenges both in defining a strategy for its businesses and who will control them.
Safra “leaves a legacy that will be followed by many generations,” according to a statement from Banco Safra on Thursday that said he died of natural causes. The bank didn’t respond to a message seeking further comment.
The Safra dynasty traces its origins to the Ottoman Empire, when it financed camel-caravan traders, and has endured global and family crises.
Joseph Safra was born in 1938, in Beirut, Lebanon, to a Jewish banking clan with roots in Aleppo, Syria. His father, Jacob, moved the family to Brazil after World War II and Banco Safra was established in 1957. He and his brother Moise ran the Brazilian business, after their elder brother, Edmond, had broken off years before to build his own banks in Europe and New York.
Edmond, who later sold the business to  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), died in 1999 as a victim of arson in Monaco.
In Brazil, Joseph and Moise grew the bank into one of Latin America’s biggest, catering to the country’s wealthiest people and most prominent companies. The business was known for its soundness, withstanding the many turbulences its home nation threw at it.
Jacob Safra famously said: “If you choose to sail upon the seas of banking, build your bank as you would your boat, with the strength to sail safely through any storm.”
It also had misteps, including in 2009 after the group was linked to a feeder fund for Bernie Madoff, who orchestrated a $17.5 billion Ponzi scheme.
Joseph and Moise split in the 2000s, when a falling out between the two led Joseph to create a rival lender across the street from his family’s, J Safra, and started poaching clients. To end the dispute, Moise sold his share of the family business to Joseph in 2006 for a reported $2.5 billion and left the bank.
Joseph Safra, who had parkinson’s disease, did make arrangements for his succession. His children Jacob, David, Alberto and Esther were all granted shares of the family’s main asset, Banco Safra, last December, according to a regulatory filing. Two of his sons already have central roles within the group, with Jacob running the international side of the operations, while David oversees the Brazilian firm.
Joseph’s middle son, Alberto, departed from the board of his family lender in 2019, due “exclusively to his personal intent of dedicating himself to another project with the family,” according to a memo sent by Safra at the time. Alberto kept his stake at Grupo J. Safra and created ASA Investments. Joseph’s daughter, Esther, is an educator and was never involved with the bank.
“Joseph, Moise and Edmond had their differences at their time, disagreeing on how to handle the business, and the next generation might have their disagreements too,” said Rodrigo Marcatti, a former Safra employee who’s now chief executive of Veedha Investimentos.
The younger Safras are already making their mark. The Brazilian unit, built to serve the wealthy and the nation’s biggest firms, ventured into retail banking this year. In October it launched AgZero, a digital bank with no branches, while beefing up a digital investment platform under the SafraInvest brand. Notoriously low-profile, the lender has invested more on marketing.
There are also subtler changes. Last year, David was seated arm-in-arm with the rest of the nation’s banking elite at a year-end luncheon hosted by the Brazilian federation of banks. At those sorts of events, Banco Safra was usually represented by a high-ranking executive, not a family member -- Joseph was incredibly media shy, rarely gave interviews and avoided public events. David’s presence was seen as a show of force within the firm.
“Safra was always a traditional bank, but being traditional doesn’t mean it’s not evolving,” Schiozer said. “What differentiates it is that Safra is seen as safe, no one is afraid of doing businesses with it.

Investing.com -- Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) may be the next big tech takeover target, prompting shares to jump 6%.

Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) may be eyeing the file-sharing platform, according to The Information.
Dropbox is up 40% this year, which is nice but doesn't approach its peers  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) and  DocuSign Inc  (NASDAQ:DOCU), which are up more than 480% and above 200%, respectively in 2020.
The stock is down 24% since the company went public in March 2018.
Dropbox has positively surprised the market every quarter, reporting profit and revenue above expectations. For the third quarter, it reported earnings per share of 26 cents, better than the estimated 18 cents, on sales of $487 million versus the expected $484 million.

Investing.com -- Virgin Galactic slumped after a test flight to space was aborted shortly after takeoff because of a technical snag.
Shares tumbled 12% after White Knight Two's ignition sequence to light the space plane failed to complete on Saturday in New Mexico, Ars Technica, a tech and science news website, reported. It was the first attempt to fly in two years. The rocket motor failed to fire and the two pilots on board glided the vehicle back to a runway in New Mexico.
""The flight did not reach space as we had been planning. After being released from its mothership, the spaceship’s onboard computer that monitors the rocket motor lost connection,"" said Chief Executive Officer Michael Colglazier in a statement. ""As designed, this triggered a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor. Following this occurrence, our pilots flew back to Spaceport America and landed gracefully as usual.""
Virgin Galactic is now conducting post-flight analysis and said that the onboard computer that monitors the propulsion system lost connection, triggering a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor. This system, like others on the spaceship, is designed such that it defaults to a safe state whenever power or communication with sensors is lost.  
""As we do with every test flight, we are evaluating all the data, including the root cause assessment of the computer communication loss. We remain focused on the test flight program we have previously announced, beginning with a repeat of this test flight,"" Colglazier said. ""This will be followed by another test flight which will include mission specialists in the cabin. And following that flight, we will have another test flight which will include our founder, Sir Richard Branson.""
Virgin Galactic's first successful suborbital flight took place in December 2018, according to Ars Technica. New Mexico invested more than $200 million to attract and retain Virgin Galactic, which recently moved from California.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Wall Street opened higher on Monday as the start of the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in the United States cheered investors, while Britain's pound jumped on a last-gasp extension to Brexit talks.
News that London and Brussels had agreed to ""go the extra mile"" to try to salvage a Brexit trade agreement set an optimistic tone, boosting Europe's main share index and lifting the euro against the struggling dollar.
""We are going to give every chance to this agreement... which is still possible,"" the European Union's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told reporters before updating envoys from the 27 EU countries on Monday.
Progress on coronavirus vaccines boosted sentiment, with the first doses being shipped across the United States as part of an effort to inoculate more than 100 million people by the end of March.
That was despite second waves of the pandemic forcing Germany, the Netherlands and possibly London back into stricter lockdowns. Cases surged in Japan, South Korea and parts of the United States as well.
""The vaccine has and will likely continue to provide a tailwind to the market that is allowing investors to look beyond record case levels, hospitalizations and deaths,"" analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.76%, the S&P 500 gained 0.86% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.31%.
MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets rose 0.65% to 633.94, while its index for emerging markets stocks fell 0.5%. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index added 0.61% to 1,517.92.
Japan's Nikkei rose 0.3% as a survey showed the mood among Japanese businesses improved in the December quarter. 
In currencies, Sterling was the day's big mover, gaining on both the euro and the dollar as what last week had appeared to be evaporating prospects of a Brexit agreement came back to life.
Sterling was last trading at $1.3335, up 0.85% on the day after earlier climbing 1.2% to $1.3423. 
""Even in the face of amped up rhetoric, we continue to think a deal is the most plausible outcome,"" said AXA Group chief economist Gilles Moec.
The dollar index fell 0.025%, with the euro up 0.16% to $1.213. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.01% versus the greenback at 103.99 per dollar.
The Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Dec. 15-16 will be an added hurdle for the dollar. The market is assuming the central bank will merely refine its forward guidance on policy rather than buying more bonds or ""twisting"" its portfolio to add longer-dated debt.
The Bank of England on Thursday and the Bank of Japan on Friday will close out central bank meetings for 2020. Before that, Wednesday brings the global flash PMIs and on Tuesday, China will issue its monthly data.
""The risk is then if the Fed does unveil a surprise twist at this meeting, then Treasuries could rally and the USD could fall,"" said Tapas Strickland, a director of economics at NAB.
An extra wrinkle is the chance of a U.S. deal on fiscal stimulus after a top Democrat hinted a compromise was possible to get an agreement past Republican objections.
Reuters reported a $908 billion relief plan would be split in two to win approval and could be introduced as early as Monday.
The talk of stimulus helped put a floor under gold, leaving it lower at $1,833 an ounce. Gold has gained more than 21% this year.
Oil prices rose on Monday, maintaining a six-week rally as investors priced in a global recovery next year. [O/R]

66,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Europe's banks have a way to go on sustainability - BlackRock study,"By Simon Jessop and Kate Abnett
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's banks are not integrating climate change and other sustainability concerns into their risk management systems as quickly as regulators expect, a study by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) for the European Union showed on Monday.
In an interim report, BlackRock said it had analysed feedback from the region's lenders and found most were only just starting to reflect environmental, social and governance (ESG) related risks in their internal processes. 
A final report, which will be used by Brussels to help develop new regulations, is due by April next year.
""While interviewed banks often state that they have initiatives in place to enhance the integration of ESG risks, the majority have not formalised an ESG risk integration strategy with clear timelines and responsibilities,"" it said. 
""With respect to climate risk, many smaller banks stated that they have not yet started its integration into risk management,"" the report said.
It also found that only a minority of regulators provide guidance to banks on ESG risks or reflect it in their oversight processes, such as through climate-related stress tests.
""The majority of supervisors interviewed do not yet have any quantitative indicators in place to monitor and assess the exposure of supervised banks to ESG risks,"" the report said.
While some banks have begun to launch ESG-related products and make commitments to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate, the report said that in the view of many civil society organisations, efforts by lenders so far fell short.
""The Commission is committed to transparency. As promised, we published BlackRock's interim report today,"" a European Commission spokesman said. ""This report is only a preliminary analysis of data collected so far. The final report is to be submitted to the Commission at a later stage.""
The EU's appointment in April of the world's biggest asset manager to help it plan future prudential regulations has raised concerns about conflicts of interest.
While the bloc's Ombudswoman said last month that the Commission had failed to consider such conflicts properly, she did not cancel the contract.

67,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>","Biotech, pharma investments on VC radar in 2021 - PitchBook","(Reuters) - The two main areas for venture capitalist (VC) investment - technology and healthcare - have grown during the COVID-19 pandemic and investors have ample dry powder to direct money at biotech and pharma firms in 2021, research firm PitchBook said on Monday.
There is mixed news heading into 2021 on the COVID-19 pandemic front, with rising infection levels and a handful of vaccines showing promise. 
Added to this, a new administration in the United States and its policy proposals, taxes, immigration, trade policy, and other issues that directly affect both VC investors and companies will all be on the table next year, PitchBook said in its 2021 U.S. venture capital outlook report.
VC investment in the biopharma space is likely to surpass $20 billion in 2021, driven by the need to fund trials and build out research and development programs, as clinical trials resume and elective procedures restart.
On the other hand, the number of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which raise funds through an initial public offering (IPO) to acquire another company within two years, is expected to dwindle in 2021 compared to 2020, PitchBook said. 
A total of 162 SPACs listed so far this year have raised $55 billion, an increase of 501.8% on capital raised and 295.1% in count from 2019.
""Just eight months into this new SPAC phenomenon, we've already seen signs of oversaturation in the market, with a recent uptick in the number of downsized SPAC IPOs,"" PitchBook analysts said.
Over the next 12 months, the analysts expect to see more signs of overcrowding in the SPAC market, including a year on year decline in SPAC IPO volume. 

PitchBook said more companies, especially large-sized technology startups, are expected to take the direct listing route to go public instead of an IPO in 2021.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday on signs that plans for a fiscal stimulus package had been simplified to a degree that might let them pass Congress this week, while the start of distribution of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine provided a welcome reassurance against the backdrop of continued high numbers of deaths and hospitalizations from the coronavirus.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 216 points, or 0.7%, at 30,262 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was outperforming with a gain of 1.0%.
Over the weekend, reports emerged that the bipartisan group of lawmakers behind the $908 billion stimulus proposal endorsed by House Democrats were prepared to split off contentious clauses about legal liability protections for businesses and aid for state and local governments, in the hope of getting the less controversial pieces of the package through before Friday, when the goverrment’s spending authority expires.
The development represents something of a victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has resisted any plans for his party sees as a bailout for profligate local government. House Democrats, for their part, have insisted that the $160 billion in aid foreseen is vital to help front-line services defeat the pandemic. The number of Americans in hospital with the disease rose to a new record high of over 109,000 at the weekend, while the number of deaths was also higher than the previous week.
This week will see the last Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year, and comes with a certain amount of speculation on further monetary easing already baked into prices. However, views are mixed, something that creates a two-way risk to price if the Fed over- or under-delivers.  
""A faithful and fulsome reading of the last FOMC and its meeting minutes, plus statements from some key FOMC members, suggest to us that – at least through the media blackout period which began on Friday December 4 – there is no committee consensus for long maturity purchases yet,"" said Bank of New York macro strategist John Velis in a research note to clients. 
Among early movers, DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) stock and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock both fell on profit-taking after their astonishing debuts last week provoked much commentary about bubbles over the weekend. Doordash fell 12.2% and AirBnB fell 9.3%, but both remain well above their IPO prices. 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) stock rose 30% as the life sciences company agreed to be bought by U.K.-based AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) for $39 billion, the biggest deal in biotech M&A this year. AstraZeneca ADRs fell some 6.4%, amid concern that is overpaying, and awareness that Astra will be paying some two-thirds of the acquisition price in stock.
Elsewhere, trading in SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI) stock was briefly suspended after it fell sharply in response to reports that many of its tools had been compromised in what appeared to be a Russian-sponsored attack on U.S. government agencies. The stock resumed trading down 13.8% from Friday's close."

70,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>",Oil Sands Win Wall Street Favor After Years in Shale Shadow,"(Bloomberg) -- After years in the shadow of the U.S. shale boom, the Canadian oil sands are emerging from 2020’s historic market crash with a slew of upbeat outlooks from Wall Street equity analysts.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). are the latest firms to point out the industry’s ability to generate healthy cash flow next year as a reason to buy stocks like Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) Inc., Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd. and MEG Energy (OTC:MEGEF) Corp. That follows similar reports from BofA Securities and BMO Capital Markets.
“With improved cost structures and increased propensity to be capital disciplined, Canadian producers are emerging from the downturn stronger, with greater ability to generate free cash flow,” Morgan Stanley analysts Benny Wong and Adam J Gray said in a note Friday.
Among tailwinds improving the prospects for the beleaguered heavy-crude producers of northern Alberta are declining competition from Mexico and the start of construction of three pipelines, following years of insufficient shipping capacity. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s decision last week to narrow the scope of Canada’s new Clean Fuel Standard, by including liquid fossil fuels but leaving out solid and gaseous fuels, is also seen as a positive for the sector.
Steady output from their mines means that oil sands producers are able to keep revenue coming for decades without too much investment, while the short life span of shale wells forces U.S. explorers to constantly burn cash just to keep up production.
The eight largest oil-sands producers by market value posted a combined free cash flow of $1.4 billion for the third quarter, compared with $163.7 million from the top eight U.S. exploration and production companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Exports of Mexico’s flagship Maya heavy crude grade are forecast to decline by 70% in the next three years, helping narrow Western Canadian Select oil’s discount to New York-traded futures to $5 to $7 a barrel next year, BMO Capital Markets said in October. The price gap is currently at about $12 a barrel.
Demand for WCS has also risen after OPEC countries cut output of their heavier, higher-sulfur grades similar to those from the oil sands. Canadian oil will continue to be “well supported” in 2021, according to Goldman.
Also See: Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) Pipeline Linking Oil Sands to Midwest Wins Approval
To be sure, oil sands companies also face potential headwinds. Increasing numbers of banks and investors have shunned the industry because concerns over high carbon emissions. The pipelines that are under construction still face potential court delays, as well as political opposition.
Adam Waterous, chief executive officer of Calgary-based private equity firm WEF GP, is among investors expecting more profitability from the oil sands than shale. He estimates U.S. crude production will fall by about 2.5 million barrels a day in the next year as oil prices are still too low to earn attractive returns.
WEF controls two Canadian oil producers including Cona Resources Ltd., which bought Pengrowth Energy Corp. in January for about C$790 million ($620 million), including debt, and is currently embroiled in an attempted hostile takeover of Osum Oil Sands Corp.
“The best days of the U.S. oil industry are definitely behind us,” he said. “We are very bullish on Canadian oil sands where others are not.”

The coronavirus crisis dented demand for crude oil and created a supply glut, although prices have recovered from historic lows hit earlier this year as vaccines have started rolling out across the world.
Phillips 66's 2021 refining capital budget of $776 million includes pre-construction costs related to the company's plans to reconfigure its San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, to produce renewable fuels.

74,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","AstraZeneca shares fall on ""hefty"" $39-billion Alexion deal","By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) -AstraZeneca shares fell as much as 9% on Monday, as investors moved to price in the costs of a $39 billion deal for U.S. biotech company Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) that would be the British drugmaker's biggest ever corporate acquisition.
The deal, announced over the weekend, is also one of the biggest in an already bumper year for mergers and acquisitions and at current market prices will be almost two-thirds funded with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shares. 
The terms of the deal give Alexion shareholders $60 in cash and about $115 worth of equity per share, working out at a premium of more than $50 per share according to Reuters calculations.
Analysts from two brokerages, Cowen and Liberum, called the price respectively ""considerable"" and ""hefty"", while praising the quality of the assets AstraZeneca was buying.
AstraZeneca shares were down 5.9% at 7,676 pence by 1048 GMT, wiping roughly 7 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) off its market value of 107.1 billion pounds, as of its last close.
The deal is a bet on rare-disease and immunology drugs that will aid Chief Executive Pascal Soriot in his bid to broaden AstraZeneca's drug portfolio further after a successful push into cancer treatments. 
Some analysts wondered if the $175 per share price tag left room for a competing bid but Soriot said on Saturday that the deal was the result of exclusive talks and that no competitive bidder had been involved.
Shares in Alexion surged to more than $163 a share, enough to suggest investors believed the deal would succeed but stopping well short of pricing in a bidding war. The company would also have to pay AstraZeneca up to $1.2 billion to walk away from the deal. 
Alexion shares in 2015 traded as high as $200 a share and the deal follows pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management to complete a sale. 
In eight years at the helm https://www.astrazeneca.com/our-company/leadership.html#, Soriot has made AstraZeneca one of the pharmaceutical world's success stories, raising profits and broadening its portfolio.
Shares of the company, however, have now lost around 17% since hitting a peak in July, as rivals  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) moved ahead in the race to get their COVID-19 vaccines approved.

75,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","Dow Futures Up 248 Pts; Vaccine Distribution, Stimulus Talks Eyed","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, as investors weigh up the rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine and updates on a new coronavirus relief package.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract were up 248 points, or 0.8%, S&P 500 Futures traded 28 points, or 0.8%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 75 points, or 0.6%. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has started to be rolled out from a facility in Michigan to hundreds of distribution centers across the country after the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization of the drug on Friday.
This comes as U.S. coronavirus-linked deaths rapidly approach 300,000. New infections continue to explode, with more than 219,000 cases reported on Saturday, pushing most of California back under lockdown and with indoor dining set to be curtailed again in New York City.   
Given these numbers, investors will be keen to hear if more fiscal stimulus is coming. A bipartisan group of House and Senate negotiators has decided to split its $908 billion Covid relief package into two separate proposals. One bill will be a $748 billion proposal, which includes money for small business loans, jobless benefits and vaccine distribution, and is expected to pass. The second includes $160 billion for state and local aid that includes liability protections for businesses and other entities, the two biggest points of contention.
Additionally, the Federal Reserve is set to hold its final monetary policy meeting of 2020, concluding on Wednesday, against the background of a faltering economic recovery.
That may prompt policymakers to debate making changes to the bank’s asset purchase program, but an alteration of the pace or composition of bond buying is deemed unlikely at this point.
In the corporate sector, Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN) will be in focus after Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) agreed to buy the U.S. drugmaker for $39 billion in its largest ever deal. All eyes will also be on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), as the electric carmaker joins the benchmark S&P 500 index at the end of the week. 
Oil prices pushed higher Monday, continuing recent gains amid confidence the start of the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer, will result in a rebound in demand next year.
Jitters surrounding an oil tanker exploding after being hit by an as-yet unidentified external source while discharging at Jeddah port in Saudi Arabia also resulted in prices rising.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $47.14 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.1% to $50.50. Both benchmarks have posted gains for six consecutive weeks, their longest stretch since June.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,830.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.2157.

(NYSE:SNOW) is poised to face more selling pressure on Tuesday when company insiders get their first chance to cash out since the initial public offering three months ago.
Shares of the cloud-computing company have nearly tripled since Sept. 15 with investors becoming enamored with its triple-digit revenue growth and potential to expand market share. That’s made Snowflake the best performing U.S. company to debut this year, excluding IPOs that raised less than $1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has fallen in two of the last three trading days since closing at a record $390 on Dec. 8 and more declines could be in the offing if insiders are tempted to cash in.
Snowflake’s gains have raised concerns that after adding more than $60 billion in market value, its valuation is getting overheated. On Friday,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) downgraded its rating to hold from buy, warning that a further rally is probably limited as investors seek to lock in gains at the end of the year. The stock fell 5.2% to close at $353.96.
“Any profit taking around the lockup expiry could be exaggerated by tight liquidity typical in late December and early January,” analyst Patrick Colville wrote in a research note.
Snowflake’s lockup expiration comes just three months after its debut, half the length that is typical following an IPO. Of the 22 analysts covering the San Mateo, California-based company, less than half recommend buying the stock. A Snowflake representative declined to comment.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Canadian court will hear testimony from a technical witness on Monday in the case to extradite Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to the United States.
The witness will testify via video from Ontario about the federal police force's email system at prosecutors' request.
Meng, 48, was arrested at the Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 on a warrant from the United States. She is charged with bank fraud over allegations she misrepresented Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran to its lender, HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
She has denied all charges and is fighting to throw out the extradition case from Vancouver.
Her lawyers argue that U.S. and Canadian authorities coordinated to use the extended powers of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to interrogate Meng without a lawyer present ahead of her arrest by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).
They claim that this and other alleged abuses of process during her investigation and arrest should invalidate the extradition.
Prosecutors say the investigation and arrest followed standard procedures and the extradition should move forward.
Witness testimony was originally scheduled for just five days in late October and early November but has since been extended several times.

Interest in the case has risen after news earlier this month that U.S. prosecutors are discussing a deal with lawyers for Meng to resolve criminal charges against her, signaling a potential end to a case that has strained ties between the United States, China and Canada.

80,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 05:44AM ET</span>",StockBeat: AstraZeneca's Alexion Move Deserves a Better Reaction,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has come up with a good, old-fashioned acquisition to remind everyone what biotech M&A used to be all about before the pandemic.
The company has agreed to buy U.S.-based Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN) for $39 billion, a move that will launch it into the high-margin world of treatments for rare diseases. In doing so, it will diversify its own revenue stream, protect itself against patent cliff effects and – it hopes – strengthen cash generation both to service a progressive dividend policy and whittle down a debt load that is one of the few long-term concerns of shareholders.
Astra’s share price fell 5% by mid-morning in London, amid some worry that it may yet get dragged into a bidding war. However, on the terms disclosed, there is not too much to dislike about the deal.
The price represents a premium of around 43% on the one-month average price for Alexion, which may look expensive at first glance, but is par for the course in the sector. In any case, Astra is covering two-thirds of the cost with its own generously-valued stock, reaping the rewards of past value creation under chief executive Pascal Soriot.
The beauty of it is that Alexion’s business, which depends heavily on a single blockbuster drug, should command a higher valuation when incorporated into a broader portfolio of drugs. Alexion’s share price has gone nowhere for the last four years not least because of concerns about patent expiry that have only partly been allayed by the development of Ultomiris, a second-generation version of its cash cow Soliris.
In its most recent update, Alexion reported that sales of Ultomiris more than tripled in year-on-year terms in the third quarter, suggesting that it is successfully transitioning patients to the new drug, whose patent protection runs for longer.
All that gives AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) the confidence to say the deal will raise earnings per share by 10% over the next three years, with annual synergies of $500 million far offsetting one-off costs of $650 million. Dividend cover, it added, will be “materially enhanced.” While the company is borrowing another $17.5 billion to finance the deal, around 20% of that will go to refinancing Alexion’s debt.
It’s been easy to forget that this is the kind of move that had already made AstraZeneca the most valuable stock in the FTSE100 even before the events of this year. The intense spotlight on the race for a Covid-19 vaccine has left much of the longer-term action in the biotech sector in the shadows.
The deal shows that the company hasn’t forgotten to plan for life beyond the pandemic – rightly so, given that it isn’t likely to earn much out of its vaccine: it has promised to distribute that more or less at cost as long as the pandemic lasts."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - New World Development said its land investment in mainland China may exceed that in Hong Kong in the near future, as a new Chinese policy gives it an edge over indebted peers in the hunt for premium land in the ""Greater Bay Area"".
The new policy, dubbed ""the three red lines"", aims to tackle unbridled borrowing in China's real estate sector, capping debt-to-cash, debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios, effectively limiting debt-driven growth strategies.
""Some Chinese peers who were competing with us are now being restricted by the three red lines,"" New World CEO Adrian Cheng, who took over the top job at the HK$95 billion ($12 billion) conglomerate from his father in May, told Reuters.
""We're not restricted, so we are able to get even better land,"" Cheng said, adding the Hong Kong-based company passed all three red lines because its gearing was only at 40% versus high double digits among mainland Chinese peers.
The bulk of New World's mainland investment will focus on redevelopment projects, which convert old villages into mix-used integrated property complex, involve a long development time but yield attractive margins, the CEO said.
New World has six such projects in the ""Greater Bay Area"", which will be added to its landbank in 2022-2026.
The group has split its land investment equally between Hong Kong and the mainland this fiscal year, but the allocation may favour the latter in the future due to ""old city redevelopment landbank replenishment"", Cheng said.
""We'll continue to buy some premium land in the Greater Bay Area,"" Cheng added.
It sees similar sales contractions in mainland China and Hong Kong this year, but expects mainland sales to grow in double digits in the next few years.
Mainland China's contribution to New World's revenue rose to 37% in the year just ended, from 32% a year earlier. Its revenue for the year to June 2020 was HK$59 billion.
Greater Bay Area ""will be our growth engine, but ... the recurring income in Hong Kong will be pretty strong"".
China is developing the ""Greater Bay Area"" to spur growth in Guangdong province, Hong Kong, and Macau. The area has a combined GDP of about $1.5 trillion, roughly equivalent to that of Australia or South Korea.
New World is also looking for Greater Bay Area-related opportunities in Hong Kong, where it is among the top four property developers.
It has announced deals with anchor tenants who will provide wealth management and medical services in its HK$20 billion retail and business complex near the Hong Kong International Airport, expected to be completed in phases from 2022.
""Many Hong Kong products can be sold to the Greater Bay Area ... once that market opens, you have a 70 million population, which is bigger than South Korea's,"" Cheng added.

That has created a huge opportunity for passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion companies, including Singapore Technologies (ST) Engineering Ltd, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and U.S.-based Aeronautical Engineers Inc.
Aviation analytics firm Cirium expects the number of P2F conversions globally will rise by 36% to 90 planes in 2021, and to 109 planes in 2022.
""We estimate that most slots are sold for 2021 and at least 40% for 2022,"" Cirium Head of Market Analysis Chris Seymour said. ""There is an increase in newer-generation programs, notably the 737-800 and A321 as well as the A330, although older types like the 767 continue to see strong demand, driven in the past few years by Amazon building their own fleet.""
The market value of 15-year-old planes has fallen by 20% to 47% since the start of the year depending on the model, according to advisory firm Ishka, which makes freighter conversions more attractive. 
Air Canada is looking to convert several of its Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 767s, Russia's S7 Group is acquiring its first 737-800 converted freighters from lessor GECAS, and lessor CDB Aviation has ordered two Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A330 conversions from ST Engineering's EFW joint venture with Airbus.
The P2F conversions are a step beyond the cheaper temporary conversions many airlines have implemented during the pandemic, which remove passenger seats to carry more cargo. 
Permanent conversions are a financial bet that air freight demand, which was weak before COVID-19, will remain strong for years to come as shoppers turn to e-commerce. The airline industry estimates it will take until 2024 for passenger traffic to recover to 2019 levels.
Freight markets are notoriously volatile, however, and have been beset by extended downturns; shortage can quickly turn into overcapacity, analysts warn.
Normally about half of the world's cargo is carried in the bellies of passenger planes, but the hit to demand has left the world more reliant on dedicated freighters.
""2020 has seen record high freighter aircraft utilisation, and our view is that the pandemic has accelerated the long-term structural shift towards increased e-commerce demand,"" said CDB Aviation chief executive Patrick Hannigan.
Boeing said cargo yields had risen by 40% through September because of the pandemic-related passenger disruptions, and it forecasts more than 60% of freighter deliveries over the next 20 years will be conversions rather than new widebody freighters like the 777. Narrowbody freighters are almost all conversions.
The conversion boom is also helping aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul groups offset some of the lost business from the decline in passenger flights.
Such conversions generally cost millions of dollars on top of the cost of the aircraft and take three to four months, said ST Engineering Aerospace president Jeffrey Lam said.
His company is ramping up capacity, with plans to convert at least 18 A321 planes next year, rising to around 25-30 annually in the future, up from single digits this year. 
""We are all booked out for 2021 for aircraft conversions,"" Lam said. ""The first slots are well into 2022.""
ST Engineering also may add converted freighters to its leasing business, which has focused on passenger planes, he said.
IAI can convert 18 or more 767s a year and produces most of those used by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""We are investing a lot of effort to meet the market demand,"" said Yosef Melamed, general manager of IAI's aviation group, which is also working on the first-ever P2F conversion of the larger 777-300ER as part of a 15-plane contract with GECAS.
""What happened with the coronavirus outbreak, commercial flights were significantly reduced ... international flights dropped to nearly zero,"" he said. ""So the only solution for transporting cargo, and with the trend that people are staying at home ordering online, is cargo planes.""
U.S.-based Aeronautical Engineers is also seeing a dramatic increase in demand for conversions, said Robert Convey, its senior vice president for sales and marketing, citing a 30-40% fall in the value of planes. 
""We're seeing younger and younger aircraft being converted due to the large number of passenger aircraft that have been grounded and are not likely to return to service in the near future,"" he said.
Grant Stevens, vice president of corporate services at Canada's KF Aerospace, said increased demand for P2F conversions, which grew from about 10% of its business before the pandemic to about half today, has helped offset a decline in requests for aircraft maintenance. 

""We have been able to employ most of our staff by doing conversions,"" he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, adopting a cautiously optimistic stance after Brexit negotiations were extended past the Sunday deadline.
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8%, and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.1%. 
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed over the weekend to go the “extra mile,” ignoring a self-imposed Sunday deadline and giving negotiators another shot at closing a trade deal. 
The talks looked doomed to failure at the end of last week, with Johnson stating that there was ""a strong possibility"" the two sides would fail to strike a trade deal. However, a weekend of intense diplomacy appears to have injected fresh momentum into the long-running process, increasing hopes a deal can be done this week.
At stake is around $1 trillion in annual trade at risk of facing tariffs and quotas if a deal cannot be reached before transition arrangements end on Dec. 31.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine late last week. The U.S. will see its first deliveries of the drug starting this week. 
There is also the possibility of additional fiscal stimulus in the U.S. with a bipartisan bill for a $908 billion Covid-19 relief package set to be introduced in Congress later in the day. 
On Sunday, German federal and state officials agree to put the country into a much tighter lockdown from Wednesday that will see the closure of non-essential stores as coronavirus cases surge during the winter period.
In corporate news, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock dropped 5.9% after the pharma giant said over the weekend it would buy U.S. drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) for $39 billion in its largest ever deal. 
Eurozone industrial production data for October are due Monday, and are expected to show a rebound of 2.0% on the month, from a drop of 0.4% the previous month. 
Oil prices pushed higher Monday, continuing recent gains amid confidence the start of the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer, will result in a rebound in demand next year.
Jitters surrounding an oil tanker exploding after being hit by an as-yet unidentified external source while discharging at Jeddah port in Saudi Arabia also resulted in prices rising.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $47.15 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.2% to $50.55. Both benchmarks have posted gains for six consecutive weeks, their longest stretch since June.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,830.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2144.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.9% after breaking a five-week winning streak to end 1% lower last week. 
Leaders from both sides decided to extend talks beyond a Sunday deadline in an attempt to secure a deal to govern around $1 trillion in trade, currently free from tariffs and quotas.
The pound, battered recently by the prospect of a chaotic British exit from the bloc, rose more than 1%, weighing on London's export-heavy firms that earn revenue in dollars. 

The FTSE 100 was flat as gains in most sectors were offset by a slide in AstraZeneca. The drugmaker said over the weekend, it would buy U.S. drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) for $39 billion in its largest ever deal.

In a letter sent to Italy's Industry Ministry on Friday, the Commission said the law was not notified to Brussels, making it potentially inapplicable, according to the la Repubblica report. 
The new rule could be ""incoherent with European treaties,"" the report said, citing the document. 
Last month, Italy approved stop-gap legislation allowing national communications regulator AGCOM to start a probe into Vivendi's Italian assets, to evaluate whether these holdings are harmful to media plurality. 
Vivendi, controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, holds a 29% stake in Italy's top commercial broadcaster Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), and is also top investor in former phone monopolist  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) with a 24% holding.
The new law could help Mediaset - controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi- in a long-running dispute with its second-largest shareholder Vivendi.

The two groups have been locked in a fight since 2016 when Vivendi ditched an accord to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit and built its 29% stake, which the Italian broadcaster considers hostile. Attempts to reach a compromise have been unsuccessful so far.

(Reuters) - This time of year, hundreds of thousands of seasonal retail workers across North America and Europe would usually be wrapping gifts, stirring hot chocolates, tidying Christmas displays or assisting the flurry of last-minute shoppers.
But the balance of available holiday jobs this year has radically shifted from storefront to warehouse and delivery amid record purchases online. And with millions of retail workers in the United States and Europe already laid-off, competition for what remaining jobs are left is fierce, economists say. 
The supply of available holiday jobs in U.S. customer-facing retail fell by a third to 302,100 this year from around 466,400 jobs last November, data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics gathered by consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed. 
Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) cut seasonal hires to 25,000 this year from 80,000 in 2019. JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ) Company Inc, narrowly rescued from bankruptcy in early November, is hiring just 1,700 people in contrast to 37,000 last year. For a graphic, click here 'Tis the season: Fewer retail jobs up for grabs. 
Meanwhile, applications for U.S. storefront retail positions have jumped by around 34% year-on-year, according to November data from jobs site Glassdoor. 
Kayla Frederick, 31, was laid off from her position as leasing assistant for a tour bus company in Florence, Alabama in April as venues closed and tours were cancelled because of the pandemic. In November, she started her first ever seasonal job in a local clothing boutique's warehouse, pulling online orders, folding inventory and tagging intake items. 
""I never expected to be laid off this long,"" Frederick said. ""I'm thankful this gave me a job.""
In Europe, data from jobs sites like Indeed, Adzuna, Student Jobs and CV Library paints a similar picture of lower vacancies and rising applications. The number of available seasonal jobs in the UK was down by a third year-on-year in November to 13,600, according to Adzuna data.
CV Library reported a 60% drop in the number of customer-facing retail jobs listed in the UK compared to last year – but clicks per job have doubled. In Germany and the UK, sales associates at jobs site Student Jobs reported increased contact from frustrated students not hearing back from companies inundated in applications. 
Data from Indeed in the UK showed a jump of around a third in clicks per posting on seasonal jobs this year compared to last, according to a report by Indeed's UK in-house economist Jack Kennedy. 
""Jobseekers may be looking at Christmas jobs as a potential temporary lifeline as job losses mount,"" Kennedy wrote. 
'NEW WORLD OF RETAIL' 
UK postal service  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) increased its seasonal hires to 33,000 this year from 20,000 in 2019, while FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) in the U.S. hired a quarter more seasonal workers, taking total hires to 70,000 from 55,000, labour statistics bureau data showed.
""This is likely a window into the new world of retail,"" Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, said. ""What was done out of necessity during a pandemic is likely to become an annual online shopping tradition for future holidays."" 
Glassdoor saw a 120% year-on-year increase in applications for e-commerce roles like delivery drivers, warehouse workers and order pickers in the United States and a 45% jump in the UK.
Oscar Jiminez, a twenty-two year old college senior in Southern California, is among the lucky ones. He landed seasonal employment in October in a gig he believed would have him working as a customer service agent on an ""essential"" retailers' sales floor. But he found himself in a warehouse at the back of the store instead. 
""This wasn't exactly in my job description."" Jiminez said. ""So far I've been picking orders, going around the store, finding things people purchased online and getting them ready for curbside pickup, ship-to-home... I'm constantly on the move."" 
Some supermarkets are also pushing up hiring. In the UK, British supermarket Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) posted 2,000 more seasonal vacancies than last year. It posted its seasonal vacancies on student jobs site E4S a month later than usual because of lockdown uncertainty, but still received over twice as many applications, according to website data. 
German supermarket giant Lidl took on 2,400 apprentices this year in Germany, 40% higher than last year's intake. Lidl and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) were already boosting their staff by a significant amount throughout the year to deal with the surge in demand, reducing the need for temporary seasonal hires, the companies said. 
Amazon hired just 100,000 seasonal staff this year in the United States, half last year's total of 200,000, because it had already boosted operational hires by 275,000 throughout the year, it said in September. 
Lidl took an opportunistic approach to finding candidates this season in Germany, where a partial lockdown is likely to be toughened in coming days. ""Bar work is so yesterday,"" read a November 30 recruitment ad. ""Look forward to a secure job for €12.50 an hour - switch industries and get into retail.""

Lidl pulled the ad within a day after backlash from the gastronomy sector on social media, it told Reuters, apologizing for the distress the message caused. It declined to say how many new positions it had on offer.

TOKYO (Reuters) - When Japan announced a state of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic this year, people were urged to declutter their homes to pass the time, with Tokyo's governor even roping in household-organising celebrity Marie Kondo in promotional videos.
Many have taken that message to heart and the market for second-hand luxury goods is booming as a result.
Mitsuko Iwama, a 71-year-old housewife, is a case in point. Pre-pandemic, she would have been spending a lot of time at the gym but after being stuck at home and cleaning her closets more often, she decided to part ways with kimonos that her parents bought her decades ago.
""I thought it was a waste to leave the kimonos just hanging up, and if someone from a younger generation would wear them, that would make me happy,"" said Iwama, who sold 22 kimonos for 4,000 yen ($38).
Buysell Technologies Co Ltd, the company used by Iwama which collects goods from people's homes and resells them through online stores and at old-style in-person auctions, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of pandemic-induced tidying.
Visits to people's homes surged 31% to 20,990 in October from a year ago, the company said, adding that three quarters of its customers are in their 50s or older, selling kimonos, luxury handbags and jewellery.
Similarly, Mercari Inc, which operates a popular flea market app, reported a 52% jump in sales for its July-September quarter compared with the same period a year earlier.
A surge in the value of gold this year as the pandemic spurred demand for safe-haven assets has also prompted people to sell rings and necklaces that had just been sitting around, adds BuySell Chief Executive Kyohei Iwata.
""There's a term in Japanese, ""danshari"", which means minimise your life. People's mindsets have changed that way,"" he said.

Across the Atlantic, the U.K. and the European Union will continue their post-Brexit trade deal talks as the initially set deadline of Sunday came and went.
Some investors were cautious in their expectations on whether a deal could be reached before the end of the year.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2020 07:26PM ET</span>",Flying fur prices put fox in focus as mink cull sparks shortage,"By Silvia Aloisi and Nikolaj Skydsgaard
MILAN/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's coronavirus-driven mink cull has put the fur business in a spin, with industry officials expecting fashion houses such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi to snap up fox and chinchilla to fill the gap. 
The global fur trade, worth more than $22 billion a year, is reeling from Denmark's decision to kill 17 million farmed mink after COVID-19 outbreaks at hundreds of farms led to the discovery of a new strain of coronavirus in the mammals. 
Worries of a sudden shortage of slinky mink pelts, of which Denmark was the top exporter, have lifted prices by as much as 30% in Asia, the International Fur Federation (IFF) says.
Now, all eyes are on Finland, where one million mink and 250,000 fox pelts will soon be up for grabs for buyers in Korea, China, the United States and elsewhere next week. Auction house Saga Furs plans to hold the international sale, the first since the Danish cull, via livestream from Dec. 15. 
A sales programme offers mink fur from both Europe and North America, such as ""Pearl Velvet"" and ""Silverblue Velvet"" mink, in addition to ""Silver Fox"", ""White Finnraccoon"" and Russian sable.
Saga Furs, which last year took over its North American rival NAFA, expects to sell all the pelts, compared with a 55% take-up so far in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus crisis.
""The market will strengthen, an increase in prices will help our business in general,"" Saga Furs CEO Magnus Ljung said of the industry, which has seen years of falling prices.
""We've already had more requests about foxes, if people see that there is a lack of mink, they could consider using something else,"" Ljung told Reuters.
LVMH's head of sustainability Helene Valade said this week that the French luxury group obtains fur from Finland. The owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi, which relies on brokers to bid, says it is using only 100% certified mink, fox and finnraccoon. 
Fur demand has been falling since the 1950s, except for a rise between 2000 and 2013 when it was popular on fashion runways and Chinese appetite for luxury pelts boomed, Lise Skov, an academic who researched the Danish fur industry, said.
A typical mink pelt sold for more than $90 at auction in 2013, while last year skins fetched around $30. This was despite a fall in global production to just under 60 million pelts last year, from more than 80 million in 2014.
Euromonitor predicts the value of fur and fur products, both real and faux, will fall by 2.6% this year.
IS FUR FINISHED?
A Danish breeder-owned cooperative that sold 25 million mink hides last year, or 40% of the global total, is considering selling its brand and other assets after announcing that it would gradually shut down operations over the next 2-3 years.
Kopenhagen Fur CEO Jesper Lauge Christensen told Reuters he had received expressions of interest from Chinese customers to take over the auction house's brand, which he said could be valued at up to 1 billion Danish crowns ($163 million).
It still plans to sell some 25 million pelts over the next two years, from Danish farms not infected by the virus, frozen stocks and foreign animals.
Animal activists hope the Danish debacle, which has had political repercussions in the country, will finish off the fur industry and demand for items such as $1,700 fur trinkets, $16,000 fur vests and $60,000 fur coats will disappear.
Countries and states which have already banned fur farms or fur products includes Britain, Austria, the Netherlands, France, Norway, Israel and California. 
PJ Smith, director of fashion policy at Humane Society International, says that brands still using real fur will ditch it soon, following Gucci, Prada (OTC:PRDSY), Armani and others. 
But for now, Kopenhagen Fur's Christensen said fashion brands in Europe had expressed concern they will not be able to find a similar quality to the Danish mink furs.
""One of the biggest challenges from the brand perspective is that the unique Danish qualities will be disappearing from the collection and you cannot source that product elsewhere.""
He said he was looking at selling warehouse facilities and equipment such as automated vision machinery to grade the skins.
China, followed by Russia, is the biggest buyer of Danish fur as its own mink are considered of lower quality than those raised in Europe, where breeding standards are generally higher.
""We wouldn't choose Chinese-made fur due to its poor quality,"" Zhang Changping, owner of China's Fangtai Fur, told Reuters, adding that it had already bought enough fur at least for the first half of 2021.
Fangtai would shift to auctions in Finland if Denmark failed to supply enough mink in the future, he said. 
Niccolò Ricci, chief executive of Italian luxury designer label Stefano Ricci which has many clients in Russia and eastern Europe, said he expected mink prices to increase by up to 50% but that high-end labels like his would continue to seek top quality pelts, mainly from U.S. suppliers. 
""The real shortage could come from 2022, but by then we are hoping mink farmers in Canada, Poland, America and Greece will increase production to replace Danish output,"" said IFF head Mark Oaten. Russia and China are also expected to hike output. 

""People will also be looking at other types of fur. Fox has been very popular for trimmings, in parkas for example. Wild fur is also becoming more popular, as is chinchilla,"" Oaten added.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S.-based investment group MSP Sports Capital is taking a significant minority stake in McLaren Racing in a deal the Formula One team said would give them the tools to return to the top of the sport.
The long-term investment, announced on Sunday, is for an initial 15% holding rising to a maximum 33% by the end of 2022. McLaren said it values the British racing outfit at 560 million pounds ($740.5 million).
Under the deal, MSP will put 185 million pounds into the former world champions, who last won a race in 2012 but are still historically the sport's second-most successful team, over a two-year period.
Luxury sportscar maker McLaren Automotive remains wholly owned by the McLaren Group, whose majority shareholder is Bahrain's Mumtalakat holding company, and is not part of the transaction.
The consortium members include The Najafi Companies, a private investment firm, and UBS O'Connor, a hedge fund subsidiary of Swiss investment banking firm UBS.
MSP is headquartered in New York and the principals have a background as owners and investors in Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association (NBA) among other ventures.
Jahm Najafi will become a vice-chairman of McLaren Racing, while Jeff Moorad of MSP and Rodrigo Trelles Zabala of UBS O'Connor will join the McLaren Racing board.
McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown said the investment marked the start of ""the next chapter"" and would allow the team to ""turbocharge"" their efforts.
Paul Walsh, executive chairman of the McLaren Group, told a video conference that the new cash flow would not impact the debt level of McLaren directly.
""We have got a number of activities in place where we will look to refinance some of our debt next year and attendant with that there could very well be some kind of equity raise,"" he said.
""What this (deal) does is mean that McLaren Group is not funding on a cash basis in Racing.""
MSP's arrival increases North American interest in a sport whose commercial rights are held by U.S.-based Liberty Media.
Moorad, a former NASCAR team owner, said MSP had looked into acquiring Force India when that team, now Racing Point and owned by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, went into administration in 2018.
They also considered former champions Williams (NYSE:WMB), whose sale to U.S.-based Dorilton Capital was announced in August.
Moorad said McLaren, who are switching to Mercedes engines next season with Australian Daniel Ricciardo joining from  Renault  (PA:RENA), was ""by far"" the first choice.
Najafi said Liberty's stewardship of the sport, with a budget cap being introduced next year and major changes in 2022 to level the playing field and put Formula One on a more sustainable footing, provided investor confidence.
""We believe that Liberty's business plan of creating more franchise-like values on the teams are going to flow in part from the cost cap,"" said Moorad.

""All of these pieces of a thoughtful business plan will ultimately create franchise values for each of the teams in the sport. That's our bet, to be frank. We're betting on the long-term future of Formula One."" ($1 = 0.7563 pounds)

101,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Vodafone towers spinoff Vantage eyes growth, open to bigger deals - CEO","By Douglas Busvine and Nadine Schimroszik
BERLIN (Reuters) - The telecoms infrastructure business spun out by Britain's Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) is ready to join the dealmaking fray in Europe but even with its existing asset base sees a decade of promising growth ahead, its CEO told Reuters.
Vantage Towers, which owns 68,000 masts across nine European countries, is eyeing a spring listing in Frankfurt that would arm CEO Vivek Badrinath with the firepower to pay for takeovers with its own shares.
In an interview, Badrinath said his primary focus would be to strengthen Vantage's position in its existing markets. But the former Orange executive suggested a tie-up with the leading French operator would also make sense.
Europe lagged the United States by 20 years in reshaping its industry to split infrastructure from mobile operators, with just 42% of its towers run by specialist companies compared to 90% in the United States.
""There is 10 years of growth ahead,"" Badrinath said. ""So it's a good time to build, structure, strengthen and invest.""
Vodafone, Europe's largest mobile player with 116 million customers, is the first big operator to float a towerco and hopes that Vantage could fetch a market valuation of more than 18 billion euros ($21.8 billion).
Because towers generate long-term revenue streams that are tied to inflation and expected to grow as new 5G networks expand, they are gaining favour as an asset class in a world of low investment returns.
They can also support high debt - Vantage targets a leverage ratio of four times and says it has 'headroom' of a further 1 billion euros to do deals.
Spain's Cellnex is already rolling up regional tower assets in deals backed by debt and equity issuance, recently buying 24,000 towers from Hong Kong's CK Hutchison for 10 billion euros.
FILL-IN ACQUISITIONS
Badrinath said his plan did not require mergers and acquisitions to work out, but added: ""If we want to do something bigger because it appears, that's something we would look at.""
He would be interested in fill-in acquisitions in the markets where Vantage is already either the number one or number two player.
Badrinath would also consider bigger deals to go 'off footprint' into new markets. He noted Orange CEO Stephane Richard's comments to the Financial Times https://on.ft.com/2IItNh4 that he would be open to towers cooperation, while adding no talks were taking place.
Relations with Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY)'s towers unit were also good in Germany, Vantage's largest market and where the company is headquartered.
Vantage is still working to fold CTIL, its UK joint venture with Telefonica (NYSE:TEF)'s O2, into the business, said Badrinath: “I am optimistic of getting it in the right time frame. But it’s not done until it’s done.""

(Reuters) - U.S. gaming platform Roblox Corp has put off its planned initial public offering (IPO) until next year as it works with advisers to improve the process to benefit employees and investors, the company told employees in a memo seen by Reuters.
""We've seen companies take innovative approaches to creating a more market-based relationship between investors and companies,"" Roblox Chief Executive David Baszucki said in the memo, dated Friday.
""We've decided to take this opportunity to work with our advisers to see how we can make such improvements.""
Baszucki said the company expects to list early next year. The San Mateo, California-based firm had filed to raise $1 billion through an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange and was expected to join a year-end IPO wave. 
A person familiar with the company said it hoped to get a higher IPO pricing after seeing Airbnb Inc and DoorDash Inc spike on their first day trading this week, which it sees as examples of companies underpricing IPO shares and leaving money on the table.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Affirm Holdings Inc is also postponing its IPO. 
The lending startup, which had been set to begin marketing its shares to investors this coming week for a December listing, will not go public until January at the earliest, the Journal reported, citing sources. Affirm declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
DoorDash raised $3.4 billion and its stock rose as much as 92% on the first day of trading, while Airbnb jumped as much as 142% in its $3.5 billion IPO. 
Earlier this year, Roblox had floated the idea of a direct listing - in which existing investors sell their shares and investment banks play less of a role - but in the end chose the IPO route, sources said.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors have concluded a probe into Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY)'s Vincent Bollore and Arnaud De Puyfontaine for alleged market manipulation and obstruction of regulators in a case involving stake building in Italian broadcaster Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), tax police said.
The probe involved allegations the two executives were involved in a deal to buy the pay TV unit of Mediaset to drive down its share price and raid its stock, the police said in a statement.
A lawyer representing the two men did not respond to an email request for comment. Vivendi denied any wrongdoing in a statement on Saturday.
In a probe closure document seen by Reuters, prosecutors allege the real aim of the pay-TV deal was ""to reach a relevant share holding, at least 24.99%, in the capital of Mediaset.""
They allege three Vivendi statements issued in 2016 were written to convince the market the deal had fallen through because of ""wrong representation by Mediaset of the economic-financial situation"" of the pay-TV unit.
They also allege the two executives failed to tell the market they had hired Italian bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) to study ways of building a stake in Mediaset.
A few months after Vivendi scrapped its bid for the pay-TV unit it bought a stake of almost 30% in Mediaset in an attempted takeover. 
Vivendi, the French media group which is Mediaset's No 2 investor behind the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, also owns a 24% stake in Italy’s largest phone carrier  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
According to the probe document the two executives considered involving Telecom Italia in a plan to build a media holding company with Vivendi and Mediaset as the main shareholders, without informing local market regulator Consob.
The latest development in the long-running case comes amid tension between the Paris-based media company and Italy over a law potentially curbing its interests in the country. 
Fininvest, the holding company that controls Mediaset, originally filed a complaint over Vivendi's stake-building at the end of 2016, accusing it of never intending to honour the pay-TV deal.
Prosecutors later placed the then Vivendi chairman Bollore and chief executive officer De Puyfontaine under investigation for alleged market manipulation over the French group's stake-building in Mediaset.
Prosecutors are now expected to ask a judge to send Bollore and De Puyfontaine to trial. 
Vivendi, which questioned the pay-TV unit’s profit forecasts when it ditched the deal, has previously said its aim was to forge an alliance to create a European media company. 
The U-turn on the pay-TV purchase by Vivendi, whose main investor is Bollore, prompted Mediaset and Fininvest to seek multi-billion euro damages. 
A legal case has been ongoing ever since, while attempts to clinch a wider settlement and break the stalemate have so far proved unsuccessful. 
In Italy, investigations do not imply guilt and does not necessarily mean charges will be laid.

Mediaset and Fininvest declined to comment. Mediobanca was not immediately available for a comment.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",AstraZeneca to buy Alexion for $39 billion to expand in immunology,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has agreed to buy U.S. drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) for $39 billion in its largest ever deal, diversifying away from its fast-growing cancer business in a bet on rare-disease and immunology drugs.
The deal comes in a week that AstraZeneca said it was conducting further research to confirm whether its COVID-19 vaccine could be 90% effective, potentially slowing its rollout, and as a rival shot from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) was launched in Britain and approved for use in the United States.
The British company said on Saturday that Alexion shareholders would receive $60 in cash and about $115 worth of equity per share - either in AstraZeneca's UK-traded ordinary shares or in dollar-denominated American Depositary Shares. 
Based on a reference average ADR price of $54.14, that implies a total price of $175 per share. Alexion shares closed at around $121 apiece on Friday.
""It is a tremendous opportunity for us to accelerate our development in immunology, getting into a new segment of disease, a new segment of physicians, and patients we haven’t been able to cover so far,"" AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told a media call. 
Alexion's best-selling drug is Soliris, used against a range of rare immune-disorders including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which causes anaemia and blood clots, and whose revenue rose 3.6% in the first nine months to $3 billion. 
AstraZeneca hopes that an improved version of Soliris called Ultomiris has an even larger market potential. It expects more growth from introducing the target's rare-disease treatments to China and other emerging markets.
The British firm said the boards of both companies had approved the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021.
AstraZeneca was once seen as leading the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, but has fallen behind Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, as well as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), whose shots have shown greater efficacy in late-stage clinical trials. 
With a planned capital increase of about $25 billion after the deal closure, Soriot is looking to harness a strong advance by AstraZeneca stock, driven by the stellar growth of new cancer drugs.
The shares have climbed about 70% through the past three years. A precursor cash call, on a much smaller scale, was a $3.5 billion issue last year to fund the purchase of rights to cancer drug Enhertu from Daiichi Sankyo.
RARE DISEASES 
Despite generating billions in cash from treatments such as Soliris, one of the most expensive drugs in the world costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, Alexion shares have struggled in recent years as investors have worried about competition heating up. 
That had led it to be seen as a possible bid target. 
Hedge fund and activist investor Elliott Management has urged Alexion to seek a buyer and in May spoke out publicly. 
The fund, which had held private meetings with the company, said CEO Ludwig Hantson’s go-it-alone approach had failed to gain traction and opposed its plan to buy rivals to diversify its research pipeline. 
Elliott first invested in Alexion in 2017 when the share price was only slightly lower than Friday's close of $120.98. Elliott did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
AstraZeneca said it expected the deal to immediately boost core earnings and to deliver pretax synergy gains of around $500 million per year. It also expects around $650 million in one-time cash costs during the three years following completion. 
Speaking on an analyst call, 61-year-old Soriot said the deal should put to rest speculation he was on his way out, as he was determined to stay on board to see the strategic benefits of the transaction delivered.
Soriot also told reporters the deal was the result of exclusive talks and no competitive bidder was involved. 
AstraZeneca finance chief Marc Dunoyer said a capital increase for the equity component of the transaction would take place on closure of the deal. 
On AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, Soriot said it wasn't yet clear if the company would need results from a U.S. clinical trial before filing for approval with U.S. regulators. 

Assuming positive results from that trial, the company should be able to submit the vaccine to U.S. regulators within the next six weeks, he added.

107,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 12, 2020 08:48AM ET</span>","DoorDash Debuted as a Star, But Will It Last?","By Peter Nurse and Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com --  Doordash Inc  (NYSE:DASH) shone on its market debut earlier this week, with its stock soaring 80% on its opening trading day.
Now, investors have to decide whether there's still a chance for gains.
DoorDash has benefited from the pandemic that has forced people to stay home, ordering food delivered instead of eating out in restaurants all the time. But it faces stiff competition by other companies that have more going on, including driving people round.
Investing.com's Peter Nurse argues the case in favor of DoorDash's prospects, while Christiana Sciaudone explains why it's a tough buy for investors.
The Bull Case
Even with these stunning gains there is value in owning the stock going forward.
It’s not surprising the food delivery startup’s stock has been in such demand - it has been one of the success stories of the Covid-19 era, with customers flocking to its app to get their favorite foods delivered as state restrictions forced restaurants to curtail indoor dining options.
Revenue surged to $879 million in the third quarter from $239 million the same time last year. It has also dramatically reduced losses and started making money on every order. More sharp growth is likely into 2021, as it will take time for the U.S. population to be fully vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus.
While the virus will eventually be defeated, the pandemic has likely fast forwarded a significant shift in consumer behavior. Millennials may find ordering food online as commonplace as booking an Airbnb or hailing an Uber, but the older generations have now had the opportunity to test the process out of necessity, and will likely have enjoyed the simplicity.
Another feature of the way the coronavirus has changed American society has been the likely long-lasting shift to favor seeking housing in lower-density suburbs, deemed to be much safer in terms of virus transmission. 
This plays into DoorDash’s hands. It has the lead in U.S. market share, with 49% of meal delivery sales in September compared with Uber’s 22% and GrubHub’s 20%, according to analytics firm Second Measure, but the dominance in the suburbs is even more evident, with 58% market share there. 
Consulting firm Frost and Sullivan estimated the global food delivery service industry generated $82 billion in gross revenue in 2018, and predicted that this number will more than double by 2025. 
DoorDash’s major presence is in the U.S., but it also has operations in Australia and Canada and is looking to expand elsewhere. The industry has seen plenty of consolidation of late, but more is likely and DoorDash is likely to have plenty to say in this regard.  
However, food delivery may not be the major reason in favor of owning DoorDash stock. The company is already considering the idea of moving beyond this to becoming an even more important player in the individual community.
DoorDash has already moved to turn uncertain cash flows into a subscription model, launching DashPass, a $10 monthly subscription that allows customers to get unlimited orders from participating restaurants.
And, “in the future, we envision this membership program becoming a wallet for the physical world, where a consumer can access not only restaurants, but all the local businesses in their community, and receive benefits while shopping in-store, at home or anywhere in between,” DoorDash said in the prospectus.
Uber entered the food delivery business by starting with ridesharing, DoorDash can do the reverse, potentially growing its available markets substantially.
The Bear Case
Do we really need yet another delivery service? 
Sure, demand's been pretty solid since we're all stuck at home. But that's bound to taper once we're permitted to step outside again (soon?) and we're sick and tired of sitting in the same kitchen/dining room/patio with the same people night after night after night.  
And it's not like things have been easy this year. Let's take  Grubhub Inc  (NYSE:GRUB) as an example. It has been a clear winner with Americans stuck at home. But shares have had a very bumpy year, and are up about 43% so far. That might seem nice until you compare it to the other pandemic winners, like Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU). They are up close to 500% and 200%, respectively.
And when might we expect a profit from DoorDash? Considering the competitive landscape -- Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER), Grubhub, Postmates, Zomato, Swiggy, Slice, ChowNow, and the list goes on -- it might be never. DoorDash offers a membership program called DashPass, where customers can pay a flat monthly delivery fee of $9.99 for unlimited deliveries from eligible merchants. How lucrative can that possibly be? Uber Eats charges the same for a similar service, but it also offers rides for humans and is located in dozens of countries from Taiwan to Chile. Compare that to DoorDash's whopping presence in the U.S., Canada and Australia. Beyond the membership programs, there's not much motivation to be loyal to one or another app.
The same may be true for merchants. The food business is a tough one to make a living off of, and restauranteurs are loath to allow a third-party to take a cut of the business. The fees that it charges can be 30% of the cost of an order, though some cities, including New York and Seattle, have set limits on the amount of fees delivery services can charge restaurants, Bloomberg reported.
Ok, so if you have a long list of rivals and you've yet to expand beyond English-speaking countries, how soon will you turn a profit? We'll let the company speak for itself:""We have incurred net losses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability in the future,"" DoorDash said in its prospectus. ""We incurred a net loss of $667 million and $149 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.""
Again, the company repeats, ""We expect our costs will increase over time and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business and operating as a public company."" It could be a while, folks. 
Growth rates are also likely to fall after rapid increases in recent years, with revenue growth in to the tune of more than 200%. ""Local food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive,"" the company said in its prospectus, and competitors may have advantages. Let's take, for example, Uber's purchase of Postmates and JustEat's acquisition of Grubhub, and the latter's deal with  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) to partner and offer loyalty-program members free delivery from Grubhub restaurants.
DoorDash also expects to expand into delivery of anything at all. We wonder if they'd heard of this place called Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Don't take it from us. New Constructs Chief Executive Officer David Trainer called DoorDash's move to go public, ""the most ridiculous IPO of 2020,"" according to a Dec. 7 Market Insider story.  
""We think this proposed public equity offering holds no value, $0, beyond bailing out private investors before unsuspecting public investors realize the business is not viable in its current form,"" Trainer said.    "

109,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 10:55PM ET</span>","With U.S. now in hand, BioNTech CEO looks for more vaccine production","By Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chief executive of Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said the biggest challenge facing it and partner  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) now that their COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for use in the United States will be to scale up manufacturing to meet huge demand.
""We need to solve the manufacturing challenge,"" Ugur Sahin told Reuters in an interview. ""It is very clear that more doses are needed. And we are dealing with that question - how to produce more doses.""
The companies have said they will produce up to 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine next year.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the vaccine for emergency use on Friday, after Britain became the first country to begin deploying the shot outside of clinical trials earlier in the week.
Sahin said he expects the companies will receive conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency by the end of the month and can begin rolling out vaccine in European countries early next year.
One way he hopes to boost supply would be by bringing on earlier than projected the 750 million-dose-a-year plant BioNTech bought from Novartis AG in Marburg, Germany. 
BioNTech had said it would begin making the vaccine there in the first half of 2021, and Sahin said they are working to get it up and running on an expedited timeline.
""The baseline plan is 1.3 billion doses,"" Sahin said. ""And we are working on an extended plan. I can't tell you at the moment what is possible and how much we can expand the scale but we will try to do it significantly.""
Supply of the vaccine will be limited at first in the United States, which has a population of roughly 330 million. The U.S. government has ordered 100 million doses of the two-dose vaccine and could negotiate for more. 
Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC the company had offered to sell the United States more doses as recently as last month but had been turned down.
In data released this week, Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine began conferring some protection to recipients even before they received the second shot. It seemed to begin to show some efficacy around 12 days after the first shot.
Sahin said he was surprised by the data: ""We know that the immune response is heavily boosted after the second dose.""
He said the companies have not decided yet whether to evaluate a single-dose version of the vaccine. 

""This will be a discussion that we will certainly have with our partners Pfizer,"" he said.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 09:56PM ET</span>",U.S. FDA authorizes Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use,"By Michael Erman
(Reuters) -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it authorized the use of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, with the first inoculations expected within days, marking a turning point in the United States where the pandemic has killed more than 292,000 people.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, which was shown to be 95% effective in preventing the disease in a late-stage trial. 
The FDA said the vaccine can be given to people aged 16 and older. Healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities are expected to be the main recipients of a first round of 2.9 million doses.
The U.S. government has said it will begin distributing the vaccine around the country immediately after FDA authorization, and that the first inoculations would happen early next week.
Millions of Americans could begin getting vaccinated this month, especially if a second vaccine from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc is quickly approved. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was first approved in Britain earlier this month, and UK residents began receiving the shots on Tuesday. Canada also authorized the vaccine and expects to start inoculations next week. 
Mexico and Bahrain have also approved the vaccine.
The FDA authorization comes at a time when infections, hospitalizations and deaths are soaring to record levels in the United States, which has failed to mount a coordinated effort to slow the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, the one-day COVID-19 death total topped 3,000, while hospital intensive care units across the country are nearing capacity, threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems.
Others with vaccines in advanced development include Moderna, which could win emergency U.S. authorization as soon as next week, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc with Oxford University, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
BioNTech began developing the vaccine in January, using a technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) that had yet to produce an approved product. The technology uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic part of the new coronavirus, which the immune system learns to recognize as an invader. BioNTech struck a development deal with Pfizer in March.
The vaccine comes with complex distribution challenges as it must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), requiring specialized ultra-cold freezers or supplies of dry ice.
Moderna's vaccine employs the same technology but does not need to be stored at sub-Arctic temperatures.
THE FIRST SHOTS
Pfizer has developed a special shipping container that will be filled with dry ice to keep the vaccine from spoiling. Many states are concerned about whether there is enough dry ice for shipments to rural areas that lack the specialized freezers, but Pfizer believes there should be sufficient supply.
The U.S. quest for a vaccine has been the central response to the pandemic from a Trump administration that has mostly otherwise left states to fend for themselves. It has said it will have enough to supply all of the 330 million U.S. residents who wish to be vaccinated by the middle of 2021.
The government has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough to inoculate 50 million people - through its Operation Warp Speed virus development program and could negotiate for more. The status of those talks are unclear.
Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC earlier this week that the company had offered to sell the United States more doses as recently as last month but had been turned down.
The United States has agreed to buy 200 million doses of Moderna's two-dose vaccine. The government also has supply deals with J&J and AstraZeneca, but authorization of those vaccines are not imminent.
Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said if distribution goes well and enough Americans agree to get vaccinated, relief for a pandemic weary nation may be on the horizon. 

""If we do it efficiently enough by the second quarter of 2021, and by the end of summer or end of third quarter, we may actually have enough herd immunity protecting our society,"" he said. ""And as we get to the end of 2021, we could approach very much some degree of normality that is close to where we were before.""

111,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 08:25PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Georgia Senate elections threaten pillar of market rally,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are looking ahead to dual U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia early next month, a potential threat to a year-end rally that has pushed stocks to record highs in the midst of a country-wide surge of coronavirus cases. 
Democratic wins in both Jan. 5 Senate races would change control of the legislative body and give President-elect Joe Biden's party full sway over Congress. The S&P 500 has gained 9% since the Nov 3 election, fueled in part by expectations of a split government that would prevent overhauls in areas such as taxes and regulation.
“From a market perspective, the one advantage to having a split government is the fact that you now have to stay down the middle in terms of policy and there really can’t be large policy changes from the track we have been on,” said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors.
The Georgia elections will come further into focus in the coming week, when investors will also be keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy statement, due Dec 16. Unprecedented Fed stimulus to support the coronavirus-hit economy helped drive the S&P 500's 60% rally since March, while progress on vaccines against the virus more recently boosted stocks. 
Georgia has not elected a Democratic senator in 20 years, but Biden's narrow victory there over President Donald Trump has given Democrats hope. The latest polling gives a slight edge to both Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, over their respective Republican opponents, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, according to data website 538.
A win by both Ossoff and Warnock would give each party 50 Senate seats, but Democrats would effectively gain control because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the deciding vote in any tie.
That outcome could raise chances for Biden's tax-reform proposals, seen as market negative by many investors, including a plan to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.
""Anything that undermines the confidence that it will be a status-quo tax regime would be considered a negative,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management.
The prospect for tougher regulation could hit the energy and financials sectors, two groups that have enjoyed rebounds over the past month, said Peron.
For example, full Democratic control could ease the way to a broad ban on fracking in the energy sector and to more stringent regulation around fees and capital requirements in the financial sector, Peron said.
Biden could also find an easier path to shaking up the healthcare system, leading to volatility in shares of health insurers heading into the Georgia vote, analysts said.
Others, however, have noted that a Georgia sweep would give the Democrats only a slim Senate margin, meaning any legislation would likely need support from more moderate party members.
“Fifty-fifty is still close enough to gridlock that you’re not going to get the worst elements of... Biden’s tax proposals,” said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. A potential Democratic win could also help Biden enact further fiscal stimulus, which has stalled for weeks in congressional negotiations. 

Investors appeared to price in a ""Blue Wave"" Democratic sweep ahead of the Nov 3. vote, including gains for alternative energy stocks and a steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve, only to then seize on the potential upside of a split government. At the same time, some investors believe that regardless of the Georgia result, markets will welcome political clarity and focus on expectations that breakthroughs in a COVID-19 vaccine will eventually lead to economic revival, justifying the current rally in stocks. “It feels like no matter what the outcome is, the mindset of the market right now is fairly bullish, and therefore any news will be spun positively,” said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)'s appeal in a securities fraud case that could redefine the ability of shareholders to pursue class actions against public companies whose stock prices fall.
Goldman is appealing an April decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan allowing a class action accusing the bank of hiding conflicts of interest when creating risky subprime securities before the 2008 financial crisis.
A decision is likely before the end of the court's current term in June.
The case stemmed from Goldman's sale of collateralized debt obligations including Abacus 2007 AC-1, which it assembled with help from hedge fund manager John Paulson.
In 2010, Goldman reached a $550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve charges it cheated Abacus investors by concealing Paulson's role, including how he made a $1 billion profit by betting the CDO would fail.
Shareholders led by three pension plans claimed that before the news came out, the bank had misled them and inflated its stock price with such statements that client interests ""always come first"" and that ""integrity and honesty"" mattered.
The 2nd Circuit presumed that shareholders relied on such statements when buying Goldman stock, and rejected the bank's argument that allowing lawsuits based on seemingly generic statements would unleash a flood of litigation.
Goldman described its appeal as ""the most important securities case"" before the Supreme Court in several years, and drew support for it from business and financial industry groups.

The bank also won support from the Society for Corporate Governance, which said a Goldman loss could prompt companies to clam up on social issues such as diversity and racial justice, ""out of fear that even generalized or aspirational statements"" could prompt securities fraud claims.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Apartment Investment and Management Co will be removed from the S&P 500 as of Dec. 21 to make room for the inclusion of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday.
Apartment Investment and Management, which is spinning off Apartment Income REIT in a deal expected to be completed post market close on Monday, will no longer be representative of the S&P Composite 1500 indices market cap ranges, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement.
The company has a market value of about $6 billion and its stock is down 21% this year. By contrast, Tesla's stock market value stands at around $600 billion, and its shares are up 600% year-to-date. 
""The subtraction of this relatively small REIT doesn't have a significant impact on the index at all, but the addition of Tesla does have a big impact,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
Adding Elon Musk's Tesla to Wall Street's most followed benchmark will force index funds to buy over $70 billion worth of its shares, while simultaneously selling shares of other S&P 500 constituents.
The electric car maker's stock has surged nearly 50% since Nov. 16, when it was announced Tesla would join the index.
""Definitely, traders have been accumulating the stock significantly in anticipation of the indexes having to buy on the first day of trading,"" Ghriskey said.
Tesla will account for just over 1% of the S&P 500.
California-based Tesla's meteoric rise has made it by far the most valuable auto company in the world, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).

Apartment Investment and Management Co's shares, which closed down 0.5% at $40.58 on Friday, slipped to $39.00 in extended trading. Tesla shares, which closed down 2.7% at $609.99, was little changed after the close.

Oracle is the latest tech firm to exit Silicon Valley after the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a broader shift to remote work, making companies reconsider California's higher operational costs and hefty taxes. 
Employees can pick their office location and choose whether to work from home part-time or full-time, Oracle said in a regulatory filing.
""We believe these moves best position Oracle for growth and provide our personnel with more flexibility about where and how they work,"" the 43-year-old company said. 
In 2018, Oracle set up a campus in Austin that could support a 10,000-strong workforce, in a bid to meet increasing demand for its cloud business. 
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), a spinoff of the decades-old corporation often mentioned in the accounts of the founding of Silicon Valley, said earlier this month it would move its headquarters from California to the Lone Star State.
Data analytics firm Palantir Technologies also shifted headquarters to Denver, Colorado from Palo Alto, California in August.
Earlier this week, electric car-maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Elon Musk said he had relocated to Texas from California, which has the highest personal income tax rate in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California asked to join the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit against Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Friday, making the state's attorney general the first Democrat to openly support the litigation.
The department in October accused the $1 trillion California-based company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals, and was joined by 11 other states when it was filed. 
""California is not making substantive changes to the complaint. In particular, California is not seeking to add any new facts or claims,"" Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in the filing, adding that it would not delay the case.
Google has denied wrongdoing, and the company has said that its search engine and other products are dominant because consumers prefer them.
""People use Google because they choose to, not because they're forced to, or because they can't find alternatives,"" a Google spokeswoman said. ""We’ll continue to make our case in court.""
The company must respond to California's request to join the lawsuit by Dec. 18, said the judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta.
The Justice Department welcomed California's entry to the case, which says Google broke antitrust law to build and maintain dominance in search and search advertising.
""This landmark antitrust case reflects broad and bipartisan concerns that Google ... has maintained its monopoly power by cutting off its competition,"" said spokesperson Brianna Herlihy. 
In November, Reuters reported a separate bipartisan group https://reut.rs/34lxt03 of states plan to file a related lawsuit. The group, made up of Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah, plans to combine its case with the federal government's case.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 05:25PM ET</span>",Analysis-Amateur traders' euphoria leaves red-hot U.S. IPOs with money on the table,"By Joshua Franklin and Krystal Hu
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wild stock gains on the first day of trading of Airbnb Inc and DoorDash Inc show how unprecedented demand this year from individual investors is making it difficult not to leave big money on the table, investment bankers say. 
In this year's biggest week for U.S. initial public offerings (IPOs), food delivery app DoorDash raised $3.4 billion, only to see its stock rise as much as 92% on the first day of trading. If it had priced the offering higher, it could have raised an additional $2 billion and still have a strong 20% first-day pop.
Shares of Airbnb rose as much as 142% on their first day of trading on Thursday after the home-sharing firm raised $3.5 billion in its IPO. It could have raised double that and also had a 20% pop. 
Leaving money on the table is nothing new for high-profile stock market debuts, yet the consistently large gap between the IPO and first-day trading prices is unique to 2020. It underscores the challenges of anticipating demand coming from an expanding pool of investors, such as millennials working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic and trading stocks on the Robinhood app, IPO bankers say.
""One thing that has emerged in last 12-18 months with the new issue market is the retail component, which seems to have an insatiable demand for some of these newly issued stocks,"" said Brad Miller, co-head of equity capital markets at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG), which underwrote DoorDash's IPO.
Fourteen of the 30 IPOs with the biggest first-day-close gains of the last 15 years were in 2020, according to Dealogic. Nineteen IPOs of companies in 2020 had shares whose value more than doubled in their first day of trading, the most since 2014, when there were six. 
Some of the drivers behind the surge in demand for newly issued shares are the same as those that have pushed the stock market to record highs this year: low interest rates, a gradual economic recovery and the prospects of a quick rollout of vaccines to beat the pandemic. 
But others are unique to IPOs and are challenging for bankers to price in advance. The rise of low-cost, easy-to-use trading apps has unleashed a flood of retail investor money into stocks. Retail investors have accounted for as much as 25% of the stock market's activity this year, up from 10% of the market in 2019, according to brokerage Citadel Securities.
Bankers and investors say the new demand exacerbates what is already a scramble for new listings. Underwriters reserve most of the new shares in red-hot IPOs for top institutional investors, cutting out mom-and-investors who can only buy in once the shares start trading. 
This build-up in demand, coupled with the relatively scarce supply of the new shares, has always helped drive a pop in the first day of trading. The influx of new retail money is now making this pop more profound and hard for companies and their bankers to foresee. While the underwriters have great visibility into IPO demand among Wall Street's elite circles, they cannot predict how many Robinhood users will buy the new shares. 
As a result, many newly listed companies, especially technology firms such as Snowflake Inc and C3Ai Inc, are trading at record-high valuation multiples this year.
""The animal spirit frenzy that happens as these companies are dropped into the stock market is smaller investors flocking to them like piranhas to fresh steak. That is why we are seeing valuation metrics get thrown out the window right now,"" said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors.
NO PUSHING BACK
There is no sign that companies that left money on the table are upset with their bankers. DoorDash CEO Tony Xu told Reuters in an interview this week the company priced its IPO as a ""true reflection of our fundamentals.""
When Airnbnb CEO Brian Chesky learned of the first-day trading reaction to the IPO on Thursday during a Bloomberg TV interview, his reaction was one of amazement rather than anger with his bankers. ""I'm very humbled by it,"" Chesky said.
Many companies seeking to raise money during a stock market debut feel they have no good alternative to using IPO underwriters. A route to the stock market that does not rely on underwriters, known as a direct listing, does not currently allow companies to raise money. And mergers with black-check acquisition firms, which enable companies to go public while raising money, can be very dilutive to their owners.
University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter said his analysis of IPOs of the last ten years showed that the most prolific underwriters -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) Inc - underpriced IPOs the most compared with where shares started trading. 
He attributes this to the big investment banks seeking to keep their major customers such as hedge funds, who are buying the new stocks, happy. He said many companies do not push back because the IPOs exceed their valuation expectations.
""When companies like Airbnb started the process, they didn't know what market conditions were going to be like months later, and they are happy that the deal is being completed, especially when the offer price gets raised,"" Ritter said.

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan declined to comment.

Investing.com – The Food and Drug Administration on Friday gave emergency authorization to the Pfizer-and-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine as the pandemic reaches a critical point in the United States.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) rose 0.2% in aftermarket hours and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) was up 0.1%.
The emergency use is authorized for those aged 16 and older.
“The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first COVID-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D., in a statement Friday night.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Friday told Dr. Hahn to approve the vaccine by Friday, or hand in his resignation, the Washington Post reported earlier in the day, citing unnamed sources.
Health and Human Services Chief Alex Azar earlier Friday said he expected the vaccine to be available in the U.S. by Monday. The authorization paves the way for the vaccine to be rolled out quickly.
Earlier on Friday, Trump had called on Hahn to get the vaccine out, and accused the FDA commissioner of “playing games.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed with modest declines on Friday, as uncertainty over fresh economic stimulus dented confidence, although strong gains from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) helped the Dow Industrials eke out a gain.
The U.S. Senate, facing a midnight deadline on Friday, unanimously approved a one-week extension of federal funding to avoid a government shutdown and to provide more time for separate negotiations on COVID-19 relief and an overarching spending bill.
Lawmakers have wrangled for months over a fresh fiscal stimulus package to support an economy battered by coronavirus lockdowns. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday suspended indoor dining in New York City, effective Monday.
""It’s like holiday shopping - you think you’ve got time and the next thing you know it’s the day before the holiday and you’ve got to hammer it out and get it done,"" said Tom Hainlin, global investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management's Ascent Private Wealth Group in Minneapolis.

While recent data has showed a faltering recovery in the labor market, a survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment improved more than expected in November, while a gauge of inflation rose moderately.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 47.11 points, or 0.16%, to close at 30,046.37, the S&P 500 lost 4.64 points, or 0.13%, to 3,663.46 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 27.94 points, or 0.23%, to 12,377.87.
For the week, the Dow lost 0.57%, the S&P 500 shed 0.96% and the Nasdaq lost 0.69%. The declines for the S&P and Nasdaq marked their biggest weekly declines since the end of October. 
Walt Disney Co shares were the biggest boost to the Dow and S&P 500, surging 13.59% after the media company announced a heavy slate of new shows for its streaming services and said it expects as many as 350 million global subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. 
With daily coronavirus death tolls at alarming levels, fresh business restrictions in many U.S. states and increasing layoffs, investors are counting on more fiscal relief to sustain a nascent economic recovery as most government aid has dried up.
Another 2,902 U.S. deaths were reported on Thursday, a day after a record 3,253 people died, a pace projected to continue for the next two to three months even with a rapid rollout of inoculations. 
However, conflicting headlines on progress toward a stimulus deal have kept investors cautious, even as optimism over a working vaccine pushed Wall Street's main indexes to record highs this week.

Investing.com – The Dow snapped a three-week winning streak despite eking a win Friday as investors continued to mull the prospect of a stimulus deal before year-end after the Senate passed a veto-proof one-week spending bill, buying more time to break the stalemate on Capitol Hill.   
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.09%, or 28 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.17%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.23%.
The Senate passed a one-week stopgap funding package Friday, to keep the government funded through Dec. 18, giving lawmakers more time to negotiate a full-year spending package and a stimulus relief program. 
The bill was passed by 84-13 votes in the Senate and by 335-78 votes in the House earlier this week - a large enough majority (over two-thirds) to overturn a possible veto from President DonaldTrump. 
Trump has threatened to veto the bill because it doesn't include a repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that shields social media companies from lawsuits over the content posted on their platforms. The president also opposes provisions included in the bill that curb his ability to redirect funds for his border wall and forces the removal of names of Confederate generals from military bases.  
Efforts to break the deadlock in stimulus talks have suffered a setback after Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled that Republicans would be unwilling to back some parts of the $908 billion bipartisan stimulus package, including the $160 billion support for local and state governments.
Still, there remains a sliver of hope as lawmakers bought more time to negotiate after the Senate passed a one-week government funding extension Friday.
The need for further stimulus to prop-up the U.S. economy has been exacerbated by a surge in the spread of Covid-19 that has forced parts of the country to impose fresh restrictions.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that indoor dining in New York City will close from Monday, marking a blow to restaurant operators in the city less than two months after they resumed activity.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",Investors weigh blocked China companies as Sino-U.S. chill deepens,"By Tom Westbrook, Andrew Galbraith and Ross Kerber
SINGAPORE/SHANGHAI/BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors face uncertain rules and could miss out on promising opportunities after index makers cut some blocked Chinese firms from their books, according to money managers and attorneys. 
The exclusions, a response to a ban on American investment in companies named on a Pentagon list, could weigh on prices for some stocks - though only for as long as it takes for foreign buyers to pick up the spoils.
Tariq Dennison, managing director at GFM Asset Management in Hong Kong, said the index exclusions were understandable but had created a headache for investors.
""It's been more than the average annoyance because some of those names are names we own,"" he said, referring to China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), which is on the Defense Department list and which he still considers a good investment.
The executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump, published last month, barred U.S. investors from buying securities of restricted firms starting in November 2021, based on their alleged ties to the Chinese military.
Most selling will probably come from passive managers who track major indexes and exchange-traded-funds, since FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices have said they will drop certain companies from their products.
S&P is also culling blocked firms' bonds from its credit indexes, and other index providers including MSCI and Nasdaq are expected to take similar steps.
But several investors said they are waiting for the U.S. Treasury to publish more details about the sanctions to fully assess the market impact.
""As the executive order sits there is no required forced selling per se,"" said Salman Niaz, a bond fund manager and head of Asian credit at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management in Singapore, ""When the detailed regulations come out we will know exactly what it means.""
Niaz points out that the risk premium on Chinese securities had not changed since the announcements. Chinese borrowers have more than $600 billion of bonds outstanding in offshore markets, he said, of which about 75% is rated investment grade and just $29 billion of that was from issuers on the list of blocked companies. ""This leaves a sufficiently deep investible opportunity set of bonds that global investors can participate in.""
Jamieson Greer, a former Trump administration trade official who is now a partner at law firm King & Spalding in Washington and represents investment firms, said one question is how the prohibitions will affect indirect holdings such as those in index funds. 
The White House order's deadline of next November gives investors time to wait for more guidance, he said, which may come from the incoming administration of U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden.
Because many of the concerns raised by the United States are bipartisan, Greer said, ""I don't think there is going to be a lot of political or popular pressure to roll this back quickly.""
A U.S. Treasury Department official did not immediately comment on the questions of how the rules would affect indirect holdings.
The Defense Department's list covers a range of companies that it says have ties to the Chinese military, including Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC),, oil giant China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) and telecom operator China Mobile Ltd.
Hikvision has repeatedly said that it considers its targeting by the executive order to be ""groundless.""
The restrictions have hurt some individual firms' valuations, with CNOOC's Hong Kong shares down by nearly a quarter since it was named in late November. Others have fared better: Hikvision's shares have risen more than 50% from lows following its blacklisting last October.
Chetan Seth, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at Nomura in Singapore, said the bigger risk is an escalation in the U.S. pushback against Chinese firms, noting that the impact of targets to date has been relatively minor.
    ""I think the bigger risk here is if the administration were to target some of the big boys. The obvious ones, like (Ali)Baba, Tencent,"" he said.
But in the event of a sudden rush of divestments by U.S. investors, global appetite for increasing exposure to fast-growing Chinese names is likely to provide price support despite the blockings.
""We suspect a lot of ... non-American investors would take that opportunity to accumulate because the fundamental story doesn't change,"" said Seth.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>","WHO expects decisions on Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca vaccines in weeks","GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization expects to make decisions on whether to give emergency use approval to COVID-19 vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) in the coming weeks, its chief scientist said on Friday.
Soumya Swaminathan said the global health body could decide on Pfizer's vaccine candidate in the next ""couple of weeks"", and later said it could also review Moderna's and AstraZeneca's candidates in a few weeks. 
WHO approval could allow a vaccine to be deployed in some countries where national medical regulators have not yet been able to evaluate it. Swaminathan said at least 10 companies had expressed an interest in or submitted a request for emergency approval for vaccine candidates.
Pfizer's vaccine has already received emergency approval in Britain and Canada, and could receive U.S. approval within days. The first British recipients were vaccinated this week.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said nearly a billion doses of vaccines had been secured for the COVAX programme to provide shots for poor- and middle-income countries, with 189 countries participating.
WHO officials described the arrival of vaccines as a major development, but stressed repeatedly that it would take a long time before vaccines could be rolled out worldwide.
In the meantime, the epidemic is worsening in much of the world, and countries must continue to take other steps to curb infection, such as testing, tracing, isolating cases and social distancing. Tedros noted that coronavirus deaths had increased 60% in the last six weeks.
Swaminathan said the supply of vaccines was likely to be limited for the first half of 2021.
WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan said: ""Vaccines represent a major, major light at the end of the tunnel, but we have much work to do to make that a reality.""

Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to Tedros, added: ""It is a long tunnel, to give it to you straight. It is a long tunnel.""

126,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>","Brazilian prosecutors sue Maersk, seek to freeze $200 million","By Gram Slattery and Sabrina Valle
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -Federal prosecutors in Brazil filed a civil lawsuit against Danish shipping company Maersk and former executives representing the firm for alleged corruption involving shipping contracts with state-run oil firm Petrobras, they said on Friday.
The lawsuit requests that a judge freeze almost 1 billion reais ($198 million) in assets in order to make sure funds are available to pay for damages resulting from the alleged scheme.
Prosecutors said there was evidence of bribe payments to Petrobras employees in exchange for privileged information that allowed Maersk to secure shipping contracts between 2006 and 2014. Former employees of Petrobras, formally Petroleo Brasileiro SA, were also included in the lawsuit. 
""We take these allegations very seriously and remain committed to cooperating with the authorities during the investigation as well as running our business in compliance with anti-corruption laws in all operating locations,"" Maersk said in an emailed statement. 
The company said the investigation is ongoing and that it will not comment further on the case.
Petrobras did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The civil lawsuit is the latest chapter in the epic Brazilian corruption investigation known as Car Wash. Initiated in 2014, the probe has implicated politicians and businesspersons in Latin America and beyond, who until recent years were thought untouchable.
Recent phases of the probe have taken aim at multinational companies based outside Brazil.
Last week, prosecutors took a similar action against oil trader Trafigura for allegedly bribing Petrobras employees in order to secure fuel shipments.
In August, Brazilian prosecutors pressed criminal charges against two individuals involved in the alleged Maersk bribery scheme.

In Brazil, prosecutors can press criminal charges only against individuals, and companies are subject only to administrative sanctions, which can include fines.

Investing.com --  Lululemon Athletica  Inc (NASDAQ:LULU) investors have some lofty expectations. 
Sales rose 22% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion (that's an awful lot of luon leggings), gross profit was up 24% and earnings per share of $1.10 beat the expected 86-cent estimate. What more can they possibly want?
A better outlook, apparently. On the earnings call, executives said total sales for the current quarter would increase in the mid- to high-teens, versus that swell 22% jump in the third quarter. It's even higher than what they previously had expected, and yet investors are unhappy. Shares fell 5.4% on Friday.
Productivity for the fourth quarter is expected at about 70% of last year's levels with trends in line with the third quarter during non-peak weeks, Lululemon executives said. 
That tends to happen when you have a valuation of about 57 times forward price to earnings. That compares to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 31 times and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s 31 times. Gap, which owns rival Athleta, has a valuation of 17 times.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Tiny activist investor's arguments against Exxon draw crowd to its side,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Jennifer Hiller
BOSTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), a giant of the energy world and once the world's most valuable company, is being pressured by a small investment company whose campaign for spending cuts and management change has been gathering more supporters.
Exxon has fended off past challenges seeking big change to its policies and leadership. But faltering returns - its shares are off 40% in the last five years and losses through September have reached $2.37 billion - could swing more holders behind the activist, say investors and analysts. 
Engine No. 1, a week-old, $250 million California-based firm, has called for expanded spending and pay cuts, a board shake-up and shift to cleaner fuels. Its views are supported by California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), the Church of England, and echoed in part by hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which has $50 billion under management.
""Management and board members regularly engage with our shareholders on a range of topics and value their constructive perspectives,"" but they do not share details of such conversations, Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said. 
The company supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, is working to reduce emissions and has been ""encouraged by feedback"" on recent plans to improve performance and returns, he added.
""This firm is not making a climate change argument but a financial argument, saying your performance is terrible,"" said sustainability expert Robert Eccles, a professor at Said Business School at Oxford University. ""The world is moving against Exxon, and I think the activists can win this."" 
For CalSTRS, the second-largest U.S. pension fund with $255 billion in assets, its support of Engine No. 1 mirrors an earlier union, when it backed hedge fund Jana Partners in a successful push for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to add parental controls to its phones.
Charles Penner, a former Jana partner who is spearheading the battle and has known CalSTRS for years, won its backing by arguing Exxon's spending and dismissive attitude toward climate issues cost it investor support, a person familiar with his thinking said. 
He also wanted to make a statement with the challenge to Exxon, considering it is the biggest and worst performer among its peers, the person said. 
""This is not about the size of your stake but about the value and credibility of your argument,"" said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer at CalSTRS. ""This is a company that needs change inside the boardroom."" 
While Exxon's board is diverse, having female and minority directors, it needs energy industry experts such as Engine No. 1's candidates, she said. 
The Church of England, which brought climate-related and management change proposals to Exxon holders in the past, lent its support to Engine No. 1's pitch on Thursday. 
New York state's $226 billion pension fund, which has joined Church of England shareholder proposals in the past, said this week it would start pulling money out of oil and gas companies whose business plans do not align with the Paris climate accord.
And D.E. Shaw sent its own letter with criticisms to Exxon.
""It's not surprising someone is pushing for change because it has been underperforming  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and peers for a long time. To the extent D.E. Shaw can accelerate this process, I would say it’s positive and should be helpful to shareholders,"" said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. 
D.E. Shaw declined to comment.
Engine No. 1 owns about $40 million in Exxon shares, a fraction of the $12 billion that Exxon's top investor Vanguard Group,oversees. To some, that miniscule holding might put it at a disadvantage in waging a proxy contest that can costs $20 million. Exxon is valued at $184 billion and its share price has climbed to $43.46 this week.
But some analysts believe the fund may have found its match in Exxon. 

""You can win proxy contests with very small stakes and the way you do it is by using your opponent's weight against him,"" said a person who advises companies against activists but could not be publicly identified.

132,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",U.S. SEC charges Sequential Brands with deceiving investors over goodwill,"By Jonathan Stempel and Susan Heavey
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday sued Sequential Brands Group Inc, accusing the brand management company of deceiving investors by failing to write down its goodwill fast enough after its stock price fell.
Shares of Sequential fell as much as 16.4% in Friday trading.
In a complaint alleging negligence-based fraud, the SEC said Sequential ignored internal calculations in late 2016 that showed a writedown was needed because its stock price was falling, including a 41% drop in that year's fourth quarter.
The SEC said this enabled the New York-based company to appear financially healthier to investors by overstating operating income, lowering expenses, and understating by at least $42 million its reported 2016 net loss.
Sequential did not fix the problem until February 2018, when it belatedly wrote down the $304.1 million of goodwill on its books, the SEC said.
The complaint filed in Manhattan federal court seeks civil fines.
Goodwill is an intangible asset normally associated with one company's purchase of another.
Sequential typically buys brands, which include Jessica Simpson and Joe's Jeans, and licenses them in exchange for fees.
By ignoring ""clear evidence"" of goodwill impairment, Sequential ""delayed alerting investors to its declining economic prospects,"" SEC associate enforcement director Melissa Hodgman said in a statement.
Mary Beth Maloney, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher representing Sequential, said the company would defend itself against the SEC's ""meritless"" lawsuit, and believed it had complied with goodwill accounting rules.
In morning trading, Sequential was down $1.40, or 7.7%, at $16.83, after earlier falling to $15.25.

The case is SEC v Sequential Brands Group Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern Distinct of New York, No. 20-10471.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Britain's Asda paid parent Walmart $1.52 billion dividend,"LONDON (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket being sold by Walmart (NYSE:WMT), paid its parent a 1.15 billion pound ($1.52 billion) dividend from surplus cash in March, Asda's annual report showed on Friday.
In October, the Issa brothers and private equity group TDR Capital agreed to buy a majority stake in Asda from Walmart in a deal giving the chain an enterprise value of $8.8 billion.
Asda, Britain's third largest grocer after market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury's, said in its report and accounts published on Friday that the dividend payment was made in respect to its 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years.
It said the payment, the first since 2017, was made after the completion of the 3.8 billion pound ""buy in"" of its pension scheme with Rothesay Life in October 2019.
Asda said its acquisition by the Issa brothers and TDR was on track to complete in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority is probing the deal.
Last year, Walmart's attempt to sell Asda to Sainsbury's for 7.3 billion pounds was thwarted by the regulator but analysts see few problems with the latest deal.
Asda's accounts show its operating profit fell to 584.2 million pounds in 2019 from 803.2 million pounds in 2018, on flat sales of 22.9 billion pounds.
Last month, Asda said like-for-like sales rose 2.7% in the third quarter of 2020.
Industry data has shown Asda's growth has lagged that of Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, partly reflecting Asda's lack of a local convenience store offer, a format that has proved popular with consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

134,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 10:43AM ET</span>","Disney Rides High on Streaming Outlook, Star Wars & Marvel","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) popped nearly 12%, to its highest price ever, after announcing a slew of new series and movies, including favorites Star Wars and Marvel.
Disney+, the company's streaming service, is outdoing itself, with almost 87 million subscribers. Disney said last year it expected the platform to reach between 60 million and 90 million subscriptions by that time, according to CNBC. Disney forecast that its streaming service will have between 230 million and 260 million subscribers by 2024. For comparison, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) had 195 million subscribers in the third quarter and HBO Max has 12.6 million.  
Disney will increase the cost of Disney+ by $1 to $7.99 in the U.S. and by 2 euros in the EU, to 8.99 euros. Even with millions of new subscribers and a hike in the pricing, Disney is unlikely to compensate for the losses of closing its theme parks during the pandemic. The company reported that its parks, experiences and products segment sank 61% in the most recent quarter. It was previously the biggest contributor to revenue. Media networks, in contrast, rose 11%, not nearly enough to make a dent in the damage done.  
Analysts from Guggenheim to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were also pleased by the announcements, and awarded the Mouse House with price target increases.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) gave Disney a Street-high price target of $200 on the material increase in long-term forecasts for the company’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) subscribers and revenue from higher price points for Disney+ going into effect in 2021, according to StreetInsider. The shares are currently trading around $173.74.
Goldman analyst Brett Feldman also cited plans to continue initially releasing key tent pole franchise films (Star Wars, Marvel, etc.) in theaters.
Earlier this month, Disney announced it would lay off 4,000 employees by the end of March 2021, in addition to the 28,000 employees who began receiving notices in October, The Guardian reported. Most of the job cuts come from limited attendance and continued closure of Disneyland.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>",Vaccine carrots or sticks? U.S. businesses grapple with getting employees inoculated,"By Erwin Seba and Jessica Resnick-Ault
HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. workers could soon face choices such as free COVID-19 shots and a cash bonus if all get immunized, or those unwilling to be vaccinated get reassigned or even lose their jobs. 
Those options are being studied by businesses hoping to bring at-home employees back without triggering a backlash or violating federal and state employment law. Companies are consulting with lawyers, health care experts and polling their workers to gauge when to offer carrots and when to use a stick. 
Workplace programs could come following U.S. approval of the first vaccine this week. But the array of choices reflects huge hurdles. A Pew Research poll shows 21% of Americans are firmly opposed, with 60% likely to get a shot. That split, and worries about side effects, have led to a wide variety of potential options.
""Some of my clients say 'if you get a vaccine, we'll give you a bonus,'"" said Rogge Dunn, who runs a Dallas law practice and is advising businesses on setting up programs to encourage workers to get inoculated.
Employees may not be easily swayed.
""All this rushing has me nervous,"" said a registered nurse in Georgia, who insisted no incentive would change her mind. She spoke on condition of anonymity and believes the fast pace of development raises the risk of neurological problems such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. 
Other workers say they will freely line up for shots once the rollout to health care workers proves successful. 
""I'm willing to take it, but not maybe immediately,"" said Sean Rollins (NYSE:ROL), a 37-year-old Massachusetts carpenter who wants to see if serious side effects emerge. Protecting his family is more important than any incentive, but free would be nice. 
""I want to get it as soon as possible. No incentive necessary,"" said Alissa Gabriel, 51, a San Diego, California, municipal worker, who believes the vaccines will help workers return to their office towers from remote work. 
Among big employers starting to formulate policies are oil giant  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), auto maker Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, retailer  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), restaurant chain Ford's Garage, the United Steelworkers union, and refiners' Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Citgo Petroleum. 
Their efforts are preliminary given FDA vaccine approvals remain outstanding.
Private employers could set up mandatory vaccinations so long as they offer accommodations to workers with religious and medical conditions that would exempt them, said Sarah Mitchell Montgomery, a partner at Jackson Walker LLP advising corporate clients. The direct threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic will allow mandatory programs to win approvals soon, she believes. 
""There may be situations where there is not a good accommodation,"" such as allowing those employees to continue to work from home, wear protective clothing or equipment on the job, she said. To protect workers from unvaccinated employees, companies also could argue they need to remove recalcitrant staff to protect others, she said. 
Marathon Petroleum, the largest U.S. oil refiner, ""is developing plans for its use of COVID vaccines,"" said spokesman Jamal Kheiry. Policies for its 60,000-person workforce are still being formulated, he said.
Target, which has more than 1,700 retail stores with in-house pharmacies, said it plans to use those health care outlets to offer authorized vaccines to store workers and shoppers as supplies become available.
Ford Motor ordered freezers to be able store vaccines and begin a voluntary immunization program when supplies allow. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles also are weighing internal programs. 
Vaccination programs, exemptions and access are being studied by union officials. The United Steelworkers union, which represents teachers, healthcare, mining, petrochemical and government workers, is looking to the CDC for recommendations. But it is concerned about workers being told to get vaccinated.
""Vaccination should be strongly encouraged,"" said Michael Wright, USW director of health, safety and environment, but not mandatory. Workers who develop side effects should receive free health care and be paid for time out of work, he said. 
""The questions we have are: what is the strategy if there are side effects, and who is responsible for that?"" said Wright. The federal National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program that evaluates injury claims is slow and uncertain, he said.
Restaurants, which have been hit hard by customers staying away, are gearing up to pay for the vaccines and encourage most staff to get them, said Steve Shlemon, chief executive of Ford's Garage, a 15-restaurant chain based in Tampa, Florida.

It will cover the cost for its 1,800 staff and has urged they and other hospitality industry employees be designated essential workers to speed access. The call mirrors that by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) for its drivers. 
""We plan to secure as much as we could and offer to employees at our expense,"" said Shlemon. The vaccine might convince at-home employees to return without fear of getting infected, and protect customers, he said.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Insurers jostle to give dealmakers cover for when things go wrong,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - A record rebound in merger activity this year and a rise in litigation has brought with it an upsurge in insurance policies that give companies and private equity firms cover for when a deal goes wrong, industry officials say.
Keen for revenue after a year marked by payouts for event cancellations and shuttered businesses, insurers are tapping into the appetite of deal-seeking firms to protect themselves should the businesses they want to buy misrepresent their accounts.
For the sellers, insurance can help to guarantee a clean exit from any deal.
M&A protection can also remove a company's need to set money aside for potential disputes and help them to avoid costly and lengthy litigation.
As a result, a spate of insurers has entered the market, with around 30 crowding in in Europe alone, broker Paragon said. Despite the rising level of claims, the entrants have pushed down premiums, but that could be temporary.
""In 2008, you could have probably sat the whole of the London M&A insurance community round a meeting room table,"" said Adrian Furlonge, partner at M&A insurance broker Helmsley Wynne Furlonge. ""Now there are more than 300 people in that market."" 
Mark Fellows, head of financial lines at  Aviva  (LON:AV), said the British insurer entered the sector in 2019, and M&A was becoming an established class of insurance. 
M&A insurance premium is likely to total $2 billion worldwide this year, James Swan, partner at broker McGill and Partners, said.
The most common M&A protection in Europe is warranty and indemnity (W&I) insurance, to cover the warranties and indemnities provided in a deal's sale and purchase agreement.
The buyer would take out insurance against any company information in those warranties - such as financial statements - being inaccurate. 
The seller, which in many cases may be a private equity firm, would buy insurance instead of holding money in an escrow account in the event of a dispute.
Brokers said the sector, while small, had seen growth that continued this year, although companies have yet to give full-year figures for 2020.
Lloyd's of London pointed to W&I insurance as one of the main contributors to increased premiums in 2019 and law firm CMS said 19% of the European M&A deals on which it advised last year used W&I insurance.
The expense is small compared with the cost in money and time when a deal goes wrong, a marked tendency as COVID-19 has led to claims of misleading valuations and broken business models.
Among high-profile deals leading to court battles, U.S. software giant Hewlett-Packard (HP (NYSE:HPQ)) is suing Autonomy founder Mike Lynch along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion, alleging they inflated the value of the British data firm before selling it in 2011.
SMALL BEGINNINGS
M&A insurance started with small deals involving private equity firms eager to avoid tying up money against future legal claims. 
It has evolved for larger deals - up to $10 billion is not unusual, brokers say - and listed companies are also using it. 
The London Stock Exchange bought insurance for the $27 billion purchase announced last year of data company Refinitiv, in possibly the largest deal using such cover, brokers said. 
LSE said at the time of the deal announcement that it bought insurance providing $1.2 billion in cover from a group of insurers. Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Reuters' parent  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI).
Swan at McGill said the broker was fielding enquiries about M&A insurance from executives setting up special purpose acquisition companies, blank-check deal-hunters that have become the darling of the U.S. stock market this year.
Broker BMS said demand was also growing for M&A insurance to cover potential tax bills arising from a deal.
M&A activity, meanwhile, has rebounded. 
The second quarter was barren for deals as the pandemic caused lockdowns around the world.
But the third quarter hit a record $1 trillion. And Furlonge said November had been the six-year-old broking firm's busiest yet.
CHANGING RATES
Companies generally insure around 10% of the transaction value of the deal. The premium is around 1% of the sum insured, with premiums having fallen 50% in the last two-to-three years, brokers said.
So for a $10 billion deal, policyholders might insure $1 billion at a cost of $10 million. 
Claims are also rising, deterring some market players and potentially paving the way for rate increases, industry sources said.
Nineteen percent of material claims made against AIG (NYSE:AIG) M&A policies in 2019 totalled more than $10 million, compared with 8% in 2017, the insurer said, with the increase partly down to greater use of the insurance for large deals.
Allianz (DE:ALVG) and Canopius, which operates in the Lloyd's of London market, are among a handful of insurers to have withdrawn from the sector, sources say.
Allianz was no longer backing an underwriter offering M&A insurance in North America, it said in an emailed statement, though it remained involved in Europe and Asia. All parts of its underwriting book had to meet ""optimal portfolio performance criteria"", the insurer said.
Canopius declined to comment.
More insurers may withdraw in January, the traditional season for policy renewal, because of rising claims exposure, brokers said, which could drive premium increases of 10% or more.
Joe O'Brien, co-managing director for Howden M&A, said a ""reasonable chunk"" of M&A provision could leave the market, potentially driving prices up. 

""That's where we see a bit of a correction coming,"" he said.

Investing.com --  U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Friday, on course for their first weekly loss in nearly a month, although the two blowout IPOs of the week were both holding on to the lion's share of their spectacular gains. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 130 points, or 0.4% at 29,870 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both down 0.5%.
Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock showed no sign of a hangover after doubling on its first day of trading. It rose 2.3% in early trading, while Doordash  (NYSE:DASH) stock, which gained 86% on its debut, weakened slightly with a loss of 3.8%. AirBnB CEO Brian Chesky had struggled to justify the stock's performance on its first day in an interview with Bloomberg late on Thursday. That performance gave the company a valuation of over $100 billion, even though it has only $4 billion in sales and is not currently profitable. The valuation is three times what it was before the pandemic, which forced AirBnB and many other travel-related companies into rethinking their business models. 
Doordash likewise received a stellar valuation given that not only is the food delivery company unprofitable itself, but also operates in a sector where barely any company has turned a profit. 
The extraordinary valuations of some stocks are now starting to make the broader market look stretched, some analysts argue. Jeroen Blokland, head of multi-asset strategy at Robeco, pointed out via Twitter earlier on Friday that the addition of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock to the S&P 500 increases the whole index's trailing price-earnings ratio to 44 from an already high 27, the forward P/E ratio to 24.3 from 22.1. Tesla stock fell 2.1% in early trading but was still close to the all-time high it hit earlier in the week.
The market was depressed by further signs of the talks on a fiscal stimulus package in the U.S. stalling, as Senate Leader Mitch McConnell repeated his insistence that House Democrats drop their demand for aid to local and state governments. McConnell was reported by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday to have blocked the bipartisan push to agree a $908 billion package of measures over the issue of liability protection for businesses, schools and other entities. 
Elsewhere, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock fell 4.7% on the back of reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), a major customer, is looking at developing its own cellular modems. 
Ferrari  (NYSE:RACE)stock, by contrast, withstood the news of its CEO stepping down for personal reason. The maker of luxury sports cars and F1 racing team owner lost only 0.1%."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group and its chairman have agreed to buy a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics from SoftBank Group Corp in a deal that values the U.S.-based robot maker at $1.1 billion.
The South Korean automaker group said on Friday the purchase would help it expand automation in its vehicle factories and design autonomous cars, drones and robots, as it seeks to turn itself from a manufacturer into a broader mobility service provider.
Hyundai Motor Group said the deal, which involves a new share issue, would give the company and its chief a combined 80% stake in Boston Dynamics, while Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) will retain 20%. 
Newly promoted Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Euisun Chung has pledged to reduce reliance on traditional car manufacturing. He has said robotics would account for 20% of the firm's future business, while car-making would account for 50% and urban air transport would make up the remaining 30%.
Chung will own a 20% stake in Boston Dynamics, while Hyundai Motor and its affiliates Hyundai Mobis and Hyundai Glovis will hold a combined 60% stake. 
Softbank Group Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said the partnership with Hyundai Motor Group would accelerate the robot maker's path to commercialisation. 
Boston Dynamics, which was spun out from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992, was bought by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in 2013 and sold to SoftBank in 2017.
The company's products include Spot, a dog-like robot that can climb stairs. The firm has gained media attention although the company has struggled to build a commercial business. 
Boston Dynamics reported a net loss of $103 million for the fiscal year ending in March 2020, widening its losses by more than 60% from a year earlier. 
The transaction, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close by June 2021. 
'INNOVATION RACE' 
Boston Dynamics' clients include Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which leased two Spot robots in July as part of a pilot programme. 
Last year, Ford Motor also said it was partnering with walking robot maker Agility Robotics as it designs a planned fleet of self-driving delivery vans that will drop packages at the doorsteps of people’s homes. 
The Boston Dynamics deal is the latest pullback by SoftBank from operating businesses as Son focuses on investing.
It marks the fading in SoftBank's robotics ambitions, which were talked up by Son. It leaves the group's own rump robotics business, which includes humanoid robot Pepper, looking increasingly isolated. 
For Hyundai Motor Group, this is the latest in a flurry of deals under Chung, who pledged to transform the automaker into a mobility provider, amid threats from electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and tech firms with ride-sharing, self-driving and other technologies. 
""Automakers are in an innovation race. Hyundai is a late-comer to the race, and it seems that they want to showcase that they can do it, rather than trying to generate money from the robot business,"" said mobility consultant Cha Doo-won.
Hyundai Motor Group has developed a wearable robot to reduce fatigue for factory workers and ran pilot programmes at its U.S. plants. 
In January, Hyundai Motor Group announced it had partnered with Uber (NYSE:UBER) to develop electric air taxis, but the U.S. firm said this week it would sell its loss-making flying taxi unit to Joby Aviation, an electric passenger aircraft developer.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares slipped and sterling skidded to its lowest in nearly a month on Friday as markets confronted the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a trade deal, with doubts over U.S. stimulus also nagging. 
Europe's broad Euro STOXX 600 shed 1.3%, with indexes in Paris and London slumping as much as 2.1% and 1.1% respectively. 
Banks were among the worst hit, sliding 2.6% to their lowest in nearly three weeks, with Spain's lender-heavy main index down 2.3%. 
Britain is now more likely to leave the European Union's orbit on Dec. 31 without a trade deal than with an agreement, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyden reportedly told the bloc's 27 national leaders on Friday.
The gloomy outlook echoed that of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who had said on Thursday there was ""a strong possibility"" Britain and the EU would fail to strike a trade deal.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, turned negative and was last down 0.2%.
Britain and the EU have set a deadline of Sunday to find an agreement, before Britain exits the bloc's customs union and single market on Jan. 1. The odds of a disorderly Brexit rose to 61% on Friday from 53% a day before, according to the Smarkets exchange.
Sterling fell 0.9% against the dollar, touching its lowest point since Nov. 16 and putting it on course to ending five straight weeks of gains. Volatility also rose to its highest in over eight months.
""Investors are right to be worried,"" said Olivier Marciot, a portfolio manager at Unigestion. ""If there is no deal, there will be implications. There could be some sort of correction.""
A no-deal Brexit would damage the economies of northern Europe, send shock waves through financial markets, block up borders and wreak chaos through the delicate supply chains which stretch across Europe and beyond.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Electric Last Mile Solutions (ELMS) said on Friday it has agreed to go public through a reverse merger with blank-check company Forum Merger III Corp in a deal that values the U.S. electric commercial vehicle maker at $1.4 billion.
The deal will provide ELMS with $379 million in gross proceeds, including $155 million from such private investors as BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management and Jennison Associates. It is expected to close in the first quarter and the company will trade on Nasdaq under the symbol ""ELMS.""
ELMS, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, plans to launch a small Class 1 delivery van - the UD-1 - in the third quarter of 2021, followed by a larger Class 3 truck in late 2022.
Both vehicles will be assembled at the former Hummer plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, that ELMS intends to acquire from China's Chongqing Sokon Industry Group Stock Co Ltd when the deal closes, ELMS Chief Executive James Taylor said.
A blank-check or special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is a shell company that raises money through an initial public offering to buy an operating entity, typically within two years. SPACs have emerged as a quick route to the stock market for companies, particularly auto technology firms, and have proven popular with investors seeking to recreate Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's high stock valuation. 
ELMS' vehicles will be based on Sokon's commercial van made in China through a joint venture with Dongfeng Automobile Co Ltd, speeding development time, said Taylor, a former General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) executive.
The battery for the vehicle will be supplied by Chinese battery company CATL, he said. 
The UD-1 has a starting price of $32,500 before the $7,500 federal tax credit and a driving range of 150 miles. It will include such features as over-the-air updates.
""The demand for cost effective solutions to support the e-commerce ecosystem is overwhelming,"" Taylor said. ""This industry promises rewards to first movers."" 
The Indiana plant has capacity to assemble 100,000 vehicles annually. ELMS plans to build 4,100 UD-1 vans at the end of next year, more than double output to 9,100 vehicles in 2022 when the second vehicle is added, and grow to 83,000 for both in 2025, he said.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's witness cross examination has been extended into next week, as the court proceedings on Thursday were disrupted for over an hour after a border official admitted to giving ""incomplete"" testimony.
Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) official Nicole Goodman is expected to face more grilling on Friday after prosecutors said Goodman had reached out to a Canadian Department of Justice employee to ask about a privilege issue, which violated an order not to discuss testimony outside of court.
The Canadian prosecutors on the case also said that two additional witnesses are expected to testify next week as part of Meng's ongoing U.S. extradition hearing.
The 48-year old daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei was arrested on a U.S. warrant two years ago at Vancouver International Airport. 
She faces charges of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Meng has denied the charges and is fighting the extradition from Vancouver, where she is under house arrest.
Her lawyers have argued that U.S. and Canadian authorities coordinated ahead of her arrest, using the extended investigative powers of the CBSA to interrogate her without a lawyer present.
Prosecutors say the investigation and arrest followed standard procedures and the extradition should move forward.
On Thursday, Goodman was questioned by defense lawyer on whether she gave inaccurate or misleading testimony the previous day. She replied that her testimony was ""incomplete,"" but she didn't know if it was misleading. 
The witness testimony continues amid reports last week that U.S. prosecutors are discussing a deal with lawyers for Meng to resolve criminal charges against her, signaling a potential end to a case that has strained ties between the United States, China and Canada.
China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges soon after Meng's arrest.

Meng’s extradition hearing is expected to wrap up in April 2021.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",United Airlines flight attendants raise alarm on crew quarantine protocols,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines is telling some flight attendants whose colleagues test positive for COVID-19 to keep flying and monitor for symptoms, three employees told Reuters, raising concerns among staff about the policy. 
""Most of us feel that's unsafe,"" said one of the employees. Reuters also viewed around a dozen comments in a private online group for United flight attendants, which expressed unease and frustration about loose quarantine and contract tracing protocols by the airline. 
United's major rival American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), by contrast, removes all crew from service when they have worked with an infected person, a policy decision American flight attendants and the union representing them affirmed.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued COVID-19 policy recommendations but there are no government mandates on the topic. That has created inconsistent safety protocols across the industry, from how an airplane is boarded and blocking middle seats to inflight service and crew quarantines, unions said. 
The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA), which represents crew at 17 airlines including United, said that it has received complaints from members about United not isolating all crew who have worked with an infected colleague.
""We've received concerns about quarantine protocols from flight attendants across the industry from carriers we represent and where we're organizing,"" said AFA spokeswoman Taylor Garland, who added some complaints were from flight attendants at Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). 
Asked about its policy and flight attendants' concerns, United did not dispute that it tells some to self-monitor and continue working after a colleague tests positive for COVID-19, saying it follows Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance on quarantines for ""close contacts."" 
The CDC defines close contact as being within 6 feet (1.83 m) of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over 24 hours starting from two days before the onset of illness until isolation. 
""If a flight attendant or pilot meets the criteria, we ask them to quarantine. If not, they are instructed to self-monitor,"" United spokeswoman Leslie Scott said. She declined to explain how it determines a close contact.
Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said: ""As we have throughout this pandemic, we follow guidelines from the CDC and other health authorities to ensure that all Delta people quarantine if they have prolonged, close contact with a Covid-19 positive individual.""
United and Delta both said the safety and health of their customers and employees is their top priority and noted measures to combat the spread of COVID-19, including requiring masks and deeper cleaning. 
Airlines say studies show that airplanes are ""uniquely safe"" thanks to hospital-grade air filtration systems, assuming people wear masks, and that flight crews have not contracted COVID-19 at higher rates than the rest of the U.S. population.
But as cases spike across the country, they are increasing among airline workers too.
AFA said it saw an average of 50 positive COVID-19 tests a week in November among roughly 25,000 active crew, up from about 10 weekly in the summer.
For an interactive graphic tracking the global spread of COVID-19, open https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/ in an external browser.
POTENTIAL EXPOSURE
The seeming discrepancy in quarantine protocols comes amid strained staffing after mass furloughs and as some airlines resume food and beverage service. 
Flight attendants said they work closely even if they are assigned to different galleys and share several legs of a domestic shift and layovers. 
Asked for details on its quarantine criteria, United said it follows the FAA's bulletin, the Safety Alert for Operators.
The Nov. 4 bulletin on quarantines says the FAA and CDC recommend that crew members with known exposure to COVID-19 not work until 14 days after the last potential exposure. 
It also cites CDC guidance that even if crew members show no symptoms, they should not be allowed to work since they cannot remove themselves if they develop symptoms.
It notes ""the challenges involved in effectively isolating a symptomatic person on board an aircraft.""
Last week the CDC shortened the quarantine to seven days with a negative test and 10 without a test.
United's Scott said the airline was following the new guidance on the number of days close contacts should quarantine while the FAA works on updating the bulletin.
The union, however, has asked the FAA to maintain or strengthen the recommendation that any flight attendant potentially exposed to the virus quarantine for 14 days. 
""With the pandemic worsening as winter approaches, it is unacceptable to backtrack on existing quarantine practices that are critical for limiting infections,"" AFA's director of air safety, Christopher Witkowski, said in a Dec. 5 letter seen by Reuters.
RISING STRAIN
Flight attendants are also worried about decisions by airlines including United to resume food and beverage service, which they say encourages people to remove masks.
Hot drinks are of particular concern because of blowing.
AFA has asked airlines to minimize onboard service and only serve cold food and drinks on shorter flights.
United encourages passengers to ""keep it brief and replace their mask"" when they are not eating or drinking, United's Scott said, and noted that United runs its air filtration systems from boarding to deplaning.
Between voluntary and involuntary departures, Chicago-based United has 60% fewer flight attendants than before the pandemic. 
Staffing strains were evident last month when United's senior vice president of inflight services, John Slater, mentioned an ""excessive"" number of late sick calls by flight attendants in a memo to staff seen by Reuters. Slater said the late sick calls caused hundreds of missed connections.

The president of AFA's United chapter, Ken Diaz, hit back, saying: ""The headache or aches and pains that we once came to work with are today indicators of a COVID-19 infection. And, try as we might to control when these symptoms appear, we're simply not able to do so.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, as lawmakers continue to prevaricate over a new coronavirus relief package while the economic outlook weakens.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract fell 223 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 30 points, or 0.8%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 95 points, or 0.8%. 
These cash indices are on course for a losing week, which would be the first in three for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, and the first in four for the NASDAQ Composite.
An agreement of a new coronavirus stimulus package remains frustratingly far away, after Republican Senate leaders Thursday rejected a $908 billion aid package, proposed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers.
Despite the recent attempts to try to reach a deal, lawmakers still have not resolved disagreements over aid to state and local governments, as the surge in Covid-19 cases continues to harm the economy.
Weekly jobless claims jumped to 853,000 on Thursday, the most since the middle of September. This follows nonfarm payrolls growing by only 245,000 last Friday, a sharp slowdown from the 610,000 jobs created the month before.
On the plus side, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is likely to authorize Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use in the U.S. in the very near future, after a panel of experts gave their approval late Thursday.
The rollout of this vaccine will be much needed as U.S. cases reach record levels, with the number of Covid deaths over 3,000 on Thursday for the second day in a row, and states announcing more restrictions.
In the corporate sector, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) will be in focus after the home-sharing site’s stock more than doubled in its first day of trading on Thursday, continuing the hot streak of IPOs after Doordash's (NYSE:DASH) debut on Wednesday.
Turning to the economic data slate, the November producer price index is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), while the University of Michigan's preliminary read of consumer sentiment for December is due two hours later. 
Oil prices edged lower Friday, consolidating after the sharp rally of the previous session, on continued enthusiasm that the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine will result in a rebound in demand next year.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $46.66 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $50.02, after climbing above $50 for the first time since March. Both benchmarks are on course to post their sixth consecutive week of gains. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,836.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2115.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>","Sanofi and GSK delay COVID-19 vaccine, marking setback for global fight","By Matthias Blamont
PARIS (Reuters) -  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) said clinical trials of their COVID-19 vaccine showed an insufficient immune response in older people, delaying its launch to late next year and marking a setback in the global fight against the pandemic.
The announcement on Friday, which highlighted the challenges of developing shots at record speed, hinders efforts to develop the multiple options that experts say the world needs to counter a disease that has killed over 1.5 million people.
The news, which came on the same day as Australia axed a domestic vaccine project, is also a blow for many governments that have booked hundreds of millions of doses of the shot, including the European Union, United States and Britain. 
Shares in France's Sanofi were down 2.8% at 0910 GMT while Britain's GSK was up 0.2%.
The two companies said they planned to start another study next February, hoping to come up with a more effective vaccine by the end of 2021.
The setback affects one of the most established technologies in vaccines - used against the human papillomavirus, hepatitis B and pertussis among other pathogens - which aims to introduce lab-made proteins into the body to prod the immune system into developing a targeted defence against the novel coronavirus.
It cements the lead of more novel approaches used by vaccines from the likes of Pfizer-BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which use mRNA genetic technology to trick the body into producing those proteins. Both of those shots were found to be about 95% effective in successful large-scale trials.
Delays and additional trials are not unusual but the Sanofi/GSK announcement highlights the unique set of challenges facing drugmakers in multitasking science, speed and logistics during a pandemic that has crushed global economies.
It also underscores why governments have spread their bets by securing shots from different developers. 
Australia, meanwhile, cancelled the production of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by the University of Queensland and using an adjuvant made by biotech firm CSL (OTC:CSLLY) after trials showed it could interfere with HIV diagnosis.
""Science cannot be all about producing positive results; negative results will and must occur,"" said Diego Silva, an expert at the University of Sydney School of Public Health.
""Negative results are also as important as success in science, since they, too, form part of the evidence base for future research."" 
DELAYED TO LATE 2021
Sanofi said Friday's results from Phase I/II trials showed ""an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low immune response in older adults likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen"".
""With this type of vaccine, the result is not a surprise, we know that more antigen is needed in older patients. But when in Phase I and II, drugmakers test tolerance and one cannot test strong dosages,"" said Jean-Daniel Lelievre, head of clinic immunology and infectious diseases at Henri-Mondor hospital in Creteil, France.
""I would think Sanofi and GSK will be able to improve their vaccine.""
Phase III studies were expected to start this month. However Sanofi said it would instead launch a phase 2b study in February.
""The study will include a proposed comparison with an authorized COVID-19 vaccine,"" the company said, declining to give further details on this.
""If data are positive, a global Phase III study could start in Q2 2021. Positive results from this study would lead to regulatory submissions in the second half of 2021, hence delaying the vaccine's potential availability from mid-2021 to Q4 2021.""
The two companies said they had ""updated governments and the European Commission where a contractual commitment to purchase the vaccine has been made"".
BRITAIN JUMPS AHEAD
The vaccine uses the same recombinant protein-based technology as one of Sanofi's seasonal influenza vaccines. It will be coupled with an adjuvant, a substance that acts as a booster to the vaccine, made by GSK.
Sanofi and GSK have scaled up manufacturing in order to be ready to produce up to one billion doses of their vaccine in 2021. GSK said a goal to produce 1 billion doses of adjuvants - with some expected to be delivered to other partners - in 2021 remained in place but was under review.
The Phase I/II study tested the safety, tolerability and immune response of the vaccine in 440 healthy adults across 11 investigational sites in the United States..
This week, Britain started deploying the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, jumping ahead of the rest of the world in the race. 
Canada has also given the green light for the shot, while a panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday voted to endorse emergency-use authorization. 
Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and Oxford University have also reported late-stage data for their COVID-19 shot, which showed it has an average success rate of about 70%.

Sanofi is working on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate with U.S. company Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO) which uses mRNA technology. Phase I trials are expected to start this month.

The median pay gap for Black staff was 19.7% this year, while the gap for all Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) employees was 14.8%.
Lloyds said the ethnicity pay gaps at the company reflected a lack of BAME staff employed at a senior level and not employees of different ethnicities receiving different pay for the same role. 
Companies globally have grappled with concerns over racial inequality this year in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, including issues such as pay and representation particularly at senior levels.
Reporting on ethnicity pay gaps by companies is voluntary in the UK - unlike for gender pay gaps - and still relatively rare, although more businesses have committed to disclosing figures or have done so, such as energy giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa).
In July Lloyds set a target to increase the number of Black staff in senior roles to at least 3% from 0.6% by 2025 - in addition to an existing BAME target of 8% of senior staff by the end of this year - as part of a wider 'Race Action Plan'.
The bank said it had also launched a Black Business Advisory Committee, led by former Cabinet Office adviser Claudine Reid, which would investigate barriers to growth for Black-led businesses. 
Lloyds CEO António Horta-Osório said: ""We want to be clear that we are an anti-racist organisation – one where all colleagues speak up, challenge, and act to take an active stance against racism. 
""In doing so, our colleagues will help break down the barriers preventing people from meeting their full potential.""

The funding round, which aims to raise $2 billion and would make it the world's most valuable financing round in the private market, is drawing to a close after kicking off about a month ago, the two people said.
The sources declined to be identified as talks were not public. A Sequoia spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. KKR didn't immediately respond. ByteDance declined to comment.
The Chinese company has seen its valuation more than double in the past two years.
ByteDance's last round of financing dates back to 2018, which valued it at $78 billion after that round. Earlier this year, ByteDance was valued at as much as $140 billion in the secondary private equity market.
The jump in valuation comes despite a U.S. order, citing national security grounds, that ByteDance must divest TikTok’s U.S. assets.
In its home market, however, it is on track to rake in at least 180 billion yuan ($27.2 billion) in advertising revenue this year, Reuters has reported.

LONDON (Reuters) - A 14 billion pound ($18.5 billion) class action against Mastercard (NYSE:MA) for allegedly overcharging more than 46 million people in Britain over a 15-year period was on Friday given the green light by the UK Supreme Court.
The judgment dismisses an appeal by Mastercard, sets the scene for Britain's first mass consumer claim brought under a new legal regime and offers guidance for a string of other class actions that have been stalled pending this ruling.
The vast, complex case -- brought after Mastercard lost a drawn-out appeal against a 2007 European Commission ruling that its fees were anti-competitive -- could entitle adults in Britain to 300 pounds ($400) each if it is successful.
""Mastercard has been a sustained competition law breaker, imposing excessive card transaction charges over a prolonged period in a way it must have known would impose an invisible tax on UK consumers,"" said Walter Merricks, who is leading the class action.
The lawyer, who once led the Financial Ombudsman Service, which handles consumer disputes with banks, added that the prices of ""everything we all bought from 1992 to 2008 were higher than they should have been"".
Mastercard said it fundamentally disagreed with a claim that it said was being driven by ""hit and hope"" U.S. lawyers.

""Mastercard will be asking the Competition Appeal Tribunal (which will oversee the case) to avert the serious risk of the new collective action regime going down the wrong path with a case which is fundamentally flawed,"" it said in a statement. ($1 = 0.7563 pounds)

Investors poured $18.1 billion into equity funds in the week to Wednesday, BofA's weekly flow data showed, taking inflows in the last six weeks to a record $140 billion as major vaccine breakthroughs raised hopes that economies could move closer to normality in 2021.
The risk-on sentiment is further supported by the accommodative policies at central banks, which have been purchasing assets at $1.3 billion per hour.
""Central banks have never been this dovish at this level of asset prices and valuation,"" BofA said, citing soaring valuation at MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe. At 25.3 times forward earnings, the index's valuation has been hovering close to March 2000 levels.
In the week to Wednesday, emerging market stocks attracted $3.9 billion, a fifth week of large inflows as investors prepare for ""the year of vaccine"", according to BofA's note to clients.
The U.S. investment bank said its clients with assets under management of $2.9 trillion had allocated 61.5% to equities, just short of the 62.5% record nearly six years back.
BofA said its closely watched 'Bull & Bear' indicator -- a gauge of market sentiment -- was fast approaching ""extreme bullish"" levels jumping to 6.6 from 4.7 in just two weeks. The indicator runs from zero, indicating extremely bearish and ""buy"", to 10, signalling extremely bullish and ""sell"".
Some $28 billion going into cash in the latest week was another sign of caution before Christmas break.

155,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",StockBeat: FTSE's Brexit Blues Likely to Drag on Into Next Year,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Two factors are supposed to underpin U.K. stocks next year. The first is the post-pandemic economic recovery, to which the commodities-heavy FTSE 100 and the midcap FTSE 250, with its bevy of domestic-focused services companies are both heavily exposed in different ways. The second is the return of international portfolio managers to equal weightings for U.K. equities after years of being underweight due to the lack of clarity about Brexit. 
The first theme is still intact, despite the likelihood of some setbacks along the way. The announcement on Friday by GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) that their vaccine hadn't proved effective in stage 2 tests is one example of that. The pair now say they will re-engineer the drug and try again but don't expect it to be available before the fourth quarter of 2021. GSK stock was unmoved by the news, though, not least because it seems that the race to get vaccines to market is already lost. GSK was up 0.7% by mid-morning in the U.K., helped by sterling's weakness and by the comforting knowledge that it doesn't matter whose vaccines return the world to normal if it means that all of GSK's other drugs can be return to pre-pandemic sales levels when the intensive care wards are cleared again. 
But the second theme looks to be in more danger. The unending nightmare of Brexit looks as if it may yet stretch out into the new year, albeit in mutated form. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told journalists after a meeting with EU leaders that ""No Deal"" as of January 1st, when the current post-Brexit transition agreement lapses, is more likely than a deal of any sort. That the EU leaders spent all night haggling (with some success) over their budget and the 750 billion-euro Recovery Fund, and only 10 minutes (according to various newswire reports) talking about Brexit, suggests very strongly that no-one sees a deal on the table worth discussing.
The chance of agreement has been effectively scuppered by the EU inserting, at the last minute, additional requirements that would force the U.K. to follow any future tightening of regulatory standards in the EU if it wanted to maintain full access to the Single Market. This is not a demand that lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party will willingly accept. 
U.K. officials are complaining that the demands are unfair, but that is to miss the point. Negotiations are about what you feel you can get away with, not what is fair or unfair. The addition of fresh demands at the last minute comes only three days after the U.K. gave ground by withdrawing the offensive parts of its new Internal Markets Bill to placate the EU. That makes it very clear where the balance of power in the negotiations lies.
That all suggests that the EU is calculating that the impact of No Deal in January will be harder in the U.K. than in the EU. The U.K. will have to levy tariffs on imports from the EU (equivalent to around 13% of U.K. GDP) under World Trade Organization rules, with direct impacts on the cost of living. Given that imports from the U.K. constitute only 4% of EU GDP, the EU's calculus seems well founded. However, it does assume that the EU is willing to compensate Ireland for the particularly heavy impact that it will suffer from the disruption of trade, especially since much of Ireland's exports are perishable and need to avoid delays at the border.
Assuming that the new year starts with disorder and recriminations, the likeliest way forward is that the chaos is only mended slowly and in piecemeal fashion. That is not a scenario under which international portfolio managers are likely to return to U.K. equities, however good the post-pandemic rebound looks.

As head of audit regulator APAS, Ralf Bose was responsible for regulating EY, which audited Wirecard's accounts for years until it collapsed following the discovery of a 1.9 billion euro ($2.30 billion) hole in its accounts.
""We will discuss the matter with the people involved,"" Altmaier said on Friday, adding that he was ""concerned"" after learning overnight of Bose's share trading. Promising that the matter would be ""intensively"" examined on Friday, he said authorities would check if the rules had been followed.
Bose told a parliamentary committee that he had dealt in Wirecard shares shortly before its collapse, according to attendees of the closed door meeting.
There is no evidence that his trades broke any rules. APAS declined to make any immediate comment. 
The matter has become an embarrassment for officials and authorities, who have been charged with failing to monitor with sufficient rigour a $28 billion euro company that many had believed was a rare German digital champion.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>","Brexit, virus worries weigh on European shares; Sanofi down on vaccine delay","By Susan Mathew and Amal S
(Reuters) - European shares slipped on Friday, setting up to end an action-packed week on a somber note on worries over the economic impact of a resurgent COVID-19 pandemic and the fate of a Brexit trade deal as well as stalled U.S. stimulus measures. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index slid 0.8%, extending losses after a dour 2021 economic forecast from the European Central Bank had seen it end in the red on Thursday.
The index is set to break a five-week winning streak as a stalemate in talks between the European Union and Britain raised the chances of Britain's exit from the economic bloc without a trade deal. 
Investors will be watching for Brexit updates with a Sunday deadline for a last ditch attempt at a deal. 
""It's the fears that the talk from both sides has definitely switched to a more negative tone,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, adding markets still hope for some sort of a deal because stocks ""aren't falling through the floor.""
Drugmaker  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY)'s 3.1% slide weighed the most, after it said its COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) showed an insufficient immune response in clinical trials. GSK shares were trading flat.
As European bond yields dipped, banks continued their slide. Spain's lender-heavy main index fell 1.9%. 
Meanwhile, European Union leaders unblocked a 1.8 trillion euro ($2.18 trillion) financial package late on Thursday to help the economy recover from the pandemic-induced recession.
But in the United States, fiscal stimulus appeared unlikely after Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that wrangling over a spending package could drag on through Christmas. 
A raft of stimulus measures since the onset of the pandemic has lifted sentiment on hopes of a global economic recovery. The STOXX 600 has risen 45% since lows hit in March, but it remains more than 6% down for the year. 
Among other individual stocks, Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) slumped 5.3% after the engineering company downgraded this year's cash outflow forecast and warned the outlook remained challenging.
Telecom gear maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) fell to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after filing a U.S. lawsuit against Samsung (KS:005930) for alleged breaches in negotiations for royalty payments and to license patents.
This could impact Ericsson's operating income by 1 billion Swedish crowns ($118.70 million) to 1.5 billion per quarter beginning in the first quarter 2021, the company said. 
Europe's telecoms sector dropped 2.3% and was on course for its worst day in over 10 weeks.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Investors swap China holdings from Wall Street to Hong Kong as delisting threat brews,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Global fund managers are reducing their holdings in U.S-listed Chinese companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Netease and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com as risks grow they will be forced off American exchanges, switching instead into shares of the companies listed in Hong Kong.
Delisting risks surfaced last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump's administration explored moves to kick Chinese companies off Wall Street unless they abide by U.S. accounting standards, part of an escalating standoff between the world's top two economies.
The threat is now real. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act has been passed by both Chambers of the U.S. Congress and should soon be signed into law by Trump. Once law, foreign issuers in the United States which decline a review of their audits for three years can be delisted.
Since most Chinese companies are prohibited by mainland laws from disclosing information that might be considered state secrets, they are often unable to comply with such audit reviews, making them vulnerable to delisting.
""It's always something you're aware of as a potential risk. Now that risk is really becoming a reality,"" said Brian Bandsma, a New York-based portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management.
Bandsma said he has started moving positions in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Chinese companies toward Hong Kong. There are two paths, he says, and he's taking a slower, but less costly route. But ""if we see the risk becoming more immediate, we can convert very quickly,"" he said. 
Nicholas Yeo, head of China equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said his fund, too, is making adjustments. 
""Listing venue doesn't really matter. For the sake of prudence, we just buy the same companies in the Hong Kong market. The shift is quite easy."" 
An increasing number of Chinese companies have secondary listings in Hong Kong, giving investors an alternative.
U.S.-listed firms including Alibaba, JD.com, NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), Yum China and New Oriental have already floated in Hong Kong. 
More than 20 other ADRs, including  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD), Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS) and Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI), are also eligible for a Hong Kong secondary listing, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
EARLY MOVERS 
Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at New York-based Krane Funds Advisors, believes most conversions so far have come from Asian and European investors who want to align themselves with their investor base.
Temasek, the investment vehicle owned by the Singapore government, said in September it had swapped half its stake in Alibaba - worth about $3 billion - from the United States to Hong Kong. 
Matthews Asia told investors in July it owned Chinese firms such as Alibaba through both U.S. and Hong Kong listings.
For U.S. investors, there is also the option of trading Chinese firms such as Tencent in the less liquid over-the-counter (OTC) market. 
Ahern believes China and the United States will eventually come up with a plan to avoid wholesale delistings that could affect over $2 trillion in American savings invested in U.S.-listed Chinese companies. 
""(We) will not stand idle as we have fiduciary obligation to protect our investors,"" Ahern said, adding the firm had done a test conversion of Alibaba's U.S. shares to Hong Kong shares, proving the process is ""exceptionally easy.""
Fund managers say U.S. and Hong Kong-listed shares are completely fungible, with little price difference or cost. 
Still, in a worst-case scenario, a large exodus of Chinese companies would affect investors and reduce competitiveness of the U.S. capital markets, a lawyer who works with an ADR depositary said on condition of anonymity.
""If you take away prominent successful companies from U.S. exchanges, it will make London or Hong Kong or both stronger and will create a perception that now there are possibly better choices than U.S. exchanges.""

160,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",Coronavirus pandemic worsens 2020 outlook for Rolls-Royce,"By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - British engineering company Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) downgraded this year's cash outflow forecast and warned of a challenging outlook as the slump in air travel continues. 
But the company stuck to its guidance to turn cash flow positive during the second half of next year, saying that its deep cost-cutting plans were on track and would help turn its cash burn rate around. 
The company, whose engines power Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s and Airbus A350s, has been hit by the travel slump during the coronavirus pandemic and to survive it raised 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) from shareholders in November. 
Just weeks later, Rolls-Royce on Friday downgraded this year's cash outflow forecast, saying it now expected that to be 4.2 billion pounds, worse than the 4 billion pounds it was guided to in October. 
It also warned the recovery in engine flying hours, a key measure of how much it is paid by airlines, had slowed due to a second wave of coronavirus infections in some places.
Shares in Rolls-Royce were down 7% to 118.5 pence at 0834 GMT, paring some of the 80% gains the stock has made since positive vaccine news emerged in early November. 
Having tapped shareholders for funds also and taken on 3 billion pounds of new debt last month, CFO Stephen Daintith told reporters that Rolls-Royce had ""ample liquidity to get us through 2021"".
Chief executive Warren East said he was confident Rolls-Royce would meet its 2021 cash flow target but the timing of it would depend on the recovery of flying hours. 
Over the 11 months to November, engine flying hours were approximately 42% of their prior year level, meaning Rolls will likely miss the base case forecast it gave in October for engine flying hours to come in at 45% for 2020.

To ride out the pandemic, the company plans to sell assets worth 2 billion pounds to pay down debt and is cutting 1.3 billion pounds in costs by axing 9,000 jobs and closing factories, a plan it said on Friday was on track.

Chairman John Elkann, the scion of Italy's Agnelli family, will lead the company on an interim basis, Ferrari said late on Thursday.
According to a company source, Camilleri, 65, had suffered health problems, which made it necessary for him to be hospitalised for COVID-19 in recent weeks. He is now recovering at home but his illness was not the cause of his decision to retire, the source added. 
Camilleri also resigned as executive chairman of Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) (PMI), the Marlboro maker said separately.
Camilleri was appointed to lead Ferrari in July 2018 after the sudden death of former CEO Sergio Marchionne. During his tenure, Ferrari was one of the best performing stocks in the auto sector, as demand for its high performance cars remained strong despite the coronavirus pandemic.
Under his leadership, Ferrari shares have hit record levels, with those listed on Milan bourse touching an all-time high of 182.95 euros ($221.70) last month.
The shares slipped 0.4% by 0854 GMT on Friday compared with a 1% fall in Milan's blue-chip index.
Camilleri was also leading an effort to expand the Ferrari vehicle lineup and the use of its brand, without undermining the exclusivity that supported its premium pricing and profit.
Citi analysts said whoever replaces Camilleri would inherit a ""significant legacy"".

""At the same time, Ferrari faces perhaps the biggest upheaval in its history with a number of questions around the deliverability of 2022 profit targets and more pertinently navigating the launch of the PuroSangue SUV and negotiating the transition to zero carbon emissions,"" Citi added.

ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) -Zurich Insurance and Farmers Exchanges have agreed to buy MetLife (NYSE:MET)'s U.S. property and casualty business for $3.94 billion, the insurers said on Friday, after the COVID-19 pandemic made motor and home insurers more profitable. 
Motor and home insurers have had a windfall as government lockdowns to curb the spread of infection have reduced the number of claims for road accidents and burglaries.
Insurers, such as Zurich, by contrast have faced hefty claims from event cancellation and business interruption and premium rates are rising.
""It is an acquisition that complements very well...what we see on the commercial side where the market is hardening,"" Zurich Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco told a media call.
The Swiss insurer will contribute $2.43 billion to the deal through its Farmers Group Inc (FGI) unit, while the Farmers Exchanges will contribute $1.51 billion, Zurich said. 
Reuters was the first to report on Nov. 20 that Zurich was in talks to buy the MetLife business.
The deal will give Farmers Exchanges, to which FGI provides certain administrative and management services, a nationwide presence in the United States and access to new distribution channels, Zurich said.
It will also help Zurich deliver its growth targets for 2022. Chief financial officer George Quinn told the call that the insurer's targets did not depend on acquisitions, but they ""can accelerate what we are looking to achieve"".
MetLife President and CEO Michel Khalaf said the sale would allow the life insurer ""to focus on our core strengths"".
The deal is the latest in the sector.
Denmark's Tryg and Canada's Intact Financial are buying British home and motor insurer RSA, and Finland's Sampo and South Africa's Rand Merchant Investment is buying Britain's Hastings.
Shares in Zurich were down 1.3% at 0825 GMT in a 0.8% lower European insurance market. KBW analysts called the transaction a ""great strategic deal,"" but reiterated their underperform rating on the stock.
The MetLife business to be acquired includes 2.4 million policies, $3.6 billion of net written premiums in 2019 and 3,500 employees, Zurich said.
Zurich said it wanted to fund FGI's portion of the deal through a roughly equal combination of internal resources and hybrid debt.

Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2021.

163,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>",The Current IPO Craze Is Starting to Look a Lot Like 1999,"(Bloomberg) -- Initial public offerings have been doing extremely well lately, bringing to mind the excesses of the tech bubble in the late 1990s.
Shares in Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International Ltd. jumped as much as 112% in their debut Friday, after home-rental platform Airbnb Inc. closed 113% above its IPO price in New York. JD (NASDAQ:JD) Health International Inc. surged 56% in its debut Tuesday while DoorDash Inc. soared 86% in on Wednesday.
The FTSE Renaissance Global IPO, which tracks the performance of offerings worldwide, is up 82% this year, compared with a 12% gain for MSCI’s All-Country Index. Comparing the current period with the dot-com bubble is hard to do directly because the Renaissance IPO Index didn’t start until 2009, and a Bloomberg index that was around in the dot-com boom became defunct in 2017.
There are some pretty clear similarities between the Bloomberg index versus the S&P 500 in 1998-99 and the Renaissance gauge now, noted Cameron Crise, a macro strategist at Bloomberg. The performance after that in the late 1990s was even more dramatic. If IPOs were to follow the same pattern now, they would have a huge jump still to come -- before a pretty spectacular drop.
“The action in these names is definitely a concern for us,” said Matt Maley, a strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., speaking about the U.S. IPOs.
“However, we’d also note that experience tells us that froth in the IPO market tends to be a ‘leading indicator’ for an important top -- not an ‘immediate indicator’ of a top. In other words, yesterday’s action in the IPO market probably tells us that we’ll see a meaningful correction at some point over the next six to nine months, not necessarily over the next few days/weeks.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>",NTT's record bond issue to wrap up bumper year for Japan corporate bond market,"By Hideyuki Sano and Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (OTC:NPPXF) (NTT) launched the country's biggest-ever corporate bond sale worth 1 trillion yen ($9.57 billion) on Friday, as the telecom giant doubled its borrowing plan encouraged by robust investor interest this year.
Corporate bond issues in Japan have already surpassed the annual record set last year of 13.0 trillion yen so far in 2020, ahead of debt sale rush in December, according to Refinitiv data.
""After COVID-19, Japanese corporations are trying to accumulate much more money on their balance sheets, so demand for financing is increasing, which is why many companies are issuing corporate bonds in addition to bank loans,"" said Toshiyasu Ohashi, chief credit strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""There's hope of keeping this volume next year because we know COVID-19 won't disappear so quickly, and many companies are thinking the market is much more attractive."" 
Companies are benefiting from investors who are squeezed by plunging global bond yields, stepping up their borrowing targets to fund investment, replenish working capital, and to pay back maturing higher-yielding debt.
NTT needed longer-term funding after its 4.3 trillion yen tender offer to make its wireless unit NTT Docomo (OTC:DCMYY) a wholly-owned subsidiary, a transaction it has just finished earlier this month. 
The bonds, offered by NTT's financial arm NTT Finance in four tranches, attracted such strong investor appetite that the firm increased the issue to 1.0 trillion yen from its original plan of 500 billion yen, an NTT spokesman said. 
Its 10-year bond, the biggest tranche, carries a yield of 0.38%, about 37 basis points above Japanese government bonds.
When there is a big bond issue, investors would normally offload some of other bonds they hold to make room for new bonds but this time there were no such sales, said a trader at a Japanese brokerage, highlighting investors' thirst for yields.
""As global bond yields have plunged, the relative attraction of Japanese bonds is increasing. And corporate bond yields are becoming attractive enough for life insurers like us,"" said an investment manager at one life insurance company. 
The bumper year for the bond market came as banks, traditionally the dominant players in Japan's debt market, stepped up lending aggressively as they respond to a rare spike in funding demand after the pandemic.
""The fact that corporate bond issues did well despite increased bank lending suggests borrowers are re-discovering the benefit of corporate bonds,"" said Nana Otsuki, chief economist at Monex Securities.
Still, Japan's 75 trillion yen corporate bond market is dwarfed by banks, which saw their lending growing about 6% from a year earlier in past several months, the fastest growth in this century, to around 570 trillion yen.

Spohr told Wirtschaftswoche that the concrete prospect of an effective vaccine against the coronavirus had boosted confidence among passengers.
""The fact that people have also already reserved flights for the Easter period shows how confident they are,"" he was quoted as saying on Friday.
""I expect that next year we will be able to achieve half the level of 2019 again on average, and for the summer and autumn we calculate up to 70%.""
Lufthansa expects to stop bleeding cash next year and hopes to be profitable from 2022, he said.
Spohr hopes the German government, which gave the airline 9 billion euros ($10.94 billion) in state aid in May in return for a 20% stake, will be able to reduce its holding in Lufthansa from 2023.
He said Lufthansa has drawn down only 3 billion euros of the bailout and only spent a small part thanks to strict cost management.
Still, Spohr said the airline will have to lay off 1,000 pilots in the second quarter if it cannot seal a wage agreement with unions on cutting salaries and reducing working hours.

""In the absence of an agreement, it will probably be the first time in the history of our company that 500 captains and 500 first officers will have to leave us in the second quarter of 2021,"" Spohr said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Friday, with the fraught Brexit negotiations prompting caution even after the ECB extended its bond-buying program and the Covid-19 vaccine rollout continues.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%. 
Talks between U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen this week have ended without a breakthrough. Although the two teams of negotiators are continuing to meet ahead of the Sunday deadline, there appears to be little chance of success without fresh political compromise.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday there was ""a strong possibility"" Britain and the EU would fail to strike a trade deal. 
At stake is around $1 trillion in annual trade at risk of facing tariffs and quotas if a deal cannot be reached before transition arrangements end on Dec. 31.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank said it will inject more stimulus into the region’s Covid-battered economy, increasing the overall size of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program by 500 billion euros ($600 billion) to 1.85 trillion euros and extending the scheme by nine months to March 2022. This comes after EU leaders also finally signed off 750 billion euros ($908 billion) of coronavirus relief funds, ending a months-long stand-off with Poland and Hungary.
Additionally, U.S. authorities voted overwhelmingly to endorse emergency use of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s coronavirus vaccine, meaning inoculations in this country which has seen over 285,000 deaths from Covid-19 are expected to begin as early as next week.
On Capitol Hill, U.S. lawmakers continued to negotiate over a broader Covid-19 relief package, but a deal before the Christmas break is looking unlikely.
In corporate news, Zurich Insurance (SIX:ZURN) will be in focus after its subsidiary Farmers Group agreed to acquire MetLife's (NYSE:MET) property and casualty business in the U.S. for $3.94 billion.
German airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) will be forced to lay off 1,000 pilots in the second quarter if it cannot seal a wage agreement with unions, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said Friday.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, continuing the sharp rally of the previous session, on continued enthusiasm that the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine will result in a rebound in demand next year.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $47.06 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $50.47, climbing above $50 for the first time since March. Both benchmarks are on course to post their sixth consecutive week of gains. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,839.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2159.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 12:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: 'Avoid getting caught' - report details how Carlsberg, SABMiller and UB fixed beer prices in India","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Top executives of Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), SABMiller (LON:SAB) and India's United Breweries (UB) exchanged commercially sensitive information and colluded to fix beer prices in India over 11 years, according to a government antitrust investigation report seen by Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2018 raided the offices of the three brewers and started an inquiry. The investigation's findings - which are not a final judgment of wrongdoing - cast a shadow on the brewers, which account for 88% of India's $7 billion beer market. (https://reut.rs/2yxSfsw)
Senior CCI members will consider the report, drafted in March, as they decide on fines, which could exceed $250 million, two sources familiar with the case said. The CCI members could agree with or dispute the findings of its investigation team. 
Executives' conversations, WhatsApp messages and e-mails contained in the report show the companies regularly and collectively strategised in seeking price increases in ""several states"", forging a cartel the CCI said gave them more bargaining power with state authorities.
The companies also used the All India Brewers Association (AIBA) as a ""common platform"" to decide collectively on prices; and the local group then lobbied on the companies' behalf for price increases, the CCI report found.
At least three times, executives exchanged messages urging one another to keep their plans quiet, the report showed.
""We should avoid getting caught,"" AIBA's director general wrote in an e-mail in 2016 to executives of the three companies.
The brewers coordinated to ""manipulate the government machinery"" and ""were well aware that their collective approach through the association (AIBA) was violating"" competition law, the 248-page CCI report said. The report concluded the cartel existed between 2007 and October 2018. 
The CCI did not respond to Reuters queries. Lobby group AIBA and Carlsberg declined to comment, citing ongoing CCI proceedings.
United Breweries, part-owned by Heineken (OTC:HEINY), said it had cooperated with authorities and would make submissions to the CCI. Heineken didn't respond to requests for comment.
The world's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, which acquired SABMiller in 2016, said it takes ""antitrust compliance very seriously"".
INVESTIGATION, 'CLEAR ADMISSION'
The CCI raids in 2018 seized hundreds of files and more than 2 terabytes of data from laptops, pen drives and smartphones. 
The case was triggered when AB InBev used CCI's ""leniency programme"" to disclose that it had detected a cartel while integrating SABMiller's operations in India. Later in 2018, UB and Carlsberg also filed leniency applications, Reuters has reported. (https://reut.rs/2JeQKEs)
Under the programme, the CCI can reduce the penalties it imposes on companies depending on the cooperation they provide. In this case, 19 beer executives engaged in anticompetitive practices, the CCI's investigation report says. 
""The collusion ... has been mostly through the highest level of management in these companies,"" the report said, including managing directors, vice presidents, and sales and marketing heads.
When the CCI asked former Carlsberg India managing director Michael Jensen whether the company ""was actively coordinating with its competitors on pricing issues, and taking utmost care so as not to leave any documentary evidence"", the report said ""his reply was a clear admission"". Jensen declined to comment.
Some discussions took place over WhatsApp, the report says. The report shows that in 2013, the chief sales officer of UB, Kiran Kumar, and then-managing director of SABMiller, Shalabh Seth, exchanged WhatsApp messages to plan a 60 rupee (81 cent) price increase per case of beer in a particular state.
According to the report, Seth wrote in one message: ""Pls arrange msg to other friends"". The CCI said that indicated ""that other competitor companies were also coordinating with them"".
Seth - who now works at UB - and Kumar said in separate statements that they had extended ""full cooperation"" to authorities and would make submissions to the CCI. They both declined to comment further.
""STARVE THE MARKET""
Collaborating on price increases gives companies higher negotiating power and avoids a price war while deterring healthy competition and hurting consumers, antitrust experts said. 
India's alcohol market has complex rules. States regulate taxes and prices, which are every year approved by local authorities. 
Tax earnings on alcohol also form a major part of state revenue in India, and the investigation said the beer companies had held talks at least three times between 2015 and 2018 to create artificial scarcity and pressure governments on policy changes. 
India's antitrust law says such agreements are anti-competitive.
Carlsberg told the CCI that after a pricing policy change in eastern Odisha state in 2015, all companies ""decided to limit supply of beer"".
One early 2018 internal e-mail from Carlsberg's vice president for growth markets at the time, Nilesh Patel, refers to a similar strategy deployed in Maharashtra state.
A fall in the state's sales in 2017 ""was primarily driven by conscious decision"" by UB and Carlsberg to ""starve the market post Excise (tax) hike"", Patel wrote.

Patel, who is now Carlsberg's India managing director, declined to comment.

Investing.com –  Pop Mart International Group  Ltd soared in its Hong Kong stock market debut on Friday, with shares in the Chinese toy maker opening 100% higher.
Pop Mart (HK:9992) shares were at HK$70 ($9.03) at 12:25 AM ET (4:25 AM GMT), after opening at HK$77.10.
The company had priced its IPO shares at HK$38.50, at the top of the range in its bookbuild that took place during the previous week. Cornerstone shareholders, a typical feature in Hong Kong IPOs, were absent  as both the company and its advisors were confident of a high level of investor interest.
They were proven right, with the deal hotly contested by both institutional and retail investors and raising $676 million for the company. The institutional portion of the deal was 44 times covered while the retail component was 356 times oversubscribed, according to Pop Mart documents lodged with the Hong Kong Exchange.
Pop Mart shares rose 103% on Thursday in grey market trading set by Phillip Securities in Hong Kong ahead of the company’s official debut earlier in the day.
The company’s main product is a ‘mystery’ toy box each containing a single figurine from various collections. The best-selling figurine is the round-faced ‘Molly’ doll."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese toy maker Pop Mart International Group, seller of the renowned 'Molly' doll and figurines wildly popular among China's cashed-up millennials, is now worth $14 billion after its stock price doubled in its Hong Kong trade debut on Friday.
The Beijing-based company's shares opened 100% higher in their first session on Friday, continuing a run of strong first-day performances for deals in the city.
Pop Mart raised $676 million in an initial public offering (IPO) which gave the company a valuation of $7 billion ahead of the trading debut.
With the price doubling, the company is worth at least $14 billion and the firm's founder Wang Ning, 33, is a now billionaire with his 56% stake.
Pop Mart sells most of its toys in mystery boxes, meaning shoppers at its 136 mainland China stores and 1,001 vending machines do not know which figurine they get until opening the box.
The attraction of the toys even lured the normally serious bankers who worked on the deal.
""I bought a lot,"" said one dealmaker who could not identified as he was not authorised to speak to media.
The company priced its IPO shares at HK$38.50 in a deal that was hotly contested by institutional and retail investors.
Pop Mart's shares opened at HK$77.10, outpacing the broader Hang Seng Index which is trading up 0.37% in the final session of the week. It is Friday's most actively traded stock by turnover on the Hang Seng.
The share-price surge puts the stock among the best-performing debutants for the city on record for deals over $500 million, Refinitiv data showed.
Just this year, Smoore International Holdings Ltd stock shot up 150% on debut in July, Nongfu Spring Co Ltd gained as much as 85% in September while JD (NASDAQ:JD) Health International Inc gained 56% when it debuted on Tuesday.
GEO Securities Chief Executive Francis Lun said the first day 'pop' of IPOs in Hong Kong was driven by investors taking on leverage to buy into deals.
""There is so much money chasing these deals, sooner rather than later these punters are going to hit a rough spot and they will realise that they can lose money on some deals,"" he told Reuters.
""The problem is people are too optimistic, they take on a lot of leverage, interest rates are low and they think every deal will make money.""
There have been deals in Hong Kong this year that have failed to rise on the first day, especially in the property services sector.
KWG Living Living Group Holdings Ltd lost 23% while Shimao Services Holdings Ltd and First Service Holding Ltd dropped 23% and 27% respectively on their recent debuts.

Pop Mart's main product is ""mystery"" toy boxes that each hold a single figurine from different collections. Its best-selling character is the round-faced Molly doll..

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, with investors digesting disappointing jobs data and weighing the likelihood of the latest stimulus measures being passed by the U.S. Congress.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.60% by 10:31 PM ET (2:31 AM GMT), while South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.94%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.47%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.49%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.29% and the SZSE Component fell 0.39%.
Data released on Thursday showed 853,000 U.S. jobless claims for the past week, more than the 725,000 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous week’s 716,000 claims. The data suggested that more claims were filed as more businesses shut down due to the ever-increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.
U.S. shares also saw a second day of losses overnight. Although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that there was progress toward an agreement on the measures, there seems to be with no apparent signs of it as Asian markets opened on Friday.
Democrats and Republicans continued their negotiations over the measures, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supporting Mnuchin’s $916 billion proposal and emphasizing the need to do “everything we can” to help the economy. However, Pelosi sees an alternate $908 billion plan, which is still being drafted by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, as her preferred option.
Both sides have until Dec. 11 to reach a consensus to avoid a government shutdown. However, some investors did not have high hopes for a deal, even if it materializes before the deadline.
“We’re just kind of waiting on a deal. I wouldn’t expect the market to do a whole lot one way or the other going into year-end from here … especially if the stimulus package keeps getting pushed out,” Gradient Investments portfolio manager Keith Gangl told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) deployed another round of monetary stimulus totaling EUR500 billion ($605.19 billion) during its policy meeting on Thursday. The central bank said that it would continue its ongoing bond purchase stimulus by EUR500 billion euros to EUR1.85 trillion and will extend its support program until at least March 2022 from the current earliest end date of mid 2021.
With Europe continuing to fight a second wave of COVID-19 cases, the measures were widely within expectations, although the ECB might not use all the funds.
ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the euro’s exchange rate had not been targeted. However, she also added, “But clearly [the] exchange rate, and in particular the appreciation of the euro, plays an important role and exercises downward pressure on prices, so we monitor it, we will continue to monitor it very carefully going forward.”
The Federal Reserve also met for its policy meeting on Thursday.
Meanwhile, a panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday voted 17-4 to endorse emergency use of BNT162b2, the COVID-19 vaccine co-developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy). The panel’s overwhelming endorsement could clear the way for the FDA to authorize emergency use of the vaccine within days. Vaccine distribution and inoculations in the U.S. are expected to begin almost immediately thereafter.
Some investors remained cautiously optimistic about the overall situation.
Markets are “having to balance a weak short-term picture against a much rosier medium-term as vaccines start to be rolled out … [and] in this environment equities have largely held onto recent gains,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) director of economics and markets Tapas Strickland said in a note."

LONDON/HANOI (Reuters) - Cybersecurity investigators at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have traced a hacking group long suspected of spying on behalf of the Vietnamese government to an IT company in Ho Chi Minh City. 
The announcement on Friday is the first time Facebook has publicly exposed an offensive hacking operation and, if confirmed, would be a rare case of suspected state-backed cyberspies being tracked to a specific organisation.
The hackers, known as OceanLotus or APT32, have been accused for years of spying on political dissidents, businesses and foreign officials. Reuters reported this year that the group had attempted to break into China's Ministry of Emergency Management and the government of Wuhan as the COVID-19 outbreak first spread.
Facebook said it had found links between cyberattacks previously attributed to OceanLotus and a Vietnamese company called CyberOne Group, which lists an address on a sidestreet in a commercial district of Ho Chi Minh city. 
CyberOne Group denied being connected to the hackers.
""We are NOT Ocean Lotus,"" a person operating the company's now-suspended Facebook page said when contacted by Reuters. ""It's a mistake.""
Vietnam's foreign ministry, which handles enquiries from international media, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ministry has previously denied connections to OceanLotus attacks. 
Facebook said the hackers had used its platforms to carry out a range of cyberattacks, some of which employed fake accounts to trick targets by posing as activists, businesses and possible love interests.
Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said his team had found technical evidence that linked CyberOne's Facebook page to accounts used in the hacking campaign, as well as to other OceanLotus attacks.
He declined to detail the exact evidence, saying to do so would make the group more difficult to track in the future. But he said it included online infrastructure, malicious code, and other hacking tools and techniques. 
""The actors in this space use some very defined techniques and if we are too public about how we observe those, it really does harm our ability to catch more of this,"" Gleicher said.
MOVIE THEATRE AND YOGA (OTC:YOGAQ)
Although OceanLotus has not gained the level of notoriety in the West as some suspected Chinese and Russian state-backed hacking operations, it has been prolific in southeast Asia.
Ben Read, a senior manager at U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), and Marc-Étienne Léveillé, a researcher at Slovakian software security group ESET, said the hacking activity uncovered by Facebook matched operations attributed to OceanLotus.
Read said OceanLotus had been active since at least 2013 and had ""all the hallmarks of a substantial state-backed organisation acting in support of Vietnamese government"".
Facebook said it did not have sufficient evidence to attribute OceanLotus beyond CyberOne Group, which it said has also used the names CyberOne Security, CyberOne Technologies, Hành Tinh Company Limited, Planet and Diacauso.
CyberOne reveals little information about itself on its website, saying only that it has around 200 employees providing a range of ""essential security technologies"".
A careers page that was removed shortly after Reuters contacted the company advertised positions for people with hacking skills and experience in malware analysis. Recruiters boasted of a generous benefits package, including free meals, a mini movie theatre and after-work yoga. 
In Vietnam, Facebook is navigating a standoff with government officials who have threatened to ban it if it does not agree to censorship demands.

Reuters reported in April that Facebook had complied with a government request to increase its censorship of ""anti-state"" posts after its servers in Vietnam were taken offline, slowing traffic there to a crawl.

""Mr. Cohn is a team player, and as a good corporate citizen, he volunteered many weeks ago to make a significant charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs-sponsored organizations and looks forward to doing so,"" a spokeswoman for Cohn said.
The planned donation was first reported by Bloomberg on Thursday.
Goldman Sachs in October agreed to pay U.S. authorities $2.9 billion in penalties to settle probes by the Department of Justice and other authorities into its role in the 1MDB scandal.
At the same time, the bank said it would reclaim a total of $174 million in compensation from current and former senior Goldman executives as an acknowledgement of managerial accountability for the institutional failure.
None of the executives concerned were involved in any wrongdoing, the bank said. 

Cohn severed all financial ties with Goldman upon becoming President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser in January 2017 and had no compensation tied up in the firm as of then. 
Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs had asked Cohn for $10 million but that he declined and instead would make the donation, the size of which was not disclosed by his spokeswoman. 
“We are pleased that Gary (Cohn) has chosen to support charitable organizations that are doing important work and put this matter behind us,” a spokeswoman for Goldman said.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 06:21PM ET</span>","Face value: In China men's skincare boom, startups, global investors seek rich glow","By Sophie Yu and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's radiant male skincare market has a fresh shine: A raft of domestic startups is tapping global investors for funds, with ambitions to rival giants like L'Oreal in a billion-dollar business serving image-conscious millennial men like Hou Junru.
The 24-year-old Shanghai education worker got into skincare as a student and splurged more than $1,000 on creams and lotions in e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s giant Nov. 11 Singles Day promotion. ""My need is to keep the skin moist and look pale,"" said Hou.
It's a priority shared by many of his peers, influenced by the spread of social media and South Korean pop culture that embraces a softer version of masculinity. Already the biggest in the world, the Chinese men's facial skincare market is forecast to hit 12.5 billion yuan ($1.90 billion) this year - and expand 50% to 18.5 billion yuan in 2025, research firm Mintel estimates. 
Market research provider Euromonitor International estimates the men's skincare business in China, excluding post-shave products, was last year already more than three times the size of the U.S. market in dollar terms and more than twice the size of South Korea - with value growth through 2024 seen easily outstripping both.
Drawing on the huge reach of online retailers like Alibaba and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, at least 10 new Chinese male skincare brands have been set up this year, according to media reports.
""A great number of small brands are emerging through online channels,"" Mintel said in a recent report. The ""online shopping experience enables men to choose what they want quickly ... online retailers can make it easier for men to seek out information and tips than in offline stores."" 
Six of the new players between them raised more than 300 million yuan between them, the founder of one brand told Reuters. Bertelsmann Asia Investments said it has invested in a new Shanghai brand, without saying how much, while others like SIG Asia and Redpoint Ventures have also placed sector bets, according to domestic media reports and startup research database CB Insights.
To be sure, with a combined share of 60%, according to Mintel, the China market remains dominated by three big foreign players - France's L'Oreal, Nivea maker Beiersdorf of Germany, and Japan's Rohto, home of the OXY brand. L'Oreal declined to comment for this article, while Beiersdorf and Rohto didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Still, beyond that dominance lies a hefty, fragmented chunk to be targeted by new local startups, hoping to emulate the success of Perfect Diary, a red-hot Chinese women's cosmetics brand whose parent raised $617 million in a Nasdaq listing last month.
'DRAGON BLOOD'
Among the new breed of male skincare firms is Coen, founded in September by Huang Kai, a Xiamen-based entrepreneur who has shuttered his previous business selling men's apparel to focus on the beauty beat, with goods manufactured by firms in Guangzhou. 
Huang, 31, said sales at Coen - a name that translates to ""scientific and grateful"" - topped 1 million yuan in two months via stores on e-commerce marketplaces. A 120 millilitre bottle of its flagship cleanser, 'Dragon Blood', retails for 64.90 yuan ($9.90) on Alibaba's Tmall platform.
With products like a beard depilatory cream in the pipeline Huang said he was in talks to raise funds from investors for what he described as a huge opportunity to tap new generations more open to skincare. ""There are more than 200 million men born (in China) after 1995,"" said Huang.
A half-dozen of this year's bevy of startups have together already raised more than 300 million yuan, Huang said, declining to say which potential investors he's talking to. 
Bertelmann Asia Investments Vice President Cindy Zhu told Reuters her firm has invested in Shanghai-based men's skincare company Just a Cool Brand (JACB), set up this year. Zhu said the fund believed the growth momentum in China's cosmetics market would continue.
""JACB will provide more professional products that may appropriately meet the skin care requirements of Chinese men consumers,"" said Zhu. JACB was not reachable for comment. 
According to the CB Insights database, meantime, Redpoint Ventures and SIG Asia have invested in Make Essense, based in Shenzhen. Make Essense, SIG and Redpoint did not respond to Reuters' inquiries. 
COLOUR COSMETICS?
One major hurdle for the new breed of Chinese suppliers will be persuading customers who have used well-known foreign brands for years to switch over to them.
Education worker Hou, for instance, said he doesn't use new domestic goods, opting for brands like France's Guerlain and La Mer instead. ""These products are used on your face so I don't want to try brands I haven't heard of,"" he said.
But others remain open to the possibility. University student Liu Yuxuan, 22, typically uses Clinique and  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) but would consider domestic brands that offer value for money. ""Chinese brands are more down-to-earth,"" said Liu.
One avenue of possibility for domestic brands could be to expand into colour cosmetics like eye shadow - still a niche but growing segment, according to JD.com and Alibaba numbers.
""Most men's products are boring,"" said Hou.
""Why won't brands give us men more innovative products? Like women I also need skincare to maintain moisture and look white. I will buy if they are good!""

(Reuters) -Shares of Airbnb Inc more than doubled in their stock market debut on Thursday, valuing the home rental firm at just over $100 billion in the biggest U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of 2020 and capping a bumper year in which investors flocked to tech stocks. 
Airbnb opened at $146 on the Nasdaq, far above the IPO price of $68 per share that raised $3.5 billion for the company. The stock hit a high of $165 and closed at $144.71. 
The IPO is the culmination of a stunning recovery in Airbnb's fortunes after the firm's business was heavily damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year. 
But as lockdowns eased, more travelers opted to book homes instead of hotels, helping Airbnb post a surprise profit for the third quarter. The San Francisco-based firm also gained from increased interest in renting homes away from major cities.
""I don't think this summer too many people expected to see an Airbnb IPO this year,"" Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky told Reuters in an interview. 
""We were planning on going public, we put our IPO on hold and this has been the most unbelievable journey. It's been quite a comeback for our hosts and for what I hope will be travel,"" added Chesky, whose Airbnb stake is now worth around $11 billion. 
Founded in 2008 as a website to take bookings for rooms during conferences, Airbnb's listing was one of the most anticipated U.S. IPOs of 2020, which has already been a record year for stock market listings. 
Record label Warner Music Group, data analytics firm Palantir Technologies and data warehouse company Snowflake Inc have all gone public in the past few months.
At the start of trading on the Nasdaq, Airbnb had a market capitalization of $86.5 billion, eclipsing that of online travel agency Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc and hotel chain Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc. 
Including securities such as options and restricted stock units, Airbnb's fully diluted valuation came to $100.7 billion, more than five times the $18 billion Airbnb was valued at in a private fundraising round in April at the outset of the pandemic. Airbnb's worth was pegged at $31 billion in its last pre-COVID-19 private fundraising in 2017. 
The eye-popping rise in Airbnb's stock on its debut comes just a day after the share price of food delivery company DoorDash Inc doubled in their first day of trading.
Such large first-day trading gains are likely to fuel criticism from some venture capital investors, including Benchmark's Bill Gurley, who argue investment banks underprice IPOs so their investor clients can score large gains when the stock starts trading. Such advocates have pushed for companies to consider listing shares through a direct listing, in which bankers have little influence on the price at which stock is sold. 
Chesky said Airbnb would focus on the things that were within the company's control. 
""At this point the price of stock is not something we control. I've encouraged our employees to focus on things they can control,"" Chesky said, speaking before the stock had started trading.

(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) on Thursday stopped processing payments on Pornhub after a New York Times report last week that many videos posted on the adult website depicted sexual assault of children.
Mastercard said it was permanently ending the use of its cards on the sex videos site after its investigation confirmed the presence of illegal content on the platform. Visa said it was suspending payments till an investigation was completed.
Pornhub called the actions as ""disappointing"", saying it came after the site implemented safeguards such as a ban on video downloads, as well as permitting only certain partner accounts to upload content.
The New York Times article had also described some videos on the site as recordings of assaults on unconscious women and girls.
Pornhub has denied the allegations.

""This news is crushing for the hundreds of thousands of models who rely on our platform for their livelihoods,"" Pornhub said on Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major averages closed on Thursday with a rebound from early lows as investors looked for signs of progress in fiscal stimulus talks to support the economy after labor market data showed a jump in jobless claims.
Stocks on Wall Street opened lower on the heels of weekly initial jobless claims data that spiked by 137,000 to a seasonally adjusted 853,000, well above expectations for 725,000 and the highest level since mid-September, underscoring the need for fresh stimulus measures to support a flagging economy.
But equities moved well off lows that saw the S&P 500 down as much as 0.75% after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks between Republican and Democratic senators on COVID-19 relief were making ""a lot of progress"" with more discussions expected in the day.
""The competing narrative of the virus is here, it is worse, the natural pullback of the economy because of that and the lack of uncertainty around the timeline and magnitude of the package is going to be a daily struggle with pretty volatile moments in the interim,"" said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. 
""If this is the start of a trend, we will test the capacity of the market to remain optimistic by looking past a really tough environment that is on the ground right now.""

Airbnb Inc's shares opened at $146 in their debut, far above the initial public offering (IPO) price of $68 apiece, raising $3.5 billion for the home rental firm, with shares closing at $144.71. The offering comes on the heels of a blowout debut for Wednesday's high profile IPO DoorDash.
The S&P energy index closed at a six-month high as Brent crude prices surged above $50 a barrel for the first time since early March. The group has surged 36.2% this quarter, the best performing of the 11 major S&P sectors, as investors have looked to names that could benefit from an economic reopening. 
The faltering labor market recovery and the recent surge in COVID-19 infections have piled pressure on policymakers to come up with another rescue package, as most of the government financial aid for Americans and businesses has dried up.
A U.S. Senate vote on a stopgap measure to keep the government running could slip to the Friday deadline, said the Senate's number two Republican, John Thune. The measure would give lawmakers time to work out a larger spending package and coronavirus relief, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi raised the possibility talks could drag on through Christmas. 
Also in focus was a meeting of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later in the day, to decide whether to recommend that the agency authorize  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use.
Some officials said vaccinations could begin as soon as this weekend if the FDA consented.

Investing.com -- Markets fluctuated, often lower, on Thursday as Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) made its striking debut as a $100 billion company.
We are still, still, hearing about stimulus, and look forward to the day we get our payments and move on, as surely do the number of Americans who are unemployed, which increased by more than 850,000 in the week ended Dec. 5.
We may or may not have emergency use authorization very soon as the Federal Drug and Food Administration has started the review of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine. 
The imminent vaccine helped energy stocks enjoy some time in the green on higher oil prices. Tech traded lower.   
Finally, we're getting into the December doldrums, where there's very little to look forward to on a Friday. Still, there are a few things that should pull you away from Christmas shopping. 
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. PPI 
Producer prices are expected to have risen slightly in November after a similarly modest gain the prior month. A broader economic slowdown due to rising Covid cases is likely to weigh on things. Economists expect a 0.2% gain when the number comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. Sentiment
The virus resurgence is also expected to bring down consumer sentiment. Consensus has the University of Michigan's preliminary read for December coming in at 76.5, compared to November's final print of 76.9. That's due at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT).
3. Earnings

189,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Santa takes a back seat to COVID vaccine, UPS, FedEx officials say","By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -United Parcel Service and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) plan to deliver millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines before holiday gifts - giving them VIP handling that includes GPS tracking, special labels and first-loaded status on planes and trucks. 
The largest U.S. package delivery companies are partners in the federal government's Operation Warp Speed (OWS) vaccine program and each has specialized capabilities to handle fragile medical products - including  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s mRna vaccine that requires shipment at sub-Arctic temperatures. 
""We're giving priority to all the vaccine shipments,"" Wesley Wheeler, president of the global healthcare unit at UPS, told the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation on Thursday. 
A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is meeting on Thursday to weigh whether to recommend that the agency authorize Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, one of the last steps before vaccinations could begin.
If the vaccine is approved, UPS will put Gold-level service labels, which are embedded with four radios, on every vaccine and dry ice shipment.
UPS GPS trackers will also provide temperature, light exposure and motion data, backing up sensors provided by Pfizer. All of that information will stream into command centers run by UPS and OWS. 
""We have three ways of looking at the packages through the system,"" said Wheeler. ""We are watching the packages all day long."" 
UPS will load the suitcase-sized vaccine packages onto planes and trucks first and give them special handling in hubs and sorting centers. The company also will inform drivers who are transporting vaccines, and provide security escorts. 
Vaccine distribution could start just as the U.S. holiday shipping peak hits record-pandemic fueled e-commerce volumes. 
Some experts are already warning that the number of packages tendered for delivery could be 5% greater than the capacity carriers have to handle them - resulting is as many as 700 million gifts not arriving on time. 
UPS and FedEx executives said they are giving vaccines top priority and have reserved capacity for them. 
Before vaccine deliveries start, UPS will deliver supplies needed to administer Pfizer inoculations - including diluent, mixing vials, needles, syringes, protective equipment for healthcare workers and COVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients. 
The delivery companies will split next-day Pfizer vaccine deliveries in the United States, and UPS will deliver the first dry ice refills needed to keep vaccine in Pfizer's suitcase-sized shipping boxes at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), Wheeler said.
Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania's secretary of health and the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, said in prepared remarks that a quarter of states experienced a lag in receiving supply kits during a dry run.
""You're going to have three different components ... that all need to arrive at the exact same place, at the right time so that the vaccine can be administered,"" Levine said at the hearing.
The executives reassured Senators that they are ready to tackle the biggest and complex vaccination distribution effort in U.S. history.

""We deal with the unforeseen every day: weather, traffic ... regulatory holds, customs delays. We don't expect anything that we won't be able to handle,"" Richard Smith, executive vice president of global support for FedEx Express.

Investing.com -- Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) opened trading at $146, more than double the $68 at which it priced on Wednesday, on the heels of  Doordash Inc  (NYSE:DASH)'s spectacular debut.
The company sold about 52 million shares -- originally marketed between $90 and $95 -- on Wednesday to raise $3.5 billion in its initial public offering and now has a market value of more than $100 billion.
Airbnb's IPO is the third-largest in the U.S. this year, topped only by Bill Ackman's $4 billion blank-check company and Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW)s $3.86 billion offering.
DoorDash shares soared as much as 92% on Wednesday after it raised $3.37 billion in its IPO, Bloomberg reported. The delivery company's market cap is about $60 billion, which is higher than  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc. and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. DoorDash is trading down about 5% on Thursday.
Airbnb, founded in 2007, saw business plummet amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which put a major halt to international and national travel. But business rebounded after domestic travel rebounded and guests took trips closer to home. The work-from-anywhere theme has also supported the company as city-dwellers have sought refuge outside of urban areas. In addition, it has been a boon for those who need to supplement their income, or lack thereof, amid millions of job losses.  
As of Sept. 30, Airbnb had over 4 million hosts around the world, with 86% of hosts located outside of the U.S. Hosts had 7.4 million available listings of homes and experiences, of which 5.6 million were active listings. The company estimates the total addressable market for its services to be $3.4 trillion, including $1.8 trillion for short-term stays, $210 billion for long-term stays, and $1.4 trillion for experiences.
Airbnb has incurred net losses since its inception, including $696.9 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",Banks face four more years of lower profits in pandemic aftermath - report,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most banks around the world could face four more years of depressed profits in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, consulting firm McKinsey & Co said in a report.
By 2024 the pandemic will require $2.7 trillion of provision expenses for loan losses and $3.7 trillion of revenue will be lost forever because of economic challenges and persistently low interest rates, the consultants said. 
Their estimates used a base-case outlook for ""a muted global recovery"" from the pandemic-induced recession.
The lost revenue is as much as the industry would have collected in six months in normal times, according to the report(https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/global-banking-annual-review) to be released late on Wednesday.
Globally, a key measure of profitability, return on equity, is predicted to decline to 1.5% in 2021 from 8.9% in 2019. Most institutions won't regain their 2019 profitability for five years unless they improve their productivity and capital management, the firm said. Mergers may be a solution for some.
""There is a great imperative for banks to lift their productivity,"" said Kausik Rajgopal, one of the report's authors.
But the prospects for the ""long winter"" that McKinsey predicts means banks will want to take care in spending to improve productivity. Banks face increasing competition from highly valued technology companies with resources to try new products at little cost to customers.
At an investor conference on Tuesday, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the biggest and one of the most profitable banks in the United States, cited Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), PayPal, Stripe and Square as competitive threats.

The pandemic is leaving few banks in jeopardy because the industry has more capital than before the 2008 financial crisis. Now, McKinsey estimated, 7% of banks, representing only 2.7% of industry capital, have a 50% or greater chance of needing more capital to stay above regulatory minimums.

Earlier this week, environmentalists went to court in the eastern city of Frankfurt an der Oder in an attempt to stop Tesla clearing a forest, arguing that cutting down more trees could endanger hibernating snakes. [L8N2IO1OV]
A higher regional administrative court found in favour of the plaintiffs, who had appealed an earlier rejecting the environmentalists' arguments on the grounds that Tesla had taken sufficient measures to protect the reptiles.
The temporary halt should allow the court to review the case on its merits before the tree felling is completed, the Brandenburg Higher Administrative Court said in a statement.
Tesla's permission to start construction depends on a conditional approval by local authorities, who are obliged to consult environmental groups and the community.

A lower regional court in Frankfurt an der Oder earlier reviewed a complaint by environmental group NABU, which argued that snakes and sand lizards could be put at risk by Tesla's plans.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - ""Your generation has accomplished extraordinary things. But did you have to bankrupt this planet?""
That recent comment from Pat Gelsinger's daughter-in-law was ""a slap in the face,"" said Gelsinger, the chief executive of software maker VMware (NYSE:VMW) Inc.
But in what he calls the ""Year of the Triple"" - climate change, a global pandemic and racial upheaval, it also helped influence a call to action. 
On Dec. 10, the Palo Alto, California-based company unveiled its 2030 Agenda, a list of 30 environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals ranging from hiring one woman for every man, to procuring 100% of its power from renewable energy by the end of the decade.
Gelsinger, 59, spoke to Reuters about why ""a company with greater purpose"" is his mantra. Edited excerpts are below.
Q. What is the driver for this vast range of goals for the next decade?
A. We're not a consumer brand. But VMware is one of the largest software brands on the planet and is deeply embedded in operations, data centers and management environments.
At our soul, we've always held ESG-related topics closely - what we call our EPIC2 values: Execution, Passion, Integrity, Customer, Community.
With our 2030 goals, the objectives that we have are much, much greater than ourselves. The agenda is aligned around three core concepts: trust, equity and sustainability.
Q. Talk to me about trust.
A. We view our role in technology as a force for good. Not just what it is, but how it's used, and how society can embrace it and be better as a result of technology. 
Products have to be secure. They have got to be trustworthy. The COVID era has demonstrated this more than ever. Humanity relies on us. So how do we build trust into everything that we do?
Q. And what about equity?
A. It's who we hire, our diversity goals, proper representation of women, and making tech education available broadly. Can we bridge the digital divide and create a future that is more accessible and inclusive?
Q. Which of these 30 goals will be the hardest to achieve?
A. The goals where we need to influence others will be the most challenging. For example, changing our supply chain and driving some of the customer behaviors around energy efficiency.
Already, we say our products have helped to avoid 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon emissions. Now we have a goal to collaborate with our public cloud partners to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for operations by 2030. That may have the greatest amplification effect of all of our goals.
Q. Is there one goal that you really are passionate about?
A. Tech companies today are pariahs on people's personal information. Business models essentially probe deeper and deeper into our personal lives. We have a lack of good data protection capabilities and standards around the world. So this idea of trust in the cyber infrastructure is probably the one that is my deepest personal passion.
If we don't do a better job as a tech community, then the world should stop giving us responsibility for their most cherished information - financial information; the education of the children; the social networks they live on; healthcare data.
Every aspect of humanity is coming to us. We have a duty, if not a sovereign responsibility, to do a better job.
I also wrote a personal goal, many years ago, which says I want to work on a piece of technology that touches every human on the planet. 
I hold a deep and strong Christian beliefs. My job is to improve the lives of as many humans on the planet as possible. Not all days are great, but every day is a great privilege to be in a position of leadership, where I get to marshal the energies of my 33,000 passionate employees and channel them.

We're now at a point where 60% of the world's population has a persistent connection to the internet. By 2030, that number is going to be 90%. I think we truly can make the world a better place for every human and every modality of life.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Biopharmaceutical company Alkermes (NASDAQ:ALKS) responded to pressure from activist investment firm Elliott Management on Thursday with a broad plan designed to boost returns.
Alkermes committed to new profitability targets, reviewing its cost structure, considering alternatives for non-core assets and to keep refreshing its board, pledges which lifted its shares by more than 12% to $20.63.
""Alkermes is significantly undervalued given its attractive assets and growth potential, and we are confident that these new initiatives will yield meaningful share price upside,"" an Elliott spokesperson said in a statement.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month dealt Alkermes a setback when it declined to approve its treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, citing concerns related to a tablet coating process at its manufacturing site.
Industry analysts have said that ALKS 3831 is expected to generate sales of more than $600 million in 2030 and may be approved by the first half of 2021.
""The Value Enhancement Plan is intended to position the company to efficiently execute on its business strategy, support the continued growth of its commercial products, including the potential approval and launch of ALKS 3831, and further the advancement of its pipeline of development programs,"" Alkermes said in a statement.
Alkermes also said it plans to host an investor day in early 2021 to update shareholders on its activities, including its research and development portfolio.
The company said that David Daglio and Brian McKeon, who have operational and financial expertise, will join the board and that it will add at least one more independent director in the first half of next year.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Investors push back on blank-check company insiders' payout bonanza,"By Joshua Franklin and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Investors are pressuring some blank-check acquisition companies to scale back wildly lucrative payouts to their bosses that are weighing on shareholder returns, threatening to tamp down Wall Street's biggest gold rush of recent years. 
Managers of the biggest so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which raise money in initial public offerings (IPOs) to merge with privately-held companies, are awarded stock worth hundreds of millions of dollars by only investing millions of dollars of their own money.
Investors have typically acquiesced to such compensation on hopes of handsome profits. But after SPACs raised a record total of more than $70 billion this year, bigger than the last 10 years' haul combined, the intense competition for deals is beginning to erode returns and is triggering a backlash from some investors over what they say has become a ""get-super-rich-quick"" scheme for SPAC managers.
""Investors are more selective now, they are willing to push back on SPAC sponsors for more favorable terms, and sponsors are more willing to listen,"" said Evan Ratner, an Easterly Alternatives portfolio manager who has invested in SPACs for 14 years and is now raising a SPAC-focused fund.
Hedge fund veteran William Ackman's Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd, billionaire investor Daniel Och's Ajax I and former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan's Executive Network Partnering Corp are among SPACs that recently launched IPOs with less favorable terms for their managers than the industry norm.
(Graphic: Average size of SPAC IPOs, https://graphics.reuters.com/SPAC-COMPENSATION/dgkplarrmvb/chart.png) 
The managers argue they are aligned with their investors because they also take a hit when the combined company's shares drop, and are often restricted from selling their stock for one year after the deal closes. But they can still be in the black when their investors lose, because their cost to own the shares is only a small fraction of what investors pay.
""(A smaller stake in the company going to the managers) is better for the public shareholders in the SPAC because the sponsors are buying the shares at a discount. Investors would prefer to give away less of the company for a cheaper price than more of it,"" said Westchester Capital Management managing member Roy Behren, who invests in SPACs. 
The climb-down in payout expectations follows several high-profile investment flops that allowed SPAC managers to make a killing. 
Veteran dealmaker Michael Klein and his team were awarded $275 million worth of stock last month for merging their SPAC Churchill III with healthcare services firm MultiPlan Corporation in an $11-billion deal by only investing $25,000, according to SPAC Analytics. Klein's team separately invested $23 million to receive warrants, or options to purchase shares at a certain price, in the company. 
The combined company's shares are now trading at 25% less than when the deal closed amid concerns over growth prospects. Yet Klein and his team are still in the black by more than $200 million, because the shares cost him only a tiny fraction of what investors paid.
A spokesman for Klein declined to comment. 
Another prolific SPAC sponsor, Chamath Palihapitiya, is in line for a stock payout that on paper will be worth $207 million after investing $25,000 of his own money in a $3.7 billion merger with U.S. insurance startup Clover Health. He also invested $16.4 million to receive warrants in the combined company.
His SPAC's shares have lost 20% since the deal's announcement in October, as investors fretted the deal may have overvalued Clover.
A spokesman for Palihapitiya declined to comment. 
(Graphic: SPAC IPOs annually, https://graphics.reuters.com/SPAC-COMPENSATION/xegpbqzrxvq/chart.png) 
REDUCED PROMOTE
Some SPAC managers are now asking for a smaller chunk of the combined company as compensation than the customary 20% to curry favor with investors and also companies which may ultimately merge with the SPAC. Known on Wall Street as the ""promote,"" it dilutes SPAC shareholders because it leaves them with a smaller ownership of the company. It is also dilutive for the owners of the companies that negotiate mergers with SPACs, often becoming a sticking point in deal negotiations.
Och, who founded hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management in 1994, charged a 10% promote, rather than 20%, for his SPAC Ajax I, which raised $750 million in October. Executive Network Partnering Corp, a SPAC where Ryan serves as chairman, raised $360 million in September with a 5% promote, with additional shares to be paid out only based on its share price performance.
(Graphic: SPAC fundraising skyrocketed in 2020, https://graphics.reuters.com/SPAC-COMPENSATION/azgpozqozvd/chart.png) 
Ackman, the founder of activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management LP, decided not to ask for a promote. He will receive warrants that he can exercise to buy a slice of the combined company. There are warrants awarded to all SPAC managers, although Ackman will receive less than the industry norm.
""The big trend you may see in early 2021 with SPACs is lower promotes, which might make the product more attractive to a wider group of prospective target companies,"" said Alan Annex, co-chair of the global corporate practice at law firm Greenberg Traurig LLP.
To be sure, a manager's promote is subject to further negotiations with the owner of the private company involved in a SPAC merger. While many SPAC managers receive the equivalent of 20% of a SPAC after its IPO, they have been awarded on average 7.7% of the company after a merger in deals between January 2019 and June 2020, according to an analysis by Stanford Law professor Michael Klausner and New York University School of Law assistant professor Michael Ohlrogge. 
POOR PERFORMANCE
SPACs have been around since the 1990s, and even President Donald Trump considered launching one 12 years ago when he worked as a real estate developer, according to people familiar with the effort. He worked with  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) on the SPAC, dubbed Trump Acquisition Corp, but abandoned the effort when the 2008 financial crisis hit, the sources said.
The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) declined comment.
SPACs' track record used to be lackluster, confining them to the backwaters of capital markets. The 12-month stock performance for companies that have gone public through a SPAC merger since 2015 lagged both regular IPOs and the Russell 2000 Index of small-cap stocks, according to research by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc. 
The sector took off late last year, when SPACs caught the eye of blue-chip investors who bought shares in high-profile companies such as space tourism firm Virgin Galactic and fantasy sports operator DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc. The massive influx of money into SPACs led to unusually big trading gains for many of them. 
SPAC industry insiders and investment bankers now point to the overheating of the sector and pushback against managers' compensation as evidence that the hype of blank-check acquisition companies is fizzling. 

""The more that some folks change their promotes, it will put pressure on others who want to stay competitive to do the same,"" said Stephan Feldgoise, global head of mergers and acquisitions at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).

200,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Goldman escalates diversity push at portfolio companies; activists want more,"By Ross Kerber and Simon Jessop
BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS)'s asset-management arm will pressure U.S. companies to appoint more women and members of under-represented groups to their boards, an executive said, but will stop short of setting specific numerical targets for racial and ethnic diversity as some activists urge. 
While the bank is not alone on Wall Street in developing such a policy, Goldman carries outsized influence with institutional shareholders as one of the oldest and biggest Wall Street firms. The move also shows the tension between the growing importance of racial justice to investors and the difficulty of effecting social change in the corporate arena. 
After pushing companies in its investment portfolio to include at least one woman director since 2019, Goldman Sachs next year wants boards to have a second director from an under-represented background, Catherine Winner, head of stewardship efforts for the $1.8 trillion unit, said in an interview. 
For that second spot, Goldman's definition of diversity includes gender identity, sexual orientation and under-represented race and ethnic groups, and a board with two white women would meet the standard. 
Goldman Sachs itself meets the standard based on details in its proxy.
Winner said the change will lead more companies to meet investor expectations. ""Escalation draws attention,"" she said on Wednesday.
The asset-management arm can exert leverage at companies where it is an important shareholder. The firm casts proxy votes at more than 9,000 corporate annual meetings a year, and last year 25% of its votes against directors were due to a lack of a woman on the board.
Winner said Goldman stopped short of urging companies to add a racially or ethnically diverse director outright because of challenges around obtaining this information. Many companies do not disclose directors' racial and ethnic make-up, and investors are wrestling with how to judge companies' progress on diversity without such data.
Some activists want asset managers to set targets. ""You can find the data, the data is out there,"" said Roel Campos, a former member of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission who is now chair of the Latino Corporate Directors Association. 
The relative ease of knowing which candidates are female is one reason women have made faster gains in the boardroom. Among the Russell 3000, women hold 23% of board seats, up from 15% in 2016, according to researcher Equilar. 
Among top U.S. companies 8% of directors are Black and 5% are Hispanic or Latino, well below the groups' share of the U.S. population, 13% and 19% respectively. 
In an interview this week BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) stewardship chief Sandy Boss also cited a lack of data as a reason the largest asset manager will avoid a specific racial or ethnic target in its policy. Nasdaq Inc recently outlined a future listing requirement of one director who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as LGBTQ+ or a member of a racial or ethnic minority.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer for a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker charged with involvement in the looting of billions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund accused U.S. prosecutors on Thursday of withholding evidence that could show his client's innocence.
Roger Ng, the former head of investment banking for Goldman Sachs Malaysia, also pleaded not guilty in Brooklyn federal court to an amended indictment filed late Wednesday accusing him of conspiring to violate an anti-bribery law and launder money.
The plea followed Goldman's Oct. 22 agreement to pay $2.9 billion in penalties and have a Malaysian unit admit criminal wrongdoing to settle probes by the Department of Justice and other authorities into its role in 1MDB.
Ng's lawyer Marc Agnifilo said it was not until Nov. 13, or 18 months after his client agreed to leave Malaysia to face the charges, that prosecutors revealed a slew of new evidence provided by Goldman lawyers during the bank's own dealings with the government.
He accused prosecutors of waiting until Goldman ""put $2.9 billion in the government's pocket"" before disclosing materials that among other things suggested Ng may not have violated the bank's accounting procedures.
Agnifilo said it was ""a troubling issue"" that prosecutors withheld ""evidence that our client did not commit some of these crimes.""
Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith responded that ""we do not agree with the defense's characterization of these materials,"" but prosecutors would in good faith turn over potentially exculpatory evidence.
Goldman helped sell $6.5 billion of bonds for 1MDB, a fund former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak had launched to promote economic development. 
Authorities said fund officials and accomplices looted some of the money to spend on luxuries and the financing of Hollywood films, while Goldman bankers paid more than $1.6 billion in bribes to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi for 1MDB business.
Tim Leissner, another former Goldman banker, pleaded guilty in 2018 over his role in the scandal. He has not been sentenced.

The case is U.S. v. Ng, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 18-cr-00538.

""We are now forecasting product supply to catch up to demand in the second half of 2021,"" the company said in a statement. That said, the cancel rate as a percentage of sales has been lower for the past three quarters than last year, signaling the company should convert a high percentage of the demand to revenue. ""We expect that the unfilled orders will provide an $80 to $100 million positive impact to revenue growth in fiscal 2021.""
Restoration Hardware expects ""significant growth in the first half of 2021."" Demand continues to be strong, with core demand in November up 39%. Total company demand was up 38% in August, 37% in September, 24% in October, and 35% in November. December-to-date demand is  up 23%.

While Pemex has long financed a substantial portion of the budget of Latin America's second-largest economy, its debt burden is also weighing heavily on the country's sovereign rating.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Citadel's investments in commodities returned more than $1 billion this year, according to three people familiar with the matter, helping to drive strong overall performance for one of the world's largest funds.
Citadel, led by Chicago billionaire Ken Griffin, benefited from gains across the commodities business in oil, power, natural gas and agriculture markets this year, the people said. 
Citadel's flagship Wellington fund, which practices a multi-strategy array of investments on stocks, bonds, commodities and other securities using teams of traders, is up by 21.2% this year through November, putting it on track to have its best year since 2012, one person familiar with the matter said.
All five of the fund's core investment strategies have positive returns for the year, the person added.
A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.
Energy markets swung wildly this year as the coronavirus pandemic crushed global fuel demand and created distortions, allowing trading opportunities for hedge funds, oil majors and commodities merchants. 
The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index - which tracks the performance of the global hedge fund industry - gained 6.2% in November, the strongest monthly gain since December 1999, and is up 7.3% year-to-date.
Multi-strategy hedge funds - those that bet on a broad array of markets using teams of traders, leverage and centralized risk management - in particular have flourished this year. 
Citadel, which had about $35 billion in assets under management as of Oct. 1, recently hired a former Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) energy derivatives trader to head its first commodities trading team in Asia, and recruited former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) commodities trading chief Jay Rubenstein.
The fund also hired Eike Schick, former head of the European natural gas desk at Freepoint Commodities, as a portfolio manager in London, and Mark Tawney, who ran Munich Re Trading, joined the company to lead a weather derivatives team earlier this year.

Investing.com -- Starbuck expects ""outsized growth"" for the coming years. 
Shares of the coffee purveyor rose 4.4% after it said in a presentation that fiscal 2022 and 2023 are looking promising, while fiscal 2021 will be a recovery year.

Earnings per share for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 are expected to grow between 10% and 12%, according to a presentation by Chief Financial Officer Patrick Grismer.
The stock is trading at a record, despite recording lower revenue for the past three quarters compared to the same periods a year earlier. The company had reported record quarterly earnings for the end of 2019.
""Looking ahead, coffee remains a very large and attractive market that is growing globally,"" said Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson in a statement. ""We are focused on growing category share and believe Starbucks is better positioned than ever for continued success.”

The Church Commissioners, who manage the Church of England's investment fund, said they were ""pleased to lend their support"" to proposals from new hedge fund Engine No 1 designed to ""re-energise ExxonMobil"".
Exxon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment.
Engine No. 1, launched 10 days ago, sent a letter to Exxon this week outlining its plan to nominate four directors to the company's board and asking the company to cut more costs to preserve its dividend.
Investors have been unsuccessfully pressing Exxon on climate change for years now, and the Church of England, New York state's pension fund and Legal & General Investment Management backed a call this year to split the CEO and chairman roles at the company.
That proposal received 32.7% votes in May, down from 41% last year.
This year, however, the pressure on Exxon has risen exponentially as the COVID-19 pandemic destroyed fuel demand and sent oil prices to record lows.

On Wednesday, Reuters reported hedge fund D.E. Shaw was also pressuring Exxon to make changes and sent the company a letter this week asking it to cut costs and improve performance.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair to resign early next year,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Heath Tarbert will resign as chair of the U.S. derivatives market regulator early next year when Democratic President-elect Joe Biden designates an acting agency head, ensuring a ""smooth transition,"" he told Reuters in an exclusive interview. 
A former corporate attorney and senior Treasury Department official, Tarbert was nominated by President Donald Trump to be both chair and one of five commissioners at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), taking office in July 2019.
Commissioners are political appointees, with a maximum of three from the same party allowed at any time. The chair serves at the president's discretion, but commissioners are independent. 
Tarbert, a Republican, said he wants to return to the private sector. While he will resign as chair, he expects to stay on as a commissioner after Biden takes office on Jan. 20 while he finalizes his plans.
""It's important to have a smooth handover and a smooth transition,"" said Tarbert. ""It's obviously been a tremendous adventure and - I think - successful time in government ... but I would like to return to the private sector in some relevant leadership role,"" he said.
Tarbert, 44, did not speculate on his replacement. Washington analysts say Democratic commissioners Rostin Behnam and Dan Berkovitz are the front-runners, and would likely take a tougher stance on the industry.
During his tenure at the CFTC, which began policing the over-the-counter derivatives or ""swaps"" market after it nearly toppled the financial system in 2008, Tarbert has led an unusually active rule-making agenda, said lawyers.
The agency has finalized 40 rules and proposed 21 more, according to data provided by the agency, while juggling practical and regulatory challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Heath is a talented negotiator. During his time at Treasury as well as at the CFTC, he has been effective in enacting critical policies,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters in a statement. 
Several of the completed rules stemmed from the 2008 financial crisis, including big, contentious changes such as limits on speculative physical commodities positions and capital requirements for non-bank swap dealers. 
Some have been criticized by consumer advocates and Democrats for being too weak, while lawyers say others were rushed, resulting in problematic holes and snags.
""There's always a tension between getting stuff done, getting it done in a timely fashion, and getting it absolutely perfect,"" said Tarbert. 
Generally speaking, however, Tarbert has avoided the partisan scrapping and pro-industry accusations that have dogged other Trump regulators, with 87% of his votes passing on a bipartisan basis, according to agency data. 
""He did everything he could to bring consensus to the agency, but sometimes it's impossible,"" said Sheila Bair, the former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who has worked closely with Tarbert. 
Tarbert's enforcement record has also surprised lawyers. In 2020, the agency imposed $1.33 billion in penalties, the third year-on-year increase, with a record 113 actions. 
Notable cases include a landmark $920 million market manipulation settlement with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) , and the agency's first corruption-based fraud action against Houston-based Vitol Inc. [L1N2IJ2B1] [L4N2GQ3S0]

""I think that busts the myth that Republicans are soft on Wall Street,"" said Tarbert. Institutions should be treated ""like adults"" with reasonable regulation and supervision, he said. ""There is no flexibility when people wantonly break the rules.""

213,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 09:44AM ET</span>",Wall Street Falls at Open as Jobless Claims Rise Unsettles Market; Dow Down 60 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened weakly on Thursday after a sharp rise in initial jobless claims spooked investors who have become more used to a positive narrative about vaccine development and distribution, overlooking the short-term impacts of the pandemic on the economy.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 57 points, or 0.2%, at 30,011 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both down 0.3%. 
The Labor Department said earlier that the number of initial jobless claims spiked to 853,000 last week, the highest in nearly three months, a fresh sign of the slowdown hitting the economy as more and more restrictions are placed on business and social life to stop runaway numbers of coronavirus cases. The U.S. notched 3,000 deaths in a single day from Covid-19 for the first time on Wednesday.
The rise in claims is an uncomfortable reminder of Congress's failure to agree a stimulus package to support the economy, despite clear signs for over a month that the pandemic has been gaining in strength, forcing fresh public health measures that inevitably weigh on the economy.
All eyes were focused on the two stocks that have enjoyed blowout IPOs this week. Doordash (NYSE:DASH) stock fell as much as 7.6% at the opening but recovered later to be only 6.4% down, which still leaves it up 80% from its IPO price after a spectacular debut on Wednesday. 
AirBnB stock is due to start trading, having been priced late Wednesday at $68 a share, valuing the rental startup at $47 billion. Some attributed the weakness of the rest of the Nasdaq on Wednesday to investors having to free up space for the two stocks in their portfolios for the two newbies.
Elsewhere, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock continued to struggle, the social media giant losing another 0.7% after the announcement of the latest Department of Justice lawsuit against it alleging a years-long abuse of its market power. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), whose Google search business is also increasingly attracting the attention of antitrust regulators, fell 1.3%. 
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock rose 1.2% after its new graphics card received a hot response from gaming enthusiasts on Wednesday, selling out within a day. 
There was little reaction from news further afield that the European Central Bank had increased the size of its key bond-buying program to stop the pandemic causing a double-dip recession in the euro zone. The ECB will buy up to 500 billion euros ($600 billion) more in bonds, also extending the timeline for purchases by nine months, keeping the program alive through March 2022."
214,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>",Uber asks U.S. states to prioritize its drivers for COVID-19 vaccine,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Thursday sent letters to the governors of all U.S. states, asking for its ride-hail and food delivery drivers to get early access to COVID-19 vaccines as essential workers.
The company also said it will send a letter to U.S. President-elect Joe Biden.
The letters come less than a week after Uber sent a similar letter to a committee of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, in a letter seen by Reuters, urged Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to classify Uber's workers as essential, entitled to vaccines immediately after healthcare professionals and long-term care facility residents.
""Over the last nine months, these workers have been a lifeline to their communities. They have transported healthcare workers to hospitals, delivered food to people socially distancing at home, and helped local restaurants stay in business,"" the letter said. 
Khosrowshahi also said Uber's app could offer vaccination information to Americans.
With initial vaccine doses limited and strong federal guidance lacking, it has fallen to U.S. states to determine who will be first in line to be vaccinated. More than 20 large industries have urged public officials to prioritize their workers.
Uber said its U.S. drivers who have done at least three trips since the pandemic began in March stood at over 1.5 million.
Florida, where Uber has the most pandemic drivers at around 236,000, expects to receive vaccine doses for 500,000 to 1 million residents this month. The state has more than 1 million licensed healthcare professionals and some 146,000 long-term-care residents, according to state health department data.
U.S. officials have said if vaccines get approved quickly they will distribute enough doses to inoculate 20 million people by the end of the year, roughly covering all U.S. healthcare workers. Doses for some 100 million people are expected by the end of February.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Thursday it had committed to a multimillion-dollar investment in a project to remove carbon dioxide from the air through air direct-capture technology as part of a plan to be 100% ""green"" by 2050.
The project, iPointFive, is a partnership between Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) subsidiary Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Rusheen Capital Management that plans to build the first U.S. industrial-sized direct air capture plant that would permanently sequester 1 million tons of CO2 each year.
That's the equivalent of what 40 million trees can do, but covering a land area about 3,000 times smaller, United said, adding that direct-capture technology is one of the few proven ways to correct for aircraft emissions.
United declined to provide further details on the investment amount.
Speaking to reporters about the project, United CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said carbon capture and sequestration is the only scalable technology that removes carbon from the atmosphere and buries it in the ground. 
""Sequestration is a real and permanent solution,"" Kirby said.
Until now, the airline industry has focused primarily on the purchase of carbon offsets to reduce the environmental impact of flying.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global air travel earlier this year, carbon reduction was expected to be a top priority for airlines, particularly in Europe, where a flight-shaming movement has gained momentum.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has forced airlines to focus heavily on their daily survival rather than on longer-term environmental goals, Kirby said climate change could alter behaviors in even more dramatic ways than the pandemic.
""The longer we wait, the more drastic those changes will have to be,"" he said.
Aside from the carbon-capture program, United is also investing in sustainable aviation fuel, which has up to 80% less carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel.

Most of an airline's contribution to climate change comes from the fuel it takes to fly.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",Cannabis review site Weedmaps agrees $1.5 billion deal to go public,"By Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - WM Holding Company, a cannabis technology company which operates the online U.S. platform Weedmaps where users find and rate marijuana sellers, said on Thursday it has agreed to go public through a merger with Silver Spike Acquisition Corp. 
The deal to take Weedmaps public, which values the company at around $1.5 billion, is a rare example of a business focused on the cannabis sector listing on a U.S. stock exchange. 
Companies are unable to list shares in the United States if their business involves selling marijuana or is ""plant touching,"" which Weedmaps is not. 
""When you look at what we're offering (to investors), there's really not too much else like it,"" WMH Chief Executive Chris Beals said in an interview. 
Irvine, California-based Weedmaps was founded in 2008 by Doug Francis and Justin Hartfield, and sells a cloud-based operating system for cannabis retailers as well as hosting a review and ratings platform for sellers.
Weedmaps expects to receive gross proceeds of up to $575 million from the deal, in part from proceeds Silver Spike had raised and also through $325 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, transaction. Investors in the PIPE include funds from the Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) Kaufmann Funds, Senvest Management LLC and AFV Partners 
Silver Spike shares were indicated up 8.8% at $11.41 in premarket trading. Reuters first reported news of the deal on Wednesday.
The merger agreement comes less than a week after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level, the first time either chamber of Congress has voted to end the federal ban on marijuana since the drug was listed as a ""controlled substance"" in 1970. 
The legislation is not expected to advance further as long as the Senate remains in Republican hands. Nevertheless, 15 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use of marijuana, and over 30 states allow some form of the drug for medicinal purposes. 
Weedmaps is on track to deliver $160 million in revenue and has been profitable for its entire 12-year history, Beals said. 
Silver Spike is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which raise funds in an initial public offering (IPO) with the aim of buying a private company. The acquired company then becomes public as a result of the merger and is an alternative to the traditional IPO process.
SPACs have emerged as an increasingly popular route to the stock market for private companies given that they can be completed more quickly than an IPO and there is greater certainty over the funds a company will raise.
Silver Spike, led by cannabis industry executive Scott Gordon, raised $250 million in an August, 2019 IPO on Nasdaq with a focus on buying a company in the cannabis sector.

""There was no better opportunity and no more dynamic company and story for us to consider a transaction with than with WMH,"" Gordon said in an interview.

Seznam said Google abused its dominant position on the Czech market with licensed operating systems and application stores for smart devices equipped with Android operating system.
""Based on the European Commission’s decision back in 2018 which confirmed that Google was in breach with EU antitrust rules, we claim the compensation of damage that we have suffered while trying to distribute our applications and services via mobile devices with Android operation system,"" Seznam deputy chairman Pavel Zima said.
Google could not be immediately reached for comment.
Seznam, with an estimated 25% Czech market share, said the size of the claim was based on the period between 2011 and 2018. The claim was sent in the past few days with a 30-day deadline, Seznam said, adding it was prepared to take civil legal action.
Seznam earned revenue of 4.69 billion crowns in 2019 and cumulative revenue of 32 billion crowns since 2011, it said.
Reuters reported in November a group of 165 companies and industry bodies have called on EU antitrust enforcers to take a tougher line against Google.
Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), has rejected assertions that it unfairly favours its own services. It says that its users are not locked in and that competition to its services is just one click away on the internet.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen drifting at the open Thursday, after lawmakers bought themselves more time to negotiate a new coronavirus relief package. 
At 06:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), the Dow futures contract rose 42 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 17 points, or 0.1%. 
The House of Representatives passed a one-week government funding extension late Wednesday. This allows the federal government to keep running until the end of next week, and thus buys Congress more time to try and come up with a compromise that would result in a new stimulus deal to help the Covid-battered economy.
U.S. lawmakers have been debating for months about the size and scope of a broader spending package, and confidence has been rising that some form of a compromise can be made. So far the two sides have been unable to sort out disagreements over aid to state and local governments.
More than 3,000 Covid-19-related deaths were recorded in the United States on Wednesday, for the first time, with almost 223,000 cases recorded, also a daily record.
On a more positive note, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to grant emergency use authorization for the Pfixer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine later Thursday, starting the likely months-long program to vaccinate the U.S. population. 
Over in Europe, the European Central Bank is expected to provide fresh monetary stimulus at its council meeting, with the announcement due at 7:45 AM ET (1245 GMT).
In the corporate sector, the IPO market will remain in the spotlight as Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) starts trading after its flotation. The home-sharing site said late on Wednesday it sold shares at $68 a piece, above its targeted price range, to raise around $3.5 billion.
Doordash (NYSE:DASH) had a stellar debut on Wednesday, as the food delivery company’s stock surged to $182, 80% above its IPO price.
There’s an abundance of economic data due for release Thursday, with, in particular, inflation figures and jobless claims expected at 08:30 AM ET and a monthly budget statement at 2 PM ET.
Oil prices rose Thursday, despite a larger-than-expected build in U.S. crude stocks, on increased confidence a fairly prompt rollout of Covid-19 vaccines will spur a rebound in demand next year.
Crude Oil WTI Futures traded 1.3% higher at $46.14 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.5% to $49.47. Both benchmarks have fallen this week, after previously posting five consecutive weeks of gains, but remain near nine-month highs. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,839.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2088.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",Canadian border official set to wrap up testimony in Huawei CFO U.S. extradition case,"By Sarah Berman
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Canadian border official who recounted the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's ""persistent"" requests for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's travel history after her arrest two years ago is expected to finish testifying on Thursday.
The final week of witness cross examination, which is part of Meng's U.S. extradition case, comes in the wake of news last week that U.S. prosecutors were discussing a deal with lawyers for Meng to resolve criminal charges against her, signaling a potential end to a case that has strained ties between the United States, China and Canada.
Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on a U.S. warrant for bank fraud at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018. She is accused of misrepresenting Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s dealings with Iran, putting one of its lenders, HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC), at risk of violating United States trade sanctions.
Meng, 48, has denied the charges and mounted a defense, asking that her extradition be thrown out because of abuses of process.
Her lawyers have argued that U.S. and Canadian authorities coordinated ahead of her arrest, using the extended investigative powers of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to interrogate her without a lawyer present. They further allege that private information collected by the CBSA was inappropriately shared with the FBI.
Prosecutors say the investigation and arrest followed standard procedures and the extradition should move forward.
CBSA Chief Nicole Goodman, who oversaw a staff of 250 at Vancouver’s airport when Meng was arrested, testified Wednesday that she had advised the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) not to use passcodes to Meng's electronic devices collected by CBSA.
Goodman told the police officer responsible for handling exhibits in Meng's case that the passcodes had been given in error, she testified. Sharing passcodes of Meng's electronic devices has become a flashpoint in the case, with her lawyers saying that it amounts to violation of her civil rights.
Relations between China and Canada have been strained since Meng's arrest. China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig soon after Meng's arrest and charged them for espionage. 
On Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Minister Francois Champagne called the Canadian men ""incredible examples of perseverance and determination.""

226,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Newsmax plans expansion to capitalize on Trump support, anger at Fox News","By Lisa Richwine and Helen Coster
LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Newsmax, a conservative cable news channel promoted by President Donald Trump, plans to expand in the United States and Britain, Chief Executive Chris Ruddy told Reuters.
The network plans to hire more staff in the United States and London, debut a new primetime host and add more weekend programming to capitalize on post-election gains and some viewers' discontent with Rupert Murdoch's longtime ratings king Fox News.
Aided by shout-outs from Trump on Twitter, Newsmax's weekly primetime viewership has jumped 68% since the U.S. presidential election as the channel refused to declare Joe Biden the winner and aired debunked theories about voter fraud. 
Early evening host Greg Kelly on Monday averaged 229,000 viewers ages 25 to 54, the group most coveted by cable news advertisers, for the first time beating Fox's Martha MacCallum, who brought in 203,000 viewers in that age range at that hour.
MacCallum, however, won in overall viewers, and reclaimed her lead in both categories on Tuesday, suggesting the Newsmax gains may be fragile. Some key audience metrics have slipped from Newsmax's post-election peaks. Primetime viewership for the week that ended Dec. 4 was down 21% from two weeks earlier, averaging 391,000 viewers, while its total day audience fell 19%.
Fox News, which also has declined from election-week highs, still averaged 2.9 million primetime viewers that week, a sign of its strength after almost 19 years as the most-watched cable news channel.
The network had its highest-rated November in history, drawing 3.9 million primetime viewers, beating all cable networks, not just cable news. Primetime host Tucker Carlson averaged 5 million viewers for a second straight month, a record for cable television.
Ruddy noted that, despite some dips, Newsmax is hovering high above pre-election levels.
He sees the 40 million viewers not on cable as the next battleground for growth. In addition to cable news, the network streams for free on platforms including YouTube and a Newsmax app, which Ruddy said roughly doubles the nighttime audience. 
""People are really tired of Fox News,"" Ruddy said in a recent interview. ""There is a perception that they really tried to torpedo the president."" 
Fox News declined to comment.
Trump has complained about its coverage of his presidency. The network further irked the president and some viewers on election night with a projection that Biden had won Arizona -- nine days before most major news organizations confirmed that win. 
""Newsmax, I think, has been gaining ground against Fox News because it's been able to convince some fraction of Fox's audience that it is more loyal to the president than Fox is,"" said Matt Gertz, a senior fellow at liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America. 
One of Newsmax's latest displays of Trump loyalty sparked a lawsuit. Former U.S. cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs sued Trump lawyer Joseph diGenova, Newsmax and the Trump campaign after diGenova said Krebs should be ""taken out at dawn and shot"" after Krebs disputed Trump's claims of election fraud. 
Newsmax said that while diGenova made ""inappropriate"" comments, Krebs’ lawsuit threatened free speech. 
""HIRING SPLURGE""
It is unclear whether Newsmax's surge is sustainable over a longer term after Trump leaves office. 
Available in roughly 70 million cable TV homes, Newsmax is on a ""hiring splurge,"" Ruddy said. The network has added 25 employees since the election to bring its total workforce to 275. It plans to hire 30 more over the next three months, including one in London and another in Los Angeles. 
Newsmax, which is based in Florida, also plans to hire staff for a bureau in the state, home to both Trump and his Mar-a-Lago resort. Most of Newsmax's current 165 television staff are based in New York. Fox News has hundreds of journalists based in 10 U.S. bureaus and three international bureaus.
This month, Newsmax will launch a 10 p.m. ET (0300 GMT) program hosted by Rob Schmitt, a former early morning Fox News host. 
Ruddy said he is currently considering various offers to invest in the channel but shot down media reports that the network was for sale. 
Trump, meanwhile, is debating where to take his megaphone after he leaves office on Jan. 20. The president is considering starting a TV channel or social media company, according to several advisers.
A longtime friend of Trump's, Ruddy said he does not want to turn Newsmax into Trump TV, though he said he has told the president he would welcome him as a regular contributor or show host. 
BATTLING FOX
Fox's more recent challengers on the right remain independent networks like Newsmax and One America News Network (OAN), rather than major media conglomerates, because large players view the conservative media business as too risky, said Christopher Balfe, partner at media firm Red Seat Ventures, which advises on new media startups.
""None of (the independents) have deep enough pockets from a resource perspective to be truly competitive,"" Balfe said. 
Fox spent $1 billion before Fox News became profitable, Fox Corp Chief Financial Officer Steve Tomsic said this week. 

""It’s not a small undertaking to try to compete at that level,"" Tomsic said at a UBS conference. ""When people think about competition, their knee-jerk reaction is to think 'Well, all we need is two or three talking heads to go head to head with ours.' The business is much bigger than that.""

227,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",Manufacturers hunt for deals amid pandemic wreckage,"By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has been a disaster for many U.S. manufacturers, but it is also creating acquisition opportunities.
Cary Wood, chief executive of Grede Holdings LLC, saw business plunge 90% earlier this year as the auto plants and heavy equipment producers that use his metal parts shut down, followed by a bumpy recovery. But he's upbeat these days and, in the last two months, he's opened negotiations aimed at acquiring seven smaller foundries.
""I can wait out the cycle,"" Wood said, ""but many of these guys can't.""
Grede, carved out of publicly traded American Axle (NYSE:AXL) & Manufacturing Holdings Inc last year, is backed by a private equity firm and was already hunting for acquisitions before the crisis hit. But Wood said the rate of deal talks is far higher than a year ago, when he was running the foundry company that merged with Grede as part of the buyout. And it is similar to a wave of restructuring he saw just after the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
A similar story is playing out across the U.S. economy. 
A recent survey of leaders of companies with over $250 million in sales found 65% of manufacturers said they planned to make acquisitions in response to economic conditions created by the pandemic. Other sectors show a similar push for acquisitions, though not to the same degree. Only 36% of consumer goods companies said they were looking for acquisitions, while 41% of health care companies said they were on the hunt.
""The first impact of COVID on manufacturers was to make them defensive - they all sought to conserve capital and find ways to continue operations,"" said Scott Fuzer, a mergers and acquisitions expert at West Monroe, the business consulting firm that conducted the survey. ""But now,"" he said, the stronger companies ""are going on the offensive.""
Fuzer said many smaller manufacturers are ""just holding on - especially family businesses - where the family is already on the edge of wanting to get out of the business.""
U.S. merger activity jumped nearly 36% in the third quarter, according to data compiled by Refinitiv, to 3,296 deals, after a slump during the early months of the pandemic. Many of the biggest deals have been in the technology sector, but old-line industrials are in the game, too.
 Ingersoll Rand  (NYSE:IR) Inc, for instance, announced a $184 million deal this week to buy a vacuum pump and blower systems maker. And United States Steel (NYSE:X) Corp plans to take full ownership of Big River Steel for $774 million.
MOTIVATORS: SUPPLY CHAINS, TAXES, 'BUYER'S MARKET'
One reason U.S. manufacturers are active is the fragmented nature of their supply chains. While the sector is dominated by large producers, smaller companies often continue to supply the parts those factories use to build finished goods.
The foundry industry is a good example of this. In 1980, there were 4,800 U.S. foundries and, even after waves of shutdowns and consolidations, just under 2,000 remain, the bulk of them small outfits often with just one operation serving a few targeted industries. 
With an uneven recovery, many are struggling to survive. The lucky ones are in sectors that have snapped back quicker than others. The auto sector, particularly truck producers, have thrived, for instance, while many industrial equipment and off-road machinery companies remain depressed.
Grede, based in Southfield, Michigan, was formed in December 2019, when Gamut Capital Management bought nine foundries and two related processing plants from American Axle for $245 million. Owning that many foundries makes Grede one of the industry's larger players. Even before the pandemic, it was planning to grow through acquisitions. The crisis accelerated that process, Wood said.
Last month's presidential election is also a factor for some companies, he said, noting that one of the companies he's talking to is family owned and is concerned about potential tax changes under Democrat Joe Biden's incoming administration.
""There's some concern about what a wealth tax might mean for private owners,"" he said.
The economic downturn also means some companies can be bought at lower prices. 
Austin Ramirez, chief executive of Husco International Inc, said he's looking ""at a couple of small to medium-sized acquisitions"" that would help his business - which makes parts for cars and off-road machinery - expand into new product lines. Ramirez said the crisis has helped ""compress"" prices.
""We would have looked at these things anyway,"" he said, ""but it's more of a buyer's market.""
That said, it still isn't easy to make deals. ""There's an awful lot of capital out there - both from strategic acquirers like us, and financial buyers,"" said Ramirez.
And some manufacturing sectors have thrived during the pandemic, which means valuations remain high in those businesses. 

Sanjay Singh, executive chairman of Mace Security International Inc, the makers of the well-known pepper spray, said his business has surged ""because of COVID and the social climate - people are looking for safety."" That means valuations are up, he said, but he's still looking for opportunities to expand now.

228,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 05:53AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Mission Creep at the ECB,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The European Central Bank is to extend its emergency bond-buying program at its governing council meeting Thursday.
Economists expect that the 1.35 trillion euro ‘envelope’ for the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program will be expanded by 500 billion euros, and that the central bank will stretch out the horizon for purchases under the program by six months or even 12. Recent practice suggests the ECB will add language opening the door to further extensions, too.
Some people will take that as a positive - especially if they own Eurozone government bonds (basically, Eurozone banks and insurers). Expectations that the ECB’s already massive presence in that market will get even more suffocating has pushed the yields on Portuguese debt below zero for the first time this week, while Spain’s are hovering around zero. Both countries, of course, nearly left the euro zone nine years ago due to crippling debt problems. 
However, it is hard to see what is positive about yet another incident in which an emergency measure that was meant to be temporary morphs gradually into another permanent fixture of policy. Especially when the result is to show beyond any reasonable doubt that the natural, risk-free rate of return on capital in Europe is now negative. 
The ECB likes to focus on the signals it wants to send. It likes to show that it is not ‘out of ammunition’, that it is capable of influencing outcomes.  However, its toolkit is simply not appropriate for the current situation.
“Talk of trying to stimulate an economy when governments are trying to slow economic activity for public health reasons, is not particularly helpful,” Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a morning podcast. “We’re not facing a credit crisis. Instead, governments have taken money from businesses and consumers through lockdowns and structural changes are putting parts of the economy into a terminal decline.”
Certainly, the ECB still has a role in keeping financial markets orderly – and it’s undeniably true that the PEPP did just that during the spring panic. But what it is doing now is nothing like that, whatever its top management thinks. In an interview with Bloomberg last week, board member Isabel Schnabel described bond markets as “calm”. With all due respect to Frau Schnabel, they are not ‘calm’, they are fundamentally distorted by a central bank that will own nearly half of Eurozone government debt by the time it stops the PEPP.
When it finally gets to that stage, the bank will still doubtless be claiming that it hasn’t violated the principle of monetary financing, even though today’s measures are explicitly tailored to funding a second year of sky-high budget deficits. Heaven forbid that the market should decide the real price of Portuguese or Spanish sovereign risk in today’s circumstances. Or, for that matter, last year’s. Or next year’s. Or the year after that.
The ECB has already killed price discovery for sovereign risk. It is only a small step away from doing the same in private credit risk, flirting with schemes that will punish some activities and reward others under the guise of an initiative to mitigate climate change – as if that can somehow compensate for the growth in emerging market oil demand or the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.
Today’s decisions are all part of the same pattern. Unable to admit the limits of what a central bank can or should do, the ECB is succumbing to mission creep – trying to solve crises it can’t solve, fearful of losing the extraordinary privilege of political independence if it is perceived to be doing too little.
It’s only fair to say that the bank’s officials have the best intentions and have said for years that they can’t be expected to do things that governments should be doing. Even so, the glaring contradictions in its policy are getting ever harder to ignore. It can’t and won't end well. The only consolation is that the ultimate reckoning can still be pushed out beyond most investors' relevant time horizons."

The numbers suggest that handset demand in China remains weak despite the country's fast recovery from the coronavirus crisis, and that manufacturers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its rivals will have to fight harder for a smaller pool of customers.
Phone makers shipped 27 million handsets to domestic customers in October compared with 33 million a year earlier, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a state-backed think-tank.
That follows a 27% year-on-year decline in October and a 36% decline in September.
Data from third-party research firms showed that Apple and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd saw shipments decline in the third quarter on-year, even though both companies released new flagship handsets in October.
Analysts remain bullish about sales of both devices in the short term, despite the broader market slump.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - S&P Dow Jones Indices on Thursday became the second major index provider to remove some Chinese companies from its index products following a Trump administration executive order, in the latest market disruption from persistent Sino-U.S. tensions.
Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order, unveiled in November, is designed to deter U.S. investment firms, pension funds and others from buying shares of Chinese companies designated by the U.S. Defense Department as backed by the Chinese military.
S&P DJI said it would remove mainland-listed A-shares, Hong Kong-listed H-shares and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of 10 companies including Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) from all equity indexes prior to the market open on Dec. 21.
The company said it will also remove securities issued by 18 Chinese companies from its fixed income indices before Jan. 1.
""The order ... may impact the ability of market participants to replicate S&P DJI Equity and Fixed Income Indices containing securities affected by the order,"" S&P DJI said in a statement.
A spokeswoman for Hikvision called the order's decision to pursue the firm ""groundless.""
""We strongly protested when Hikvision was included on this list in June because, as we have shown time and again, Hikvision is not a 'Chinese military company',"" she said.
SMIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
FTSE Russell said last week that it would remove eight Chinese firms from its products to comply with the U.S. executive order, which bars U.S. investors from buying securities of blacklisted firms starting in November 2021.
The index providers' moves to comply with the U.S order effectively shut passive investors out of the stocks and bonds affected and could challenge investors' assumptions that a Joe Biden administration will mean a warmer relationship with China.
""It's significant and even more importantly it's not necessarily going to be unwound by the Biden administration,"" said Kay Van Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore.
""There are more ripples from it and it raises possible questions: What about  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which is listed in the U.S. ... What if it was the other way around? How would people like those apples? And no-one's talking about that yet.""
President-elect Biden has said he will not immediately cancel existing tariffs set by the Trump administration against China, and legislation taking a hard line on Chinese business and trade practices tends to have broad bipartisan support in Washington.
Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a law to kick Chinese companies off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not fully comply with the country's auditing rules.
Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Kokusai Asset Management in Tokyo, said that funds following the S&P indices ""will have to sell"". 
""This goes beyond the routine annual changes to names on the index,"" said Ishigane.
""Once the passive funds start selling, the active funds will be inclined to do the same.""
China is firmly opposed to the removal of Chinese firms from indexes due to the U.S. executive order, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.
""This is yet another example of how the United States uses the power of the state to oppress Chinese companies,"" she told a daily briefing on Thursday.
""We believe these endless lies and this suppression of Chinese firms will eventually work against U.S. interests,"" she said.
Hikvision shares in Shenzhen shrugged off the index announcement to close 2.95% higher on Thursday. SMIC's Shanghai shares closed up 1.08% and its Hong Kong shares ended flat on the day.
""Although foreign ownership in A-shares is rising, it remains relatively small, accounting for 4-5% in total,"" said Max Luo, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management in Shanghai. 

""We're watching these developments closely, but we don't think these events will trigger major concern or panic in Chinese markets.""

European capitals have been jostling to attract business from London in the wake of the Brexit referendum, especially among banks, asset managers and other financial services firms. 
Paris Europlace said the jobs came from teams relocating to France or investment decisions favouring the country and linked to Brexit. It listed JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Japan's Nomura among those that had shifted teams, but also French banks BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which have big operations in Britain. 
Overall, and including companies outside finance and in sectors such as healthcare or carmakers, Paris Europlace estimated the Brexit boost for French jobs at 9,516. 
Estimates of lost business for Britain vary. Consultants EY said in October that more than 7,500 finance jobs, as well as a trillion pounds in assets, had already left for the EU.

The number of jobs is still a fraction of those based in London, however, and far fewer have moved so far compared to initial estimates just after the Brexit vote, with some forecasting tens of thousands would cross the English Channel.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday, with investors looking for more stimulus from a key ECB meeting while Brexit trade talks continue.
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index outperformed, climbing 0.6%. 
Talks between U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen late Wednesday ended without a breakthrough, confirming very large gaps remain over issues from fisheries to dispute resolution.
The two sides gave themselves until the end of the weekend to seal a new trade pact, with around $1 trillion in annual trade at risk of facing tariffs and quotas if a deal cannot be reached before transition arrangements end on December 31.
While the lack of agreement may have disappointed some investors, eyes have quickly turned towards the latest European Central Bank policy-setting meeting later Thursday. The central bank is widely expected to increase and extend its pandemic bond-buying program.
“The reasons for new ECB action are clear: with the second lockdowns the September projections have become outdated and too optimistic,” said ING analyst Carsten Brzeski, in a research note. “Back then, the ECB had penciled in 3.1% QoQ growth in the fourth quarter. This number will have to be revised downwards significantly.”
Data from the (non-Eurozone) U.K. earlier Thursday illustrated this slowdown, with monthly GDP growth of 0.4% for October, a drop from the 1.1% growth seen the previous month.
In corporate news, Tui stock dropped 3.7% after the world's biggest holiday company posted a loss of 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) for the financial year. 
In the U.K., Ocado (LON:OCDO) stock dropped 3% despite the online supermarket raising its full-year guidance again after a strong quarter through the end of November. The stock is up over 76% year-to-date.
On the flip side, Frasers stock soared 8.9% after the retailer, formerly known as  Sports Direct  (LON:FRAS), posted a strong jump in quarterly profit, helped by growth in its online sales.
Oil prices rose Thursday, despite a larger-than-expected build in U.S. crude stocks, on increased confidence a fairly prompt rollout of Covid-19 vaccines will spur a rebound in demand next year.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $45.67 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $48.98. Both benchmarks have fallen this week, after previously posting five consecutive weeks of gains, but remain near nine-month highs. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,839.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2088.

NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp shares surged 11% after the investment conglomerate scored a $11.2 billion gain in the value of its stake in DoorDash Inc following the U.S. food delivery app's blockbuster stock market debut. 
SoftBank, which invested $680 million in DoorDash in the last three years, saw the value of its 25% stake in the company rise to $11.9 billion on the first day of trading in New York. 
SoftBank's shares climbed as much as 19% in Tokyo trading and closed at new two-decade highs at 8,306 yen. 
DoorDash shares ended trading up 87.5% following their debut on Wednesday, valuing the company at $68.4 billion, more than four times its valuation in a private fundraising round six months ago.
SoftBank's DoorDash gains are a boon to Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's efforts to revive its $100 billion Vision Fund, which recorded a string of losses in the past year on soured bets ranging from office space-sharing start-up WeWork to dog-walking startup Wag. 
The group's growing market capitalisation, which neared $170 billion on Thursday, raises the costs of management buyout proposals, which have been debated internally but face considerable opposition.
Last month, SoftBank said its Vision Fund was now worth about $76.4 billion, slightly more than the $75 billion paid for its 83 investments, following the rebound in public markets from a coronavirus-induced downturn earlier this year. It has also booked other gains such as $4.5 billion from exited investments. 
SoftBank has been investing on a smaller scale with its Vision Fund 2 as it looks to win the trust of backers of the first fund, like Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, and demonstrate the strength of its investment thesis. 
SoftBank's recent wins include a rally in the shares of ride-hailing app Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, where it is a top shareholder, and the sale of chip designer Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp for $40 billion. 
Uber said this week it was selling its struggling self-driving car and air taxi businesses, raising questions over whether SoftBank has backed a likely winner in the shift to autonomous driving. 
Vision Fund had invested in DoorDash over four fundraising rounds. It paid $280 million for its first DoorDash stake in March 2018, before buying more shares over two rounds in the following year for about $350 million. The fund made its last DoorDash investment worth about $50 million in June 2020, according to regulatory filings.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial markets will be disrupted in January unless the European Union allows the bloc's investors to use derivatives trading platforms in London, a group of seven financial industry bodies have said.
Britain has left the EU and transition arrangements giving continued full access end on Dec. 31.
Brussels has so far not granted ""equivalence"" or permission for platforms in London, the world's major centre for derivatives trading, to continue serving banks and companies in the bloc from January 1.
The industry bodies told the EU's financial services chief Mairead McGuinness in a letter dated Dec. 9 that without access, EU financial services firms would end up having to use platforms in the United States, which already have EU permission. 
""In the absence of action from policymakers, there will be disruption in the market as of 1 January, as not all clients across the industry will be ready to put in place alternative solutions on that date, despite best efforts,"" their letter said.
Market participants in the EU ""at best"" face reduce choice on where to trade, and avoidable extra costs and operational complexity, the letter said.
""Together, these factors may lead to lower returns for investors,"" it added.
The letter was signed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Electronic Debt Markets Association, European Venues and Intermediaries' Association, AIMA, FIA, Association for Financial Markets in Europe, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

McGuinness warned the City of London earlier this week to expect only limited access to the EU at best given Britain has decided to leave the single market.

State-owned Budapest Bank, MKB Bank and savings group Takarekbank (MTB) announced a tie-up in May to create Magyar Bankholding in a shake-up of the Hungarian banking system that has seen local players gain influence under Orban.
The government decree says the measure is needed to boost the competitiveness of the Hungarian banking sector.
The central bank, led by Gyorgy Matolcsy, a close Orban ally, has long argued that there were too many large banks in Hungary for the size of its market and banking services and loans were too costly.
Takarek, which has an extensive rural branch network, has been working to transform itself into a universal banking group - offering more services - to compete with rivals OTP, Austria's Erste Group and Belgium's KBC.
MKB, which focuses mostly on corporate and private banking, exited a European Union restructuring process at the end of 2019, which had banned it from acquisitions and imposed limits on the size of its balance sheet.
The combined entity will be worth over 740 billion forints ($2.5 billion), with the state holding a 30.35% stake. The owners of MKB Bank, including Orban ally Lorinc Meszaros, will hold 31.96% and Takarekbank will have 37.69%.
The project still faces serious challenges, including a deeper-than-expected economic downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic, which could trigger a rise in bad loans.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>",China imposes temporary anti-subsidy charges on Australian wine imports,"BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - China will temporarily impose anti-subsidy fees on some Australian wine imports from Dec. 11, the commerce ministry said on Thursday, ramping up pressure on the industry amid rising tensions between the two nations.
Importers bringing in wines being investigated for Australian subsidy benefits will need to pay deposits to China's customs authority, according to the statement.
Australia's trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said Australia rejected claims that Australian wine was subsidised. 
""Australian wine is the second-highest price point in the Chinese market. And for Australia, it’s basically our highest-priced market,"" Birmingham told ABC Radio. 
China in August launched an investigation into Australian wine subsidy schemes following a request from the China Wine Industry Association. Last month, it began imposing anti-dumping tariffs of 107.1% to 212.1% on wine imported from Australia after a separate anti-dumping probe.
The anti-subsidy deposits, of 6.3%, will be added to those tariffs for the world's largest listed winemaker, Australia's Treasury Wine Estates (OTC:TSRYF), as well as Casella Wines and Swan Vintage.  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) will attract a rate of 6.4%.
Australian Grape and Wine chief executive Tony Battaglene said the wine industry disputes the subsidy allegation. ""We don't believe it is substantiated,"" he said.
Winemakers had already made commercial decisions to divert wine shipments away from China after anti-dumping tariffs of up to 212% were imposed, with some companies removing wine from ships en-route to China when they docked in Singapore, he said.
Canberra views China's moves against Australian wine as part of a pattern of punitive trade measures since Australia called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
""The different claims that have been made by China just don't stand up to the evidence test, that's why we will continue to defend, to appeal, and of course to call this behaviour out,"" Birmingham told the Seven Network on Thursday morning.
On Wednesday, Birmingham told parliament China was not adhering to a free trade agreement between the two nations or its World Trade Organisation obligations and appeared to be targeting Australian products.
Australia had raised concerns at a WTO meeting about China taking measures against Australian barley, wine, meat, dairy, live seafood, logs, timber, coal and cotton, he said.
The Chinese embassy responded saying the comments about China's adherence to the free trade agreement were ""totally unfounded"".
Cai Xuefei, an independent liquor industry analyst based in Hefei, said the subsidy decision was ""a punishment"".
""When the price is higher, it will have a huge impact on sales,"" he said.
South American wine producers would benefit as Australian wine was disadvantaged on price in China, he said.

(Reuters) -Airbnb Inc said late on Wednesday it sold shares in its initial public offering (IPO) at $68 a piece, above its targeted price range, to raise around $3.5 billion.
The IPO gives Airbnb a fully diluted valuation - which includes securities such as options and restricted stock units - of $47.3 billion, capping a turnaround in fortunes for the U.S. home rental firm that was hit hard by travel restrictions used to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.
Airbnb had planned to sell around 51 million shares at $56 to $60 apiece, after raising this range from an earlier target of $44 to $50 per share.
Airbnb's IPO is the biggest by a U.S. operating company in 2020 in what has been an active year for U.S. listings, with the likes of tech companies DoorDash Inc and Snowflake Inc going public. 
The share offering also marks a dramatic comeback for Airbnb after it suffered a sharp drop in bookings and an increase in cancellations as the coronavirus spread across the world nine months ago, forcing governments to impose travel bans and mandate social distancing guidelines.
In April, Airbnb raised $1 billion from private equity firms Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners as it sought to boost its cash reserves amid a decline in revenue. That fundraising valued Airbnb at $18 billion, below its $26 billion valuation in early March before the pandemic began, a source told Reuters. 
Airbnb had also launched a string of cost-cutting measures, including pausing hiring, suspending marketing activities, and slashing executive pay, in an effort to save up to $800 million this year, sources told Reuters.
But as lockdowns eased and with more travelers opting to book homes instead of hotels, Airbnb's revenue rebounded from a summer slump to reach $1.34 billion in the third quarter. The company also posted a surprise profit of $219.3 million, down slightly from $266.7 million last year.
Airbnb was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia as a website to take bookings for rooms during conferences, including the Democratic National Convention that year in Denver. Some of Airbnb's investors include venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz; Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher; buyout firms General Atlantic, TPG, Hillhouse Capital; and investment management firms Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments.
The company's shares are scheduled to start trading on Nasdaq on Thursday under the ticker ""ABNB.""

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are the lead underwriters for Airbnb's offering.

The Model X smashed into the wall and caught fire in the parking lot of a Seoul apartment building late on Wednesday, police said. It took about an hour to put out the fire. 
South Korea's forensic agency would investigate the car to identify the cause of the accident, police said. 
Tesla was not immediately available for comment. 
In January, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it will review a petition asking the agency to formally investigate and recall 500,000 Tesla vehicles over sudden unintended acceleration reports.
The petition covers 2012 through 2019 model year Tesla Model S, 2016 through 2019 Tesla Model X, and 2018 through 2019 Tesla Model 3 vehicles, the agency said. 
Tesla sold 11,601 cars in South Korea from January to November, sharply up from last year's 2,430 sales, according to CarIsYou Data Research Institute. 
The U.S. electric car maker is also under investigation by South Korea's transport ministry over its autopilot functions, the ministry said earlier this year.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Taking pride of place in 28-year-old Beijing lawyer Wu Ge's bedroom are dozens of small figurines displayed on clear plastic shelves with designs ranging from cherubic dolls to characters from Japan's Pokemon series. 
Wu estimates that she has spent over 5,000 yuan ($766) in the past three years buying the pieces from Chinese toy seller Pop Mart International Group, amassing a collection of over 80 figurines. 
Millions of young Chinese toy lovers like her are behind the popularity of Pop Mart, a Beijing-based company due to list in Hong Kong on Friday after raising $676 million in an initial public offering that priced at the top of its range, valuing the decade-old firm at as much as $7 billion. 
The company's main product is ""mystery"" toy boxes that each hold a single figurine such as ""pool babies"" from the elf-like Pucky range, which Wu says are her favorite, or different versions of its best-selling character, the large-eyed, round-faced Molly doll.
The boxes, which cost about $9 each, have been a big hit with China's millennials. Consumers born after 1995 spend more on mystery toys than any other hobby, including fancy shoes and esports, according to a report last year by Alibaba-backed online shopping platform Tmall.
Pop Mart, the market leader, more than tripled its revenues last year to 1.68 billion yuan ($256.8 million), according to its prospectus.
The IPO drew strong interest from investors, with the retail offer 356 times oversubscribed. 
""The company operates in a niche and doesn't really have any listed comparables in the region,"" said Aequitas Research partner Sumeet Singh, who publishes on the Smartkarma research platform. ""In addition, it is continuing to expand its network which will continue to aid growth.""
Pop Mart and its advisors were so confident the deal would be popular that it elected not to take cornerstone shareholders which are common in Hong Kong IPOs.
""I think consumer concepts will be a new focus in the market,"" said a banker with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. ""In China, consumption is the growth engine of the economy.""
HIGH HOPES
Pop Mart's listing will make its 33-year-old founder Wang Ning, who holds a 56% share in the firm, a billionaire. Pop Mart did not respond to requests for an interview. 
Mystery toy boxes are not new and trace their origins to Japan's vending machine capsule models, Gashapon, a cash cow for the likes of toy maker Bandai. But Pop Mart has taken the trend to new heights, teaming up with artists to design new figurines and build up a pool of trademarks. 
The company now distributes its products in 21 countries outside China. ​Its customers - mostly aged 18 to 35 - are 75% female, the prospectus said.
A key attraction for shoppers who buy the toys ​either online, from Pop Mart's 136 mainland China stores,​ or 1,001 vending machines, is the surprise element: They do not know which exact ​figurine they get until they open the box. 
Some have become lucrative collectibles. Wang Di, a 19-year-old university student with more than 100 figurines, said she recently sold a rare Labubu - a rabbit-like creature with monster's teeth - for over 700 yuan, more than 10 times what she paid for it. 
But other fans say they just love the toys for themselves.

""Working pressure is huge for young people, and when I see these beautiful figurines on my desk, I'm cheered up. Some people prefer fresh flowers on their desk, and they are flowers for me,"" said Wu.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian equities eased from record highs on Thursday as stalled U.S. stimulus talks and a sell-off in tech stocks weighed, while sterling traders sat on a knife's edge as last-ditch Brexit negotiations yielded only an agreement to keep talking. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.34%. Japan's Nikkei erased early losses to trade 0.1% lower. Both are up more than 60% from March lows. S&P 500 futures meanwhile pared early gains and steadied in Asian afternoon trade.
U.S. Treasuries rose while the dollar slightly eased after a volatile overnight session in currency markets, with traders now looking ahead to a European Central Bank monetary policy meeting. Sterling teetered at $1.3366 as it awaits a Brexit resolution.
""We've risen so far so fast that it's making investors cautious,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at stockbroker CMC Markets in Sydney.
""The fall in tech stocks was a bit of a concern, given that they've risen in all market weather over the last six weeks, so to see them come off might signal that we're looking at a short term corrective move.""
A near 2% drop in the Nasdaq on Wednesday was driven by a 1.9% fall in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares after U.S. regulators filed lawsuits alleging the company used its dominance to buy or crush rivals, harming competition.
Meanwhile, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Thursday it would remove ten Chinese companies from its equities indices and several others from its bond indices.
This move comes after a Trump administration order to prohibit purchases by U.S. investors of certain Chinese securities. Index provider FTSE Russell did the same last week.
TRICKY TALKS
Cautious trading in Asia came amid widespread uncertainty surrounding long-running U.S. pandemic relief negotiations and talks between Britain and the European Union over trade arrangements post Brexit.
U.S. lawmakers approved a stopgap government funding bill on Wednesday, but were unable to sort out disagreements over aid to state and local governments that are holding up a broader spending package.
British and EU leaders meanwhile gave themselves until the end of the weekend to seal a new trade pact, with some $1 trillion in annual trade at risk of tariffs if they can't reach a deal by Dec. 31, when transition arrangements end. 
British and European futures slipped marginally in Asia, with FTSE futures little changed and EuroSTOXX 50 futures down 0.14%.
Investor focus will shift towards a European Central Bank meeting later on Thursday, where the central bank is expected to unveil more bond buying and cheap loans.
Traders are also looking to see whether the ECB will say anything about a near 14% rise in the common currency from March lows, which is hindering Europe's exporters. 
""We do not think there will be an explicit talking down of the euro, but expect ECB Chief (Christine) Lagarde to mention the central bank is keenly monitoring the currency strength,"" analysts at Singapore's OCBC Bank said in a note.
Elsewhere, faith in the recovery appears to be holding up, with oil prices steady despite a build-up in U.S. inventories. Brent crude futures last sat 0.27% firmer at $49.13 a barrel and U.S. crude was up 0.29% at $45.81 a barrel. 
Gold nursed losses at $1,839 an ounce. 
Treasuries traded firmly owing to uncertainty around U.S. stimulus wrangling, and the yield on benchmark U.S. ten-year bonds fell 1.2 basis points to 0.9278%. 
""The uncertainty around the timing is less important than the uncertainty around the overall size of the package, which depends primarily on the outcome of the Senate runoffs in Georgia on January 5,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a note.

""For now, our assumption is a $700 billion COVID relief package,"" they said, adding it would be upgraded to between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion if Democrats win the two seats.

LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on Thursday said it would more than double the number of companies it engages with over climate-related issues to over 1,000 and laid out stronger goals on other fronts for portfolio firms ahead of the upcoming shareholder meeting season.
BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager with around $7.8 trillion in assets, said its enhanced target list would cover 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions linked to the operations of the companies its clients invest in, globally.
It also made explicit its call for companies to lay out plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.
""We will step up our engagement efforts with this universe and consider accelerated voting actions should the substance of companies’ climate-related commitments and disclosures not meet our expectations,"" the company said.
The changes come at a time of rising pressure on companies to help address environmental and social problems. New York-based BlackRock said performing well on such sustainability measures can help companies improve long-term returns.
After a year marked by growing concern over the lobbying activities of some companies, particularly around climate, BlackRock also said it would look for companies to align their lobbying activities with their public statements. 
It also called for them to make their boards more diverse.
In addition, the money manager said it would be more likely to support some climate-related shareholder proposals than in the past - a sore point with many climate activists.
In a report on Thursday, the company said it had increased its support for climate- and social-related shareholder proposals since July 1, backing 11 out of 22. 

""We've really intensified our engagement approach,"" said London-based Sandy Boss, the asset manager's top stewardship executive, who joined in April. She cited the example of Spanish airports operator Aena, where BlackRock backed a shareholder resolution calling for an annual vote on its climate plans.

(Reuters) - The operator of U.S. online platform Weedmaps, where users rate cannabis sellers, is nearing a deal to go public at a $1.5 billion valuation through a merger with a blank-check acquisition firm, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
WM Holding Co, which owns Weedmaps, plans to merge with Silver Spike Acquisition Corp, the sources said. The deal could be announced as early as Thursday, the sources added, requesting anonymity ahead of an official announcement. 
The deal would come less than a week after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level, the first time either chamber of Congress has voted to end the federal ban on marijuana since the drug was listed as a ""controlled substance"" in 1970.
The legislation is not expected to advance further as long as the Senate remains in Republican hands. Nevertheless, 15 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use of marijuana, and over 30 states allow some form of the drug for medicinal purposes. 
The patchy legal framework across different states has resulted in Weedmaps fielding enquiries from law enforcement agencies and regulators about its advertising and promotional practices. The Irvine, California-based company would stand to gain from a harmonization of the rules governing the cannabis industry across the United States.
Weedmaps was founded in 2008 by Doug Francis and Justin Hartfield, and sells a cloud-based operating system for cannabis retailers as well as hosting a review and ratings platform for sellers.
Silver Spike is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), an increasingly popular investment vehicles which raise funds in an initial public offering (IPO) with the aim of buying a private company. The acquired company then becomes public as result of the merger and is an alternative to the traditional IPO process.
SPACs have emerged as an increasingly popular route to the stock market for private companies because they can be completed more quickly than an IPO, and there is greater certainty over the funds a company will raise.

Silver Spike, led by cannabis industry executive Scott Gordon, raised $250 million in an August, 2019 IPO on Nasdaq with a focus of buying a company in the cannabis sector.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Thursday morning, after U.S. tech stocks dragged the market down during the previous session. Rising doubt over whether the U.S. will pass the latest stimulus measures ahead of a looming deadline also put a damper on investor sentiment.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.28% by 10:58 PM ET (2:58 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.02%. Investors are still digesting Wednesday’s data that indicated a slowdown in Chinese economic recovery, with the consumer price index (CPI) contracting 0.6% month-on-month and contracting 0.5% year-on-year. The producer price index (PPI) contracted 1.5% year-on-year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.30%. Stricter restriction measures, with restaurants stopping dine-in services from 6 PM onwards, as well as closed gyms and beauty parlors, came into effect in the city from Thursday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.35% and South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.20%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.62%.
Tech stocks were down, with  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) facing lawsuits filed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc branded by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) as “dramatically” overvalued.
Investors are also looking to whether the Republicans and Democrats will reach a deal on the latest stimulus measures. Negotiations are at their most intense since the Nov. 3 presidential election, with a Dec. 11 deadline to avert a government shutdown just a day away. Both sides are working on proposals and counter proposals but have yet to resolve a deadlock over the price tag, business liability shields as well as aid to state and local governments.
However, some investors were not too optimistic even if the two sides reached an agreement before the deadline.
“The idea here is that you’re not going to see a huge stimulus package … you are probably going to get something done, but it’s probably not going to be enough to put a lot of pressure on rates overall,” Invesco senior portfolio manager Matt Brill told Bloomberg.
Across the Atlantic, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen held talks on Wednesday over a “frank” and “lively” dinner of turbot. The two leaders deferred a “firm decision” about the future of Brexit trade talks until Sunday, as the European Commission and the U.K. remained “far apart” on the trade deal. The two sides have until the end of the year to reach a consensus.
The European Central Bank will convene later in the day for its policy meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to roll out an increased and extended pandemic bond-buying program.
The Federal Reserve will also meet for its own policy meeting later in the day.
On the vaccines front, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will convene to discuss BNT162b2, the COVID-19 vaccine co-developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy), also later in the day. Should the FDA grant emergency use authorization during the meeting, distribution could begin within 24 hours, Health & Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said.
Health Canada gave its nod to the jab on Wednesday, following the U.K.’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granting a temporary authorization for emergency use during the previous week.

TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Sony Corp will buy AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s animation business Crunchyroll for $1.175 billion, the two companies said on Thursday, as the Japanese electronics conglomerate aims to beef up its entertainment content and distribution businesses.
The deal will give  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) access to Crunchyroll's 3 million paying subscribers across more than 200 countries and regions, helping Sony compete more globally with entertainment giants such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Sony's Funimation Global Group, a U.S. animation distributor with 1 million paying subscribers, will own Crunchyroll, currently part of AT&T's WarnerMedia segment.
AT&T has been looking to monetize its non-core assets since CEO John Stankey took over in June. The latest deal will allow it to invest in other focuses of WarnerMedia, including content creation and gaming.
Despite Crunchyroll's loyal following among anime fans, AT&T felt the anime streaming service was too niche for the broader audience its streaming service HBO Max wants to pursue, a source familiar with the company said.
The proceeds will be paid in cash at closing, AT&T and Sony said https://refini.tv/2KaukIU. 
Sony is boosting gaming and entertainment businesses under Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida's strategy to increase recurring revenue streams that cushion the impact of volatile hardware sales cycles.
Sony bought Funimation in 2017 for about $143 million.
The animation business has been thriving recently on the record-breaking success of the Japanese animated film ""Demon Slayer"" - co-distributed by Sony's music unit Aniplex Inc. The film will be heading to the United States in early 2021. It will be distributed by Funimation, now jointly held by Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc and Aniplex.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 08:57PM ET</span>",UK issues anaphylaxis warning on Pfizer vaccine after adverse reactions,"By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's medicine regulator said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a medicine or food should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, giving fuller guidance on an earlier allergy warning about the shot.
Starting with the elderly and frontline workers, Britain began mass vaccinating its population on Tuesday, part of a global drive that poses one of the biggest logistical challenges in peacetime history.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there had been two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since rollout began. 
""Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) BioNTech vaccine,"" MHRA Chief Executive June Raine said in a statement.
""Most people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against COVID-19 outweigh the risks... You can be completely confident that this vaccine has met the MHRA’s robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.""
Anaphylaxis is an overreaction of the body's immune system, which the National Health Service describes as severe and sometimes life-threatening.
The fuller guidance, clarifying that the main risk was from anaphylaxis specifically, was issued after consulting experts on allergies. The MHRA had initially advised anyone with a history of a ""significant allergic reaction"" not to take the shot.
Pfizer and BioNTech said they were supporting the MHRA's investigation.
Last week, Britain's MHRA became the first in the world to approve the vaccine, developed by Germany's BioNTech and Pfizer, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) continue to assess the data. 
A top U.S. official said on Wednesday that Americans with known severe allergic reactions may not be candidates for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine until more was understood about what had happened. 
Canada's health ministry said it would look at the reported adverse reactions in Britain, but said adverse events were to be expected and would not necessarily change the risk/benefit of the shot, after the country approved the vaccine. 
ALLERGIC REACTION
MHRA chief Raine told lawmakers such allergic reactions had not been a feature of the Pfizer's clinical trials.
Pfizer has said people with a history of severe adverse allergic reactions to vaccines or the candidate's ingredients were excluded from their late stage trials, which is reflected in the MHRA's emergency approval protocol.
However, the allergic reactions may have been caused by a component of Pfizer's vaccine called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, which helps stabilise the shot and is not in other types of vaccines.
Imperial College London's Paul Turner, an expert in allergy and immunology, who has been advising the MHRA on their revised guidance, told Reuters: ""As we've had more information through, the initial concern that maybe it affects everyone with allergies is not true.""
""The ingredients like PEG which we think might be responsible for the reactions are not related to things which can cause food allergy. Likewise, people with a known allergy to just one medicine should not be at risk,"" Turner told Reuters.
The EMA said in an email that all quality, safety and efficacy data would be taken into account in assessing the vaccine, including data generated outside the EU.
In the United States, the FDA released documents on Tuesday in preparation for an advisory committee meeting on Thursday, saying the Pfizer vaccine's efficacy and safety data met its expectations for authorization.
The briefing documents said 0.63% of people in the vaccine group and 0.51% in the placebo group reported possible allergic reactions in trials, which Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said was a very small number.
""The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well,"" he said. 
However, Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said that the MHRA and NHS had overreacted initially.
""I would not have broadened to the degree they did,"" he said.

""It's reasonable to let the world know about this, and to be aware of it in terms of people who have had reactions like this to vaccines. I think to say medicines, foods or any other allergies is past the boundary of science.""

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) -General Electric Co has agreed to pay a $200 million penalty to settle charges for misleading investors over how it was generating earnings in its power and insurance businesses, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday.
GE's shares were down 1.2% at $11.25 in post-market trade following the news.
Securities regulators opened a probe into the company's accounting practices following a 2017 surprise accounting charge of $6.2 billion by the company, which said it would need to set aside $15 billion for long-term care insurance payouts at the time.
The inquiry, which initially focused on long-term service agreements for maintenance of power plants, jet engines and other industrial equipment, was later expanded to include GE's review of its insurance business.
As part of the settlement, GE has also agreed to report to the SEC for a one-year period about compliance related to its power business and GE Capital's run-off insurance operations.
A GE representative said the settlement has brought the SEC's investigation to a close, and no corrections or revisions to its financial statements are required.
The representative said it was in the best interests of GE and its shareholders to settle, adding the conglomerate has taken a number of steps to enhance its disclosures and internal controls since the time period covered by the investigation.
Most of GE's insurance operations were spun off in Genworth Financial Inc (NYSE:GNW) more than a decade ago, but it retained some of the legacy long-term care policies and also reinsures policies written by other insurers.
""It is never a proud moment for a company to have to settle an SEC accounting investigation and pay a civil fine, but we do consider this settlement to be a favorable outcome for GE,"" said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
""It removes the overhang of the investigation,"" said Dray, adding that the SEC's fine was within the ballpark of the $100 million reserve GE set aside. ""We believe investors recognize that these legacy accounting issues literally date back two CEOs ago.""
The SEC was also investigating revenue recognition accounting at the company's power business, which led to a $22 billion goodwill write-off in 2018.
In 2017 and 2018, the company's stock price fell almost 75% as challenges in its power and insurance businesses were disclosed to the public, the SEC said.
The company misled investors by failing to explain that one-quarter of its GE Power profits in 2016 and nearly half in the first three quarters of 2017 stemmed from reductions in its prior cost estimates, the SEC said.
The order also finds that GE failed to tell investors that its reported increase in current industrial cash collections was coming at the expense of cash in future years, the SEC said. 
""Public companies must provide an accurate picture of their business. It's really very simple,"" SEC enforcement chief Stephanie Avakian told reporters during a press briefing on Wednesday.
""You must speak accurately, about the manner in which you are meeting financial targets and about trends and uncertainties, you are aware of in your business.""

GE, however, said it has neither admitted nor denied any allegations as part of the settlement. The SEC order also makes no allegation that prior period financial statements were misstated, the company said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government is weighing making further reductions to the tax burden on national oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) to bring it closer to that of ordinary corporations, a top finance ministry official said on Wednesday.
Lower taxes could mark a turning point for ailing Pemex, the country's largest company and tax payer.
Pemex has been struggling for years to shoulder its crushing tax burden and what both investors and officials consider unsustainable levels of debt.
""Changing the tax burden is a structural change that Pemex needs, but we have to do it gradually,"" Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio told Reuters in an interview.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has made reviving Pemex a top priority, but the company has been hammered by years of losses, and in April ratings agencies stripped it of its investment grade credit rating.
Yorio argued the changes should occur between 2021 and 2024 so that Pemex ""can start paying taxes like other corporations in Mexico."" But he said no decision has yet been made.
""We'll have to see how much of this our public finances can absorb,"" Yorio added, arguing that with tax evasion in Mexico worth around 3% of GDP, there is currently limited scope.
Past governments have also acknowledged that Pemex's tax burden is excessive and should be lowered. 
The shared utility tax, the oil company's largest single payment toward the government, was reduced from 65% to 58% this year and Yorio said it could be at 54% next year. 
Pemex had also received other financial support, he added.

""Pemex has two great structural problems with its cash flow: its debt burden and its tax burden,"" Yorio said. ""Right now, it seems in 2021 we'll keep (the shared utility tax) at 54%.""

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) on Wednesday delayed a decision in a trade secrets case involving South Korean battery makers LG Chem and SK Innovation to Feb. 10.
LG Chem, an EV battery supplier for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), filed its trade complaints against SK Innovation last year in the United States over allegations of trade secret theft, seeking to block SK from producing battery cells in the United States and importing the components necessary to make the cells. SK denied wrongdoing. The decision had been expected on Thursday.
An adverse ruling by the ITC could lead to an import ban on SK Innovation's batteries and necessary components, potentially causing setbacks for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) as they move to build new electric vehicles.
SK Innovation is building its first battery factory in Georgia which is set to begin production in 2022 and could be affected by an adverse ruling. The factory with capacity of 9.8 GWh is intended to serve Volkswagen's EV production in neighboring Tennessee.
In February, the ITC made a preliminary ruling in favor of LG Chem, which has since split off its battery business as LG Energy Solution.
The ITC did not disclose the reason for the delay.
""We will continue to participate in the lawsuit faithfully and decisively,"" LG Energy Solution said in a statement. 
SK Innovation said the company would continue to participate in the lawsuit regardless of the delay. 
""As the lawsuit is set to extend into the third year, SK Innovation hopes that the two companies could make a wise decision to end the dispute promptly to resolve uncertainties and devote ourselves to do business,"" it said in a statement.

The Penly 1 reactor is operating at limited capacity due to the strike, down 1,070 megawatts (MW) to 260 MW. The drop in production is expected to continue until the end of the strike Thursday evening, the data showed.
The disruption represents around 3.6% of available production capacity as of Wednesday evening, the data showed.
Electricity demand for Thursday is forecast at around 70.2 GW due to cold weather. France was a net power importer throughout most of the day Wednesday, the data showed.
The reform plan involves a restructure of EDF, including a split between the company's nuclear and renewable energy activities, which unions fear would pave the way for a dismantling and privatisation of the group.

Plans for the latest strike were announced a week ago as a follow-up to a walkout on Nov. 26 that led to a drop in nuclear output that was the equivalent of four reactors.

The meeting of the board of directors was convened after Chief Executive Herbert Diess demanded a contract extension and more backing for his reform efforts, some of which had been opposed by the company's powerful labour chiefs. 
""Talks between the participants continue in a constructive manner,"" the supervisory board spokesman said in a statement. 
""Decisions were not made in today's meeting, as expected.""
Diess has sought to shift VW from being the world's biggest maker of combustion engined vehicles into a company capable of mass producing electric and increasingly autonomous cars. 
The pace and depth of his reforms, including efforts to lower costs in Germany and to transform Volkswagen into a tech company, has led to clashes with labour leaders eager to protect local jobs.
Diess and the unions clashed over key issues including appointments to the management board, and whether to extend the CEO's contract beyond 2023, the sources said.
Volkswagen is less efficient and has higher costs than key rivals and Diess has argued that costs must come down to free up resources for high-tech cars. 
VW Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch has lobbied to avoid a discussion about the contract extension, on the grounds that it is not pressing until nearer 2023, when it is due to expire, people familiar with the matter said this week.
Volkswagen's labour bosses, who control half the seats on the carmaker's supervisory board, are likely to oppose a contract extension for Diess, plunging it into crisis.
The management stalemate has also seen Diess encounter opposition to his efforts to replenish the management board.
Diess has attempted to install Arno Antlitz as chief financial officer to replace Frank Witter, who is due to retire in June, and to hire Thomas Schmall as management board member responsible for components, replacing Stefan Sommer, who has already left the company, sources told Reuters.
The appointments had been delayed because VW's labour leaders had insisted on approving a ""package solution"", two people familiar with the talks told Reuters last week.

""We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to discuss a comprehensive proposal,"" another source said on Tuesday.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 05:02PM ET</span>","U.S. Supreme Court weighs shareholder suit over Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac","By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday questioned the constitutional structure of a federal agency as they weighed a bid by shareholders of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) to pursue legal claims arising from the 2008 housing crisis.
The justices heard an appeal by President Donald Trump's administration of a lower court ruling that let shareholders in Fannie and Freddie pursue a challenge to a 2012 agreement between the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and the Treasury Department after the government's rescue of the two companies.
As part of the case, the justices appeared receptive to separate arguments made by shareholders that the constitutional structure of the FHFA, which is led by a single director who can be removed by the president only ""for cause,"" is unlawful.
The 2012 agreement eliminated dividend payouts to various shareholders and required Fannie and Freddie to pay the U.S. Treasury an amount equal to their quarterly net worth each quarter, which now totals billions of dollars.
The administration in its appeal of a 2019 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals argued that the lawsuit should not be permitted but agreed with the challengers that FHFA's structure is unconstitutional because it infringes upon the power of president.
In 2016, Fannie and Freddie shareholders Patrick Collins, Marcus Liotta and William Hitchcock sued in a federal court in Texas arguing that the 2012 agreement, sometimes referred to as the ""net worth sweep,"" exceeded FHFA's authority and that it should be thrown out.
The U.S. government in 2008 seized Fannie and Freddie, private enterprises set up by Congress, at the height of the financial crisis as they teetered on the brink of insolvency. The government took a majority stake in each and they were placed under the supervision of the FHFA, which was created at the same time.
Some justices appeared skeptical during the arguments about whether the 2012 agreement could be voided even if they deem the agency's structure unconstitutional.
Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch said the remedy sought by the shareholders is ""a big one and hard for us to swallow.""
Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said it would be ""counterintuitive, perhaps illogical"" to suggest the challengers could get anything more than a declaration that the agency's director could be removed by the president at any time.
Many questions by the justices focused more on the constitutional claims than on other legal grounds on which the shareholders challenged the 2012 agreement.
Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts questioned the premise of the lawsuit, noting that it was based on the notion that the shareholders were ""left out in the cold and their holdings rendered worthless.""
Roberts told the shareholders' lawyer David Thompson that he checked the share prices on Wednesday morning and that Fannie was trading at $2.69 and Freddie at $2.56 per share. 
""Your shares are not worthless, they are worth something. ... So doesn't that render your sort of nationalization rhetoric just that?"" Roberts asked.
The Supreme Court in a similar case involving another federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, ruled in June that its single-director structure was unconstitutional.
Some justices questioned whether the court even needed to answer the constitutional question to decide the case, noting that the 2012 agreement was signed off on by an acting director of the FHFA, who could have been removed by then-President Barack Obama.
The FHFA is headed by a director who is appointed to a five-year term by the president subject to Senate confirmation. A ruling that the current structure is invalid would enable President-elect Joe Biden to replace the current Trump-appointed director, Mark Calabria, after taking office in January.

Fannie has paid $181.4 billion to the government and Freddie has paid $119.7 billion. They drew a combined $191.4 billion from the government at the time of the rescue.

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's decision to suspend tariffs on Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets and other U.S. goods has stunned the planemaker's European rival Airbus and exposes a growing rift between the UK and Europe over aerospace investment, industry sources and analysts said.
Britain said on Tuesday it would suspend the tariffs on Jan. 1, describing the move as an attempt to de-escalate a long-running conflict over aircraft subsidies that has dragged the United States and Europe into a tit-for-tat tariff war.
The decision comes amid wider trade talks between Britain and the United States and ends a united front on tariffs between Airbus's political backers Britain, France, Germany and Spain.
Airbus played down the move, saying the company's goal remains ""to find a negotiated settlement of this long-standing dispute to avoid lose-lose tariffs.""
Diplomats say U.S. and EU trade chiefs are in ""serious"" negotiations to end the 16-year-old aircraft trade row.
Privately, several European trade sources said the surprise UK move risked the most serious cross-Channel split on aerospace in decades. Two of the sources said it was viewed in other capitals as a ""betrayal"" of Airbus, which has 14,000 UK staff.
Paul Everitt, head of UK aerospace lobby group ADS, said Britain had acted unilaterally without reciprocal U.S. action.
The subsidy dispute is the largest case ever handled by the World Trade Organization and comes to a head just as Britain is leaving the European Union, forcing it to seek new trade deals.
""There have always been disagreements, but this is the first time that statecraft has been put so clearly before shareholder trust,"" said a senior UK industry official.
Airbus' biggest shareholders include France, Germany and Spain. Britain is not a shareholder but hosts virtually all Airbus wing production and makes its voice heard indirectly.
Several sources said the move would reinforce studies by Airbus to re-examine where to build wings for future jets.
""It is really damaging and means the UK can forget about further investment,"" the senior industry official said.
""SERIOUS"" TALKS
The decision follows a debate about whether Britain can legally impose tariffs inherited from the EU after Jan. 1 because of its technical status in the WTO case. Legal experts have said it could do so under rules of state succession.
Britain insisted the move would help resolve the subsidy spat, which has hit other industries forced to pay tariffs.
""We are serious about de-escalation ... this (suspension of tariffs) demonstrates the seriousness we place on reaching a negotiated settlement,"" a UK spokesman said on Wednesday.
Several sources said an aircraft agreement could be reached before U.S. President Donald Trump leaves office next month.
Even though the United States is likely to welcome Britain dropping tariffs, reaching a deal may be complicated by the fact that Airbus jets are built across European borders.
""It is not clear how you resolve the UK part without addressing the rest of Europe,"" a U.S. source said. ""The entire discussion has been structured around finding a whole solution"".
The U.S. Trade Representative's office declined comment.
Airbus has most plants in France, Germany, Britain and Spain. So far jets assembled at a plant in Alabama are exempt from U.S. tariffs, which are due to be reviewed in January.

Barring an agreement, one option on the table is to widen the tariffs to cover parts coming from Europe to Alabama, narrowing access to the U.S. market, two sources said.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 05:01PM ET</span>","Starbucks eyes walk-thru stores, technology to power post-pandemic growth","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said customers will flock back to cafes once the coronavirus pandemic is over, even as the company builds more walk-thru locations without seating in major cities.
After efforts to expand U.S. suburban drive-thru locations, the world's largest coffee chain is creating a similar experience for customers on foot. Orders are to be primarily digital, paid for in advance, as the company shifts to new store formats in response to changing habits.
""What we're trying to do is build the equivalent of a drive-thru in a dense metropolitan area, which I think of as a walk-thru,"" Johnson told Reuters in an interview ahead of the company's biennial investor day Wednesday.
In the United States, the stores are called Starbucks Pickup. In mainland China, the chain's fastest growing market, they are called Starbucks Now and will make up 10% of the 600 stores it plans to open there in the next year.
Within a three- to five-minute walk of these locations will be traditional Starbucks cafes, Johnson said.
Broadly, Starbucks is closing some underperforming locations and relocating others, while adding new to-go locations, traditional cafes and suburban drive-thrus where possible.
It expects to grow nearly 70% to 55,000 locations globally by fiscal 2030. It is among several big restaurant chains likely to become even larger after the pandemic.
Even so, that is about 6% of net store global growth annually starting in 2022, at the lower end of a previous growth range of 6% to 7%.
On Wednesday, Starbucks said it will launch oatmilk in all U.S. stores in the spring of 2021 and roll out new menu items, including a Shaken Iced Espresso with brown sugar and oatmilk. 
Starbucks projects earnings per share growth of at least 20% in fiscal 2022, and 10% to 12% growth in 2023 and 2024. Shares hit a record high of $102.81 on Friday as brokerages hiked price targets ahead of investor day.
The company reiterated previous guidance of adjusted profit for fiscal 2021 between $2.70 and $2.90 per share.
For future growth, Johnson said Starbucks will lean on artificial intelligence – a suite of products Starbucks calls Deep Brew – to give store managers an edge in how they run their locations. The goal is not to displace employees, but to have them focus on customer service instead, he said.
The technology can create staff schedules and automate inventory management. It is already used to generate personalized deals for Starbucks Rewards members.
And Starbucks is using AI to assess local COVID-19 cases, customer preferences and employee sentiment in order to recommend, on a store-by-store basis, whether and how to slowly reopen locations. 

""We've got a way to navigate through this virus,"" he said. ""And certainly as vaccines come and we start turning up the dial, I have no doubt in my mind the customer response coming to Starbucks is immediate, because we have seen it as we open up limited seating.""

262,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines say vaccine cargo could help restart passenger flights,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines are preparing for a massive airlift of COVID-19 vaccines that will not only boost their cargo business, but help bring back passenger flights that shut down during the pandemic, executives told Reuters.
Travel demand is hovering around 40% of 2019 levels and will not return to normal until vaccines are widely distributed. In the meantime, the vaccine transportation itself could help airlines bring back parked jets and start reopening routes.
""I think we're going to reach a point fairly soon as multiple vaccines are approved that most of the planes that are operating are going to be carrying vaccines,"" said Roger Samways, vice president of Cargo Sales at American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
""We're really looking at what could end up being the largest single airlift in commercial aviation history,"" he said.
The vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) could receive U.S. approval as soon as this week and may soon be followed by another from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
The size and range of airline fleets and networks are key, as well as the ability to manage vaccines that require ultra-cold storage and the ability to quickly load them onto aircraft and unload them onto trucks for final delivery.
Commercial planes normally carry around half the world's air cargo in their bellies, with the remainder hauled in dedicated freighter planes. But a drastic reduction in passenger routes during the pandemic has slashed overall air capacity in the market.
Airlines began operating cargo-only charter flights with essential goods early in the pandemic that have become the main driver of an international business that has otherwise collapsed.
As American prepares to fly vaccines to some 150 locations across 46 countries where it already ships pharmaceuticals, it is hoping to put passengers on some of those flights too, Samways said.
American already turned cargo charters to places like Sao Paolo, Santiago and London into revenue passenger flights earlier this year that would not have been viable given the overall sharp downturn in demand.
United Airlines said cargo flights also helped expand its passenger network over the summer following weekly meetings between cargo and network planning teams to pinpoint demand.
""We continue to have those meetings on a weekly basis,"" cargo chief Christopher Busch said.
BUSINESS FOR ALL
To shorten the run time for vaccines, United is now parking planes right behind its cargo facility in Chicago, rather than at passenger gates, Busch said, and has added refrigerated rooms to meet some of the vaccine requirements.
American said vaccines will be the last to load and the first to come off its planes, and the vaccines will not sit at an airport for more than two hours on either end. The airline has a 25,000-square-foot cargo facility with three temperature zones in Philadelphia, near 14 of the largest 20 pharmaceutical companies.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) has a 40,000-square-foot, temperature-controlled facility in Atlanta, where it is running a cargo control tower day and night to prepare for vaccine distribution support.
Traditionally, cargo contracts are a triangular arrangement in which manufacturers like Pfizer Inc pay forward freighters like FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) or  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), which in turn pay airlines for any distribution they cannot handle.
For the vaccine rollout, airlines said they expect some direct shipper arrangements with the manufacturers themselves, and enough business for any airline with the capacity and infrastructure to handle it.
""In layman's terms, there's more than enough business to go around,"" said Delta's cargo chief, Robert Walpole.
Research firm Cowen is estimating $400 million in vaccine cargo revenue in 2021. While the share for airlines is unclear, it will be a welcome boost for a loss-making industry, though not enough to put it in the black without a recovery in passenger traffic.

""We're still a long, long way away from reaching a financial situation as an industry that we’ll be comfortable with,"" Samways said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, retreating from record levels as investors grew discouraged over the halting progress of economic stimulus talks, while a drop in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares provided an additional drag.
Investors are banking on a long-awaited relief package to help buttress an economy battered from the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns that has led to millions of layoffs and overwhelmed the healthcare system.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said lawmakers were still looking for a path toward an agreement on COVID-19 aid, as the U.S. House of Representatives prepared to vote on a one-week funding bill to provide more time for a deal.
""We have been in a significant tug-of-war between vaccine news and virus news, and the vaccine news has won,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. 
""The tie-breaker in that tug of war has certainly been the potential for stimulus getting out of this Congress before they head home for the holiday,"" he added.

Positive updates on the COVID-19 vaccine development along with hopes for a fresh fiscal stimulus package have helped fuel a rise in Wall Street's main indexes to all-time highs, with the S&P 500 surpassing 3,700 points for the first time on Tuesday.
Facebook shares extended declines late in the session after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state sued the social media company on Wednesday, saying that it broke antitrust law and should potentially be broken up. The news weighed on other mega cap names such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and sent the NYSE FANG+ ETF down about 2%.
With overall valuations now at extremely high levels, some investors worry stocks could be more vulnerable to any bad news such as unexpected setbacks in the roll-out of coronavirus vaccines or delays in stimulus.

Investing.com - The Dow closed lower Wednesday, as an Apple-led decline in tech and an ongoing stalemate in stimulus talks on Capitol Hill weighed on investor sentiment.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.35%, or 105 points after rising by more than 100 points intraday. The S&P 500 was down 0.84%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.94%.
Technology stocks exacerbated the broader market decline as the Fab 5 slipped into the red, paced by a 2% decline in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) slipped more than 1%.   
Apple's day of losses come as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reiterated its sell rating and $75 price target on the stock on concerns average selling prices are set to come under pressure.  Facebook came under pressure after the Federal Trade Commission and a slew of states sued the social media company for alleged antitrust violations.

Vaccine deliveries in December could fall short of the 24 million needed to ""vaccinate all frontline medical professionals and long-term care residents, raising questions of which high-priority groups will receive the vaccine first,"" Stifel Economics added.

(Reuters) -The New York state pension fund on Wednesday committed to help curb climate change by transitioning its investments to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, making it the first U.S. pension fund to set the goal by that date. 
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said the move will put the fund, the third largest in the country, in a strong position for the future of a green economy mapped out in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate.
President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris accord soon after his inauguration on Jan. 20.
The fund will review its energy company investments for their ability to provide returns in light of the need to take action to curb climate change, he said. 
""Those that fail to meet our minimum standards may be removed from our portfolio,"" DiNapoli said in a statement.
Divestment is a ""last resort,"" he said, but it is also a tool the fund can use to push companies to invest in technologies that reduce emissions. 
The New York state Common Retirement Fund, which has an estimated valuation of about $226 billion, is wrapping up its evaluation of nine oil sands companies, mainly in Canada and Russia, and will develop minimum standards for investments in shale oil and gas.
This will be followed by a review of sectors including integrated oil and gas, oil and gas exploration, production, storage and transportation. The fund had about $2.6 billion invested in fossil fuels as of September.
The state fund joins a growing list of financial sector players who are cutting their exposure to carbon intensive projects and companies.
It has already set minimum standards for the thermal coal mining industry and divested from about $40 million from 22 coal companies, DiNapoli said. 
The fund has a climate solutions plan to double investments in things like wind and solar power to $20 billion this decade and so far has about $11 billion invested, DiNapoli said. 
The fund will decide which companies are suitable to remain in its portfolio by 2025. 
Environmentalists praised the move.

Investing.com -- After touching highs once again on Wednesday, stocks turned into red as Congress played Lucy with the stimulus football once again.
Lawmakers put the ball in play, only to yank it away. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell snubbed the White House's $916 billion proposal and said his proposal for a skinny relief bill was brushed off by Democrats.
The Federal Trade Commission sued to break up  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), sending its shares down. 
On Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to meet on an Emergency Use Authorization application by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) on their promising Covid-19 vaccination.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. All eyes on the FDA as it meets over Pfizer vaccine
Stocks have been wavering for weeks, driven higher by optimism that the vaccine is soon in hand but at times pummeled by fears the U.S. is being overtaken by a powerful second wave of the virus.
FDA approval for emergency use of Pfizer’s vaccine could mean the beginning of a vaccination program as early as next week. People in the U.K. have already started getting the shots this week. Comfort that an effective vaccine is being delivered could be welcome to markets and send the major indexes to all new highs. 
That said, Congress still needs to act on a stimulus bill before lawmakers head home for the holiday break. And Republicans continue to fight the election outcome in court, refusing to acknowledge the win by President-elect Joe Biden.
2. Earnings continue to trickle in
Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) is expected to report earnings per share of $2.02 on revenue of $41.7 billion, and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is seen with EPS of $6.24 on revenue of $6.43 billion.
 Lululemon Athletica  Inc (NASDAQ:LULU), also a beneficiary of stay at home orders encouraging people to wear comfortable clothing and exercise in their living rooms, is expected to report EPS of 86 cents on profit of just over $1 billion.
3. It’s Airbnb Day
If  Doordash Inc  (NYSE:DASH)’s IPO on Wednesday is any guide, Airbnb’s debut is setting up to be spectacular. The food delivery app soared when it started trading, nearly doubling from its $102 IPO price, set Tuesday night.
Reports indicate home-sharing site Airbnb is going to price above its already raised range when things are settled later today. At the high end of its range, it would have a market value of roughly that of Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR), the world’s largest hotel chain.

The plant closures will impact about 17% of Canopy's indoor cultivation and all of its outdoor growing capacity in Canada, and follow its exit from some international operations and closure of other Canadian greenhouses earlier this year.
Profits have been elusive for most cannabis firms in Canada, which legalized recreational cannabis in October 2018, weighed down by fewer-than-expected retail stores, cheaper rates on the black market and sluggish overseas growth.
Klein took the top job at Canopy in January, moving over from the role of finance chief at the company's largest shareholder Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ), months after the Corona beer maker expressed disappointment over heavy losses.
The company said on Wednesday it would close indoor production sites in four Canadian cities, including Edmonton, Alberta and Bowmanville, Ontario, and outdoor plants in Saskatchewan, leading to charges of about C$350 million ($273 million) to C$400 million in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock exchanges in the European Union could back each other up to avoid platform outages leading to extended market freezes for investors, a senior European Union official said on Wednesday.
Euronext and Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) have both had trading glitches in recent months and when the primary market for a listing goes down, other platforms that offer a secondary market in the same stock are also forced to suspend trading.
To get around this problem, Tilman Lueder, the European Commission head of securities markets, said the EU could copy the American model whereby Nasdaq offers trading in NYSE listed shares during any NYSE outage, with the reverse if Nasdaq fails.
""If either one goes down, there isn't this vacuum,"" Lueder told a QED event.
Brussels is looking at ways to make markets more efficient and will propose a law next year to create a ""consolidated tape"" of share transactions from the main platforms to offer investors a market snapshot for spotting the best prices.
Lueder said a tape, long a feature on Wall Street, could also avoid outages freezing markets and he will assess how to improve the quality of the data needed, which could mean mandating a common reporting ""protocol"".
""That is a huge challenge. We are going to be working with industry on the right protocol,"" Lueder said.
""It is much too early to say if it will be one tape or several competing tapes.""
A tape will put pressure on exchanges to cap or cut the price of their share prices data, as already being demanded by banks and asset managers, prompting bourses to fight back.
""There is no convincing regulatory case for a consolidated tape yet on the table,"" Alexandra Hachmeister, head of market data at Deutsche Boerse, said.

""The proposed regulatory interventions are significant, and I don't see they are effective or proportionate. I don't see how they can help in terms of investor protection and creating a more viable capital markets union,"" she added.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 12:56PM ET</span>","Exclusive: India antitrust body raids cement giants UltraTech, LafargeHolcim units, sources say","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust body on Wednesday conducted raids at offices of UltraTech Cement and two subsidiaries of the world's largest cement maker LafargeHolcim (OTC:HCMLY), two sources close to the matter told Reuters.
Swiss-based LafargeHolcim in a statement to Reuters confirmed officials visited the Mumbai offices of ACC and Ambuja Cements and said the companies were fully cooperating with the authorities, but could not comment further as the matter is ongoing.
Several officers of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) were involved in search operations conducted simultaneously at multiple locations in India, late into the evening, the sources said, asking not to be named because of the confidential nature of the raids.
Searches were also conducted at Indian company Shree Cement Ltd, a third source said.
None of the Indian cement companies responded to Reuters requests for a comment.
The CCI did not respond to a request for comment. 
The CCI does not make any details of ongoing cartel cases or raids public. 
India is the second largest cement producer in the world and accounted for more than 8% of global installed capacity in 2019, figures from the India Brand Equity Foundation show. Cement sales in India stood at $9 billion in 2019-20. 
India's commerce minister Piyush Goyal last year told parliament the CCI was examining complaints of cartelisation by cement companies.
Given the impact on industry of COVID-19, the latest raids could add to the pressure, Rudresh Singh, an antitrust partner at India's L&L Partners, said. 
""There is already significant stress in the sector due to the pandemic,"" Singh said.
In 2012, the CCI imposed a total penalty of $1.1 billion on several cement companies for colluding to under-use their plants and create an artificial shortage of cement. An appeal against that decision is still pending. 

In recent years, the CCI has raided offices of other foreign companies, including beer giant Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) and commodities trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) on allegations of price collusion in their industry.

Investing.com --  Doordash Inc  (NYSE:DASH) is a smash hit. The food-delivery company opened trading at $182, a whopping 78% jump over the $102 at which it priced on Tuesday.
The company sold 33 million shares -- originally marketed between $90 and $95 -- on Tuesday to raise $3.37 billion in its initial public offering and now has a market value of about $60 billion.
DoorDash's IPO is the third-largest in the U.S. this year, topped only by Bill Ackman's $4 billion blank-check company and Snowflake Inc's (NYSE:SNOW) $3.86 billion offering.
The food delivery company competes with Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and any number of smaller rivals. Our need to order breakfast, lunch and dinner has skyrocketed in 2020 with governments requiring citizens to hunker down at home and prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The first vaccines have started to be given this week in the U.K., and the rest of the world is poised to catch up, at some point eliminating the need to order in.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Boeing Co's 737 MAX plane on Wednesday quietly restarted commercial flights in Brazil, the first country in the world to do so, 20 months after the aircraft was grounded worldwide by regulators following two deadly crashes that killed hundreds. 
The flights are being operated by Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, Brazil's largest airlines and one of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s biggest customers. 
The first flight took place between the Brazilian cities of Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre, according to data from FlightRadar24. 
On Wednesday, the flights restarted with little fanfare. Gol declined to provide advanced information on the routes and flights on which it would use the MAX and also did not post an announcement on its homepage to inform clients that the MAX Is flying again. 
A Gol spokesman declined to comment on how the inaugural flight went. 
The flights are a key milestone for Boeing as well, which had been trying to get the planes back in service much earlier, missing its initial target of late 2019. The MAX is its latest version of its bestselling 737 family of narrow-body jets. 
Boeing also declined to comment on Gol's inaugural flight. 
The aircraft was greenlit in late November by Brazil's civil aviation regulator ANAC in November, following a similar decision by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. 

American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is expected to be the next operator to restart flights with the MAX on Dec. 29.

The company’s board has also authorized a $15 billion common stock repurchase program.
Shares of the company are up more than 140% since hitting a low for the year in March. The stock hit a record in October amid an explosion in demand for home improvements.

The Aftonbladet daily published a report in November that included footage from a hidden camera depicting what the paper said showed a woman with a foreign background being denied an exchange of purchased items without a receipt, while a Swedish-born reporter from the daily was allowed to do so. 
H&M's policy allows the exchange of items without a receipt as long as the style is still in the store, the retailer said in the report. 
H&M, at the time, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) https://www.facebook.com/hmsverige in response to the report that it strongly denounced all forms of racism and discrimination but declined to comment on the video footage.
""DO has decided to initiate an inspection of the company H&M. The background is the media information that claims that the company treats people with an ethnic affiliation other than Swedish and disadvantages them, among other things, by demanding a receipt when changing goods in violation of the company's policy,"" DO said. 
""The purpose of the inspection is to clarify whether there has been a violation of the prohibition of discrimination for which the company is responsible,"" it said in a statement. 
An H&M spokeswoman said on Wednesday the company was investigating what had happened. 
""It is a matter of course that all customers be treated equally and we take this type of accusations very seriously,"" she said. 
H&M will reply to DO's questions by Dec. 22 as requested by the agency, she said. 

DO does not have the authority to impose sanctions but is, after forming an opinion itself, able take a case to court for a ruling whether discrimination legislation has been violated.

She takes over as non-executive chair from Myron Ullman, who is retiring in March.
Hobson, co-chief executive officer of asset manager Ariel Investments LLC, was named vice chair in 2018 and has served on Starbucks' board for over 15 years. 
She also serves as a director at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), was a director at  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) Cos and chaired DreamWorks Animation's board until its sale. 
The appointment comes at a time when Corporate America is pushing for improving diversity in its senior leadership ranks.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) earlier this year appointed Jane Fraser as its chief executive officer, making her the first woman to lead a Wall Street bank. 
Women have been underrepresented in top roles at big U.S. companies, and the share of board seats held by them and minorities has drawn scrutiny in recent years.

The loss per share of 53 cents was better than the expected loss of 85 cents, but sales of $1 billion missed the estimated $1.09 billion. Revenue was down 30% from a year earlier.
 “Our third quarter results were in-line with our muted expectations and reflected operating during the last few months of a seven-year console cycle and a global pandemic, which pressured sales and earnings,"" said Chief Executive Officer George Sherman in a statement. 
The company did not give guidance but said that same-store sales for fiscal November rose 16.5% and net sales of $791.1 million compared to $747.6 million in fiscal November 2019.    
The company also blamed weak results on the unplanned shift of some software titles to later in the fourth quarter or fiscal 2021. While same-store sales dropped 25% for the third quarter, e-commerce revenue rose 257%, a figure that is included in comparable-store sales.
GameStop delivered cost cuts of $115 million in the quarter, and closed 74 stores, for a total of 462 shuttered for the year.
Benchmark cut its price target to $5 from $6 and reaffirmed its sell rating, calling the quarter a “dramatic downturn,” Bloomberg said. 
The notion that GameStop can compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is “comical,” Benchmark said. “The vast majority of players have scant desire to buy product from a GameStop retail or e-commerce location, and the hottest games are often free-to-play like Fortnite, while GameStop's e-commerce growth is more due to the virus than a compelling platform.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened  mostly higher on Wednesday but were essentially range-bound as haggling over a Coronavirus relief bill continued with no visible end in sight. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 140 points, or 0.4%, at 30,294 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up a little less than 0.1%.
In the absence of major economic data or – for the most part – corporate earnings, attention was focused on the week’s two blockbuster IPOs. DoorDash priced its offering at $102 per share late on Tuesday, raising $3.37 billion and giving itself a valuation of some $39 billion, more than twice the valuation at its last private fund-raising round before the pandemic.
Rental company AirBnB is expected to price its IPO later Wednesday, and is also projected to secure a valuation north of $40 billion – a remarkable turnaround after it was forced into an emergency capital raising by the pandemic earlier in the year.
Developments on Capitol Hill continue to dominate the macro narrative, with Senate Leader Mitch McConnell offering to drop the two most contentious issues - liability protection for businesses and support for state and local governments - in order to allow a slimmed-down package to pass. House Democrats continue to back a bipartisan initiative worth a little over $900 million, by contrast. The issue was made more complex on Tuesday by a new proposal from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, which Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed on account of what she considered inadequate funds for enhanced unemployment benefits.

289,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",Dutch prosecutors to investigate UBS chief over ING money laundering case,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Toby Sterling
ZURICH/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A Dutch court on Wednesday ordered a criminal investigation into the role UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers played in ING Group (NYSE:ING)'s failure to crack down on money laundering when he was head of the Dutch bank.
The investigation comes only a month after Hamers became head of UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, at a time when it is trying to move on from a legacy of costly court cases over money laundering and tax evasion.
The Swiss bank said Hamers would stay in his role while prosecutors conducted their investigation and that extensive due diligence, including an independent assessment of the Dutch anti-money laundering issues, had been conducted before he was hired.
""I have full confidence in Ralph's ability to lead our firm,"" UBS Chairman Axel Weber said. ""We were fully satisfied with the results of these independent evaluations and the assessment of the Dutch prosecutor at the time.""
The Swiss banking industry is trying to rebrand itself as a stable and trustworthy financial centre after global pressure effectively brought an end to a centuries-long policy of banking secrecy, but the investigation into Hamers, as well as the departure of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s chief executive this year over a spying scandal, risk tarnishing its efforts.
Swiss financial market supervisor FINMA said it also addressed the Dutch anti-money laundering issues in its review of Hamers' nomination and confirmed that he was ""fit and proper"" to take on the role.
ING agreed with Dutch prosecutors in 2018 to pay 775 million euros ($940 million) to settle a case over failing to spot money laundering and other criminal activities by its clients.
Hamers ran ING, the largest bank in the Netherlands, from 2013 until June this year, when he left to join UBS. 
Investors were unhappy with the 2018 decision because it failed to hold any individuals responsible. That leading to the ruling on Wednesday in which the court of appeal in The Hague said while the settlement still stood, prosecutors must investigate the role Hamers played.
""The court considers it important that in public criminal proceedings the standard is confirmed that managers of a bank do not go unpunished if they have actually led prohibited conduct,"" the ruling said.
'INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE'
Hamers was considered a bold choice for UBS as he came from outside the Swiss establishment and did not have executive experience in the staid world of wealth management.
However, his appointment was lauded by UBS and many observers as a chance for the bank to orient itself towards a more digital future, as Hamers had successfully implemented a digital turnaround at ING. 
ING, which is predominantly a retail bank, welcomed Wednesday's court ruling upholding its 2018 settlement and said it continued to ""enhance the management of compliance risks"".
Prosecutors said at the time that shortfalls in oversight had largely resulted from ING's lack of attention for compliance risk management and could not be blamed on any individual.
The new investigation is now likely to examine to what extent Hamers knew about the money laundering offences and failed to stop them. Hamers has not been charged with any offences at this point.
The prosecution of a current or former chief executive of a major Dutch company was very rare, prosecutors said.
""We had earlier in the same case decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute this man, and to justify this prosecution,"" a spokeswoman for the Dutch financial crimes prosecutor's office said.
""(But) the Appeals Court has decided that the former chief should be prosecuted. So we will follow out that order,"" she said, adding that she could not yet give a timeline for the investigation.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank plans more cost cuts to meet 2022 profit target,"By Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) will cut more costs, Germany's biggest bank said on Wednesday, as it confirmed a key profitability target for 2022 that analysts are not convinced it will achieve.
The bank is in the midst of a major overhaul under Chief Executive Christian Sewing and has already announced plans to cut headcount by 18,000 and exit some businesses.
It is aiming to return to profitability after five years of losses totalling more than 15 billion euros ($18.2 billion). 
Sewing heralded a new phase of the bank's restructuring, telling employees in a memo on Wednesday that ""we're now switching from defence to offence"".
The bank said in a presentation to investors it was still aiming for a return on tangible equity of 8% by 2022, a goal it originally set out in restructuring plans in 2019.
A consensus forecast published by Deutsche showed analysts expect a return on tangible equity of just 3.3% by 2022.
The bank said it would cut costs to 16.7 billion euros by 2022, compared with a previous target of 17 billion. It is looking at savings on office space and travel in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
Deutsche forecast revenues of 24.4 billion euros by 2022, more precise than the previous estimate of around 24.5 billion.
It now sees more revenue coming from its investment bank, with growth rising 3% from 2018-2022 versus 2% previously. But it has scaled back revenue expectations for its corporate bank.
The investment bank, long a drag on Deutsche's earnings, has benefited from market volatility, which has boosted trading. 
Many analysts say Sewing is making progress on turning Deutsche around. Last month, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) removed a negative outlook on the bank's credit rating, saying Deutsche was on a firmer strategic footing.
Analysts expect the bank to lose money in 2020, but return to profit next year.
Deutsche's shares, which hit a record low in March, are up around 38% so far this year. They were 0.6% higher in afternoon trading in Frankfurt.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks reached record highs on Wednesday as investors hailed efforts to provide more fiscal stimulus and positive news on COVID-19 vaccines, and sterling made gains as British and European leaders meet for talks on a Brexit trade deal.
U.S. lawmakers continued to negotiate over additional stimulus to help offset the economic impact of the pandemic while pursuing a stopgap government-funding bill. Leaders in both parties remain adamant a deal must be struck but are still working through sticking points.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",Crimped U.S. dry ice supply complicates rural U.S. vaccine release,"By Stephanie Kelly, Lisa Baertlein and Carl O'Donnell
NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As health officials from rural areas prepare to vaccinate people scattered over thousands of miles in what could be the most complex such campaign in U.S. history, they face the additional challenge of finding enough dry ice to keep a  Pfizer  vaccine that must be stored at sub Arctic temperatures from spoiling. 
The vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) could be authorized for emergency use as soon as this week and must be transported and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), requiring specialized ultra-cold freezers or dry ice. 
More than a dozen U.S. states, including Washington, New Mexico, Mississippi, Louisiana and Indiana, told Reuters they are rushing to secure dry ice to replenish suitcase-sized shipping containers from Pfizer. Once opened, if being used as temporary storage by a vaccination center, the vaccines can last a total of 30 days with re-icing every five days, Pfizer said.
The company said it believes there is sufficient dry ice supplies to serve the needs of all 50 states without serious constraints.
""This is the most challenging vaccination program ever attempted. (It) will be especially complicated in rural and remote communities,"" said Dr. Kelly Moore, an advisor to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine program and associate director at the Immunization Action Coalition.
While the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak was originally centered around densely populated areas in the U.S. Northeast, the coronavirus is now rampaging across the country, hitting small towns and rural areas with limited resources particularly hard. Rural areas account for about 60 million people, less than one fifth of U.S. population.
The Pfizer vaccine could soon be followed by another from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc that can be kept in a standard freezer.
Officials in states including Texas and Arkansas see Moderna's vaccine as the main solution for rural areas, but many state and hospital officials are planning to receive supplies of the Pfizer vaccine and expressed concerns about logistics involved.
Pfizer sends its vaccine in pizza box-sized minimum lots of just under 1,000 doses, along with a dry ice refill to last a total of five days.
After the added time it takes getting vaccines to rural communities, ""is that sufficient time for them to turn around and vaccinate folks?"" asked Soumi Saha, vice president of advocacy at Premier Inc, which coordinates purchases for thousands of U.S. hospitals and health systems.
""Are they going to say, 'Hey, you don't even have enough people, you're just gonna waste it'?” she added. ""Does that mean that you have these vacuums throughout the country where people don't even have access, because of that concern?""
Batesville, Indiana-based Margaret Mary Health, midway between Cincinnati and Indianapolis, has plans to prevent vaccine waste or spoilage as it prepares to inoculate healthcare workers over its 1,400-square-mile (3,626 square kms) area from two sites, including a drive-through at a local fire department.
It has multiple dry ice and deep freezer providers lined up to prevent mishaps, and will schedule vaccination appointments, with a backup list so no-shows do not lead to waste.
""If we take it out of the cooler, it's going into someone's arm,"" said Margaret Mary Chief Executive Tim Putnam.
VULNERABILITY IN DRY ICE (NYSE:ICE) SUPPLIES
With the optional dry ice refill of 23 kilograms (50.7 pounds) arranged with Pfizer and delivery company  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), vaccine recipients are on their own.
Many states are already scheduling dry ice deliveries. Gehm and Sons in Akron, Ohio, has a deal to provide Ohio with 15,000 pounds (6,804 kg) a week of dry ice pellets for 55 cents a pound, including delivery. 
Dry ice is made from carbon dioxide. The Compressed Gas Association trade group said it expects current dry ice production capacity to meet an estimated 5% increase in carbon dioxide demand from vaccines.
However, some dry ice suppliers said it is challenging to plan for the vaccine rollout because much is unknown about how much dry ice will be needed.
""There's going to be spots in other parts of the country that there's vulnerability or weakness in supply,"" said Steve Atkins, executive vice president of gases at nexAir in Memphis, Tennessee. 
Many ethanol plants - a major source of carbon dioxide - were shuttered early in the pandemic. Despite improvement, carbon dioxide production from ethanol plants remains about 25% below this time last year, according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Grant Hagberg's Indiana dry ice company is fielding calls from mostly local hospitals. Dry ice manufacturers and distributors ""are few and far between,"" said Hagberg, general manager.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely higher Wednesday, helped by growing confidence that U.S. lawmakers will agree on a coronavirus relief package. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract rose 75 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.2%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 9 points, or 0.1%. 
The Trump administration reentered the negotiations over a new stimulus deal late Tuesday, when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, via Twitter, proposed a $916 billion package. 
The offer included only $40 billion toward unemployment payments, an amount the Democrat leadership considered far too low. But investors have taken the fact the White House has reengaged in talks for the first time since the election as a positive sign that a compromise can be reached before the end of the year.
This comes as Covid-19 cases in the U.S. crossed the 15 million mark on Tuesday, with 213,000 new cases and a new record-high 104,600 people in hospital with the disease.
""We’re in for a very challenging period,"" top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told a virtual summit on Tuesday.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration flagged no new safety or efficacy concerns over the Pfixer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday. This should result in emergency use authorization on Thursday, when the FDA meets. President-elect Joe Biden said his administration will give 100 million shots in his first 100 days.
The U.K. is already injecting the public with this vaccine, but its regulators warned earlier Wednesday that people who have a history of ""significant"" allergic reactions should not receive the drug.
Earnings are due from computer software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB). However, the corporate focus Wednesday is likely to be on DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) as the food delivery company starts trading after its eagerly awaited IPO.
There’s more jobs data on the economic slate Wednesday, with the JOLTs Job Openings survey. This is expected to show 6.3 million openings in November, compared with 6.436 million in October.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, after Iraqi militants attacked a crude field in the country, reversing an earlier loss driven by a jump in U.S. fuel stockpiles.
The American Petroleum Institute stated late Tuesday that U.S. crude oil supplies rose by 1.14 million barrels for the week ending Dec. 4, rather than the 1.51-million-barrel draw expected. This puts the focus now on the supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $45.78 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $49.07. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,861.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2117.

295,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 07:06AM ET</span>",Column: Getting mighty crowded - searching for market elbow room,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - The biggest fear in markets is often of market behaviour itself - and it's enough to scare investors about overcrowded trades next year as an overwhelmingly bullish consensus unnerves many.
After a tumultuous collapse and rebound through 2020's pandemic shock, few major investment houses doubt that the broad sweep of fundamental drivers argues for outsize allocations to equity for the next 12 months.
Vaccine-aided rebounds in economic activity, persistently low borrowing costs, still plentiful cash, strong fiscal supports and reduced political uncertainty all point that way.
But they have been doing so for several months and even the so-called 'normalisation trade' got well underway after last month's vaccine breakthroughs prompted rapid sectoral rotations from pandemic winners to laggards.
Now the worry is that everyone is leaning the same way - always a red flag about over-exhuberance or excessive pessimism. Bank for International Settlements economist Claudio Borio on Monday warned about runaway markets, ""over-stretched valuations"" and the sheer amount of ""daylight"" between credit spreads and inevitable solvency risks ahead. 
The most obvious equity market anxiety - what Amundi's chief investment officer Pascal Blanque last week described as a ""perfect bubble"" - is Big Tech, the collection of 6-10 digital giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), that have led the stock market higher for years.
Perhaps the vaccine rotation will let the air out of this balloon gradually as a broader equity rally emerges. But Big Tech has already brushed off crowding fears for years.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s monthly survey shows ""long U.S. Tech and growth"" was identified by fund managers as the most crowded trade for the seventh straight month in November and in all but two months of the past year. Big Tech also surfed through 10 consecutive months to November 2018 with that uneviable tag.
And yet  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Investment Partners' chief investment officer Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen said he fears the large consensus more generally ""with everyone rolling into equities and the same type of strategies that could create more volatile markets somewhere late Q1 or early Q2.""
Several momentum indicators and sentiment surveys certainly indicate short-term positions getting stretched.
ECHOES OF '18?
Many investment banks compare and contrast the situation to the end of 2017 when a large consensus on long equity exposure met with some wild volatility early in 2018 amid extreme options positioning, steady S&P500 gains of about 15% through the summer and then a violent 20% fourth-quarter recoil.
Cumulative inflows to equity mutual funds had soared for over a year into early 2018, but have dissipated since. Their first substantial recovery has been late this year and, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC), is ""a blip"" compared to the near uninterrupted outflows seen since the end of 2018.
""The consensus view rarely plays out in its entirety as 2018 reminds us,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts told clients last week. ""For asset allocators, what is thus important is scale exposures to avoid an overly concentrated portfolio.""
The JPMorgan team tries to break down the confusion into what it sees as ""pockets of position over-extension"" against a still bullish longer-term picture of global markets holdings.
Using a range of proprietary momentum and flow indicators, their analysis identified crowded trades as being overweight non-U.S. developed market equities versus Wall St, short dollars against G10 currencies, overweight emerging market credit, overweight U.S. junk bonds versus investment grade, overweight euro peripheral credit and long copper and Bitcoin.
Less of problem were preferences for emerging equities and currencies, long oil and gold, individual stock trades eyeing value over growth or short duration in bonds. 
JPMorgan reckons ""long equity"" overall is ""crowded tactically"" due to red flag signals for momentum traders and likely heavy ongoing rebalancing flows by multi-asset and risk parity funds before year-end.
But proxies for global money supply mapped against relative historic holdings of cash, bond and equities by non-bank investors show little cause for concern, they added. 
""Any equity correction in the near term would represent a buying opportunity as, in our opinion, we are only in the middle of the current bull market.""
Not unlike 2018, one area of concern has been the options markets - where retail or day trader activity shot up during the middle of 2020, in part due to fee-waiving by trading platforms.
But despite the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines and the relatively straightforward U.S. election results, Wall St's VIX index of implied S&P500 volatility remains historically elevated above 20 - partly due to uncertainties around a still-raging pandemic but also perhaps due to demand for call options to play further stock gains through 2021.
However, this cuts both ways. Barclays points out VIX levels above historical averages - more than twice levels at the start of 2018 - mean risk-control funds targeting exposure to certain volatility levels likely also have below average stock holdings.
And so, like pandemic advice itself, the message from most experts is to avoid crowds for now if you can, but make sure you're still part of the recovery when it comes.

(Reuters) - European shares hit February highs on Wednesday, joining a global rally on optimism around progress in COVID-19 vaccines and U.S. stimulus package, while all eyes turned to make-or-break Brexit talks.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index and London's FTSE 100 both climbed 0.5%. Germany's DAX jumped as much as 1.3% to a three-month peak. 
Data showed German exports rose less than expected in October, but foreign trade still gave Europe's largest economy a boost at the start of the fourth quarter as it struggles to avoid slipping into a double-dip contraction. 
Meanwhile, UK Brexit supremo, Michael Gove, sounded hopeful of a compromise on fishing in Brexit trade talks, but others including EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier and UK PM Boris Johnson, said a no-deal scenario was more likely.
Johnson is to meet European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at Brussels for dinner on Wednesday in a last ditch attempt to seal a deal.
""It will be a coin toss, there is a lot of symbolism,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank in Amsterdam. 
""But our base-case scenario is still that we will see a very skinny deal before the end of this year,"" he said, adding that Wednesday's optimism was more from progress on a U.S. stimulus package after the Trump's administration proposed a $916 billion coronavirus relief package.

297,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Tesla Equity Sale Comes at a Good Time for Index-Fund Trackers,"(Bloomberg) -- With Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. about to be added to the S&P 500, people have wondered where index-tracking mutual funds will find the $80 billion of stock they’ll need to own in Elon Musk’s car-maker. Now they know: at least some of it will come from Elon Musk’s car-maker.
Taking advantage of this year’s 677% surge, Tesla said in a filing Tuesday it plans to sell as much as $5 billion in common stock. The news came two weeks before the $616 billion company’s shares are scheduled to enter the S&P 500 Index, the largest addition ever.
Given Tesla’s mammoth size, its S&P 500 debut is expected to spark billions of dollars worth of buying from index-tracking funds. Handily, the company’s third trip to the capital markets this year may help supply those shares. Tesla is expected to use the money to fund its investment program, after the company more than doubled its planned spending on plants and equipment this year.
“They’re adding some lubrication to the index-addition process,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR), who surmised in a blog last week that the company would need to issue new shares before the addition. “It’s not enough to satisfy the demand, which is about $80 billion if my off-the-cuff estimate is correct, but it helps by identifying some supply.”
Tesla has surged nearly eightfold in 2020, swelling its market cap from just $75 billion at the start of the year. The company’s massive size led S&P Dow Jones Indices -- the index’s overseer -- to consider adding the company in several steps, before deciding on one.
Selling equity or equity-linked securities ahead of an index addition isn’t without precedent.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). sold $1 billion worth of convertible notes just before its own S&P 500 debut back in 2018.
To be sure, a lot of Tesla stock trades with or without the offering, making it a bit easier on index trackers to locate shares. With $22 billion worth of shares changing hands each day, Tesla is the highest-volume stock on U.S. exchanges over the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s 40% above the next closest rival -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). -- and is 55 times as much as the average for S&P 500 members.
A combination of a unusually early notice by the index’s overseer on Tesla’s inclusion and the stock’s elevated trading volume means there will be enough liquidity to accommodate demand from passive funds, according to Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA Research.
“This is an extremely liquid stock on a normal day and that high liquidity will provide cushion for all investors that opt to get in,” Rosenbluth said by phone. Passive funds “will be buyers regardless of price,” he added. “It’s the logical time to do a secondary offering when this dilution to shareholders won’t have much impact. Investors are eager for shares and are willing to add.”

298,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",Citigroup heads to trial seeking to undo nearly $900 million Revlon blunder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) is heading to trial on Wednesday, hoping to convince a Manhattan federal judge to undo a nearly $900 million blunder where it used its own money to repay lenders of Revlon Inc, the struggling cosmetics company.
The unusual case could provide insight into Wall Street banks' relationships with clients, and guidance on steps that banks must take to safeguard how money is moved.
It stemmed from an Aug. 11 incident where Citigroup mistakenly wired $893 million to Revlon's lenders, appearing to pay off a loan that was not due until 2023, rather than a planned $7.8 million interest payment.
The bank had been acting as the loan agent for Revlon, which did not have enough cash to prepay the loan.
While some 200 Revlon lenders have repaid Citigroup, the bank is suing hedge fund and asset managers such as Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management to recover $501 million that it said remains due.
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman will preside over the nonjury trial, which will be conducted by videoconference and may last four days.
Citigroup has said the defendants did not act in good faith in keeping an overpayment they knew Revlon could not afford and which they did not even tell clients about, and which an HPS staffer called the product of a ""fat fingered"" bank employee.
The bank's North American loan chief and global head of loan and risk management services are expected to testify.
Revlon's lenders have countered that they had no reason to think a sophisticated international bank would pay them by mistake, and that they were simply paid a debt Revlon owed.
They may also argue that they thought Revlon's billionaire controlling shareholder Ronald Perelman stepped in to bail the company out, as he had done before.
Furman said on Monday the ""heart of the trial"" concerns whether there was a ""discharge for value"" entitling lenders to keep Citigroup's money.

The case is In re: Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-06539.

299,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>",Tesco's Asia deal paves way for 5 billion pound shareholder windfall,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Shareholders in Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) can look forward to a 5 billion pound ($6.7 billion) windfall in the new year after the group said it would complete a $10.6 billion sale of its Asian businesses to Thailand's CP Group next week.
Tesco agreed to sell its businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to Dhanin Chearavanont's CP Group in March.
Britain's biggest retailer said that CP Group, which runs its 12,000 7-Eleven convenience stores through CP All and about 80 cash-and-carry stores under Siam Makro, was satisfied with the approval notice from Thailand's Office of Trade Competition Commission.
This, plus approval from the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs in Malaysia on Nov. 10, means there are no further conditions outstanding and the disposal is expected to complete on or around Dec. 18.
""This sale allows us to focus on our businesses across Europe and to continue delivering for customers, make a significant contribution to our pension deficit and return value to shareholders,"" said Tesco CEO Ken Murphy.
Tesco plans to return about 5 billion pounds of the proceeds to shareholders via a special dividend, together with a share consolidation, and will also put 2.5 billion pounds into its pension fund.
The special dividend is expected to be paid around Feb. 26 2021, conditional on shareholder approval at a meeting around Feb. 11.
Last week, Tesco said it would pay back to government 585 million pounds of COVID-19 business rates relief, which prompted rivals to do the same.
Murphy said the decision to return the relief was ""completely disconnected"" to its plans to pay a special dividend.
Shares in Tesco were up 1.3% at 1007 GMT, paring 2020 losses to 10.8%. 
While Britain's three major quoted retailers - Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - have performed well during the pandemic, their share prices have not.
""We see strong value in UK supermarkets, manifested in fulsome (free cash flow) yields that if equity markets do not value then acquirers will,"" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.

300,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",U.K. Says Those With Severe Allergy Shouldn’t Get Pfizer Vaccine,"(Bloomberg) -- People with a significant history of allergies should not currently receive the Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), the U.K.’s National Health Service said, after two people experienced reactions from the shots.
The warning on Wednesday, came a day after the U.K. became the first western nation to begin a Covid vaccination program, after the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot last week.
“As is common with new vaccines the MHRA have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination,” Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said in a statement.
June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said her team looked at two case reports of allergic reactions on Tuesday evening. Both of the people, staff members of the National Health Service, are recovering well, the NHS said in a statement.
“We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature, that if we need to strengthen our advice now that we’ve had this experience in the vulnerable populations, we get that advice to the field immediately,” Raine told a panel of lawmakers on Wednesday.
Pfizer and BioNTech said they’re supporting the MHRA in its investigation.
“In the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial, this vaccine was generally well tolerated with no serious safety concerns reported by the independent data monitoring committee,” the companies said in a statement.

301,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 05:52AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Just When You Thought It Was Safe to Get Back in the Water,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The marketing slogan “Just When You Thought It Was Safe to Get Back Into the Water” was perhaps the only memorable thing about the dismal sequel to Steven Spielberg’s classic “Jaws”. It may be coming back to the minds of investors reading headlines about the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) this morning.
Sky News reported that two British healthcare professionals who received the jab earlier this week suffered allergic reactions to it. The U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency  is now advising that “people who have a history of ‘significant’ allergic reactions should not currently receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine,” according to Sky News.
""As is common with new vaccines the MHRA have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of significant allergic reactions responded adversely yesterday,” Sky quoted Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the National Health Service in England as saying.
He added that both are “recovering well.""
That final sentence is important. It should allay worries that the vaccine may do lasting harm to those it is designed to protect. However, it is still the kind of setback that must dull the edge of the optimism around the vaccine narrative, which fired European stocks to their best November ever.
Over 20% of the U.K. population, and almost half the adult population, suffers from one or more chronic allergy, according to various studies referenced by the charity Allergy U.K. That is a number big enough to have a nationwide impact on the take-up rate for the Pfizer drug.  
It will be interesting to see whether  Moderna  's (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine, which is based on the same ‘messenger RNA’ technology and has shown similar efficacy characteristics, also provokes the same response.
Moreover, the emergence of such problems comes against the backdrop of suspicions that the U.K. may have rushed through authorization of the drug for political advantage. They are not limited to a lunatic fringe of anti-vaxxers, either: the U.S.’s top doctor Anthony Fauci voiced such concerns initially before subsequently retracting them. Various U.K. government ministers put the speed of authorization in the U.K. down to its new freedom from EU bureaucracy, although MHRA head June Raine rather undermined the claims by noting that the U.K. was still subject to EU regulation and that it had merely made use of a provision in existing EU law.
If the NHS employees continue their recovery, then the fallout should be limited, and the cyclical recovery can continue. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna drugs are not the only ones in town, after all: a peer review confirmed AstraZeneca's (LON:AZN) experimental drug has over 70% efficacy, more than enough to serve public health purposes. A preliminary stage 3 trial of a drug developed by Chinese biotech company Sinopharm indicates it has 86% efficacy, according to authorities in the United Arab Emirates, where the trial is being conducted.
All the same, it’s an uncomfortable reminder of the bumpy road that still lies ahead for markets as they navigate a way out of the pandemic crisis."

303,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: How high can you go? Wall Street exuberance makes some uneasy,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Optimism is surging among U.S. stock investors, as Wall Street indexes hit records at the end of a year marred by a global pandemic that sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin. 
Investors have lowered cash reserves and poured money into stocks following breakthroughs on COVID-19 vaccines, expectations of more fiscal stimulus and less uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election. 
Yet some worry that stocks now could be more vulnerable to any bad news like unexpected setbacks in the pandemic or delays in stimulus. 
“Sentiment can be noisy at times and you don’t usually have everything agreeing,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “Right now is an exception to that, where almost every sentiment indicator that I look at shows excessive optimism.” 
Some say high stock-price valuations could be a warning sign. The S&P 500 now trades at just over 22 times forward earnings, well above its historic average of 15.3, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
Another valuation measure, comparing the S&P 500's market capitalization to nominal U.S. gross domestic product, or the ""Buffett Ratio,"" is at its highest level in history, according to Yardeni Research.
""The current altitude of the Buffett Ratio and other valuation measures has us all wondering how much higher they can go without risking a severe market meltdown,"" Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist of Yardeni Research, said in a note.
One key reason for the feel-good mood is the performance of the stock market itself. Unprecedented support from the Federal Reserve and U.S. lawmakers bolstered investor confidence and pushed many to take risk during the worst economic downturn in decades.
The optimism could add to the market’s momentum during December, historically the third-best month of the year for stock performance, according to CFRA Research. 
The S&P 500 closed on Tuesday at 3,702.25, up 14.6% for the year and well above the median year-end price target of strategists, according to a Reuters survey late last month. Among the banks whose 2020 price targets for the index has recently been hit is a 3,700 forecast by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and BMO Capital Markets' target of 3,650.
""There’s one thing that makes investor optimism typically go higher and that’s higher stock prices,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist, Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
The most recent survey of fund managers by BofA Global Research found professional investors at their most optimistic about stocks since January 2018, with a net 46% of fund managers saying they are overweight equities. 
Cash levels, which when low indicate market optimism as investors buy assets, were back to early-year lows, according to the survey. 
""We expect investors will continue to shift assets away from money market funds and towards equities,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note.
A worsening spread of the virus may already be taking a bite out of the nascent U.S. recovery, though stocks have shrugged off recent shaky economic data. The U.S. economy added the fewest workers in six months in November, hindered by a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
Stocks could also see pressure should hiccups arise for the rollout of vaccines against COVID-19, since expectations for an economic re-opening hinge on successful distribution. Insufficient economic stimulus from the U.S. Congress could also test optimism, investors said.
The latest weekly survey https://www.aaii.com/sentimentsurvey? by the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) found bearish sentiment at an 11-month low.
Flows into all equity funds last month provisionally totaled $127 billion, topping the previous monthly record set in January 2018 by some $17 billion, according to fund-tracker EPFR.
Another sign of optimism is in the options market. The ratio of puts, which are the right to sell an asset, to calls, which are a right to buy, is at the lowest point since 2000 on a monthly average basis, according to Lerner.

“Investors' expectations of the stock market now have risen and it just means the hurdle rate is higher for positive surprises,"" Lerner said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will meet Ursula von der Leyen, president of the EU's executive European Commission, in Brussels later Wednesday to try and solve the issues their negotiators have struggled with for months.
The differences over fishing rights, fair competition and ways to solve future disputes may still exist, but the decision of the U.K. government to drop controversial clauses in the U.K. Internal Market Bill, which would clash with the Brexit divorce agreement, may help with the discussions. The move would effectively leave much of the Northern Irish economy under EU regulations next year, breaking a promise made by Johnson to avoid any weakening of the U.K.'s integrity.
There is now a ""smoother glidepath"" towards a trade deal U.K. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News Wednesday, after the ditching of the clauses.
Adding to the positive tone is renewed confidence with Covid-19 vaccines. 
The U.K. started vaccinating its public with the Pfizer/BioNTech injection on Tuesday, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found no new safety or efficacy concerns, suggesting prompt American authorisation. 
Additionally, the rival Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe and effective, researchers confirmed in The Lancet journal on Tuesday. There had been doubts expressed about this drug when its interim trial results were made public a couple of weeks ago as three efficacy levels were reported.
More monetary support looks likely this week, with the European Central Bank holding its latest policy-setting meeting on Thursday. The central bank is widely expected to increase and extend its pandemic bond-buying program.

Loetscher, who has been with Deutsche since 2018, was previously with EY and among the top auditors of Wirecard, which collapsed in an accounting fraud.
German prosecutors last week opened an investigation into partners at EY who audited Wirecard after an accounting watchdog filed a report accusing them of criminality in their work for the failed company.

The Swiss food and drink giant said the brand, which is available in Australia and New Zealand, would offer burgers, sausages, nuggets and mince, and will also sell dishes aimed to appeal to Chinese taste-buds, such as kung pao chicken, braised meatballs and pork belly. 
Demand for alternatives to regular meat is surging due to concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment.
Entrants to China's meat substitute market in recent months have ranged from domestic firms Zhenmeat and Starfield to U.S. firm Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc, which has collaborations with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Yum China's KFC chain. 
Harvest Gourmet products sold in China will be produced by Nestle's faux-meat factory in Tianjin, its first in Asia.
The brand will open an online store on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group's Tmall marketplace this month, and will gradually start offering products for sale from Alibaba's Hema supermarket chain by the end of 2020, Nestle said. 
""We see China leading the trend towards a new generation of plant-based food in Asia, as people look for options that are good for them and good for the planet,"" Rashid Qureshi, chief executive of Nestle Greater China, said in a statement. 
The jury, however, is still out on whether Chinese consumers are really embracing plant-based meat substitutes. 

A survey last month by state broadcaster CCTV showed that nearly half of 2,659 respondents were unwilling to try fake meat, and just 13.7% said they had tried some products and they tasted good.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Mom-and-pop Indian investors increasingly buying U.S. stocks have been drawn to a company that has no presence in India so far: electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Indians are placing bigger-than-ever bets on U.S. stocks this year as the American stock market has recovered faster than markets in India and other emerging nations following a crash sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
While firms such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) - which have a significant presence in India - are popular among Indian investors venturing into U.S. stocks, data from brokerages shows Tesla has emerged as a new favourite.
Indian brokerage Vested Finance said its accounts held $2.5 million worth of Tesla stock in November, up from just $76,000 at March-end. Another brokerage firm, Stockal, said its clients' Tesla holdings have quadrupled to $10 million during the period. 
Tesla shares surged around 450% during that time.
""Some investors have just created accounts to be able to invest in Tesla,"" Vested's CEO Viram Shah said. ""We would have never imagined that a company which is not even present in India would be the most popular.""
The frenzy around the stock comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has signalled an India launch is impending. Musk in October tweeted the electric car maker will foray into India ""next year for sure"", and had earlier tweeted about a 2020 launch.
Tesla's plans of a possible launch come when India is becoming focused on promoting the use of electric vehicles, even though Musk has previously flagged concerns around high Indian import duties.
Gaurav Jhunjhunwala, 33, became a Musk fan after reading his biography and has even paid $1,000 in booking fees to get Tesla's Model 3 electric sedan whenever it launches in India. While that wait has been long, he invested $100,000 in Tesla shares in May, and buys 30 shares every other week.

""I just like the way the guy (Musk) thinks,"" Jhunjhunwala said. ""He is trying to make the world a better place.""

SoftBank's shares are seen as chronically undervalued by company executives, with debate around the benefits of a buyout intensifying as they plunged to lows in March.
Record share buybacks and a string of asset sales have driven a 180% share price gain to two-decade highs since then, giving the group a market capitalization of around $140 billion and raising the hurdle for a buyout. 
Management buyouts remain rare in Japan, where being listed is a mark of status for companies, and any move to take SoftBank private faces considerable internal opposition.
Son owns a quarter of SoftBank's shares and would need to lift his shareholding ratio to two thirds to squeeze out minority shareholders. 
SoftBank's revised scheme would aim to buy back shares when the price dips rather than launching a formal buyout with the aim of limiting the premium paid, Bloomberg reported citing unidentified sources.
The group spent $1.6 billion on buybacks in November, an increase from the previous month but less than half its July outlay.
SoftBank was not immediately reachable for comment. 
The group has raised $80 billion through asset sales causing speculation about how Son, who is said to prefer buying over selling, will deploy the cash pile. 

""SoftBank has grown to what it is through an enthusiastic use of other people's money which would end with privatization,"" said Kirk Boodry, analyst at Redex Research, adding a buyout would limit Son's freedom to invest elsewhere.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp put its revamped Mirai hydrogen fuel cell car, with 30% greater range, on sale on Wednesday in a fresh push to promote zero-emission technology amid growing demand for electric vehicles, including its own.
Toyota has failed until now to win drivers over to fuel cell vehicles (FCV), which remain a niche technology despite Japanese government backing, amid concerns about lack of fuelling stations, resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions. 
""The new Mirai will serve as a new departure point for creating a hydrogen-based society of the future,"" Toyota said in a statement. It will cost about 5 million yen ($48,000) after subsidies, about the same as its predecessor. 
By the end of September Toyota had sold only 11,100 of its first generation Mirai, almost six years after its launch. Most other automakers have eschewed FCV in favour of electric vehicles (EV).
In 2019, automakers sold 2.1 million electric cars, 40% more than the previous year, the International Energy Agency says. 
The new Mirai launch comes after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced a goal in October to cut Japan's carbon emissions to zero by 2050. 
Toyota had planned to use the postponed 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo as a platform to showcase its fuel cell technology, with 100 buses meant to shuttle visitors between venues. 
The Japanese firm is also looking to China, the world's biggest automarket, which has just about 7,000 FCVs, versus more than 4 million EVs, to boost demand.

Fresh support measures for FCVs announced in September included requiring projects with government subsidies to boost the number of hydrogen-charging stations and efforts to cut the price of the fuel.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, after U.S. shares set a fresh record after U.S. stimulus hopes overrode concerns about ever-rising COVID-19 cases globally.
The number of global COVID-19 cases passed the 68.1 million mark, with the number of U.S. cases passing the 15.1 million mark, as of Dec. 9, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.12% by 11:06 PM ET (3:06 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.55%. Data released earlier in the day showed that November’s consumer price index (CPI), came in below expectations, contracting 0.6% month-on-month and 0.5% year-on-year. This was the first decline in Chinese consumer prices seen since 2009.
The producer price index (PPI) contracted 1.5% year-on-year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.21%. A new law will enable authorities to lock down parts of the city hit by COVID-19 for up to seven days. Restriction measures in the city have also been tightened further, with restaurants to stop dine-in services from 6pm onwards and gyms as well as beauty parlors ordered closed from Thursday as 100 new daily COVID-19 cases were recorded on Tuesday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 1.09% and South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.25%
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.66%. December's Westpac Consumer Sentiment, released earlier in the day, saw its highest growth in a decade as it jumped to 4.1% against November’s 2.5% jump.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted on Tuesday that he presented a fresh $916 billion COVID-19 relief measures package to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The price tag is slightly higher than that for a $908 billion package proposed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers during the previous week.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also suggested setting aside some issues that have been roadblocks to passing the measures, which was viewed by some investors as a strategic retreat aimed at striking a deal.
Congress is working against the clock, with only two days left until a Dec. 11 deadline to avoid a government shutdown. The latest developments increased hopes that Republicans and Democrats will reach a consensus ahead of the deadline, even as Democrats oppose McConnell’s insistence on protecting employers from lawsuits. McConnell for his part has criticized Democrats’ demands for assistance to state and local authorities, which he views as a bailout.
The opportunities are “in equities and credit, so we are overweight, we are risk on … we know that we will be tested again next year in terms of COVID-19 and elsewhere,”  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors Global Chief Investment Officer Richard Lacaille told Bloomberg.
On the central bank front, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve will both hand down their final policy decisions for 2020 on Thursday. The ECB is widely expected to announce an increase and extension to its COVID-19 bond-buying program.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 09:50PM ET</span>","FBI was 'persistent' about getting information in Huawei CFO’s extradition case, court hears","By Sarah Berman
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was ""very persistent"" in seeking information from border agents after Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's arrest two years ago, a Canadian border official testified in court on Tuesday.
Nicole Goodman, a chief at the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) in charge of agents investigating Meng the day she was detained, told the court that an Ottawa-based legal attache for the FBI reached out repeatedly asking for Meng's travel history in Canada and other private information after she was taken into custody by the Canadian federal police on a U.S. warrant for bank fraud.
Goodman told the court she did not have the authority to share the requested information and was concerned that someone else within the CBSA who was not familiar with the case might share the information without authorization.
""I would never be releasing information to the FBI at my level,"" she said.
Meng's lawyers have argued that U.S. and Canadian authorities illegally coordinated during the investigation and arrest. In particular they claim that Canadian border agents intentionally gave identifying details about Meng’s electronic devices - including passcodes - to Canadian police.
They further allege that Canadian police shared those details with the FBI.
Prosecutors are trying to establish that Meng's arrest by the Canadian federal police and the investigation by border officials were above board.
Meng, 48, is facing charges of bank fraud in the United States for allegedly misleading HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
She has said she is innocent and is fighting the extradition from under house arrest in Vancouver.
Goodman testified that she discovered the CBSA may have accidentally shared passcodes with police during a debrief meeting after Meng's arrest. CBSA has previously testified that the passcodes to Meng's electronic devices were shared with the Canadian federal police in error.
Goodman said when the topic of information sharing came up, agent Scott Kirkland went pale and looked distressed.
""I remember it vividly,"" she said. ""I wanted to know, what’s wrong here, Scott?""
Goodman learned that Kirkland had written passcodes on a piece of paper, and he did not know whether the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) took it or not at that time, she testified.
She believed the passcode sharing was ""100 percent accidental.""
Earlier on Tuesday RCMP Sergeant Ross Lundie, who was serving as the force’s airport liaison when Meng was arrested, told the court that he recalled overhearing one of his RCMP colleagues discussing passcodes, potentially to Meng’s devices, with a Canadian border agent.
But he said he did not realize the potential significance of the conversation on the day of Meng’s arrest.
""At that time I had no idea why there would be passwords to phones ... obtained by anybody,"" he said. ""I should have asked for clarity.""
The witness testimony this week has generated more attention after news last week that U.S. prosecutors are discussing a deal with lawyers for Meng to resolve criminal charges against her, signaling a potential end to a case that has strained ties between the United States, China and Canada.
Meng’s arrest caused a chill in diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Shortly after Meng was detained, China arrested two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who now face spying charges.
On Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the release of the two Canadians was his ""top priority,"" while declining to comment on the talks to release Meng.

Meng’s case is scheduled to wrap up in April 2021.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co said on Wednesday its drug pipeline is poised to drive annual sales up by more than 50%, to 5 trillion yen ($48.01 billion) in the next decade.
Japan's biggest drugmaker is trying to turn the spotlight on its growth prospects after its $59 billion takeover of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP), completed last year. Since the merger, the company's shares have underperformed domestic and global peers as it focused on selling $10 billion in non-core assets to reduce debt.
""One of the questions that we've had to ask ourselves is, how can we help our investor base better understand our pipeline, and assume the same energy and enthusiasm that we have?"" research and development president Andy Plump said in an online briefing to analysts and media. 
The company outlined a wave of 12 new drugs planned for the next few years, including a dengue fever vaccine and its Orexcin narcolepsy drugs, which it expects could deliver $6 billion in annual sales. 
The 5 trillion yen sales target by March 2031 compares with estimated revenue of 3.2 trillion yen this fiscal year.
""Takeda's management is keenly aware of its poor stock performance and would like analysts to take a more bullish view of its pipeline,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Stephen Barker wrote in a research note. ""But analysts may not be convinced until more data is available.""
The Shire acquisition, completed in January 2019, expanded Takeda's pipeline and diversified its global sales. But it also saddled the drugmaker with a large debt pile.
The company reached its goal of asset disposals when it agreed in August to sell its Japanese consumer healthcare business to Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX). 

Takeda's shares, down 6.5% this year, rose 1.2% in Tokyo trading versus a 0.9% gain in the broader market.

(Reuters) -DoorDash Inc said on Tuesday it sold shares in its initial public offering at $102 apiece, above its upwardly revised target range, to raise $3.37 billion in what will be one of the biggest U.S. stock market debuts of 2020.
The IPO gives the U.S. food delivery startup a fully diluted valuation of around $38 billion, more than double its $16 billion valuation during a private fundraising round in June.
DoorDash, the largest U.S. third-party delivery company for restaurants, had aimed to sell 33 million shares at $90 to $95 apiece. It had earlier targeted a price range of between $75 and $85. 
The share offering comes as DoorDash and rivals Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, Grubhub Inc and Postmates Inc have benefited from a surge in demand for food delivery services due to widespread COVID-19 restrictions.
DoorDash joins other big Silicon Valley companies, including Palantir Technologies Inc and Snowflake Inc, that have had blockbuster IPOs, riding on a stock market rally in the second half of the year fueled by stimulus money and hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine.
DoorDash said its revenue for the third quarter ended September reached $879 million, up from $239 million in a similar period last year. The company posted a loss of $43 million after reporting its first quarterly profit of $23 million three months earlier.
Founded in 2013, DoorDash is backed by the Vision Fund managed by Japanese tech giant SoftBank Group Corp, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and sovereign wealth fund Government of Singapore Investment Corp.
The company's shares are set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker ""DASH.""

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for DoorDash's offering.

(Reuters) -Joby Aviation, an electric passenger aircraft developer, said on Tuesday it would take over Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's flying taxi unit, Elevate, the second cash-burning business the ride-hailing company has sold off in two days. 
Joby did not disclose the terms of the deal, but said Uber had also agreed to invest a further $75 million in the Santa Cruz, California-based company, bringing its total investment to $125 million. Joby has raised more than $720 million in funding since it was founded in 2009, most of it from  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. 
Uber on Monday announced the sale of its self-driving unit to autonomous vehicle startup Aurora in a move it said would accelerate the ride-sharing company's goal to achieve profitability.
Uber has promised investors to achieve profitability on a basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the end of 2021. During the last quarter, Uber reported a $625 million adjusted EBITDA loss.
The company has said it would focus on its core ride-hailing and food delivery platforms to achieve profitability and implemented stringent cost cutting measures, including large rounds of layoffs.
While losses at Uber's self-driving, Elevate and other technology programs had slightly narrowed this year, the company still reported a third quarter $104 million adjusted EBITDA loss for the segment.
Elevate began in 2016 and its team until earlier this year promised the launch of flying taxi services in Los Angeles, Dallas and Melbourne in 2023.
Uber and Joby on Tuesday said they would each integrate the other company's services into their own app to allow customers to book seamless ground and air transportation in the future.
Uber in January announced it had partnered with South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co to develop electric air taxis as part of its Elevate program.

Hyundai did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain will suspend retaliatory tariffs imposed on U.S. goods as part of a dispute over aircraft subsidies from Jan. 1, the trade department said, describing the move as an attempt to de-escalate a damaging international trade conflict.
The decision marks the start of Britain's divergence from European Union trade policy, coming into effect on the day its exit from the bloc's rules and regulations is complete, and signals an ambition to forge closer ties with the United States.
The multi-billion dollar tit-for-tat tariff battle between the United States and the European Union relates to a long-running row over state subsidies for aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
""Ultimately, we want to de-escalate the conflict and come to a negotiated settlement so we can deepen our trading relationship with the U.S. and draw a line under all this,"" trade minister Liz Truss said in a statement.
No comment was immediately available from the U.S. government or the European Union.
Although Britain formally left the EU in January, under the terms of an 11-month transitional exit arrangement it joined the EU in applying tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. goods in November. 
The measures were authorised by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) following a 2019 WTO decision to approve U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU goods.
However, Britain said it would suspend its tariffs to try to persuade the United States to reach a settlement, albeit with a warning that they could re-impose them ""if satisfactory progress towards an agreeable settlement is not made"".
For its part, the EU is pessimistic about the chances of an abrupt change in policy from the United States, even as Donald Trump's ""America First"" presidency comes to an end.
STEEL ROW REMAINS
Truss has repeatedly criticised the U.S. tariffs, which have hurt British exports such as Scotch whisky.
The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States applauded Britain's decision and urged Washington to seize the chance to work with Britain to resolve both the aircraft subsidy dispute and move to end steel and aluminum tariffs.
Having quit the EU following a narrow vote in a 2016 referendum, Britain is keen to capitalise on its new-found freedom to strike bilateral trade deals.
The United States is seen as top of the British wish list, although talks with Trump's administration made only limited progress and it remains to be seen how highly President-elect Joe Biden will prioritise a deal.
U.S. and European officials are meeting at a senior level to resolve the aircraft subsidies dispute, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. 
Truss said separate tariffs on U.S. goods relating to a row over steel and aluminium would remain in place after Jan. 1 to protect Britain's steel and aluminium industries.
The United States in 2018 imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium coming from the EU, citing national security concerns. The EU, including Britain, retaliated with its own set of tariffs, arguing the U.S. concerns were unfounded.
Truss said the British government would consult with the steel and aluminium sector to see if the tariffs on U.S. goods could be better tailored to suit the British economy.

Musk confirmed the move in an interview with Matt Murray, the Wall Street Journal's editor in chief.
""The two biggest things that I got going on right now are the Starship development in South Texas ... and then the big new U.S. factory for Tesla,"" the 49-year-old Tesla chief said.
""It wasn't necessarily a great use of my time here (in California)"".
Texas might potentially offer some tax reprieve for the world's second richest man. It does not collect personal income tax while California has some of the highest state tax rates in the United States.
An over 670% jump in Tesla shares this year has boosted Musk's net worth from $27 billion to $155 billion, just behind Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Jeff Bezos, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
In a conversation touching a wide range of topics including government intervention, technology companies and corporate policy, Musk criticized CEOs of other U.S. companies for not focusing enough on their products.
""If you find yourself spending a lot of time giving presentations and reviewing spreadsheets, you're barking up the wrong tree,"" Musk said.
The billionaire also compared himself to a war general and said, ""If you think about war ... do you want the general in some like ivory tower or on the front lines? The troops are going to fight a lot harder if they see the general on the front lines.""
Musk said tech companies in Silicon Valley had too much influence on the world and predicted a decrease in their power.
On Tesla's move to raise $5 billion in capital, he said: ""We thought we can retire a lot of the debt and increase the security of the company ... have more of a war chest.""
Musk has earned Tesla stock options related to his 2018 pay package that are currently worth almost $20 billion.

GameStop (NYSE:GME) fell 10% in after-market trading.
The company reported a third quarter non-GAAP loss of $0.29, compared with consensus estimates for a loss of $0.84 a share. Revenue fell 31%, to $1 billion from a year earlier, below estimates of $1.09 billion.
Comparable store sales declined 24.6%, which was deeper than the consensus estimate for a 20.5% drop.
The weakness on the top line was blamed on an ""unplanned shift of software titles later into the fourth fiscal quarter, and in some cases, into fiscal 2021, and an ""11% reduction in the store base, as part of the company’s de-densification strategy.""
E-commerce sales, however, helped to partly plug the gap, rising 257%.  
""Our third quarter results were in-line with our muted expectations and reflected operating during the last few months of a seven-year console cycle and a global pandemic, which pressured sales and earnings,"" the company said.
Looking ahead, however, the company touted optimism over sales in the fourth quarter following the launch of new gaming consoles.  
""We anticipate, for the first time in many quarters, that the fourth quarter will include positive year-on-year sales growth and profitability, reflecting the introduction of new gaming consoles, our elevated omni-channel capabilities and continued benefits from our cost and efficiency initiatives, even with the potential further negative impacts on our operations due to the global COVID-19 pandemic."""

(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint on Tuesday aimed at stopping Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co from buying Billie, Inc, which sells women's razors and other body care products.
The agency, which works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law, said P&G was the top seller of razors for both men and women, including the Gillette and Venus brands. 
The FTC said Billie sold quality razors for women at a moderate price. In its marketing, Billie highlights the so-called ""pink tax,"" collected by companies that charge women more than men for comparable products.

The P&G deal for Billie, which began selling in November 2017, was announced in January.
""Billie saw an opportunity to challenge P&G's position as the market leader by finding underserved, price and quality conscious customers,"" said Ian Conner, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. ""As its sales grew, Billie was likely to expand into brick-and-mortar stores, posing a serious threat to P&G.""
P&G said it was considering its options. ""We were disappointed by the FTC's decision, and we're considering our options in light of the decision,"" a spokeswoman for the company said.

Investing.com - The Dow closed higher Tuesday led by a rise in energy stocks and further signs of progress on efforts from lawmakers to reach a consensus on the $908 billion stimulus bill.     
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.35%, or 104 points after recovery from intraday losses. The S&P 500 was up 0.28%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.50% to close at record highs. 
Hopes for a stimulus package before the end of the year received a boost as the White House is reportedly pressing Senate Republicans to consider including a second stimulus check in the final bipartisan $908 billion relief proposal, the Washington Post reported. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell was said to have floated the idea of dropping the stimulus check, government support for state and local, and liability insurance from coronavirus-related claims - three key sticking points from the bill.  
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, said there was support from both sides of the political aisle for state and local government support.    
The ongoing talks on Capitol Hill come in the wake of a historic day on the vaccine front as the UK began to distribute the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In the U.S., meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration said the inoculation met its safety standards, with many expecting the health regulator to grant the vaccine emergency use authorization in the coming days. 
The vaccine news eased investor worries about the economic impact from fresh lockdown measures across states to curb the spread of infections and injected a shot of optimism across value stocks, with energy stocks leading the advance.
 Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) were among the biggest gainers in energy, with the latter up 6% as investors bet on a vaccine-fueled uptick in demand.
Industrials were not far behind, up nearly 1%, underpinned by an 8% surge in Equifax (NYSE:EFX) as the consumer credit reporting company received an upgrade from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) to overweight from underweight.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 0.7% after the aircraft maker said orders for its beleaguered 737 Max, which was involved in two fatal crashes, declined by 63 last month, taking the total cancellations for the year through November to 1,068.
Ahead of key quarterly reports from Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) later this week, investors digested mixed earnings from AutoZone and  Stitch Fix .
AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) reported earnings of $18.61 a share that topped expectations, but revenue of $3.15 billion fell short of estimates, sending its shares down 5%.
Stitch Fix, meanwhile, surged 39% after reporting a surprise fiscal first-quarter profit on higher revenue, prompting a slew of analysts on Wall Street to upgrade their estimates on the stock.
RBC lifted its price target on Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX) to $64 from $50 amid expectations for net additions and revenue growth acceleration, and Ebitda margin expansion in fiscal 2021."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A flyers advocacy group has challenged the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) decision to lift the March 2019 order grounding the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airliner after two fatal crashes in five months that killed 346 people.
Flyers Rights and a group of flyers said on Tuesdy they had appealed the FAA's Nov. 18 decision allowing flights to resume to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.   
Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD), president of FlyersRights.org and one of fourindividuals who challenged the decision, said the FAA and Boeing declared the MAX safe based on ""secret data and secret testing that is clearly legally inadequate.""
Hudson and some Democratic lawmakers have demanded the FAA disclose more underlying data in its review. The group is separately trying to force the FAA under the Freedom of Information Act to turn over documents related to 737 MAX technical fixes and testing.
Boeing did not immediately comment. The FAA declined to comment.
The FAA is requiring a series of software changes and new pilot training requirements before planes can return to service. The FAA has also approved an American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) training plan for pilots to resume 737 MAX flights, the agency and airline confirmed. 

That approval clears the way for American to resume MAX flights starting Dec. 29 once it completes required tests and software upgrades to parked planes.
American plans to begin with a single daily MAX flight from Miami to New York’s LaGuardia airport. That will mark the return of the MAX to U.S. commercial service.
The appeals court has directed Flyers Rights to file a statement of issues by Jan. 6 and both sides to file legal motions by Jan. 21.

Investing.com -- Markets took a turn to the green on Tuesday as the U.S. gets excited about its turn with the Covid-19 vaccine after the U.K. kicked off its inoculation program. 
The Food and Drug Administration said data from the clinical trials of the vaccine produced by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) met its safety standards. Emergency Use Authorization should be imminent. President-elect Joe Biden said his administration will give 100 million shots in his first 100 days.
Energy companies gained on hopes that demand will return with vaccines, as did industrials.     
Stimulus is (still) being discussed in D.C. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is apparently suggesting that the Senate drop liability protection and state and local government funding from the stimulus bill since there are so many disagreements on those issues, Briefing.com reported.
Meanwhile, Elon Musk said he's moved to Texas from California.
Moving on, it's a big week for IPOs, and DoorDash kicks things off on Wednesday.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow.
1. Data on job openings for November
We get some more jobs data, with the latest openings data publishing at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). The U.S. JOLTs Job Openings survey is expected to come in at 6.3 million, compared to 6.436 million for October, which was under the forecast 6.5 million.
2. Let's go public
DoorDash will join this year's IPO boom tomorrow. The delivery company is apparently seeing strong demand as it increased its price range last week, which could value the stock at $35 billion, double the private valuation it hit in a June fundraising round, Bloomberg reported. Coming up next: Airbnb.
3. Earnings from Adobe and  Campbell Soup 
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is set to report earnings per share of $2.67 on sales of $3.36 billion, both of which would the best on the books.
Keeping us cozy and warm, Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) is expected to report earnings per share of 91 cents on revenue of $2.32 billion. That's a lot of chicken noodle.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co lost another 63 orders in November for its newly un-grounded 737 MAX jet, and the company delivered seven aircraft to customers, down from 24 in the same month a year ago, company data showed on Tuesday.
The embattled U.S. planemaker had no 787 Dreamliner deliveries to customers last month, warning that inspections over quality flaws and the resurgent coronavirus will continue to hamper deliveries through year-end.
Jet deliveries are being closely scrutinized by investors as they generate much-needed cash during the coronavirus crisis.
On Tuesday, United Airlines was expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery since regulators imposed a 20-month safety ban. Brazil's Gol plans to resume commercial domestic routes from Wednesday.
Boeing's European rival Airbus delivered 64 aircraft in November, bringing the total so far this year to 477, compared to Boeing's 118.
Boeing's closely watched monthly orders and deliveries snapshot comes five days after Ireland's Ryanair booked a December order for 75 737 MAX jets, throwing Boeing a commercial lifeline.
For November, Boeing received orders for two KC-46 tankers. 
Boeing said it lost orders for 17 737 MAXs from unidentified customers, while Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp and Air Canada scrubbed orders for 23 jets.
Virgin Australia reduced and restructured an order for 48 737 MAX jets by replacing it with a contract for 25 of the MAX 10 variants, which have more seats. This year, Boeing has received orders for two MAX jets from Poland's Enter Air and three from an unidentified buyer.
Canceled MAX orders, including those where buyers converted to a different model, stood at 536 jets - and 548 for all jets across Boeing's portfolio, Boeing said on Tuesday. 
For 2020 through November, the number of MAX orders canceled, or removed from Boeing's official backlog when it applies stricter accounting standards, stood at 1,068 aircraft. 
Boeing orders from January through November, before the accounting adjustment, went to minus 454 for all models, compared to Airbus' net total of 297 after cancellations.
Boeing delivered seven planes last month: two P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, one 747 freighter for  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), one 767 freighter for FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and three 777 widebodies. 
The seven jets Boeing handed to customers in November compares to 24 a year earlier and 13 in October. 

For the year through November, Boeing delivered 118 aircraft, a 66% drop from the 345 it delivered for the same period a year ago.

The revision relates to the city's general obligation (GO) and associated appropriation-backed bonds and reflects a one-in-three chance S&P could lower its rating during the outlook period, which typically spans two years, the rating agency said.
The coronavirus transmission rate increase could hurt the city's financial forecast, and could negatively affect global tourism trends and additional federal stimulus funding for state and local governments as well as service reductions at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Nora Wittstruck said in a statement. 
U.S. coronavirus cases have crossed the 15 million mark, according to a Reuters tally on Tuesday. 
These issues could affect the region's economic recovery and cause ""weakness in property tax values that will not be evident until fiscal 2023,"" Wittstruck said. 
New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that if hospitalization rates keep climbing this week, he would suspend indoor dining at New York City restaurants. The city resumed indoor service in September at 25% of capacity.

On Nov. 18, New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which faces nearly $16 billion in projected deficits through 2024 due a sharp drop in ridership on its buses, subways and trains, had to authorize borrowing of up to $2.9 billion from a U.S. Federal Reserve loan program to aid its coronavirus-battered budget.

Scharf began implementing sweeping changes across the fourth-largest U.S. bank shortly after joining the firm last October and is hoping to be able to report tangible changes next year.

In January, Wells Fargo will report earnings reflecting for the first time the new business lines Scharf put in place in February when he increased the bank's official segments to five from three.
He has also installed new external leadership, created new executive positions and launched a broad cost-cutting initiative targeting $10 billion in annualized savings over the long term. 
Wells Fargo became the first major bank to resume layoffs over the summer after pausing because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Scharf braced investors for another restructuring charge in the fourth quarter similar to the $718 million charge it booked last quarter primarily related to severance costs, and said the bank was still eyeing potential divestitures for smaller product sets.

By offering products consumers can't find elsewhere, ETSY is able to stay relevant even as other e-commerce players like AMZN are making unprecedented investments in logistics and delivery capabilities,"" Colantuoni said in a note.
That competitive advantage gives it strength with sellers, said Jefferies, which recently hosted company executives for meetings with European investors, StreetInsider said. Management is committed to increasing its international presence.
Etsy reported its best sales ever in its most recent quarterly report, more than double a year earlier. 
The company got a huge break in April, when it started selling masks. It has since sold almost 54 million of them, worth $600 million, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.

(https:// On Dec. 1, shares in Nikola sank 14.9% as a lock-up period expired, allowing certain insiders to sell shares, just a day after General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) revised its deal with the company. But Monday's disclosure suggests that ""Milton plans to remain Nikola's biggest shareholder"" according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. ""There's an added confidence investors are reading into that,"" said Ives.  The analyst, who has a 'sell' rating on the stock, said investors are also likely moving on from last week's GM news.  ""Many are now looking at Nikola as now a potential EV (electric vehicle) play with the GM noise now in the rear view mirror,"" said Ives who has a $15 price target on the stock. Nikola shares last traded at $18.74, though trading volume was light at 0.2 times the 10-day moving average.

""Investors are going to continue to take a cautious wait-and-see approach but I do think potentially the tide's turning in terms of a lot of bad news in the rear-view mirror,"" said Ives.

Chief Executive Herbert Diess this month demanded a vote of confidence in his reform efforts by asking stakeholders to back his proposals for management board appointments in addition to a contract extension for himself.
Supervisory board members want to avoid a premature discussion about giving Diess another term in office, but key directors have endorsed a discussion centred on his proposals for appointments to the management board, the sources said. 
""We have a blueprint proposal on personnel, which is due to be discussed at the company's supervisory board,"" one of the sources said, referring to potential management board appointments. 
Volkswagen declined to comment. 
Diess has attempted to install Arno Antlitz as chief financial officer to replace Frank Witter, who is due to retire in June, and to hire Thomas Schmall as management board member responsible for components, replacing Stefan Sommer, who has already left the company, sources told Reuters.
As part of the latest discussions, directors are due to debate dividing Sommer's responsibilities for procurement and components and to hand responsibility for procurement to Murat Aksel, the second source said on Tuesday.
The appointments had been delayed because VW's labour leaders, who command half the seats on the company's board of directors, had insisted on approving a ""package solution"", two people familiar with the deliberations told Reuters last week.
Separating responsibility for procurement and components may help to win over directors to endorse replenishing the management board at the meeting on Thursday.
Volkswagen Group, which includes the Audi, Porsche, Skoda, Bentley, Bugatti and Seat brands, could also create a new board position for information technology (IT) and software, the second source said.

""We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to discuss a comprehensive proposal,"" the second source told Reuters on Tuesday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's government is looking for a legal way to exclude Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from 5G networks in Brazil, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
A presidential decree is being studied by Bolsonaro's national security adviser Augusto Heleno and the ministry of communications who are looking at security provisions that telecoms and their suppliers must comply with, the sources said.
Bolsonaro, following his ally President Donald Trump, opposes Huawei on the unproven grounds that it shares confidential data with China's Communist government. But, with China being Brazil's largest trade partner, he has faced resistance from industry and within his own government, including from Vice President Hamilton Mourão.
Brazil's Communications Minister Fabio Faria declined to comment and Heleno's office said it is not involved in the 5G matter.
Industry representatives said such a presidential decree could lead to a legal battle with telecom companies that already use Huawei equipment and oppose a ban on the Chinese company because it would force them to make costly technology swaps.
Most Brazilian telecommunication firms use Huawei equipment on their 3G and 4G networks. According to lobby group Conexis, the largest cellphone company Vivo, owned by Telefônica Brasil, uses Huawei equipment in 65% of its networks. Claro's equipment is 55% from Huawei, while Oi has 60% and TIM has 45%. 
A legal dispute could delay the auction of 5G spectrum frequencies planned for June next year and set back Brazil's transition to fifth-generation technology.
“Regulator Anatel needs legal provisions to set the rules for the 5G auction,"" a first source, with access to the government plans, said. ""Instructions from the president's security adviser is not enough, so they’re looking at a presidential decree to back up any restriction on Huawei."" 
A rule set by the government in March requires that companies guarantee data reliability, allow their systems to be audited and says they must deal with equipment suppliers in their geographical area. But it stops short of excluding Huawei.
The government has so far not been able to find a way to ban Huawei that legally holds water without affecting other suppliers. 
According to a second source, the government considered excluding suppliers not listed on Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock market, but that would also bar other companies.
""If set rules restrict one company without a plausible justification, it would not be upheld in court,"" said the second source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. ""That would not only delay technological advance but impact other areas of Brazil's trade relationship with China,"" the source warned. 
Last month, Brasilia declared support for the Clean Network, a U.S. initiative to get countries on board in preventing the growth of Chinese technology in 5G networks worldwide.
The U.S. government has offered Brazilian telecos finance to encourage them to buy from Western providers such as Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) instead of Huawei.
Huawei said it has been in Brazil for 22 years operating with the highest international cybersecurity standards, as it does in 170 countries worldwide, and has already conducted 5G tests with all the wireless companies in Brazil.
""We expect all decisions on the subject to be made in a strictly technical, non-discriminatory manner and in favor of the free market,"" Huawei said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. airlines carried 62% fewer passengers in October over the same month last year, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Tuesday.
The 62% decline from October 2019 was the smallest year-to-year decrease since March when the coronavirus pandemic slashed U.S. travel demand. The largest airlines carried 29.9 million passengers in October, down from 78.3 million passengers in October 2019. U.S. domestic demand was down 60% and international demand was off 77%.
Airlines for America, an industry group, said this week it estimates that through late November passenger demand remains down 62%.
A spike in COVID-19 cases and guidance from U.S. health agencies urging Americans to avoid holiday travel has led to a recent softening in travel demand.
International travel demand has also been harmed by U.S. travel restrictions that bar most non-U.S. visitors who have recently been in the European Union, United Kingdom, China and Brazil from visiting the United States.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said Friday ""rising COVID-19 case counts and associated travel restrictions ... have resulted in a slowing of net bookings growth, which has persisted into December.""
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) warned Thursday it would lose about $2 million more than forecast each day in the fourth quarter, but kept a target to halt its cash burn next spring.
Airlines are hoping vaccine prospects will start lifting demand throughout 2021 but do not expect a full recovery for some time.
The Transportation Department said Monday that U.S. passenger airlines reported third-quarter after-tax net losses of $11.8 billion and a pre-tax operating loss of $15.9 billion.

Investing.com --  Has the housing boom petered out? 
 Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL) is down 8% after announcing disappointing first quarter delivery and gross margin guidance, BTIG said.
With higher than expected deliveries, the homebuilder reported earnings per share of $1.55, beating the average estimate of $1.23 on sales of $2.55 billion, versus the expected $2.07 billion for the fourth quarter.
The company provided guidance for first quarter deliveries of approximately 1,675 homes with an average price of between $780,000 and $800,000, with adjusted home sales gross margin of about 22.4%.
""The guide seems at least in part driven by strong volume already delivered in 4Q which renders backlog thinner. Expectations for a margin beat this quarter may also be playing a role,” said analyst Carl E. Reichard, according to FXEmpire.com.   
For the fourth quarter, home building deliveries were 2,940, up 10%. Adjusted home sales gross margin, which excludes interest and inventory write-downs, was 24%.
Shares are up some 230% since March, when markets crumbled as the reality of the Covid-19 virus revealed itself and the U.S. shut down for business. Rivals  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) and PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM) were also trading lower on Tuesday..Americans have fled cities this year for the suburbs, driving up demand for homes outside of urban centers and pushing homebuilders higher.

Spokesmen for the company did not immediately say whether the issue was related to Brexit.

Transport between Britain and mainland Europe is likely to face some disruption even if there is an agreement before the transitional arrangements expire at the end of the year.

Bourla, speaking on a call with reporters on Tuesday, also reiterated confidence in  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s ability to deliver its mRNA vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, even though it must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. 
He added the companies are working on a ""new formulation"" capable of withstanding higher temperatures. 
His comments came after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released documents raising no new safety or efficacy issues with Pfizer's vaccine, setting the stage for Thursday's meeting with outside experts to the FDA who will discuss recommending the shot.
""We have answers to every question they will ask,"" Bourla said. ""I think they will vote 'yes' given the strength of the data.""
His vaccine, already being delivered in limited quantities in Britain after its emergency approval there, has raised concerns due to the Antarctic temperatures it must be stored at, though Pfizer and BioNTech have sought to reassure that it can survive at 2 and 8 degrees for a limited time.
Bourla said he was ""very comfortable"" with the companies' ability to distribute the vaccine at minus 70 degrees by using special storage boxes developed by their mechanics.
""You can transport (it) in a normal car, for example, we have GPS and thermometers inside those boxes, so at any point in time, we know where each box is, and the temperature,"" Bourla said. 
""We've started already in the UK and things are going very well,"" he said. ""I think everybody will see pretty soon that this is not a challenge, at least in countries where there is basic infrastructure, like a road or a place to store things.""
Bourla said the companies are pursuing changes to make the vaccine potentially more suitable for developing countries including Africa where such infrastructure may not be in place.

""Yes, we are working also on a new formulation that will be able to avoid the minus 70 and can be stored in simple refrigeration,"" he said.

Prior to the release of the FDA's analysis of data from the two companies' stage three trial of their Covid-19 vaccine, markets had been indicated down by more, a response to fresh evidence that the pandemic is effectively still running out of control in much of the U.S.
By 9:45 AM ET (1545 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20 points, or 0.1% at 30,049, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 0.4%.
Among early movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which had soared another 7% on Monday to a new record high, fell 2.0% in response to the news that the company planned to raise up to $5 billion via an equity distribution scheme that would see it dribble stock out into the market over an extended time.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock rose 1.1% and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 2.2% to another new record high after the FDA’s data dump acknowledged that their drug “met the prescribed success criteria” for treating Covid-19. The FDA committee responsible for authorizing new medicines meets on Thursday to take a decision on authorizing the vaccine for emergency use.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose 4.7% on hopes that its drug, which employs the same biological technology as the Pfizer/BioNTech one, will also soon be approved.
The FDA news comes against a backdrop of tightening restrictions on business and social life across the U.S., as the numbers of dead and hospitalized with the virus continue to break records. Over the last week, an average 2,204 American have died of the coronavirus, while the number of those admitted to hospital has risen above 102,000 for the first time, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
Elsewhere, Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock fell 2.1% after the ride-hailing company paid $400 million to autonomous driving startup Aurora to take its own self-driving technology operations off its hands, the latest in a string of money-losing businesses that Uber has shed this year as it struggles to move toward profitability. The company will take a 26% stake in Aurora in return, and thus keep some upside exposure. "

The company's shares touched a record high on Monday, pushing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s market value above $600 billion and further cementing its position as the most valuable auto company in the world despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Ten major banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), will conduct the sale, the carmaker said in a filing, giving no timeline for its completion. (https:// Demand for Tesla's shares has been further fueled by the decision last month to add the company to the S&P 500 index, making it one of the most valuable firms ever to join the main U.S. stock market benchmark. Some investors and Wall Street analysts believe Tesla's stock is in a bubble, and a few have warned against adding it to the S&P 500 at current levels. Analysts' median price target on the stock stands at $400, $230 short of the current price. The 670% rally in Tesla's shares this year has also boosted Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's net worth from $27 billion to $155 billion, making him the world's second-richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In September, Tesla said it would raise $5 billion to ease its future debt pressures as the company seeks to massively expand production of its existing vehicles and build new factories near Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas. The company also has plans to launch new lines of vehicles, including a semi-truck called the Tesla Semi and its futuristic Cybertruck.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 2 has led an $80 million Series D financing round in digital therapeutics startup Pear Therapeutics in its latest healthcare investment.
Boston and San Francisco-based Pear, which offers app-based therapy and tracking tools for patients in treatment for insomnia and substance abuse, also received backing from Singapore state investor Temasek and drug maker Novartis, it said in a statement. 
""We saw a tremendous opportunity to work with the SoftBank team closely to really think about and execute upon ex-U.S. geographic expansion,"" said Corey McCann, CEO of Pear Therapeutics. 
The pandemic has fuelled a rise in patients suffering from problems like insomnia and has prompted regulators grappling with rising healthcare costs to look to technology as the industry lags others in shifting online. 
Healthcare investments from Vision Fund 2, which has $10 billion in committed capital from SoftBank, include health tracking wearables startup Biofourmis. 
""We can come in with not just our capital but our entire ecosystem to help accelerate their journey,"" said Kirthiga Reddy, a partner at SoftBank Investment Advisors.

Pear's CEO McCann declined to disclose the startup's valuation after the latest round.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 08:06AM ET</span>",Analysis: Financial industry dealmaking set to heat up,"By David French and Krystal Hu
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Large acquisitions in the fragmented financial data industry are just a foretaste of the dealmaking to come, as vendors seek to expand their offerings and secure resources to invest in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, investment bankers and analysts say.
Two of the industry's top three players have inked transformative deals in the last two years, increasing pressure on No. 1 player, Bloomberg LP, and others such as CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME), Nasdaq Inc and MarketAxess Holdings Inc to join in, these experts said.
Among the potential acquisition targets, bankers said, are Factset Research (NYSE:FDS) Inc, Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW) Inc and MSCI Inc because of their strong niches in financial data. They have a market value of $13.4 billion, $14.3 billion, and $35.1 billion respectively.
Driving the dealmaking are data providers racing to diversify their offerings and using their existing distribution channels, such as desktop terminals, to sell more products. 
The data vendors also need scale to splash out on technological innovations such as artificial intelligence and machine learning that can keep pace with the needs of their financial and corporate clients, from high-speed trading to big-data crunching. 
""Without significant moves to enhance their businesses, these firms are less able to move quickly to mitigate their risk of loss,"" Burton-Taylor wrote in a report last week.
Bloomberg declined to comment. CME, Nasdaq, MarketAxess, Factset, MSCI and Tradeweb did not respond to requests for comment.
AVERSION TO ACQUISITIONS
Last year, Refinitiv entered into a $27 billion agreement to be sold to  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc, while S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc clinched a $44 billion deal last week to acquire IHS Markit Ltd . Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp, the parent of Reuters News, owns a 45% stake in Refinitiv and will own about 15% of London Stock Exchange once that deal closes in early 2021. Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) , the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, and another substantial player in financial markets data, said in August it would acquire mortgage technology platform Ellie Mae for $11 billion, extending its real estate capabilities.
Michael Bloomberg, the founder of the eponymous financial data behemoth, has eschewed large dealmaking thus far. Excluding a transaction where a stake in the company was bought back from another party, Bloomberg's largest ever acquisition was that of Bureau of National Affairs Inc, a provider of legal, tax and regulatory information, in 2011 for $962 million. 
This reflects Bloomberg's faith in the enduring success of its terminal business, the software that provides business information and connects users that has become ubiquitous in the finance and corporate world, according to investment bankers who have for years been pitching potential deals to the company.
Bloomberg's competitors have not been able to displace it as the financial data market leader. It has made the terminal synonymous to having a business desktop, akin to referencing Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as shorthand for internet searching or Zoom for video conferencing calling.
Yet while the terminal's dominance is not under threat, the company's growth prospects are, industry experts and analysts said. The trading floors at Wall Street firms that powered Bloomberg's meteoric rise are no longer expanding, and some of its customers who need niche information are moving to data vendors that charge less than the terminal's $20,000-plus annual subscription.
Bloomberg will have to overcome its aversion to big acquisitions in order to diversify its revenue while its terminal business is still strong, the bankers and analysts said.
""Strategically they may want to look beyond their current industry by expanding into verticals, including the energy and technology industry, or providing more data to current customers,"" said Jeff Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
Bloomberg declined to comment.
Another clock ticking for Bloomberg is its founder, a major philanthropist and former candidate for U.S. president. The 78-year-old mogul, whose fortune is pegged by Forbes at $55 billion, has led the company on and off as chief executive for four decades. He has resisted investment bankers' pitches for an initial public offering that would allow him to sell down his roughly 90% stake and for his employees to sell company shares they have been awarded in the open market.
Michael Bloomberg could not be reached for comment.
EXCHANGES ON THE HUNT FOR DEALS
CME Group, the world's biggest futures exchange operator, may look to diversify its revenue as persistently low interest rates reduce demand for its hedging products through futures on rates, commodities and currencies.
CME did not respond to requests for comment.
Nasdaq has said it wants to expand its market technology and information services businesses. Last month, it agreed to buy fraud detection platform Verafin for $2.75 billion, another milestone in its push to diversify revenue stream away from trading.
Nasdaq did not respond to a request for comment.
Marketaxess, an operator of fixed income trading platforms, made two small purchases in the third quarter which extended its trading, data, and post-trade businesses, and analysts have said it is seeking to diversify further.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 08:06AM ET</span>","UK's initial AstraZeneca shots will come from Europe, taskforce says","By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's initial doses of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University will come from Europe rather than a domestic supply chain, the country's Vaccine Taskforce said. 
The ""vast, vast, vast majority"" - over 80% - of the 100 million doses AstraZeneca will produce for the United Kingdom will be made there, Ian McCubbin, manufacturing lead for the Vaccine Taskforce, said, but this year's first batches will not.
""The initial supply and it's a little bit of a quirk of the programme actually comes from the Netherlands and Germany,"" he told reporters.
""But once that's supplied, which we expect will be all by the end of this year, then the remainder of the supply will be a UK supply chain."" 
The vaccine is manufactured by two British firms - Oxford BioMedica and Cobra Biologics - with another company, Wockhardt, providing fill and finish capability in what McCubbin said was ""a completely integrated UK supply chain"".
McCubbin said he expected the European vaccines to be delivered this year, which could help to minimise any disruption from Brexit. 
Military aircraft have been put on standby to help to deliver vaccines should there be chaos at the ports if Britain fails to agree a trade deal with the European Union before the end of the year.
Britain is hopeful that regulatory approval for AstraZeneca/Oxford's immunisation could come in the next two weeks, its health minister said on Tuesday as Pfizer/BioNTech's rival vaccine candidate was rolled out.
Although questions remain around the final data on AstraZeneca's candidate, which has between 62% and 90% efficacy depending on the dosing regime used compared to 95% efficacy for  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), it is easier to store and distribute than Pfizer's.

Kate Bingham, chair of the taskforce, said that Britain would next year start trials using combinations of different kinds of vaccine for the initial and booster vaccinations, in the hope that a ""mix-and-match"" approach might maximise the immune response.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Tuesday, as investors weigh up rising numbers of Covid-19 cases and the associated lockdowns with a vaccine rollout and potential fiscal stimulus.  
At 7:15 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract fell 150 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.6%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 46 points, or 0.4%. 
Investors have been buoyed over the last month by the rapid progress towards the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines. 
However, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases is rapidly approaching 15 million, with record infections sweeping across many states and hospitalizations rising by over 1,000 a day. This has led to a string of renewed lockdowns, including strict measures in California, the most populous U.S. state.
The U.K. started vaccinating its public earlier Tuesday with the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 injection, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is to vote on emergency-use authorization for this vaccine on Thursday and initial vaccinations could get underway as early as Friday.
The White House is holding a summit on Tuesday to explain plans for vaccine distribution, with President Donald Trump set to sign an executive order to ensure that priority access is given to the American people. This follows the New York Times reporting the government declined when  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) offered in late summer to sell more vaccine doses to the United States.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are expected to pass a one-week spending bill to keep the government running, providing more time for them to come to consensus over a Covid-19 relief package.
Elsewhere, there are earnings figures due from the likes of AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and GameStop (NYSE:GME), while Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock sold off premarket after the electric carmaker announced plans to sell an additional 5 million shares from “time to time”.
Economic data will be in the form of nonfarm productivity, which is expected to rise 4.9% for the third quarter, in line with the gain in the second quarter.
Oil prices slipped Tuesday as traders looked to balance positions after recent gains as lockdown fears translated directly into fears about demand.
Data due from the American Petroleum Institute later Tuesday and from the U.S. government on Wednesday are expected to show that U.S. crude stocks fell last week.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $45.55 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.3% to $48.63. Both benchmarks lost around 1% Monday, but this followed five consecutive weeks of gains.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,867.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2121.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 06:42AM ET</span>",Ssslow down! Sleeping snakes stall Tesla's German gigafactory,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Hibernating snakes are complicating Elon Musk's plans for a gigafactory near Berlin.
A German court has told the U.S. billionaire's electric vehicle company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to suspend clearing of a forest at the site of the proposed factory after environmentalists said that cutting down more trees could endanger hibernating snakes.
""The Landesumweltamt (state environmental authority) and Tesla will now be consulted, they need to make submissions by this afternoon and then we assess the situation,"" a spokesman for the administrative court in Frankfurt an der Oder in eastern Germany said on Tuesday.
Tesla declined to comment. The Landesumweltamt declined to comment further. 
The carmaker announced plans late last year to build its first European factory and design centre in Gruenheide, outside Berlin, with plans to have it up and running by July 1, 2021 to start building its electric crossover, the Model Y sports utility vehicle.
Musk, who has transformed Tesla from start-up to the world's most valuable automaker in the space of 16 years, is used to moving fast. The company's Shanghai Gigafactory went from greenfield site to building cars in just 11 months.
The decision to locate the company's first European factory near Berlin gives the U.S. electric car pioneer the coveted ""Made in Germany"" label but it also means navigating local planning rules.
Tesla's permission to start construction hinges on a conditional approval by local authorities, who are obliged to consult environmental groups and the community.
The company has been engaged in an environmental audit, a time-consuming process in a country where attention to detail is prized.
Environmental activists from a local group, NABU, are concerned that the smooth snake, also known as Coronella austriaca, may be hibernating in the ground at the site, and that tree-cutting activity may disturb its winter slumber.
Local authorities are also reviewing claims by NABU that Lacerta agilis, also known as sand lizards, could be put at risk by Tesla's expansion, NABU said.
At the beginning of October, Tesla set aside three days to sound out locals and potential critics of the factory, but the consultation process lasted eight days and 414 complaints and observations were lodged. 
Locals were concerned that the Gigafactory, especially once it started building battery cells, would be a drain on local water resources and wanted assurances from Tesla that consumption would be limited.
In response, Tesla agreed to cut water consumption to 1.4 million cubic meters, down from 3.3 million cubic meters.

Berlin's Tagesspiegel was first to report that Tesla has been ordered to suspend clearing of the forest.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","Analysis: Exchange operators embrace sustainable investing, with an eye on Biden","By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With money pouring in to assets linked to sustainable investing, exchange operators have increased their focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) business opportunities, which could get a boost from the policies of President-elect Joe Biden. 
Exchanges have increasingly been rolling out new ESG initiatives, including data products to help investors understand ESG risks; services aimed at helping corporations analyze ESG best practices, disclose their own practices, and attract capital; and ESG-focused benchmarks and derivatives. 
""Exchanges sit in this unique nexus in between investors and companies and regulators,"" said Evan Harvey, Nasdaq Inc's global head of sustainability. ""And as all three of those groups are looking for the common sense ground on ESG reporting and transparency and performance measurement, exchanges have a role to play,"" he said. 
Nasdaq expects ESG-related spending by U.S. companies to rise to $5 billion by 2025 from $500 million currently, and its executives said expanding ESG product offerings was a top business opportunity, during its investor day on Nov. 10.
The exchange operator has targeted $50 million in revenue from its new ESG services by 2025, versus $5 million now. That number rises to $150 million, or 5% of total revenue, when including all Nasdaq's ESG-related operations, like its governance platform, green bond platform, sustainable bond network, and ESG index platform, by 2025.
ESG has become big business for the investment industry. In U.S. equities, sustainable funds, which have outperformed standard funds, attracted inflows of $3.8 billion in the third quarter, compared with outflows of $118.5 billion overall for equity funds, according to Morningstar https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1007284/us-investors-continue-to-endorse-sustainable-investing. 
With a 16% compound annual growth rate, ESG-mandated assets could make up half of all managed U.S. assets by 2025, according Deloitte https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/5073_Advancing-ESG-investing/DI_Advancing-ESG-investing_UK.pdf.
One tailwind for ESG could come from President-elect Biden, who made climate change a pillar of his election campaign.
Nasdaq is taking a wait-and-see approach on what the new administration will mean for ESG, Harvey said.
""Just the attitude around sustainable investing and what, if anything, the government is going to do,"" he said. ""We're eagerly observing that along with everyone else.""
Exchange operators Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE) and New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc, also said they are curious as to how the Biden administration will treat ESG.
""The attention is there and it's growing and I wouldn't be surprised if it accelerates further as we move into a new administration and into the next Congress,"" said Angelo Evangelou, Cboe's chief policy officer. 
While Biden will likely advocate for a renewed focus on ESG, it is unclear how that will play out for the market, said Lynn Martin, ICE's president of fixed income and data services. 
""You still need to have organic demand from the market, and clearly, being able to generate returns helps with organic demand,"" she said.
Demand for ICE's green bond index has grown because green bonds have outperformed other forms of debt this year, she said.
That type of outperformance, along with more public companies backing carbon reduction and social and governance initiatives, has accelerated ESG's growth, along with things like the ESG data and hedging products ICE offers, she added.
In equities, the S&P 500 ESG Index is up 15.4% this year, topping a 13.7% rise by the S&P 500 Index. The ESG version excludes companies with low ESG scores, as well as firms manufacturing things like tobacco and controversial weapons like land mines and chemical weapons.
Cboe launched an options contract on the S&P 500 ESG Index in September investors can use to manage sustainability risks, access long or short positions and gain broad ESG exposure.
The company, like Nasdaq and ICE, also focuses internally on its own ESG metrics, Evangelou said.

""We like to walk the talk,"" he said.

373,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",Europe's supply chain finance fix feeds hidden debt fears,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - European companies hit by the coronavirus crisis are increasingly turning to a complex financial tool to pay suppliers, raising investor concerns around ""hidden"" debt.
Supply chain financing, by which companies can get cash from banks and funds to pay their suppliers without using working capital, has likely hit a record high in 2020, data shows.
The world's top banks are set to earn $27 billion from financing supply chains this year, data from research firm Coalition shows, as larger borrowers, mostly in Europe, scramble to help suppliers hammered by the pandemic.
This represents a rise of about 5.5% in 2020, compared with an average 2% increase in the previous four years.
While supply chain finance is a legitimate business tool, high-profile collapses of companies like Britain's Carillion, Spain's Abengoa and the United Arab Emirates' NMC Health have prompted investor concern.
""Supply chain financing is the latest financial engineering that could have serious consequences for working capital,"" said Pierre Verle, head of credit and a portfolio manager at French asset manager Carmignac. 
""I am not sure many investors realise how serious it is.""
An essential source of credit in a crisis, supply chain finance, also known as reverse factoring, can mask the true level of debt and cashflow issues that companies may face because it does not appear on balance sheets as debt, investors and analysts said. 
It is counted as a trade payable for the purchaser and a receivable for the supplier, despite acting more like bank debt in the opinion of some ratings agencies and industry experts.
THE X FACTOR
In a typical example of supply chain financing, a company such as a supermarket chain, concerned about the health of its small food suppliers during a temporary shock such as the pandemic, approaches its bank.
The small suppliers issue invoices to the supermarket, which confirms to the bank they are valid, and then those suppliers get the money right away rather than having to wait perhaps 30 days or even months to be paid by the retailer.
In some cases this acceleration in cashflow can mean survival for a supplier, with the funding also far cheaper because it is usually repaid within weeks rather than months.
Meanwhile, the bank makes some money on the loan.
""This product has been very popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, because it provides working capital for companies experiencing a temporary demand shock,"" Eric Li, research director at Coalition, told Reuters.
There is no official data on supply chain financing, but earnings from banks offer some insight. Lenders are a key source of such funding although it represents a small portion of their overall trade finance business.
Investment funds, not covered by the same sort of capital requirements as banks, are also increasingly providing supply chain finance but there is less visibility on their exposures.
Softbank-backed Greensill, the biggest non-bank provider of supply chain finance, also saw volumes and new business increase this year, a spokesperson told Reuters. 
""This year has battle tested supply chain finance as a new asset class and as a means of getting capital down into the real economy where it is needed the most,"" the spokesperson said.
Greensill says its technology-driven approach helps improve transparency and accountability in the asset class.
""We have said consistently that we believe that a dollar owed to a customer in an invoice is no different to a dollar owed to a bank in debt, both should be entirely transparent."" 
Companies are not required to disclose use of the technique, and the International Monetary Fund in June 2019 said the lack of available data on trade finance has been recognised as a problem since the 2008 financial crisis. 
""There are plenty of examples of companies with hidden debt, and those are often the ones that cause more problems,"" said Justin Jewell, a portfolio manager at Bluebay Asset Management.
NMC Health is the most recent high-profile corporate casualty that used supply chain finance. Some of this only came to light when short seller Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) put out a note detailing its hidden debt levels.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) also linked undisclosed supply chain financing to the 2018 collapse of British construction firm Carillion, which owed some 498 million pounds ($670 million) through an ""early payment facility"" agreement with suppliers.
Moody's said this hid the true debt owed to banks providing the financing.
Accounting firms, ratings agencies and regulators in the U.S. and Europe have called for greater disclosure.
In June, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a notice requiring companies to disclose more about how COVID-19 is affecting their cashflow, including specific mention they should disclose more about use of supply chain finance.
However, regulators and professional accounting bodies have not implemented any major rule changes.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",Big carbon? Oil majors turn to nature to help plug revenue gap,"By Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil companies such as BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) are nurturing nature as a future revenue stream, betting on an expected rise in carbon credit prices as their fossil fuel profits ebb. 
BP last year put $5 million into Finite Carbon, a company that connects forestry owners with companies seeking to offset their climate-warming emissions via-tree planting.
The Californian firm expects to generate $1 billion for landowners over the next 10 years, after a 20-40% cut of the proceeds, its chief executive Sean Carney said. 
And as companies and countries have rushed over the last year to pledge new net-zero global warming pledges, that forecast may be too conservative, Carney said.
""When you put it next to all the announcements and all the talk, it's a really small number. We might be thinking too low here given the commitments,"" he told Reuters.
For a graphic on Revenue ambitions dwarf current investments:
https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/OIL-CARBONCREDITS/xklvybwampg/chart.png
Climate change goals, agreed in Paris in 2016, have fuelled a growing, but still immature, market for carbon offsets as companies and countries seek to fall in line. 
European oil majors say investing in projects to create more credits is simply good business, offering new revenue streams at a time when oil prices have collapsed and appetite for new exploration evaporates.
""Investing in carbon sequestration, at a time when the world is increasingly carbon constrained, over time will prove to make good commercial, business sense,"" Duncan van Bergen, Shell's head of Nature Based Solutions, told Reuters.
Big oil's involvement has split environmentalists.
Sarah Leugers at the non-profit Gold Standard Registry welcomed interest from large emitters in nature conservation, but added:
""I do worry that they're initiating projects in a market that they can profit from that's attempting to solve a problem that they've largely created,"" Leugers said.
Others note the cash is going toward projects of universal benefit. 
""Why would it be OK to make money with digging out fossil fuels, but not with saving the planet?"" said Renat Heuberger, CEO of the leading climate project developer South Pole, which typically takes a 10% cut from credits it develops and sells.
CARBON KLONDIKE
Although some industries are covered by carbon-trading schemes enshrined in law, such as in the European Union, California and Australia, most of the world has no such government-backed markets.
That leaves most emitters with only a handful of small, voluntary carbon offset markets launched over the last 15 years. 
And as more seek credits, the price is expected to rise.
Shell's budgets, for example, are based on a carbon price of $85, or around 70 euros, a tonne by 2050 which is more than twice the current price of just under 30 euros on the EU carbon-trading scheme. 
While each ""registry"", or voluntary market, has its own rules for entry, they generally work by certifying credits for carbon-reducing projects which preserve forests or wetlands or help swap out wood or coal burning stoves with ones using cleaner fuels.
The entire voluntary carbon offset market last year was worth around $300 million, trading offsets for around 104 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), according to Ecosystem Marketplace, the main aggregator of these data.
However, that compares with the 33 billion tonnes of CO2e emitted by the energy sector alone in 2019, of which 2.1 billion tonnes came from products made by European energy majors, International Energy Agency and Reuters calculations show.
For a graphic on How small is the voluntary carbon offset market?:
https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/OIL-CARBONCREDITS/oakvexkkmpr/chart.png
A November report by a taskforce of investors and emitters led by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the voluntary market would have to grow 15-fold to meet the goal of avoiding catastrophic climate change.
Oil majors are playing a growing role in this as they seek to establish themselves in the new carbon neutral world order, with France's Total earmarking $100 million a year for nature-based solutions, including an unspecified amount toward creating credits.
Shell plans to spend $100 million on average over the next year or two on nature-based carbon offsets and van Bergen expects emissions cuts from nature-based solutions or carbon sinks will be ""material"" by 2030 or 2035. 
In August it bought Select Carbon which helps farmers in Australia modify their land use and certifies credits for use in a government-managed scheme or sold on the secondary market.
BP's investment in Finite Carbon went toward software that allows landowners to monetise the planting of new trees or preservation of existing woodlands.
Using machine learning, remote sensing and digital payments, the software is aimed at landowners with parcels as small as 40 acres, too small to take part in many carbon markets.
For BP's head of ventures Nacho Gimenez, the Finite Carbon investment fits with a responsibility to rein in emissions.
""As long as someone is investing in something positive, that's the baseline,"" Gimenez told Reuters.
Such nature-based offsets could remove up to 12 billion tonnes of emissions a year on the back of $120-$360 billion spending by emitters, British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) estimates.

But with no global standard for evaluating the carbon impact of a project or for pricing credits, a credit from the same project can fetch a higher price in one sale than in another.

Now, the company is set to add another notch on its belt: having the best-ever Hong Kong debut among listings that have raised more than $3 billion.
Shares of the health-care affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. surged Tuesday and were up 72% as of 3:35 p.m. local time. That puts it on track to beat the previous record held by Chinese broker GF Securities Co., which jumped 35% on its first trading day in April 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
JD Health’s IPO last week is Asia’s biggest health-care listing on record. Excluding its Nasdaq-traded parent’s $4.5 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong in June, the health-care company’s share sale is also the largest in the city this year.

The blockbuster deal and its subsequent first-day pop highlight how investors remain interested in health-care names amid the coronavirus pandemic. Health-care listings have been lapped up this year by institutional funds as well as mom-and-pop investors.
Driving the pipeline of listings have been high valuations and a wave of innovation in China’s health-care and biotech industries, partly accelerated by the pandemic as more people use online medical services.
JD Health’s strong performance also signals to prospective issuers that the window for IPOs is still open, after the abrupt suspension of Ant Group Co.’s record offering last month.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 04:26AM ET</span>",Spain's recovering rural rentals a sign of hope for Airbnb,"By Isla Binnie
MADRID (Reuters) - During a surreal summer in Spain, Perla Requejo saw so much demand for the Atlantic coastal apartment she had been unable to rent on Airbnb during lockdown that she listed another and raised her daily rate.
While bookings and rental rates have plummeted in Barcelona and Madrid, two of Airbnb's biggest markets globally, rural or coastal areas and some smaller cities are showing new life after Spain imposed some of the strictest coronavirus restrictions.
With people keen to avoid crowded city centres, data suggests guests will now pay more to stay in such places.
""In the middle of the pandemic ... I started to receive requests for information on the first house. Everyone was just waiting to see if they could travel in summer,"" said Requejo.
The resilience of rentals away from big cities has helped Airbnb, which made 40% of its revenue in Europe last year, to weather the crisis better than many expected.
As the company gears up for one of Silicon Valley's most eagerly anticipated stock market listings on Thursday, a central question for potential investors is whether this will support future growth.
Around two-thirds of people who rented out flats or houses to tourists in Spain have moved them onto the residential market, a study by property portal Fotocasa found.
But in Requejo's cool, hilly Galicia region of northern Spain, there are now 20% more registered holiday lets than in January, a local tourist rental association says, and the bet is showing signs of paying off.
The average price of a night in the local towns of Ferrol and Ourense rose 28% and 9% respectively in the third quarter, according to AirDNA, which analyses data on vacation rentals. 
    Rounding the coast towards France, surfers' paradise San Sebastian has seen daily rates soar 76%, while in Barcelona, on the eastern Costa Brava, prices fell by an average of 18%. 
Airbnb says 32% of Spaniards it surveyed at the end of September took advantage of not being tied to offices and extended trips to work extra days remotely.
Requejo says some of her guests worked remotely during their stays, and fellow Galician host Margarita Orduna was overwhelmed by requests for her property in Ferrol, some from people who wanted it for all of August.
""There was more demand than in previous years,"" said Orduna. 
Requejo, who has not calculated how much lower her total income will be this year, says, ""We cannot recover those reservations we had in April, May and June."" 
But with the pick-up in summer, ""even though everything was very difficult, we managed to save the season"".

TERRIFYING
Some in Europe have made Airbnb their livelihood, and are holding out for a tourism turnaround. 
Sweeping restrictions in March caught Airbnb host Roberto Cubas as he was saving to buy a third apartment to add to his luxuriously-furnished portfolio in Valencia, eastern Spain.
    ""It was terrifying. I had to do yoga twice a day and meditate a lot to save myself from going mad,"" said Cubas, who nevertheless intends to ride out the ongoing slump.
Bookings fell 60% in seaside Valencia in the third quarter, but unlike in Madrid and Barcelona, rates ticked up slightly in the third quarter and are steady from a year ago.
    ""People are desperate to travel because they have been stuck at home, so they will get on a plane the moment governments allow it,"" Cubas said. 
Vacation rental website HomeToGo found that 63% of Spaniards were planning to book holiday accommodation in the next year.
Although most owners who moved to the residential market have done so indefinitely, around 15% have taken a tenant for a fixed term and plan to start welcoming holidaymakers again when the situation improves, Fotocasa says.
Cubas thinks Airbnb hosts who stuck it out will be rewarded. 

""When everything starts moving again there will be fewer of us sharing the pie,"" he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) has signed a pact to buy out its China joint venture partner to make it the most advanced foreign bank to take full ownership of a mainland securities business.
The process to boost its stake in the Goldman Sachs Gao Hua (GSGH) venture from 51% to 100% has also been initiated with regulators, according to an internal memo issued on Tuesday to staff of the Wall Street bank.
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong confirmed the memo content.
Most of the international banks in China own 51% of their securities businesses, which typically house investment banking operations, with a Chinese partner.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) took 71% of its joint venture in November when it bought an extra 20% stake in the mainland business and analysts believe it could be the next in line to move to full ownership.. JPMorgan declined to comment. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) flagged in July it wanted to own 100% of its China securities venture but declined to comment on how advanced it was in the process.
Goldman has previously indicated it would double its headcount in China to 600 people by 2025 as part of its expansion plans.
The terms of the Goldman Sachs deal have not yet been made public. 
Unlike most of the other China JVs, Goldman had day-to-day operational control of its business, which offers investment banking services such as equities and bond underwriting and deal advice, even with its minority ownership.
Full ownership could allow foreign banks to expand their operations in the multi-trillion-dollar Chinese financial sector, and better integrate them with their global businesses.

""One hundred percent ownership of our franchise on the mainland represents a significant commitment to and investment in China, outlined in our China strategic plan,"" the Goldman memo said.

(Reuters) -European shares were little changed on Tuesday, as hopes of a Brexit trade deal faded amid a last-ditch attempt to find a solution, while rising coronavirus cases spurred talks of stricter curbs that could cause more economic pain.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was trading flat, while London's FTSE 100, which has been outperforming regional peers in recent sessions, fell 0.1%.
After British and EU leaders failed to narrow differences on Monday, they are set to meet in a final attempt to seal a deal to govern around $1 trillion in annual trade before Britain exits from the bloc at the end of the month. 
The timing of the meeting is yet to be confirmed, with investors waiting to see if a decision can be made before the EU summit begins on Thursday. 
Officials from both sides sounded more and more skeptical about the possibility of a deal since talks failed overnight. 
""Markets have begun to price in no-deal risk again,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. 
""We think next week is still in play for a deal if progress can be made... UK equities are among the opportunities we highlight for the next leg up.""
The decline in the broader market came as Britain began rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech, the first Western country to start vaccinating its population.
Meanwhile, as infections continued to rise in Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the government might tighten restrictions to control the spread beyond the partial lockdown implemented in November. A media report said the measures will be discussed this week. 
The German DAX was down 0.1%. 
The index has recovered about 60% from its March lows with vaccine and stimulus hopes, as well as a nascent economic recovery lifting shares. It is still off around 4% from its highest this year hit in February. 
Oil and gas shares were the biggest decliners in Europe, with Total, BP (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) losing between 0.8% and 1.3% as crude prices slipped on worries over new lockdowns. [O/R]
Among individual stocks, rental equipment provider Ashtead (LON:AHT) was the biggest boost to the STOXX 600 despite a 7% drop in quarterly profit after it said it expects annual results to be ahead of expectations.
Swedish wholesaler Beijer Ref AB topped the index, gaining 7%, after private equity group EQT (NYSE:EQT) bought a stake in the company for about $1.1 billion.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Tuesday, with Brexit uncertainty weighing despite the rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine and likely monetary and fiscal stimulus.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index also fell 0.1%. 
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels for crisis talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later Tuesday as negotiations over a post-Brexit trade deal threaten to collapse.
Continued differences over fishing rights, fair competition and ways to solve future disputes threaten to spike a deal over how to govern around $1 trillion in annual trade before Britain's privileges under the transition agreement expire at the end of the month.
Adding to the worries is the impact of the winter surge of the Covid-19 virus that has caused a string of renewed lockdowns, including strict measures in the U.S. state of California and South Korea. In Europe's largest economy, German state governments are increasingly tightening restrictions on business life, although they continue to resist pressure from Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel for a nationwide clampdown.
The U.K., meanwhile, started vaccinating its public with the Pfizer/BioNTech injection earlier Tuesday, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration meets to discuss this vaccine on Thursday. European authorities are expected to authorise its rollout by the end of the month.
Additionally, the European Central Bank holds its latest policy-setting meeting on Thursday, with the central bank widely expected to increase and extend its pandemic bond-buying program.
On Capitol Hill, Republican and Democratic negotiators continue to try to reach an agreement on a Covid-19 relief package, with last month's weak payrolls data adding a degree of immediacy. 
In corporate news, Ashtead (LON:AHT) stock rose 4.3% after the industrial equipment rental company lifted its full-year guidance despite reporting a 10% fall in pretax profit for its fiscal second quarter.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, continuing recent gains ahead of U.S. inventories numbers.
Data due from the American Petroleum Institute later Tuesday and from the U.S. government on Wednesday are expected to show that U.S. crude stocks fell last week.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $45.80 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $48.86. Both benchmarks lost around 1% Monday, but this followed five consecutive weeks of gains.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,869.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2125.

""We want to switch from gut-driven decisions to data-driven decisions,"" said Kai Demtroder, vice president of data transformation at BMW. ""We have a few hundred data scientists at BMW, but the aim is to make the data accessible to everyone.""
Demtroder said BMW's ""cloud data hub"" proved its value as the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect auto production in the spring, as data from Amazon Web Services (AWS) enabled the German carmaker to see which supplier plants had problems. 
""This was a clear case where we had all the data and we could use it immediately to respond to the crisis,"" he said.
BMW and AWS have been working together since 2015 and have spent the last year and a half jointly developing the carmaker's data hub.
Up to 5,000 BMW employees will also be trained to use AWS technologies to make better use of data.
The hub will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict consumer demand for BMW vehicles so the carmaker can order the right parts from suppliers, comply with regulations across different markets and automatically check requirements needed to design new vehicles.
The global market for cloud storage services is expected to grow from $50.1 billion this year to $137.3 billion by 2025, according to market research firm MarketsandMarkets.

Last week, Canadian technology specialist BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) and AWS said they had developed a cloud-based software platform designed to help automakers and suppliers standardize vehicle data.

England's second lockdown to stem rising COVID-19 infections started on Nov. 5 and ran until Dec. 1.
All non-essential shops had to close, along with pubs, cafes and restaurants, except to offer takeaway food. People were also encouraged to work from home if possible. All those factors help supermarket sales.

Sales of frozen food were up 19.7%, while sales of alcohol soared 23.2%.
Online sales increased by 109% compared with the same period last year, with the online share of grocery spend reaching 13.6%, compared with 7.1% in November 2019 and not far from the 14% peak seen in June of this year.
Nielsen said Morrisons, Britain's fourth biggest supermarket group by sales, continued to outperform the country's other big four grocers, with sales growth of 9.8% over the 12 weeks to Nov. 28.
No. 2 Sainsbury's, saw growth of 8.1%, followed by market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) on 7.6%. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) owned Asda was again the laggard with growth of 5.7%.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Tuesday, as investors attempt to balance Brexit uncertainty and coronavirus-inspired lockdowns against an upcoming vaccine rollout and likely monetary and fiscal stimulus.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%. 
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels for crisis talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later Tuesday as negotiations over a post-Brexit trade deal threaten to collapse amid continued differences over fishing rights, fair competition and ways to solve future disputes. 
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly admitted in an update to EU leaders late Monday that a deal continues to hang in the balance and set a new deadline of Wednesday to conclude talks.
Adding to the worries is the impact of the winter surge of the Covid-19 virus, as a sharp rise in coronavirus cases has led to a string of renewed lockdowns, including strict measures in the U.S. state of California as well as Germany and South Korea.
However, help is on the way. The U.K. starts vaccinating its public with the Pfizer/BioNTech injection Tuesday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration meets to discuss this vaccine on Thursday, while the European authorities are expected to authorise its rollout by the end of the month.
Additionally, the European Central Bank holds its latest policy-setting meeting on Thursday, with the central bank widely expected to increase and extend its pandemic bond-buying program.
On Capitol Hill, Republican and Democratic negotiators continue to try to reach an agreement on a Covid-19 relief package, with last week’s weak payrolls data adding a degree of immediacy. 
Oil prices slipped Tuesday as traders looked to balance positions on the back of recent gains and with a sharp rise in coronavirus cases leading to a string of renewed lockdowns globally.
Data due from the American Petroleum Institute later Tuesday and from the U.S. government on Wednesday are expected to show that U.S. crude stocks fell last week.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $45.25 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.2% to $48.20. Both benchmarks lost around 1% Monday, but this followed five consecutive weeks of gains.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,869.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2112.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 02:06AM ET</span>",Asian stocks dip as pandemic concerns overshadow U.S. stimulus hopes,"By Pete Schroeder and Julie Zhu
WASHINGTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian stocks came under pressure on Tuesday as investors struggled to balance hopes for more economic stimulus and vaccines with fresh concerns about a surge in COVID-19 infections.
Mixed Asian trade followed a similarly mixed Wall Street session in which the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at a record high while the two other major U.S. indices fell.
European markets are also likely to struggle for firm direction with London's FTSE down 0.3% and Eurostoxx 50 futures and those of Germany's DAX flat. 
""You saw more than a slight moderation to the S&P 500, and the Dow, but you're still looking at these markets at record highs,"" said Tom Piotrowski, a market analyst with CommSec. ""It's a matter of looking out for what the next catalyst is for these markets.""
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan narrowed its losses from early trade, but was still down 0.02% as anxiety over the coronavirus pandemic capped sentiment.
Among Asia's top markets, Australian shares closed higher for a sixth straight session, lifted by data showing an improvement in business sentiment. The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.2% to 6,687.7, adding about 3% in the past six sessions.
However, Japan's Nikkei 225 dipped 0.22% and Seoul's Kospi lost 1.53%.
Chinese blue-chips remained flat while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.56%, as Sino-U.S. tensions continued to weigh on the market. 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi assured U.S. executives that Beijing remained committed to the Phase 1 trade deal with the United States. That came as a report showed China's purchases of U.S. goods and services as of October, specified in the Phase 1 deal at $75.5 billion for 2020, was about half the level they should be on a pro-rated annual basis.
On Wall Street, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.45% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.49% and the S&P 500 lost 0.19%.
Some investors are watching whether U.S. policymakers can reinvigorate efforts to pass additional pandemic stimulus. The U.S. Congress is expected to vote this week on a one-week stopgap funding bill to give negotiators more time to strike a compromise, as the business community cautioned inaction could spur a deeper recession.
At the same time, California, the nation's most populous state, announced new restrictions on travel and business activity after record case numbers and hospitalizations. Officials in New York warned similar restrictions could be employed soon, which further weigh on the nation's recovery.
The dollar slid against most currencies as investors eyed potential stimulus and vaccine development. An index that tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies was little changed at 90.829, not far from 90.471, its weakest since April 2018. 
Sterling clung to hopes of a meeting between British Prime Minister Boris Johnston and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen salvaging a Brexit trade deal.
The British currency was on edge but holding on at $1.3360 in the Asia afternoon session, well above Monday's low of $1.3225.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year notes rose slightly to 0.9361% on Tuesday.
Oil prices fell, extending losses from the previous session. Brent crude fell 0.72% and U.S. crude dipped 0.57%. Prices came under pressure after Reuters reported the United States was prepping sanctions on at least a dozen Chinese officials over alleged roles in Beijing's disqualification of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.

Spot gold prices were 0.22% higher at $1,867.70 per ounce, and U.S. gold futures settled up 0.31% at $1,871.7, as investors bet on more stimulus money being pumped into the financial system.

TAICHUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - It's unseasonably quiet at Harlan Tsai's factory, which has been churning out Christmas trees, wreaths and snow angels for more than three decades.
Normally, around 30 employees at the Lien Teng Enterprise factory in Taichung, central Taiwan would be making over 10,000 trees. But this year, clients have slashed orders in anticipation of a huge slide in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic and the factory has had to cut back staff to fewer than 10.
""We have lost half or more of our exports to Europe and the Americas,"" said Tsai, known in Taiwan as the ""Christmas King"".
The lack of overseas orders has prompted the company to look domestically. While few Taiwanese celebrate Christmas, it supplies decorations to shopping malls and major landmarks. With the island relatively unscathed by the virus, Tsai says demand has been quite stable.
At a wholesale shop selling products from Lien Teng Enterprise last week, a steady stream of customers perused the offerings of festive baubles and fake pines in every imaginable hue. 

    ""We cannot travel overseas, so we came here today to check out if there are wholesale products in Taiwan,"" said Wu Ming Teng, a Christmas product retailer.

In the country's biggest white collar criminal case, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has brought charges against the financial giants, their client and their former executives, accusing them of colluding to keep stock they were trying to sell to stop the price falling.
The matter has crawled through numerous hearings in a local court in Sydney as lawyers for each defendant sought to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and question whether regulators followed due process as they gathered evidence.
Now, with the formal pleas of not guilty, the matter will go to trial in the Federal Court, more than two years since the charges were brought and five years since the A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) stock issue for ANZ took place. A trial date has not yet been set.
ACCC chair Rod Sims declined to comment since the matter was before the court.
Citi denied the allegations, as it has done throughout, while Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) said it would defend the charges. ANZ, Australia's fourth-largest retail bank, declined to comment. 
The case is being closely watched by financial markets participants around the world because it could influence how capital raisings are conducted.
For companies, each criminal cartel charge could mean a fine of up to A$10 million or three times the amount the company benefited from the actions in question, whichever is greater.

Individuals face sentences of to up to 10 years' imprisonment, fines of up to A$420,000, or both.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A second U.S. judge late on Monday granted a preliminary injunction blocking the U.S. Commerce Department from imposing restrictions on Chinese-owned short video sharing app TikTok that would have effectively barred its use in the United States.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued an order in a suit filed by TikTok-owner ByteDance more than a month after U.S. judge Wendy Beetlestone in Pennsylvania blocked the same restrictions that were set to take effect on Nov. 12 in a suit brought by some TikTok users.
Nichols on Sept. 27 had separately blocked the Commerce Department from banning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google app stores from offering the app for downloads by new users.
A TikTok spokesman said it was ""pleased that the court agreed with us and granted a preliminary injunction.""
Nichols, who was named to the bench by President Donald Trump last year, said the Commerce Department ""likely overstepped"" its legal authority in issuing the effective TikTok ban ""and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to consider obvious alternatives.""
The Commerce Department said it would ""vigorously defend"" Trump's August executive order that authorized the restrictions and said it ""is fully consistent with law and promotes legitimate national security interests. The government will continue to comply with the injunctions.""
Nichols' order enjoins the agency from barring data hosting within the United States for TikTok, content delivery services and other technical transactions.
On Friday, the Trump administration declined to grant ByteDance a new extension of Trump's August order requiring it to divest TikTok's U.S. assets, but talks will continue, Reuters reported.
The Treasury Department said late on Friday the government ""is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks.""
The Trump administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China's government. TikTok, which has over 100 million U.S. users, denies the allegation.
Under pressure from the U.S. government, ByteDance has been in talks for months to finalize a deal with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to shift TikTok's U.S. assets into a new entity.

A U.S. appeals court will hear arguments on Nichols' app store ban injunction on Dec. 14.

Investing.com – Jd Health International Inc (HK:6618), Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com's (NASDAQ:JD) healthcare unit, debuted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday, with shares trading nearly 50% higher in the morning.
The healthcare company’s HK$27 billion ($3.5 billion) IPO is the biggest that the bourse has seen this year. JD Health priced its 381.9 million shares at HK$70.58 apiece, which were oversubscribed nearly 422 times in the retail tranche and around 31 times under the international offering. The stock opened at HK$94.5 then surged to as high as HK$104.3.
“This marks the second largest IPO issued by a Chinese company in the overseas stock markets, as well as the largest equity financing project in the history of Chinese Internet healthcare companies,” said China Renaissance, the exclusive financial advisor of JD Health’s IPO, in a statement.
The company is now valued at nearly $39 billion after the share price increase, up $10 billion from its valuation prior to the IPO.
JD Health is the largest online healthcare platform by revenue in China in 2019, recording a total revenue of ¥ 10.8 billion. It is also the largest online retail pharmacy by revenue in China in 2019 with a market share of 29.8%. Proceeds are expected to be used to further develop JD Health's retail pharmacy business and online healthcare services."

Their braking systems may not function due to software defects, the ministry said, but did not mention if the defects have led to accidents.
It was not immediately clear if the recall would affect other markets. Kona is one of best-selling electric vehicles in Europe and their sales outside the home market accounted for more than three quarters of the total.
The South Korean recall would cover about 40,000 Kona electric and hybrid electric vehicles produced between May 2019 and November 2020 and 10,138 Nexo fuel cell SUVs made between January 2018 and November 2020. 
Affiliate Kia Motors also plans to recall an additional 1,895 Soul electric cars due to a similar issue, the ministry said. 

Hyundai is also recalling at least 74,000 of its Kona EVs globally, after more than a dozen vehicles caught fire in Korea, Canada and Europe over two years.

The inquiry into the destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelter in May has heard testimony from dozens of people and more than 140 submissions from miners, heritage specialists and Aboriginal and civil society groups. 
The committee is due to table its report to the Senate on Wednesday afternoon, after COVID-19 disruptions delayed hearings, and is now more likely to finish in the second half of 2021 once it has heard testimony from other states, an official told Reuters.
It is widely expected to castigate Rio on its failures as well as propose mining industry and legal reform. Its findings may also include a call for compensation. 
""I think the only risk is that Rio has to pay some form of restitution,"" said analyst Glyn Lawcock of UBS in Sydney.
Even then, in the context of Rio Tinto's $123 billion valuation, the amount was not likely to be material; however recommendations to overhaul legislation could result in delays to industry mine expansion plans in the years ahead, he said.
""That could slow the process down and that will have an impact on global supply and demand at the end of the day,"" he said. Western Australia supplies 55% of China's iron ore needs.
Rio is also expected to announce its new chief executive any day, after Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other senior leaders agreed to step down in August due to the procedural failings it found led to the disaster and the way it was initially managed. 

Front runners for the new job include Shell (LON:RDSa) Australia chairman Zoe Yujnovich, who once ran Rio's Canadian iron ore business, former BP (NYSE:BP) Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) finance director Stephen Pearce, OZ Minerals CEO Andrew Cole, and former Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) CEO Nev Power.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Tuesday morning after key U.S. benchmarks broke a four-day winning streak during the Monday session overnight.
Rising COVID-19 cases in the U.S., Germany and South Korea weighed on investors and overshadowed news that the U.K. would start vaccinating people Tuesday and that the U.S. would likely follow suit later this week.
Markets in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong all fell during the morning session while markets in China were mixed and Australia was marginally higher.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.30% by 9:15 PM ET (2:15 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.79%.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.22%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.56% shortly after the opening of the morning session.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.21% while the tech-heavy Shenzhen Component was up 0.33%
Pressuring stocks was news of renewed tensions between the U.S. and China, with the former preparing to impose sanctions on more than a dozen Chinese officials in relation to their activities to curb dissent in Hong Kong, Reuters reported.
The ratcheting up of tensions overshadowed a strong recovery in Chinese foreign trade. Data released Monday suggested Chinese exports in November jumped by the most since early 2018 and pushed the country’s trade surplus to a record monthly high. Exports jumped more than 21% from the same month in 2019. Imports, on the other hand, grew just 4.5%.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 fell off all-time highs on Monday as new lockdowns took effect in parts of the U.S., including California. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose for the ninth day in a row.
Markets are now looking to the increasing likelihood that the U.S. government will agree to a new stimulus deal that could be worth more than $900 billion, in particular after jobs data out Monday was disappointing and suggested the economic rebound from the pandemic is beginning to slow.
The U.S. government is also negotiating a deal on a government spending deal. Without a deal, the government would be forced to shut down. The original deadline to reach a spending deal was Friday but negotiators appeared ready to extend that deadline."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - JD (NASDAQ:JD) Health International Inc shares rose as much as 46.5% above the issue price in their Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday, following an initial public offering (IPO) that was the city's largest of 2020.
JD Health is a subsidiary of e-commerce giant JD.com Inc specialising in online medical consultation and pharmaceutical sales.
It was valued at $29 billion ahead of the debut but the share price increase now puts that valuation nearer $39 billion.
The company sold the shares at HK$70.58 each to raise $3.48 billion. The stock opened at HK$94.50 before rallying to as high as $HK103.3, becoming Hong Kong's most actively traded stock by turnover early in the session.
The stock bucked a downward trend in the broader local market as the benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 0.4%.
Kingston Securities executive director of research Dickie Wong said with market capitalisation of that size, JD Health would likely be fast-tracked into the Shanghai Hong Kong Stock Connect and the Hang Seng technology index.
""Investors are thinking they don't want to wait to buy the stock,"" he told Reuters.
""Once the stock moves into the tech index, then index funds have to buy it no matter what they think of the company so investors are taking advantage of the likely move now.""
The rise in JD Health's first-day trading could make it vulnerable to a sell-off in the next few days, said Everbright Sun Hung Kai research analyst Kenny Ng.
""JD Health provides a good opportunity for profit-taking in short term if its share price is above $HK100 since IPO investors have already got around 40% return,"" he said.
The firm's IPO prospectus showed it had 72.5 million annual active users as of June 30 versus 53.5 million at the same time last year.
Its IPO was the largest in Hong Kong in 2020, followed by China Bohai Bank Co Ltd's $2.05 billion listing in July. Dealmakers expect more activity to unfold during December.
The float has taken Hong Kong's IPO proceeds to over $25 billion in 2020, from over 100 individual deals, on track for the best year in a decade, Refinitiv data showed.

Adding secondary listings - including JD.com's $4.4 billion transaction in June - the value reaches $39.1 billion so far this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said on Monday it has awarded $9.2 billion to provide high-speed broadband internet service to 5.22 million unserved homes and businesses, boosting access in rural areas.
The FCC said in its ""Rural Digital Opportunity Fund"" auction that  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) won $1.22 billion to provide service to 1.06 million locations, while Elon Musk's SpaceX won $885 million to serve 642,000 locations.
The Rural Electric Cooperative Consortium won $1.1 billion to serve 618,000 locations and LTD Broadband LLC won $1.32 billion to serve 528,000 locations. 
A lack of internet access in rural areas is a major political issue in the United States and hinders economic growth and economic opportunities in places without access, lawmakers say. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to expand broadband access to all Americans.
A May FCC report said 18.3 million people in the United States lack access to broadband, but Democrats say that underestimates the problem, while Republicans note the report found the number without access has fallen by 30% since 2016.
The FCC estimated the latest funding will expand broadband to more than 10 million rural Americans.
SpaceX is developing a broadband internet system with low latency, or time delay, using low Earth orbit satellites.
Nearly all the locations will receive broadband with upload and download speeds of at least 100/20 megabits per second (Mbps) with an overwhelming majority - over 85% - getting gigabit-speed broadband. The funds will be distributed over the next 10 years.
The FCC said $6.8 billion in funding that was not awarded will be rolled over into a future auction that can use up to $11.2 billion to target partially served areas and remaining unserved areas.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the auction was ""technologically neutral"" and structured to ""prioritize bids for high-speed, low-latency offerings.""

According to filings on Friday in Manhattan federal court, Energizer Holdings (NYSE:ENR) Inc and Duracell, the battery unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, agreed to voluntarily dismiss competing lawsuits filed there.
Energizer sued Duracell in Sept. 2019 over claims the then-new ""Optimum"" batteries were more powerful and lasted longer than rival batteries.
Duracell sued Energizer a year later, challenging claims that the latter's MAX batteries lasted up to 50% longer than ""basic"" alkaline batteries.

(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc is selling its autonomous driving unit, Uber (NYSE:UBER) Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), to self-driving car startup Aurora, the companies said on Monday, in a move that would accelerate the ride-sharing company's goal to achieve profitability. 
The equity deal valued the ATG at $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. This marks a major drop in valuation for ATG, as it raised $1 billion from a consortium of investors including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and SoftBank Group Corp at a valuation of $7.25 billion last year.
Following the sale announced on Monday, Uber is also investing $400 million in Aurora, which values Aurora at $10 billion, the people added. Uber will hold about 26% ownership interest in Aurora on a fully diluted basis, the company said in a filing. 
Aurora, which is working to develop self-driving trucks, cars and delivery vehicles, will collaborate with Uber to launch self-driving vehicles on its ride-hailing and food delivery network. Uber is also working on building out its freight logistics platform but is not operating its own trucks at present.
The sale will accelerate Uber's goal to achieve profitability on an adjusted basis by the end of 2021, Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi told Reuters in an interview. ""This essentially advances our path to profitability,"" he said. 
Khosrowshahi, who will take a seat on Aurora's board, said Uber's profitability was not the leading factor in the deal.
But Uber has been seeking options for its autonomous vehicle division, a cash-burn machine, including more outside investment, as Khosrowshahi refocused on core businesses including ride-hailing and food delivery since the pandemic hit.
Aurora is among dozens of startups, automakers and large technology companies working on self-driving car systems, eager to capitalize on a sea change in the transportation industry. It was last valued at over $3 billion in September 2019, according to PitchBook data. 
The Palo Alto, California-based startup, which is already testing vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area and Pittsburgh, said in July it was expanding testing and development of its vehicles to the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas.
Uber's partnership with Aurora is not exclusive. Khosrowshahi said Uber would continue to install self-driving technology on a variety of vehicle makes, but called the relationship with Aurora ""special.""
""If the technology becomes real, I think our investment will be money good and then some,"" he said.

(Reuters) -A new investment firm is taking aim at one of corporate America's most iconic brands, pressing energy giant  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) to overhaul itself by focusing more on clean energy to improve its financial performance.
Engine No. 1 is being supported by pension fund California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) as it pushes the battered energy company, valued at $176 billion, to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and refresh its board.
""The industry and the world it operates in are changing and ... Exxon Mobil must change as well,"" Engine No. 1 wrote to Exxon's board, adding ""given the company's long-running underperformance and the challenges it faces, it is time for shareholders to weigh in.""
Exxon is reviewing the hedge fund's letter, an Exxon spokesman said. 
The U.S. oil company this year reversed course on a massive oil and gas expansion program, cutting 30% from its spending plan and proposing a budget next year that is $4 billion to $7 billion below its outlays this year. It also plans to reduce its workforce by 14,000 people over the next two years as losses this year reached $2.37 billion. 
Engine No. 1 faces a tough road. Exxon has beaten back past activist efforts to change its climate stance and to split the roles of chairman and chief executive.
But industry analysts also said the time may be right for traditional activists' interest to overlap with climate activists' interest and force Exxon to act. ""There is a need for a fairly active reset right now,"" said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a non profit organization that works with institutional investors and companies. ""Everyone starts at the bottom of the hill with Exxon but Engine No. 1's director nominees is not a list of flaky people."" 
The activist investment firm, launched last week by two hedge fund industry veterans, said it plans to nominate four directors to Exxon's 10-person board who have expertise in clean technology and running energy companies: Gregory Goff, Kaisa Hietala, Alexander Karsner, and Anders Runevad. 
""Exxon's refusal to adequately address climate risk is of serious concern to many shareholders and is a sign of significant governance issues. The company's board needs overhauling. We're looking forward to reviewing the slate of new directors,"" said New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, whose fund owns a roughly $300 million stake, according to Refinitiv data.
Besides pushing Exxon to add new directors with more relevant energy industry experience to the board, the investment firm also wants Exxon to cut costs on projects that are unlikely to earn money, create a better plan for success in the renewable energy sector and to overhaul management compensation to better align with shareholder value creation, the letter said. 
Exxon has long faced investor pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but this is the first time an activist firm is mounting a proxy contest that could resonate with both institutional investors concerned about the company's direction and retail investors worried about dividends, analysts said.
This was the first year since 1982 that Exxon has not raised its dividend and its share price has tumbled 41% in 52 weeks. Its $15 billion a year dividend should be cut because it drains cash that could restructure the business, some analysts said. 
Engine No. 1 is run by Chris James, best known for technology investing but who also has considerable energy investment experience, and Charles Penner, who led activist investment firm Jana Partner's campaign against iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to let parents limit children's phone in 2018.
Engine No. 1 owns roughly $40 million worth of stock in Exxon, according to a person familiar with the investment, while CalSTRS owns roughly $334 million, according to Refinitiv data.The campaign's success will depend largely on how Vanguard Group, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and  State Street  (NYSE:STT), the country's biggest index funds that are also Exxon's top three shareholders, react.
BlackRock and State Street are members of Climate Action 100+, an investor group pressing the largest greenhouse gas emitters to act on climate change. BlackRock this year pressured Exxon by voting against two directors and voting to split the chairman and CEO roles on the board, but the push failed.

Exxon shares fell 1.9% to $40.88 in afternoon trading.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>","Private equity firms, investors sign global initiative on diversity","By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Nearly 50 buyout firms and investors have signed a global initiative that aims to improve diversity and inclusion among their ranks, a U.S. private equity investor association said on Monday.
The move comes as Wall Street tries to shake off its male- and white-dominated image. Only about a fifth of the employees in the alternative asset management industry are women, a Preqin survey found in February.
About 46 private equity firms and investors, including Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc, France-based Ardian, Canada's CPP Investments and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, are founding signatories to the initiative launched by the Institutional Limited Partners Association. The Washington, D.C.-based ILPA represents many large public and private pension funds, endowments, family offices and foundations.
Many companies have launched diversity initiatives this year following the death of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis who died while in police custody on May 25. Floyd's death sparked protests in the United States and beyond.
Under the ILPA initiative, participating private equity firms and investors are required to adopt a public diversity and inclusion statement or strategy, track internal statistics on hiring and promotion by gender and diversity, specify organizational goals to attain more inclusive recruitment and retention, and provide data to investors making new commitments during fundraising.
The initiative also calls for providing unconscious bias training for employees, tracking gender and race statistics among portfolio companies, and assigning a senior manager to be accountable for diversity and inclusion.
""Beyond work from home, 2020 was a catalytic year which sparked a different kind of conversation that brought a lot of issues to fore around culture, which is essentially diversity and inclusion,"" said Jennifer Choi, ILPA's managing director for industry affairs.
ILPA said it expects to welcome more signatories from private equity firms and institutional investors. It will begin publishing a quarterly analysis of actions taken by signatories on diversity and inclusion next year.

Investing.com - The Dow broke its four-day win streak Monday as value stocks came under pressure from rising Covid-19 restrictions following a surge in cases over the past week, though losses were kept in check by optimism over an imminent vaccine roll out.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.49%, or 148 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.20%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.45% to close at record highs.
The $908 billion stimulus bipartisan deal remains in the balance as plans to bundle the relief package with a government funding bill - needed to prevent a government shutdown - have been dented by several issues yet to be resolved in order to get a spending plan over the line by the Friday deadline, The Washington Post reported. 
Investors were hopeful that lawmakers would agree a stopgap spending bill to keep the government funded, buying more time for lawmakers to iron out their differences on stimulus. Business liability insurance from coronavirus-related lawsuits and state as well as local government support are thought to be holding up the progress of a deal. 
The urgency for a deal has been exacerbated by the latest rise Covid-19 cases that have led several states across the country to impose new restrictions to curb the spread.
U.S. infections from Covid-19 surged above 14.7 million on Sunday with 1.3 million cases seen over the past week.
But there is light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel.  Pfizer  's (NYSE:PFE) emergency use authorization application for its vaccine, developed in partnership with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) could be approved by the Federal and Drug Administration in the coming days.

Investing.com -- Stocks were mixed on Monday as Covid-19 surges strained the U.S. healthcare system and a vaccine has yet to receive U.S. approval.
The good news is Congress appears closer to an actual deal for more stimulus relief, at least for ailing businesses and the unemployed. Both political parties have been fighting over the terms of the now $908 billion package. Lawmakers also have to approve government spending by the end of the week or risk a shutdown.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) could get U.S. approval for its vaccine by the weekend. It has already been approved in the U.K.
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) led Dow stocks lower on signs Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gearing up its own chip plans.
This is a big week for some high-profile initial public offerings. A number of earnings reports also straggle out on Tuesday.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings from AutoZone and others
Cars have been the vehicle of choice during the pandemic as people get away from using public transportation to go on day trips. That means the cars have to work. AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO) is expected to report earnings per share of $17.56 on revenue of $3.1 billion. That would be a healthy gain from last year.
People also spent a lot on their pets during stay-at-home orders. That said,  Chewy Inc  (NYSE:CHWY) is expected to report a loss of 13 cents a share on sales of $1.7 billion. 
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), besieged by people eager to get their hands on elusive  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 5 consoles, is expected to report a loss of 85 cents a share on revenue of just over $1 billion.
2. Economic readings
Nonfarm productivity, released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) is expected to rise 4.9% for the third quarter, in line with the 4.9% gain in the second quarter. The report comes after the government’s November jobs report last week showed a much lower than expected gain in jobs.
Small businesses, especially in the restaurant and hospitality business, are reeling from another wave of shutdowns as local governments try to get a grip on the widening pandemic. The NFIB Small Business Optimism reading for November is due out at 6:00 AM ET (1000 GMT). The reading for October was 104.
3. These hot stock debuts raise price targets
Food delivery app Door Dash raised its IPO guidance to a range of $90 to $95 from $75 to $85. But the biggest IPO this month might be Airbnb, which raised its guidance to $56 to $60 from $44 to $50. At that level, Airbnb’s debut would value the home-sharing service at $41 billion, just about even with the world’s biggest hotel operator, Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR).

406,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Online lender SoFi explores deal to go public - sources,"By Joshua Franklin and David French
(Reuters) - Online lending startup Social Finance Inc (SoFi) has held discussions with blank-check acquisition companies about a deal that would allow it to debut in the stock market, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
The discussions show that going public is solidly in the sights of SoFi's CEO, Anthony Noto. A former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) investment banker and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s ex-chief operating officer, Noto succeeded SoFi co-founder Mike Cagney, who stepped down in 2018. Noto said last year that going public was in the company's long-term plans, but had cautioned it was not a priority.
The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at $4.8 billion in a private fundraising round last year, has held talks with a number of so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), the sources said, cautioning there is no certainty an agreement would be reached. 
The sources requested anonymity because the talks are confidential. SoFi did not respond to requests for comment.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds in an initial public offering with the aim of acquiring a private company, which then becomes public as result of the merger. 
SPACs have emerged as one of Wall Street's most popular investment vehicles in 2020, with 208 SPACs raising more than $70 billion so far this year, according to SPAC Research. United Wholesale Mortgage and Finance of America were among the mortgage lenders that agreed to go public this year through SPACs.
Founded in 2011, SoFi capitalized on the retrenchment of banks from large swaths of consumer lending in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. It started with refinancing student loans and expanded into mortgages and personal loans. 
The company said in October it had received preliminary, conditional approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in its application for a national bank charter. The company has also branched out into stock trading and cash management accounts.

SoFi has raised over $3 billion in capital, according to PitchBook data. Its financial backers include private equity firm Silver Lake and billionaire investor Peter Thiel.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Monday it was taking ""a few chips off the table"" after a thundering rally in emerging markets over the last month.
The bank said it was sticking to its core view that developing economy currencies and select countries' bonds would continue to climb, but was dialling back its bullish bets after November's surge. 
That included closing long positions on South Africa's rand, which has surged 13% since June, tightening stop-losses on Latin American currencies like Brazil's real and Mexico's and Colombia's pesos, and chopping back a bunch of bond bets including in Egypt and Ukraine.
""We see the rally in EM (emerging market) currencies being front-loaded into year-end and 1Q21, but then petering out,"" Morgan Stanley's analysts said. ""We are also neutral on EM credit, where we think that spreads are close to bottoming out."" 
They said they were watching China's credit cycle particularly closely. 
""China could be the first among the major economies to start applying the brakes next year"" in terms of stimulus, Morgan Stanley added, ""and, when it does, markets will likely pay attention.""
The currencies of commodity-producing countries are likely to suffer as they generally rally as China's credit impulse intensifies and depreciate as it wanes. 
A more encouraging signal could be an expected increase of the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights (SDR) that is likely, in dollar terms, to be worth between $500 billion to over $1 trillion.
An SDR can be thought of as a credit token issued by the IMF to countries that can then exchange it for hard currency. 
An increase would be supportive to emerging markets, in part because it would signal greater international co-operation, and could help debt-strained countries such as Sri Lanka, Kenya, Argentina, Bahrain, Ecuador, Ghana and Pakistan.
On average, a $500 billion equivalent increase would help boost foreign exchange reserves 21%-22% in Bahrain and Ecuador and more than 10% in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Ghana. 

""It could (also) increase expectations of further financial aid if required."" Morgan Stanley said.

Acrotec supplies high-precision industrial applications to the watchmaking and medtech industries, as well as to the electronics, aerospace and auto sectors. It employs around 1,200 people.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Airbnb streamlines fees as it tilts toward biggest hosts,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Airbnb is requiring most professional hosts outside North America to include all service fees in the rate presented to guests, a move that mirrors how rival platforms operate. 
Airbnb will require hosts who use third-party software to manage bookings to eliminate the “service fee” paid by guests that is traditionally tacked on to the listing price. Instead hosts will pay a standard fee of 15%, up from the typical 3% they are assessed now. 
Hosts interviewed by Reuters said they expect most will raise their listed prices to account for the larger host fee, making the change cost-neutral for most guests and for Airbnb. But hosts with fewer properties expressed some concerns.
The new fee structure comes as the San Francisco-based home rental platform prepares to sell shares in its initial public offering this week. Airbnb said early tests show the simplified pricing helped drive 17% more bookings. 
“Following feedback from hosts we recently introduced a simplified host-only fee structure for professional hosts who connect to our API in certain countries,"" said Airbnb spokesperson Christopher Nulty. ""Our fee structure for individual hosts remains unchanged."" 
The change will not impact individual hosts on Airbnb who do not use third-party software to manage listings. Airbnb said in a statement to Reuters that the move is based on feedback from hosts in an effort to make pricing ""effortless."" 
The fee change has been communicated to professional hosts but not reported widely.
Airbnb began with hosts renting out air mattresses in their homes. A former Airbnb host acquisition specialist told Reuters “individual hosts are good for PR.” But hosts managing hundreds or thousands of properties drive an outsized portion of revenue. As of end-September, 10% of Airbnb’s hosts were professional managers, and they accounted for 28% of nights booked, according to Airbnb’s IPO filings.
Management software platform Uplisting’s CEO Vincent Breslin said hotels and professional managers of multiple properties have asked for the change to make it easier to list across different platforms with one sticker price.
“Having fee parity across all platforms is a benefit to all,” said Ryan Danz, CEO of Air Concierge Inc., which manages about 500 properties. “It makes a better apples-to-apples comparison for the traveler if they find the same home listed on various websites.”
But some smaller property managers are worried the change could hurt them if they can’t raise prices enough to cover the increased host fee.
Airbnb already gave itself a black eye with many hosts when it made them issue refunds for cancellations caused by the global pandemic. It now faces a class action suit and hundreds of arbitration cases stemming from that.
Johnny Buckingham, who manages nine listings on Airbnb across the United States, said he would not want to raise his listing price to cover the increased host fee and believed Airbnb was discouraging hosts from using software to cross-list on other platforms.
“They’ve made their message clear. Stick exclusively with us or pay us 5x as much,” he said.
Airbnb denied the move targets hosts using third-party software, saying the fee change is available ""on a test basis"" and will help hosts control pricing across platforms. 
""If hosts are already pricing consistently and want to maintain their earnings, they can adjust their prices so their earnings stay the same and guests will pay the same price as before,"" a spokesperson at Airbnb said. 
Sarah DuPre, sales director at AirDNA, an analytics firm specializing in vacation rentals, said that the move will have a minimal impact on host retention but could impact Airbnb’s “ability to be seen as the most economical source of accommodation.""

Rowan Clifford, who helps Airbnb hosts improve visibility of their listings and is also a host, predicted in a blog post two years ago that host fees would go up as hosts become reliant on Airbnb. He expects individual hosts will eventually also see a fee hike and said smaller hosts could face price competition from professionally managed listings that don't raise prices to cover the increased host fee. “They don’t need us as much anymore, basically.”

410,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",'Sell' signals indicate roadbump ahead for world equities,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - After a record November, a strong start for world equities this month has triggered some of the ""sell"" signals monitored by major investment banks, raising chances that the run to record highs is about to pause.
Ranging from retail investor surveys to derivative market positions, many such signals imply that some of the world's biggest stock markets are ripe for a pullback from the euphoric levels hit after a slew of promising vaccine breakthroughs.
EPFR data shows a record $115 billion poured into equity funds in the past four weeks, sending the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 back to all-time highs with a 13% surge in one month. Europe's STOXX 600 gained 15% during the same period.
""There is no doubt that sentiment is still euphoric and overstretched to some extent,"" said Jimmy Conway, head of EMEA equity trading strategy at Citibank.
Several banks noted ""stretched"" investor positioning, though they saw it as a minor hiccup before double-digit returns in 2021, supported by vaccine-driven economic recovery.
""In the near-term, the risk of a modest equity market pullback has risen,"" with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) told clients, citing the worsening virus situation in the United States.
Beyond that, they predicted investors would keep rotating out of cash and into equities.
Here are five charts indicating how investors are positioned in equity markets:
1/ RAGING BULLS
The latest sentiment survey by American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) showed retail investors in a bullish mood; considered a classic contrarian signal, the indicator is hovering near the highest in almost three years.
Graphic: AAII survey https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgmrzwvq/AAII%20survey.JPG
2/ BURSTING CALLS, FALLING PUTS
The frenzy is also visible in options markets. The CBOE put-to-call ratio has hit 20-year lows, at levels last seen just before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. Put options confer the right to sell at a pre-agreed price and calls allow holders to buy.

3/ TECHNICALLY OVERBOUGHT
On a technical basis too, the S&P 500 and STOXX 600 are nudging into overbought territory. Their relative strength indexes (RSI) -- a 0-100 gauge of bullish and bearish momentum -- are near 70, a level that leaves them vulnerable to profit-taking.
Japan's Nikkei index entered overbought territory in November and has since ceded some gains.

4/ SIGNS OF GREED
Last week, BofA said its closely watched 'Bull & Bear' indicator -- a gauge of market sentiment -- was fast approaching ""extreme bullish"" levels jumping to 5.8 from 4.7. The indicator runs from zero, indicating extremely bearish and ""buy"", to 10, signaling extremely bullish and ""sell"".
It was pinned closer to zero for much of the summer.

5/ DON'T WORRY
The S&P 500 has bounced some 65% off mid-March troughs, comparable to their performance in the eight-month period after hitting a floor during the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. Bulls will remind us the index then extended its rally all the way to 2020, meaning there is little cause to worry.

A regulatory filing Monday showed the American home rental firm plans to price 51.6 million shares at between $56 and $60 apiece in its market debut later this week. That’s significantly higher than the $44 to $50 range it had targeted earlier. That would give the company a fully diluted valuation of $41.8 billion at the upper end of the range --- more than double the $18 billion it was worth in April in a private fundraising round in the early weeks of the health crisis. 
Airbnb has mounted a comeback since then. It initially struggled in the immediate aftermath of the crisis as travel came to a halt. But as lockdowns eased, more travelers chose to book homes instead of hotels. 
It has been a bumper year studded with huge IPOs that just saw food delivery startup DoorDash raise its IPO price range last week. But Airbnb’s debut, which would raise up to $3 billion, is one of the largest and most anticipated among them. "

""The scale and speed of the expansion will depend on the availability of capital and our assessment of the business opportunity at various production levels, taking into account, among other factors, any by American initiatives,"" he said.

Rubenstein is expected to join the firm next year and will report to Sebastian Barrack, Citadel's head of commodities, who leads the investment teams trading energy, agriculture and other commodity products, spokeswoman Megan Ingersoll said.
Citadel, which had about $35 billion in assets under management as of Oct. 1, practices a so-called multi-strategy array of bets on stocks, bonds, commodities and other securities using teams of traders.
Its flagship Wellington fund is up 21.2% this year through Nov. 30, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Ingersoll declined to comment on performance. 
Rubenstein joined Morgan Stanley in 2007 as a power trader and was named global head of commodities trading in June last year, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Rubenstein and another top executive Nancy King, global head of commodities, left Morgan Stanley earlier this year over what sources said was a breach of compliance policy on communication tools.
While the bank did not find any wrongdoing, the use of those communication channels went against policy, sources have said.

Germany's largest bank said that from 2021 management compensation would be tied to reaching targets on sustainable finance investments, on the sustainability ratings it receives from five leading ESG ratings agencies and on succeeding in reducing the bank's own energy consumption. 
Banks such as HSBC, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and UniCredit also have varying models in place that link pay to ESG, as more investors look to invest in companies that perform better on ESG metrics.
It also comes as policymakers globally increasingly look to banks to help to promote a transition to a low-carbon economy and meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
""It is our ambition to be a leader on sustainability in the financial sector, and contribute to an environmentally sound, socially inclusive and well-governed world"", Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing said.
The bank did not disclose how much of management pay is related to ESG. Banks such as BNP Paribas have tied around 20% of variable pay to meeting ESG criteria. 
Deutsche Bank has said that it plans investments in sustainable financing worth more than 200 billion euros ($242.66 billion) by 2025, with more than 20 billion euros this year, and to be carbon-neutral itself by 2025.

Investing.com --  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) dropped 4% after a report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning new chips poised to outperform Intel's.
Apple is planning a series of new processors to succeed its M1 chip that debuted in November, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company said it expects to finish the transition away from Intel and to its own silicon in 2022. 
Intel gets less than 10% of its revenue from Apple.    
Shares of Intel are down some 27% since hitting a 2020 high in January. While tech stocks have tended to outperform in a year in which we've become dependent upon our devices, Intel has missed the boat. Rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) have more than doubled this year. 
Intel's revenue for the most recent quarter was the lowest in the last five, and also 4% lower than a year earlier, according to data tracked by Investing.com. Sales for the fourth quarter are expected to fall about $1 billion from the previous quarter.
Meanwhile, Nvidia and AMD reported their highest sales ever in their most recent quarterly reports, and are expected to surpass those numbers for the current quarter.

Investing.com --  Not so fast. 
Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) fell 4% after Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) said it's unlikely Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will buy the company. 
Rumors of a takeover circulated last week, which Piper analyst James Fish said would make strategic sense and help Cisco in the cloud world, but Cisco has said it isn't interested in large M&A, according to Seeking Alpha. Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) would ""make more sense"" as a takeover target for Cisco. 
Fastly has rallied more than 300% this year, as one of its biggest customers, TikTok (yes, that TikTok), has had a banner year with the U.S. population largely stuck at home trying to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
In October Fastly slumped a day after the company released disappointing third-quarter revenue, which dragged down other cloud providers. 
Fastly cited lower spending from TikTop, a top customer, amid ongoing U.S.-China tensions. 
“Due to the impacts of the uncertain geopolitical environment, usage of Fastly’s platform by its previously disclosed largest customer did not meet expectations, resulting in a corresponding significant reduction in revenue from this customer,” the company said in a statement at the time.
A deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations on Friday passed and negotiations appear to be ongoing, according to Cnet. ByteDance struck a preliminary deal with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).

The iconic 118-year-old department store had filed for bankruptcy in May after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to temporarily close its then nearly 850 stores.

Chief Executive Officer Jill Soltau said the JCPenney banner would continue to serve its customers.
With the completion of the sale, the company will have access to about $1.5 billion in new financing, it said. 
The property holding companies that comprise 160 of the retailer's real estate assets and all of its distribution centers are expected to complete the restructuring process and emerge from bankruptcy protection in the first half of 2021.

VAL D'EUROPE, France (Reuters) - Sleeping Beauty's castle stands empty at Disneyland's theme park outside Paris and the giant twirling teacups and other rides have ground to a halt until at least mid-February due to France's COVID-19 restrictions. 
In neighbouring towns, where hotels have sprouted over the past three decades, the silence is just as eerie - and locals are starting to fear for their jobs. 
""As long as Disney doesn't open up again, as long as there are no tourists, there's no point crying victory even if we were able to open tomorrow,"" said Tomica Vajic, who owns four restaurants near the park. 
Three of his eateries are running with reduced staffing, serving only takeaways for residents. Vajic and his wife Milena have tapped state-guaranteed loans to tide their business over but say they will have to put off their retirement by several years now they have taken on debts. 
Two lockdowns to combat the coronavirus in France this year have pummelled the hospitality sector. Restaurants, for instance, will only be allowed to reopen by Jan. 20 at the earliest. 
In Val d'Europe - a grouping of small towns around the Disney site, which also straddle several shopping centres and are home to about 50,000 people - the fallout is extensive. 
Disney employs seamstresses for costumes, security staff and electricians among its range of more than 15,000 workers in France, said Philippe Descrouet, the mayor of one of the towns, Serris, and the head of Val d'Europe. 
""Obviously it's a disaster right now,"" he said. 
Including the malls, Val d'Europe and Disneyland Paris welcome more people a year than the Louvre Museum and the Eiffel Tower put together, according to local authorities. 
Despite reopening between lockdowns, visitors to the theme park dropped to 5,000-6,000 on some summer days compared to peaks of 60,000, Descrouet said.
EMPTY STREETS 
According to unions, Disney is in talks on around 1,000 departures or job conversions, as it steps up changes to shows it had envisaged even before the crisis. 
Disneyland Paris did not comment on any talks with employees. A 2-billion-euro ($2.43 billion) plan to expand the theme park with new areas - including one based on Marvel superheroes - is on track, a spokesman said. 
For now, most employees are on furlough schemes. Some said they were concerned that not all Disney hotels or attractions would reopen in February and a return to business as usual could be a long way off. 
Even the area's population has shrunk. 
""Many of the performers in the parades and shows were British and have gone home,"" said Valentin Markowski, a resident who once worked at the theme park. ""The streets are empty."" 
About 25 million euros in tourist taxes collected in the area have evaporated this year, Descrouet said. He wants Disney to freeze some planned property developments on local land as authorities cannot keep up with the spending on infrastructure.
Frederic Reith, a 41-year-old environmental consultant sporting a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt, said he would usually visit the park several times a week as a meeting place with friends. 
""We normally hear a dozen different languages being spoken around us,"" said Reith. ""We miss the diversity.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday as tightening restrictions on economic and social life across the U.S. sent the great rotation trade of the last few weeks into reverse – if only temporarily.
With no major progress over the weekend on a possible fiscal relief bill, it was the ‘long duration’ tech stocks in the NASDAQ Composite which advanced, rising to a new record high with a gain of 0.3%.
By contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 99 points, or 0.3%, to 30,119 points, while the S&P 500 fell 0.2%.
While many economic indicators have stayed resilient to the latest wave of the pandemic in the U.S., the labor market report on Friday showed a clear slowdown in the pace of hiring in November. That coincided with fresh signs that the pandemic is worsening in the short run, as the state of California imposed a stay-at-home order for most of its regions, including Los Angeles, in order to stave off a looming crisis in its hospitals. 
Nationwide, the number of deaths reported on Sunday was almost unchanged from the previous week at 1,138, according to the Covid Tracking Project. However, the past five weekdays, when statistics are updated with greater urgency, all showed over 2,400 deaths. 
Deaths are typically a lagging indicator, and the market has chosen to look through the short-term statistical drama, in anticipation of the widespread distribution of vaccines next year. The optimism generated by recent news flow has led to a massive skew in favor of call options over put options, various analysts noted over the weekend.  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW)'s Randy Frederick noted that the skew hadn't been greater since 2009 - but that was at a time when the market was recovering from a crash. By contrast, all three indices hit record highs last week.
On a day without major economic data or earnings releases, attention is sticking with Capitol Hill, where Fox News reported earlier that the $908 billion stimulus package crafted by a bipartisan group of Senators is likely to get the blessing of Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. 
Turnover was also hit by reported outages at a number of online brokers, including  Robinhood and Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR).
 Among individual movers, Kodak stock rose nearly 70% after a Department of Justice investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing in the extension of a government loan to the company earlier in the fall. Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) ADRs fell 0.2% after news that its subsidiary Universal Music Group had an unspecified amount - believed to be over $100 million - for the rights to the song catalog of Bob Dylan.
Elsewhere,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 2.0% after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is coming under pressure from a newly formed activist investment group that wants it to accelerate its shift away from traditional oil and gas plays toward more renewable forms of energy.  The company, which like the rest of its sector had profited from last week's surge in oil prices, was also suffering from profit-taking in crude futures, which fell 0.9% to $45.86 a barrel.

The paper, reported earlier by CNBC, suggests additional pandemic relief funding for lower-income families to support expenses and bring about financial stability among those who have lost their jobs during the pandemic.
""Existing structural barriers in the U.S., made worse by the current crisis, have created profound racial inequalities — straining families' economic mobility and restricting the U.S. economy,"" the bank said https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/policy-center-synthesis-brief.pdf.
JPMorgan's report comes against the backdrop of a deadlocked Congress over the size of a pandemic relief bill and follows the victory of Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump in a highly contested U.S. presidential election.
Talks aimed at delivering a fresh infusion of coronavirus relief to American families and businesses gathered momentum in the U.S. Congress on Friday, with a bipartisan group of lawmakers working to put the finishing touches on a new $908 billion bill.
Other recommendations in JPMorgan's report include promoting policies for families to build emergency savings, policies and programs that boost income and liquid assets and address the underlying challenges Black and Latino families face within the labor market.

It also suggests expanding affordable housing for underserved communities, helping people with student loans and additional aid to small businesses.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Vaccine airlift delivers shot in the arm for airlines,"By Laurence Frost, Tracy Rucinski and Jamie Freed
PARIS/CHICAGO/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Airlines battered by COVID-19 are prepping for key roles in the mass vaccine rollout that promises to unlock an immediate boost for the sector - and beyond that, its own recovery and survival.
Big challenges await carriers leading the airlift, as well as the drugmakers, logistics firms, governments and international agencies planning the deployment across networks blighted by the pandemic.
The gargantuan effort should nonetheless help airlines involved to trim their crisis losses, experts say, while bringing additional benefits to the broader sector, from supporting cargo pricing and revenue to restoring routes.
Developing vaccines in record time was the easy part, or ""the equivalent of building base camp at Everest"", according to World Health Organization vaccines director Kate O'Brien.
""The delivery of these vaccines, the confidence in communities, the acceptance of vaccines and ensuring that people are in fact immunized with the right number of doses - (this) is what it's going to take to scale the peak,"" she said recently.
Britain is about to become the first country to begin administering the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which requires storage below minus 70 Celsius.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s shot, stored at -20C, is close behind.
In line for major roles are freight specialists and airlines with large cargo arms - such as Germany's Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific - often under contract for forwarders and integrators like UPS, Fedex and DHL.
Gulf carriers Qatar Airways and Emirates as well as Turkish Airlines, all slammed by the long-haul travel collapse, can leverage their vast connecting hubs. Turkish has begun flying China's Sinovac vaccine to Brazil and, like many peers, is increasing its cold chain capacity and storage.
BRIGHT SPOT
While the earnings windfall is ""difficult to quantify"", Cathay commercial chief Ronald Lam told analysts recently, ""there will be a positive impact either directly through vaccine transportation or the surge in overall cargo demand.""
Freight is already a bright spot. Many airlines are making unprecedented cargo profits in 2020 even while chalking up record losses overall.
Before the crisis, half the world's air cargo travelled on some 2,000 freighters, and the rest on passenger jets.
So as lockdowns grounded flights, cargo rates soared, helping carriers keep remaining passenger routes open and avoid more red ink. Cargo's share of revenue will triple to 36% this year as prices or yields rise 30%, airline body IATA projects.
""The profit margins of all the cargo operations will be very strong in 2020 as a result of the extraordinary circumstances, and will be sustained at that level in 2021 as a result of the vaccine distribution,"" HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg said.
Carriers joining the airlift can expect ""a very significant impact on the cargo economics"", he said in a note.
Flying one dose to every human would fill 8,000 747s, IATA estimates. While a minority of vaccine deployments may not need air transport, many require two shots per person.
Some freight operators are already seeing other goods bumped off flights by vaccines, trade newsletter The Loadstar reported https://theloadstar.com/forwarders-see-their-cargo-bumped-as-vaccine-shipments-take-off.
""There's a lot less air capacity in the market,"" United Airlines cargo chief Christopher Busch told Reuters. ""So we need to balance not only what vaccines are coming, but how we continue to move the product that was moving before.""
DISRUPTION RISK
IATA, representing 290 airlines, warns that vaccine rollout could be ""compromised"" without an easing of the travel curbs and quarantines it has lobbied against.
""There are parts of the world that have no cargo operations once the passenger networks are grounded,"" IATA head of cargo Glyn Hughes said.
But UNICEF, whose polio and other immunization campaigns were initially hit by lockdowns, believes lessons have been learned and is now focused on resisting cargo price hikes, as it sources COVID-19 vaccines for 92 poorer countries.
The U.N. children's agency is having an ""early conversation"" with airlines to plan capacity and keep rates down, said transport chief Pablo Panadero, who still sees prices as high as twice pre-crisis levels.
""Of course we as UNICEF are making them aware of the humanitarian and even societal importance of these undertakings - this is getting their own industry back in business,"" he said.
Cargo carriers may face reputational risk if they use the full clout of their current pricing power, observers warn.
""It's not a good look to be seen to be profiteering,"" said Frederic Horst, managing director of Cargo Facts Consulting.
But Horst expects no repeat of the scramble for masks and medical equipment earlier in the pandemic, when ""a lot of government-organised charters were bringing this stuff in, and they were just overpaying.""
This time the airlift will be run by logistics firms who make smarter customers, he said.

""They understand when they're being pulled over the table and will just go to another carrier.""

Paysafe's merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II will result in the London-based company listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""PSFE"".
The appeal of financial technology companies as acquisition targets has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, as more people shop online and make more of their payments digitally.
The deal marks a return to the stock market for Paysafe, which was taken private by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.
Part of the financing for the deal will come from a so-called private investment in public equity (PIPE) worth $2 billion, which would make it one of the largest such instruments ever raised.
Paysafe's current owners Blackstone and CVC will remain the largest investors in the company.

A SPAC raises money in an initial public offering to merge with another company, typically within two years. Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II secured $1.3 billion from investors in August.

COVID-19 has shattered the aero-engine maker's finances because it is paid by airlines on a flying-hours basis. It has raised 2 billion pounds from shareholders, taken on new debt and said it will raise another 2 billion pounds from selling off units.
The company has said it wants to sell its Spain-based ITP Aero business, and analysts have said smaller disposals will make up the remainder of the target. 
Rolls-Royce said in a statement on Monday that it had agreed to sell its I&C business, which has operations in France, the Czech Republic and China and employs 550 staff, to French engineering company Framatome.
""This transaction marks a further simplification of our business and contributes towards our target to generate over 2 billion pounds from disposals,"" said Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East in the statement. 
The I&C business sits in Rolls' power systems division and had revenues of 94 million euros in 2019. 
The British company said none of its staff in the UK would be affected by the sale which, subject to regulatory approval, it expects to complete at the beginning of the second half of 2021.

AbCellera plans to sell 23 million shares priced between $14 and $17 apiece, it said in a regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703057/000119312520311091/d29983ds1a.htm.
There has been a strong demand for new biotechnology stocks, with almost half of the U.S. IPOs in 2020 coming from the healthcare sector, according to data from IPOScoop. 
Reuters reported in September that AbCellera had hired investment banks for a U.S. IPO and could look to raise between $200 million and $300 million.
The company plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ""ABCL"".
AbCellera said last month its revenue rose to $11.6 million in 2019 from $8.8 million, a year earlier. Its net loss for the year was $2.2 million, compared to a profit of $309,000 in 2018.
The company, which also counts Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and healthcare-focused buyout firm OrbiMed Advisors LLC among its investors, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Stifel, Berenberg, SVB Leerink and BMO Capital Market were the lead underwriters for the IPO.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Budget furniture giant IKEA has decided to discontinue its catalogue, one of the world's biggest annual publications, as shoppers move online, it said on Monday. 
The 70-year old publication reached a peak in 2016 when more than 200 million copies were distributed to households and IKEA stores in more than 50 markets. 
Its very first edition, featuring the MK Wing Chair, totalled 285,000 copies and was distributed in southern Sweden, while the last one, from this year, has an edition of 40 million.
The move is part of IKEA's push to become more digital as consumers increasingly seek inspiration online, as well as shopping via the web. In the 12 months to end-August, IKEA's online sales jumped 45%..

""The number of copies has gone down, but we have also seen that people have much more used our website, apps and social media. The catalogue became less and less important,"" said Konrad Gruss, Managing Director at franchisor Inter IKEA Systems - a division of brand owner Inter IKEA Group.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, consolidating after record gains and amid concerns about further lockdowns as Covid-19 cases grow.  
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract fell 101 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.3%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 7 points, or 0.1%. 
All the major indices posted healthy gains at the close Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.8%, or 248 points, higher, its ninth record close of the year. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also closed at record levels, the first all three indices had ended at all-time highs in three years.
Investors have been buoyed by the rapid progress towards the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, but it will take time for normalcy to resume and in the meantime the Covid-19 virus continues to claim victims.
California reported more than 30,000 new cases on Sunday, exceeding the state's previous high, prompting Governor Gavin Newsom to order large parts of the most populous U.S. state to close down.
New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia also announced record one-day rises in new infections, while in a high-profile case President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, tested positive.
The Food and Drug Administration is to vote on emergency-use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Thursday and initial vaccinations could get underway as early as Friday with hopes to reach around 20 million people by year-end.
Adding to the uncertainty Monday were reports that the U.S. is planning to impose sanctions on at least a dozen Chinese officials over their roles in the disqualification of four Hong Kong opposition leaders in November.
However, on a more positive note, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators is expected to put forward legislation early this week for a stimulus package worth just over $900 billion. This proposal seems to be gathering support, with one of the senators involved suggesting on Sunday that President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will come “on board”.
This comes after Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data for November showed just 245,000 jobs were created last month, a sharp slowdown from the 610,000 jobs added in October.
Oil prices weakened Monday on concerns the surge in coronavirus cases, mainly in Europe and the U.S., will result in more lockdowns, hitting demand for the product.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $45.74 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.8% to $48.84. Both benchmarks gained for a fifth consecutive week last week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,834.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2109.

436,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",UK widens access to export loans as post-Brexit transition ends,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government said on Monday it would offer a wider range of loan guarantees to promote exports as part of a drive to boost overseas sales following the country's departure from the European Union, its biggest foreign market.
Lenders will receive a state guarantee for 80% of the money they lend to companies to support exports, up to 25 million pounds ($33 million) per business.
The guarantees will be available to support working capital and other general costs, and will not be tied to specific export contracts, which was usually the case under previous schemes underwritten by export credit body UK Export Finance.y
""The new General Export Facility will make a huge difference for entrepreneurs who need the financial backing to go global and benefit from our free trade agreements,"" junior trade minister Graham (NYSE:GHM) Stuart said.
Firms that exported at least 5% of their production in each of the past three years, or 20% in any single year, will be eligible for the loan guarantees, which will initially be available from HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank, NatWest, Santander (MC:SAN) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
UK Export Finance said it provided 4.4 billion pounds of support for exports in the 2019/20 financial year.
Britain exported goods and services worth a total 691 billion pounds ($917 billion) last year, while imports totalled 721 billion pounds. 
Almost half of goods exported last year went to the EU, and these will face significant extra red tape in the form of customs declarations from Jan. 1 when a post-Brexit transition agreement ends. 
British goods exports will also face new tariffs if last-minute trade negotiations with the EU fail, and services exports are already set to incur new restrictions.
The British government has said Brexit will allow it to strike better trade agreements with non-EU countries than the bloc had been able to strike on Britain's behalf.
The biggest deal agreed so far, with Japan, largely replicates a previous deal reached by the EU.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Brexit and China tensions weigh on shares as pound gets hit,"By Danilo Masoni and Swati Pandey
MILAN/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares and other risk assets fell on Monday as growing risks of a no-deal Brexit that hit the pound hard and fresh Sino-U.S. tensions offset bets over more fiscal and central bank stimulus in Europe and the United States.
After surging to a fresh all-time high earlier on Monday, the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, turned lower to fall 0.3% by 0919 GMT. 
European shares fell 0.6% in early trade following losses in Asia on a Reuters report that Washington was preparing sanctions on Chinese officials over their alleged role in Beijing's disqualification of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slipped 0.5%. 
The main source of angst in Europe was Brexit trade talks which hung in the balance as London and Brussels tried to bridge significant differences in a last-ditch attempt to avoid a disorderly exit by year end.
Other potentially market moving events were also eyed, starting with a EU summit from Thursday to break an impasse over a 1.8 trillion-euro Coronavirus aid package, as well as the last ECB policy meeting of the year on the same day. 
""To say that this week will be a crunch week with lots of high risk events with potentially binary outcomes is an understatement,"" said AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas.
""While the week might be packed with high risk events, markets are so high on central bank liquidity and central bank puts that no one seems to really care,"" he added.
World shares had initially risen on Monday on hopes of a faster global recovery as coronavirus vaccines get rolled out, starting this week in Britain. 
Hopes the vaccines will help curb the pandemic, which has so far killed more than 1.5 million people globally, sent shares soaring in recent weeks. 
On top of that, expectations of a U.S. stimulus aid package gathered pace after weak payrolls data on Friday, following months of deadlocked negotiations.
A bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans proposed a compromise 900 million package that leaders on both sides appear open to agreeing to.
In currencies, the pound was under heavy pressure and risk currencies fell as the lack of progress in Brexit talks dented hopes that UK and EU negotiators will be able to strike a trade deal before a transition period ends later this month. 
Sterling fell 1.2% versus the dollar to $1.3263 and was down around 1.1% versus the euro at 0.9121, while implied sterling volatility gauges for overnight and one-week maturities jumped to over 17% and 14% respectively as traders braced for more swings. 
Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said on Sunday the chances of a deal were 50-50, while bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said odds of a no-trade deal exit had risen to one third from 20%.
""A deal can still be done but with the probabilities near 50:50 it is little wonder that option demand seems biased towards downside strikes,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX Strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will review the situation on Monday evening.
Meantime, the U.S. dollar rose 0.4% to 91.19 against a basket of currencies, after hitting a 2-1/2-year low last week. 
Brexit tensions also lifted European bond prices, sending yields lower. The yield on Germany's 10-year Bund dropped to a one week low of -0.58%, also weighed down by expectations the ECB would announce further stimulus later this week.
In commodities, oil prices slipped from their highest levels since March as a continued surge in coronavirus cases globally forced a series of renewed lockdowns, including strict new measures in Southern California. [O/R]

U.S. crude fell 1.7% to $45.46 per barrel and Brent was down 1.5% to $48.49. Brent has lost about a quarter of its value so far this year.

439,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 05:38AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Brexit Hiccup Awaits Complacent Markets,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- European investors have been pressing the snooze button on their Brexit alarm clocks for four years now. However, they will have to wake up this week, and markets are already showing the first signs that that is happening.
The FTSE 250, the more domestically-focused of the two benchmark U.K. indices, was the biggest loser in western Europe on Monday, falling 0.7% after a steady flow of news over the weekend that talks about the trading relationship between the two sides after the end of the post-Brexit transition agreement on December 31st were close to breaking down.  The U.K. tabloid The Sun reported early on Monday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson could call off further talks ""within hours"", while EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed EU leaders that there were still ""serious divergences"" between the two (over the familiar issues of fishing rights, state aid and dispute resolution mechanisms).
The risk of a disorderly end to the transition is naturally negative for many European companies too, and the Stoxx 600 was down, too, albeit by only 0.4%.
This is not a major sell-off. It comes off the back of an 11% rise for the FTSE250 in the last month and a 7.1% rise for the Stoxx. However, the market has - quite naturally - assumed that it had more important things to worry or get excited about for most of the last four years, and just as naturally assumed that a deal would be struck ahead of time, as too much is riding on the outcome for either side to want to risk a chaotic transition.
That complacency had not, until now, been shaken by last-minute threats and posturing on both sides. Seasoned EU-watchers know that the bloc never takes a decision before it absolutely has to. But that moment - arguably - arrives on Thursday, when EU leaders are due to meet. Should they fail to strike a political agreement, then the chance of completing a legal text that can pass all the remaining ratification processes by year-end is surely gone. 
So far, so predictable. But what has changed in the last few days and weeks? According to U.K. press reports, the ruling Conservative Party has become more relaxed about the economic harm of a no-deal scenario, largely because it will be conflated with the economic harm from the pandemic, the effects of which are much more immediately visible across the country. That has tilted the risk-reward balance more than many appreciate.
On the EU side, little has changed - because, as Berenberg Bank analyst Kallum Pickering points out – not much can change, given that Barnier has little wiggle room within the mandate given him by EU member states. For the EU, the question remains: how much pain is it willing to inflict on Ireland (the country most exposed to Brexit disruptions) to get the deal it wants. Against this backdrop, French President Emmanuel Macron's intervention last week - threatening to veto any agreement that concedes too much - should not be construed as the willingness to tolerate chaos on the Irish border and in the Channel ports forever. Rather, Macron knows that whatever disruptions occur will hit the U.K. economy harder than the EU one. His calculation, shared by many, is that a month of border troubles will put much more pressure on the British to make concessions than it will the rest of Europe.
Either way, a ""no-deal scenario"" is unlikely to last for very long. The dip in sterling, and in U.K. stocks, prefigured in today's options market is more than likely to be a buying opportunity as markets move on - however unevenly - to a new equilibrium.
Or, as Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management said in a morning podcast: ""Do not pay attention to the tantrums of politicians – it only encourages them.""

Neither Kodak nor the DFC immediately responded to requests for comment left outside normal office hours.
Kodak shares surged almost tenfold in July after the Rochester, New York-based firm made a surprise move into the health care world and disclosed the award of a $765 million loan to manufacture Covid-19 drug materials as part of a government program.

(Reuters) - European shares slipped on Monday as rising tension between the United States and China sapped some appetite for risky assets, while a battered pound on growing fears of Brexit without a trade deal buoyed London's blue-chip index.
After adding about 14% over the last five weeks, the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.7% with banks leading losses as euro zone bonds yields fell.
Finance-heavy indexes in Spain and Italy slipped more than 0.8%, while France's CAC 40 fell 1% after scaling a more than nine-month high on Friday. 
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX index lost 0.8% after Reuters exclusively reported that United States was preparing to impose sanctions on at least a dozen Chinese officials over their alleged role in Beijing's disqualification of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.
""U.S.-China relations was the hot topic last year and at the start of this year, so any return to that... is going to weigh on markets as they pull back from some very high levels,"" said Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spreadex.
The news cast a shadow on data that showed German industrial output rose much more than expected in October. Adding to the gloom, the Ifo institute said production expectations for Europe's largest economy have deteriorated for the coming months.
With Britain preparing to roll out the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine this week, London's FTSE 100 rose 0.3% after swinging between losses and gains in early trade. Consumer and healthcare stocks led gains.
The pound took a beating as negotiators struggled to reach consensus on a post-Brexit trade deal. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are due to hold another call on Monday evening in the hope that stubborn differences over fishing rights in UK waters, fair competition and ways to solve future disputes will have narrowed by then.
""If we don't get a signal by the end of today, there are talks that it's sort of a de-facto no-deal Brexit,"" Campbell said.
Failure to secure a deal would clog borders, upset financial markets and disrupt delicate supply chains across Europe and beyond. 
Investors also await the outcome of a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, with more emergency bond buying and cheap liquidity for banks eyed.
Among individual stocks, upbeat trading updates from Games Workshop and Pandora (OTC:PANDY) sent their shares to the top of STOXX 600, while UK homebuilders led declines. 

Oil stocks slipped 1.3%. A continued surge in coronavirus cases globally pressured crude prices as it forced a series of renewed lockdowns.

The third-largest U.S. card firm with 62 million accounts, plus more in Canada and Britain, said it would no longer allow ""transactions identified as point of sale loans charged on its credit cards, regardless of the point of sale lender"".
""These kinds of transactions can be risky for customers and the banks that serve them,"" a spokeswoman said in an email.
The move makes CapOne the first major financial firm to push back against the quick-growing BNPL segment which has seen startups such as Australia's Afterpay Ltd make inroads offering interest-free shopping with no credit history required.
The nascent segment is subject to less regulatory scrutiny relative to its traditional consumer credit counterpart where background financial checks are required. BNPL is exempt from consumer credit law in most countries because it does not involve interest and repayments are typically limited to four.
BNPL companies make money charging merchants commission, whereas credit card providers charge consumers interest.
Australian BNPL companies have seen their share prices soar in 2020 as COVID-19 lockdown measures and government economic stimulus payments for individuals spurred online shopping.
Afterpay set a record A$1 billion ($742.00 million) in U.S. underlying sales in November, over three times the same month a year prior. On Monday, its stock closed at A$96.60 from under A$9.00 in February, making the firm Australia's 16th largest.
Afterpay told Reuters CapOne's decision impacted a ""small percentage of Afterpay customers and many of those have chosen to add a different card in their Afterpay wallet"".
The CapOne spokeswoman said customers who paid for BNPL purchases with debit cards or checking accounts were not affected by the decision to stop credit card BNPL payments.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>",Airbnb streamlines fees as it tilts toward biggest hosts,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Airbnb is requiring most professional hosts outside North America to include all service fees in the rate presented to guests, a move that mirrors how rival platforms operate. 
Airbnb will require hosts who use third-party software to manage bookings to eliminate the “service fee” paid by guests that is traditionally tacked on to the listing price. Instead hosts will pay a standard fee of 15%, up from the typical 3% they are assessed now. 
Hosts interviewed by Reuters said they expect most will raise their listed prices to account for the larger host fee, making the change cost-neutral for most guests and for Airbnb. But hosts with fewer properties expressed some concerns.
The new fee structure comes as the San Francisco-based home rental platform prepares to sell shares in its initial public offering this week. Airbnb said early tests show the simplified pricing helped drive 17% more bookings. 
“Following feedback from hosts we recently introduced a simplified host-only fee structure for professional hosts who connect to our API in certain countries,"" said Airbnb spokesperson Christopher Nulty. ""Our fee structure for individual hosts remains unchanged."" 
But Airbnb declined to comment on some of the negative feedback from hosts about the change, citing a quiet period before its IPO. 
The fee change has been communicated to professional hosts but not reported widely.
Airbnb began with hosts renting out air mattresses in their homes. A former Airbnb host acquisition specialist told Reuters “individual hosts are good for PR.” But hosts managing hundreds or thousands of properties drive an outsized portion of revenue. As of end-September, 10 percent of Airbnb’s hosts were professional managers, and they accounted for 28 percent of nights booked, according to Airbnb’s IPO filings.
Management software platform Uplisting’s CEO Vincent Breslin said hotels and professional managers of multiple properties have asked for the change to make it easier to list across different platforms with one sticker price.
“Having fee parity across all platforms is a benefit to all,” said Ryan Danz, CEO of Air Concierge Inc., which manages about 500 properties. “It makes a better apples-to-apples comparison for the traveler if they find the same home listed on various websites.”
But some smaller property managers are worried the change could hurt them if they can’t raise prices enough to cover the increased host fee.
Airbnb already gave itself a black eye with many hosts when it made them issue refunds for cancellations caused by the global pandemic. It now faces a class action suit and hundreds of arbitration cases stemming from that.
Johnny Buckingham, who manages nine listings on Airbnb across the U.S., said he would not want to raise his listing price to cover the increased host fee and believed Airbnb was discouraging hosts from using software to cross-list on other platforms.
“They’ve made their message clear. Stick exclusively with us or pay us 5x as much,” he said.
Sarah DuPre, sales director at AirDNA, an analytics firm specializing in vacation rentals, said that the will have a minimal impact on host retention but could impact Airbnb’s “ability to be seen as the most economical source of accommodation.""

Rowan Clifford, who helps Airbnb hosts improve visibility of their listings and is also a host, predicted in a blog post two years ago that host fees would go up as hosts become reliant on Airbnb. He expects individual hosts will eventually also see a fee hike and said smaller hosts could face price competition from professionally managed listings that don't raise prices to cover the increased host fee. “They don’t need us as much anymore, basically.”

444,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: Christmas and Brexit double bill put strain on UK supermarkets,"By James Davey
LONDON(Reuters) - For Britain's supermarket groups Christmas 2020 will be like no other, with the challenge of unprecedented demand due to the COVID-19 crisis followed by the risk of disruption to supplies at the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31. 
Queues are already forming outside UK supermarkets at peak times and shoppers should expect them to lengthen in the run-up to Christmas as the big four players - market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - and their smaller rivals wrestle with meeting a jump in demand whilst adhering to social distancing requirements. 
Then, from January, shoppers face the prospect of gaps on shelves if supply lines from the European Union are disrupted. 
Market researcher Nielsen forecasts UK shoppers will spend 2 billion pounds more in supermarkets in the quarter to Dec. 26 than in the same period last year, or a total of 33 billion pounds. Some analysts believe that could prove a conservative estimate.
While a forecast increase in demand is not unique to Britain - in the U.S., for example, researcher IRI expects a near one fifth jump in quarterly food and beverage spending - the added dimension of Brexit adds to the operational difficulties UK supermarket groups are facing.
In Britain, demand beyond the normal seasonal pick-up is being driven by a large chunk of the population still working from home and tight restrictions on cafe, pub and restaurant openings in many parts of the country.
Supermarkets also have more mouths to feed -- with many of the five million or so Britons who normally travel abroad for Christmas staying in the UK, and the early return of university students to the family home.
Britons are also keen to indulge over Christmas after such a miserable year. 
""Frankly people have had enough (of COVID) and I thinkthey're going to have a big blow out,"" said Shore Capitalanalyst Clive Black.
RECORD DEMAND 
Sainsbury's said on Thursday its sales since early November had exceeded expectations.
""That's why we're working really hard to make sure that wecan expand the capacity in the supermarkets, that's why we'reasking customers to shop on their own...to make sure we can get more into the store,"" said Simon Roberts, CEO of Britain's second largest grocer.
Roberts, like Tesco CEO Ken Murphy, is tackling his firstChristmas in the top job. 
Supermarkets are asking customers to shop forseasonal products early to spread volume out, encouragingthem to use handheld devices that bypass checkouts and extending trading hours. They are also lobbying government to relax strict Sunday trading laws and allow all-night deliveries.
Another industry executive observed that when queuing Britons snaked around supermarket car parks at the outset of the pandemic in March the sun was shining and a wartime ""Dunkirk spirit"" prevailed. 
""When it's pouring down that will go less well,"" he said. 
To try and keep spirits up in the December cold, Asda and Sainsbury's are trialling virtual queuing apps where customers can wait in their cars until there is room for them in store, while Morrisons and Asda have constructed canopies to protect waiting shoppers from the rain, with the latter also making 25,000 umbrellas available.
Online home deliveries have been ramped up and click & collect capacity expanded. 
Market researcher Kantar reckons online now accounts for about 13% of all UK grocery spending versus 7% before the pandemic. But that means more than 85% of the market still needs to be served by stores.
DISRUPTION
With nearly one third of Britain's food coming from the EU, grocers fear significant disruption to their ""just in time"" supply chains when the Brexit transition period ends shortly after the Christmas rush.
Delays of even a few days as post-Brexit customs checks come into force at ports could make fresh produce unsaleable and lead to shortages of some products.
Supermarket groups have stockpiled where they can but warehouse space is scarce with most required to service Christmas. And although they will seek to build stocks further once Christmas is over, fresh produce such as salad and fruit simply can't be kept for long periods.
Grocers will seek to utilise alternative routes to the main Dover-Calais crossing but options are limited. 

""The reality is that we're leaving Europe, so whetherthere's a trade deal or not there's going to be a level offriction at borders that there historically wasn't,"" saidanother industry director.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Monday, weighed by increased Brexit uncertainty and more coronavirus-inspired lockdowns ahead of key central bank meetings.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.3%. 
The uncertainty surrounding Britain’s trading relationship with the EU in the new year is weighing on equity markets Monday, amid reports British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to pull out of talks within hours.
Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyden are scheduled to hold a call on Monday evening after negotiators were unable to solve differences over fishing rights, fair competition and ways to solve future disputes over the weekend.
Both the European and U.K. parliaments still need to ratify any accord, so time is running short for a deal to be implemented in time.
Also weighing, the southern German region of Bavaria announced on Sunday that it will impose a tougher lockdown from Wednesday until early January, meaning people will only be able to leave their homes if they have a good reason.
Germany's problems with the second wave of Covid-19 has undoubtedly contributed towards production expectations deteriorating for the coming months. Germany's Ifo institute said its index for production prospects dropped to 5.5 points in November from 16.3 points in October.
German industrial production rose 3.2% on the month in October, more than expected, but this could be a high point over the near term. 
The European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve are both due to release policy decisions later in the week. The ECB is widely expected to increase its bond-buying program to aid the region’s economic recovery. Expectations of a U.S. stimulus package are also gathering pace after weak payrolls data last week, following months of deadlocked negotiations.
In corporate news, Italian fashion group Moncler (MI:MONC) stock rose 1.3% to a new all-time high after announcing the acquisition of smaller rival Stone Island for 1.15 billion euros ($1.4 billion)
In the U.K., retail group Frasers (LON:FRAS) stock fell 2.3% after it confirmed it was in rescue talks for Debenhams' U.K. operations. Countrywide (LON:CWD) stock soared over 18% after rival Connells increased its offer for the U.K. property group by 30% to 325 pence per share.
Oil prices weakened Monday on concerns the surge in coronavirus cases, mainly in Europe and the U.S., will result in more lockdowns, hitting demand for the product.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $45.61 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.2% to $48.65. Both benchmarks gained for a fifth consecutive week last week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,831.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2104.

Younan, 58, came to the region in 2006 and oversaw the expansion of Wall Street bank's presence and franchise in MENA with offices in Dubai, Doha and Riyadh. 
Goldman has advised some of the top deals in the region such as  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s $29.4 billion initial public offering last year. It also advised Saudi Arabia's Riyad Bank on a potential merger with National Commercial Bank, but the plan to combine was abandoned at the end of last year. 
Goldman named Fadi Abuali and Zaid Khaldi as co-chief executive officers of the U.S. bank for the MENA region, effective Jan. 1, a separate memo said.
Saudi Arabia has become the biggest market for bankers, who are keen to grab a slice of its active equities market this years as companies tap into Saudi demand for shares.

The kingdom is encouraging more companies to list in a bid to deepen its capital markets under reforms aimed at reducing its reliance on oil.

Tensions between the U.S. and China rose over the news that the U.S. is reportedly planning to impose sanctions on at least a dozen Chinese officials over their roles in the disqualification of four Hong Kong opposition leaders in November, which triggered a mass resignation of opposition lawmakers soon after.
Meanwhile, Chinese trade data for November, including exports, imports and the trade balance, is due to be released later in the day.

Should the FDA grant emergency use during Thursday’s meeting, distribution of the vaccine could begin within 24 hours of the decision, Health & Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A blank-check acquisition firm backed by veteran investor Bill Foley is nearing a deal to merge with Paysafe, valuing the payments company at around $9 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Paysafe's merger with Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II will result in the London-based company listing in New York, according to the sources.
Paysafe's current owners, private equity firms Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc and CVC Capital Partners, will retain a significant interest in the company following the merger, the sources said. The deal could be announced by Monday, the sources added.
Part of the financing for the deal will come in the form of a so-called private investment in public equity (PIPE) worth $2 billion, which would make it one of the largest such instruments ever raised, according to the sources.
The sources requested anonymity ahead of an official announcement. Paysafe, Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II and the private equity firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with another company, typically within two years.
The SPAC secured $1.3 billion from investors in August.
The SPAC model has become an increasingly popular route to the public markets this year over a traditional IPO, including for other payments firms such as Paya and Billtrust.
The appeal of financial technology companies as acquisition targets has increased during the pandemic, as more people shop online and make more of their payments digitally.
The deal marks a return to the stock market for Paysafe, which was taken private by Blackstone and CVC in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.

Sweden-based Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said it had included data on Chinese companies for the first time in its annual ranking of the world’s 25 largest arms manufacturing companies.
The four Chinese companies on the list were Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO) and China South Industries Group Corporation (CSGC), which SIPRI said ranked 6th, 8th, 9th and 24th, respectively.
""Chinese arms companies are benefiting from military modernisation programmes for the People’s Liberation Army,"" SIPRI Senior Researcher Nan Tian said in a statement accompanying the report.
China is considered more of a potential threat militarily than in the past by many western countries. A report on reforming NATO said last week the Atlantic alliance must think harder about how to handle China and its military rise.
SIPRI said on Monday that overall arms sales by the 25 companies in its ranking rose by 8.5% in 2019 to $361 billion. The top five companies were all from the United States --  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), with combined arms sales of $166 billion.
The think-tank has previously not included Chinese companies in its ranking due to what it has said was a lack of reliable data.

Goldman executives have been scouting office locations in South Florida, speaking with local officials and exploring tax advantages as they consider creating a base there, Bloomberg said, citing the people.
The members of the leadership team have been persuaded by the bank's success in operating remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic to move more roles out of the New York area to save money, according to Bloomberg.
The bank may yet decide not to center its asset management business in Florida and may opt for a different destination like Dallas, where it has been accelerating its expansion, Bloomberg added https://bloom.bg/2IiYUzy.

Goldman did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, but a spokesman for the bank told Bloomberg that the bank was executing on its strategy of locating more jobs in high-value locations throughout the U.S., with no specific plans to announce at this time.

Founded in Berlin by Gentz and Schneider in 2008, Zalando has quickly grown to become Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer, serving 35 million active customers in 17 countries.
Ritter, responsible for strategy and communications on the management team, said in a statement that he wanted to devote time to his growing family and allow his wife's professional ambitions to take priority in the coming years.
""In my remaining months I will ensure that we continue to rapidly advance the execution of our strategy,” he said.
Ritter's contract had been due to run until November 2023. Zalando said he would step down at the next annual general meeting, which usually takes place in May.
Zalando chairman Cristina Stenbeck said while the supervisory board regretted Ritter's decision, it respected his motivation and appreciated his transparency that gave the company enough time to organise the management transition.
Ritter became co-CEO in 2010 alongside Gentz and Schneider, but was also finance chief until David Schroeder was given that role last year.

In an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera daily, Padoan denied Mustier's exit facilitates a merger with MPS, after speculation about a deal hurt UniCredit shares last week. 
""MPS played no part in Mustier's decision to leave UniCredit at the end of his current term. Moreover, his decision does not change in any way the bank's position towards any such operation,"" Padoan said.
Mustier resigned last Monday citing a clash with the board over strategy. UniCredit had been in talks with the Treasury over MPS, which Rome is trying to re-privatise, sources had said. 
Mustier had prioritised returning cash to shareholders over mergers and had worked since his arrival in mid-2016 to reduce Italy's exposure to its fragile home turf.
In an attempt to reassure investors, UniCredit's board said the capital return strategy was unchanged and ruled out deals that harmed the bank's capital position.
Padoan said Mustier's decision was due to ""different opinions"" over ""the steps to take for the integration strategy outside of Italy. The strategy, on which we agree, is not in question. Different views emerged on how to take it forward"".
Padoan, who was named in October as incoming chairman, denied a report saying he had challenged Mustier's international focus advocating instead expansion in Italy.
A former Italian economy minister who oversaw the MPS bailout and a Member of Parliament for the ruling PD party at the time of his appointment, Padoan also sought to dispel concerns about political meddling.
""Political interference, real or alleged, can only be harmful ... But in UniCredit's decisions political interference has played no role.""

Padoan, who is leading the board's search for Mustier's replacement, said the new CEO needed to have ""a high international standing, a strong knowledge of the banking system, inclusive leadership and strategic vision"".

The airline and its subsidiaries, Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian and Brussels Airlines, have slashed their schedules, fleet and staff, with air travel not expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels before 2025.
Citing unnamed company sources, the Bild am Sonntag newspaper said that Lufthansa would cut 20,000 jobs outside of Germany, while it is also selling its catering unit LSG, which employs 7,500 people, bringing the total staff down to 109,000.
Next year, a further 10,000 jobs will be cut in Germany. It has already burned through 3 billion euros ($3.64 billion) of the 9-billion-euro government bailout it secured earlier in the year, the paper said.
Lufthansa has 27,000 too many full-time equivalent staff, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said last month, even as the airline promised unions not to make forced redundancies in return for cuts to bonuses and other payments.
A deal to cut costs and save jobs at Lufthansa has won the support of a majority of the Verdi trade union members who work for the German airline as ground staff, according to the results of a ballot seen by Reuters on Friday.
A formal announcement is expected on Monday.
The deal with Verdi followed months of on-off talks, during which the union accused management of seeking to cut jobs even after taking a bailout to keep its planes flying.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kia Motors Corp said on Saturday it is recalling 295,000 U.S. vehicles for engine fire risks.
The Korean automaker said the recall covers some 2012-2013 model year Sorento, 2012-2015 Forte and Forte Koup, 2011-2013 Optima Hybrid, 2014-2015 Soul, and 2012 Sportage vehicles because an engine compartment fire can occur while driving.
Dealers will inspect the engine compartment for fuel or oil leaks, perform an engine test and make any repairs including engine replacement, as necessary. Kia said it is currently developing a Knock Sensor Detection System software update.
Last week, Kia and affiliate Hyundai Motor Co agreed to a record $210 million civil penalty after U.S. auto safety regulators said they failed to recall 1.6 million vehicles for engine issues in a timely fashion.
The Korean automakers agreed to consent orders after the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the automakers inaccurately reported some information to the agency regarding the recalls.
Kia’s civil penalty totaled $70 million, including an upfront payment of $27 million, requirements to spend $16 million on specified safety measures, and a potential $27 million deferred penalty.
The settlement covers recalls in 2015 and 2017 for manufacturing issues that could lead to bearing wear and engine failure.
In the new Kia engine recall, NHTSA opened an investigation in 2019 into non-crash fires in Kia and Hyundai vehicles. The agency in July recommended Kia conduct recalls on certain models with a higher fire complaint rate, the automaker said.
Kia said ""based on NHTSA’s recommendation"" it had made the ""decision to recall certain Kia vehicles as a preventative measure to mitigate any potential fire risk."" 

Hyundai on Friday recalled 129,000 U.S. vehicles because connecting rod bearings may wear prematurely, which over time can result in engine damage and increase fire risks.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast will lift a suspension imposed this week on cocoa sustainability schemes run by Hershey after the U.S.-based chocolate maker committed to paying a premium aimed at combating poverty among farmers.
Ivorian and Ghanaian cocoa regulators on Monday suspended the schemes, alleging Hershey was sourcing large volumes of physical cocoa on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) futures exchange to avoid paying the so-called living income differential (LID).
Hershey, makers of such popular candy items as Hershey chocolate bars, Hershey's Kisses and Kit Kat, said it was fully participating in the LID and would continue to do so.
Ivorian regulator, the Coffee and Cocoa council (CCC), has since held a video meeting with Hershey representatives in which it promised to lift the suspension, a letter dated Dec. 4 from the CCC to Hershey and seen by Reuters shows.
The move ""follows your definitive commitment to pay the LID"", the letter, whose authenticity was verified by a CCC spokesperson, said.
""Our sustainability programs complement and strengthen our shared efforts to positively impact cocoa-growing communities,"" Hershey said, adding it recognised the importance of the LID.
The schemes certify cocoa as sustainably sourced - meaning its production is free of environmental and human rights abuses, such as using child labour or being grown in a protected forest.
This allows companies to market their chocolate as ethical and charge a premium for it. 
Ghana's cocoa industry regulator, Cocobod, has not yet taken a decision on whether to lift the suspension, a spokesman said.

Ivory Coast and Ghana, which produce two-thirds of the world's cocoa, introduced a $400 a tonne LID on cocoa sales for the 2020/21 season, but have since struggled to sell their beans as chocolate demand has been hit by the coronavirus crisis.

""This (BE-7) is the engine that will take the first woman to the surface of the Moon,"" Bezos said in a post on Instagram with a video of the engine test this week at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.
The BE-7 engine, which Blue Origin has been developing for years, has tallied 1,245 seconds of test-fire time and will power the company's National Team Human Landing System lunar lander.
Blue Origin leads a ""national team"" as the prime contractor that it assembled in 2019 to help build its Blue Moon lander. That team includes  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT),  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and Draper.
Blue Origin has vied for lucrative government contracts in recent years and is competing with rival billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX and Dynetics, owned by  Leidos Holdings  (NYSE:LDOS) Inc, to win a contract to build NASA's next human lunar landing system to ferry humans to the moon in the next decade.
In April, NASA awarded a lunar lander development contract to Blue Origin's team worth $579 million, as well as two other companies: SpaceX which received $135 million to help develop its Starship system and Leidos-owned Dynetics which won $253 million.
NASA is poised to pick two of the three companies ""in early March"" 2021 to continue building their lander prototypes for crewed missions to the moon beginning in 2024, an agency spokeswoman has said.

But slim funds for the landing systems made available to NASA by Congress, as well as uncertainty over the incoming Biden administration's views on space exploration, have threatened to delay NASA's decision to advance the lunar lander contracts.

Women comprise 17% of the company's U.S. leadership roles - directors and vice presidents - and 21% of the overall workforce, according to the report. The figures for Asian, Black and Hispanic people combined are 33% and 60%.
The carmaker noted, though, that leadership roles were a ""very small cohort"", or less than 0.4%, of its workforce.
Elon Musk's Tesla, whose meteoric rise has seen it become the most valuable auto company in the world and worth about $550 billion, acknowledged the lack of representation.
""We know that our numbers do not represent the deep talent pools of Black and African American talent that exist in the U.S at every level – from high-school graduates to professionals,"" it said in the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Impact Report https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2020-DEI-impact-report.pdf 2020 published on Friday. 
""While women are historically underrepresented in the tech and automotive industries, we recognize we have work to do in this area,"" it added.
Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, said it planned to increase representation of all under-represented groups next year and would be recruiting at historically Black colleges and universities.
Nasdaq Inc filed a proposal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday that, if approved, would require all Nasdaq-listed companies to adopt new rules related to board diversity.

The rules would require most of the companies to have, or publicly explain why they do not have, at least two diverse directors, including one who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+.

Investing.com -- Its delivery delays are so long, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) skipped Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Would-be customers are fed up with months-long waits to get their bikes and are turning to rivals, including the very new MYXfitness. Not even a year into the market, the company is already reporting growth that was expected three years out.
Demand for the Greenwich, Conn.-based company's equipment, which debuted at the consumer technology trade show CES in January, saw a surge in the spring following stay-at-home mandates to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. While they had some delays in delivery, MYXfitness guaranteed Christmas delivery up through the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Current lag times range between three and five weeks. Peloton says on its website some deliveries will take in excess of 10 weeks.
""We thought this would mature over the next several years,"" said MYXfitness President Herbie Calves in a video interview. But sales have taken them by surprise, and continue increasing as Peloton fails to deliver and the holiday season is upon us. ""Home fitness is probably one of the hottest categories for giving this year.""
With gyms closed and Americans forced to reinvent home life as work life, gym life and everything else, at-home fitness has been one of the beneficiaries of the Covid-19 virus. Peloton reported sales of $757.9 million for the third quarter, up more than 200% from a year earlier. Its shares have risen almost 300% from the start of the year.
MYXfitness was funded by a venture capital group out of Greenwich to bring connected fitness to a ""broader group of consumers,"" Calves said. That is defined as those who work out for life, not to win, ie, everyday people who are harried and busy with life, parenting, work, etc. Calves compared it to those who go to Soul Cycle and those who go to Orange Theory.
""We built everything around that with that consumer in mind,"" said Calves, who refers to the product as a home gym solution. And while price is a factor, it's not the only one.
""They don't want to compromise on quality, and they have a certain price sensitivity,"" Calves said.
MYXfitness charges $1,299 for its standard package, and membership for classes is $29 a month. Peloton charges $1,895 and a monthly fee of $39 for classes. 
Despite the high costs overall, for the fiscal 2021 first quarter, Peloton reported subscription growth of 137% to more than 1.3 million, with total members growing to over 3.6 million.
Still, MYXfitness isn't the only rival in town, and it doesn't have the brand recognition of some of its competitors, including NordicTrack, Bowflex and Pro-Form.With so much demand, though, MYXfitness may help fill the need. And Calves believes the change is real, with vaccines doing little to disrupt the new dynamic of the home gym. 
""This change was happening in the category anyway,"" he said. For 2021, ""we see this acceleration of a category, not a one time, one shot thing.""

469,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",Home Goods Sales Triple With Nary an Item Sold Online,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Sales jumped 200% in the third quarter for home goods retailer Betterware De Mexico SA de CV (NASDAQ:BWMX). With the company poised to start online sales next week, the numbers are likely to keep on keeping on.
The only Mexican company directly listed on the Nasdaq, Betterware de Mexico is a direct-to-consumer retailer (think, catalogues and local associates hawking their wares), and the jump online won't change that. It will bring the brand to consumers who haven't yet used it, but always through a local representative who not only takes care of the last-mile delivery, thereby keeping costs down for the company, but who also accepts cash. 
Betterware de Mexico has plenty of online competition -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Mercado Libre, to name two -- but ""accepting cash is necessary to achieve ecommerce success,"" according to a Practical eCommerce report in June. While buyers can pay for online goods via convenience stores by printing a page with a barcode and paying in cash, representatives of the home goods company take cash in hand. 
That positions Betterware de Mexico to win over a large swath of the population, and the company is, accordingly, preparing for major expansion.
""We have a lot of opportunity to grow in the future,"" said Chief Executive Officer Andres Campos in a phone interview alongside his father, Chairman Luis Campos. 
The company has bumped its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the full year to a range of 1.900 million pesos ($95.6 million) and 2.100 million pesos, up from its previous guidance of 1.45 million pesos. It expects its Ebitda margin to be between 26.2% and 28.9%.
Betterware de Mexico went public in March through a reverse merger with special purpose acquisition company  DD3 Acquisition Corp  . The company sells everything from chip clips and toilet paper stands to lingerie wash bags and purse lights. Betterware de Mexico currently serves more than 3 million Mexican households, and is already profitable in Guatemala, where it began a pilot project this year.
""Today we only have a 20% market penetration in Mexico,"" said Andres Campos. ""We still have a lot of room to grow.""
New Markets in Sight
With Guatemala proving to be a win, the company expects to move into Peru and Colombia in the next few years. More immediately, however, is the launch next week of a web marketing platform that should attract a whole new swath of Mexicans who maybe haven't ever ordered from a catalogue or met a company representative.
""This model is even stronger than standard ecommerce,"" Andres said. Orders are delivered through representatives, who take care of the last delivery mile without any cost to Betterware, a competitive advantage against rivals. Perhaps more importantly, ""we're able to collect cash on delivery. Traditional ecommerce models cannot do that in Mexico."" 
More than a third of the population has no bank account, meaning cash remains king, Practical eCommerce reported. Internet use is also not as widespread as in other countries.
In 2019, about 56% of homes had access to the web, but for those without it, most said they couldn't afford it. Still, ecommerce revenue should grow at a compound annual rate of 6.5% over the next four years for a total of $21.8 billion in 2024, according to Practical eCommerce. 
Betterware, which makes its own items largely in factories in China, introduces about 300 new products each year, and it aims to delve into new categories, though the executives declined to give further details. It is another vector of growth for the ambitious group.
Not that it is without competition. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) de Mexico,  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Tupperware (NYSE:TUP) are among Betterware de Mexico's biggest rivals, but the executives point to their specializing in the home as one of their differentials. 
""We are very close to our consumers,"" Andres Campos said. ""We invest a lot in understanding the consumer and understanding the house,"" coming up with the exact products we know that our markets need.  
""We are prepared to continue to grow,"" he said.

470,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2020 07:42AM ET</span>","Airbnb's IPO is Finally Happening, But Will its Stock be a Winning Investment?","By Yasin Ebrahim and Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Airbnb, the home-sharing company that shook up the hospitality industry, is preparing for its public debut.
An initial public offering expected to value it at more than $30 billion is finally set to launch on Wednesday, with Airbnb listing on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ABNB.
It is just one of several big IPOs this year despite the volatility created by the pandemic. Airbnb is a popular brand and has given big hotel companies a run for their money, but regulatory and competitive risks are not to be ignored.
Investing.com's Yasin Ebrahim argues why Airbnb is a winning investment, while Liz Moyer says there are plenty of reasons for caution.
The Bull Case
Airbnb may be new to the public market, but privately it has been building up a track record that has competitors like  Expedia  and Bookings looking over their shoulder.
In 2019, Airbnb's gross bookings of $38 billion were 35% that of Expedia Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) and 39% of Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG)'s, but that gap has narrowed dramatically to 62% and 64%, respectively, in the year to date so far.
Some doubt whether this catch-up – driven by a pandemic-led surge in demand for social-distancing friendly alternatives to staying at hotels – can continue as the world begins to emerge from the pandemic, but the company has a knack for ensuring guests return.
""69% of our revenue in 2019 was generated from stays in that year by repeat guests, defined as guests with at least one prior booking, up from 66% in 2018 and 62% in 2017,"" the company said in its S-1 filed earlier this week.  ""We believe the guest revenue retention of our community is higher than the customer retention of OTA distribution platforms in the United States, based on available third-party credit card data.""
Much of the sticky attraction that Airbnb enjoys among travelers comes from the power of its brand. Unlike its competitors, who turn to crowded marketplaces like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) to generate traffic, Airbnb doesn't have to suckle on the teat of advertisers to succeed: Its brand loyalty does the heavy lifting of marketing, generating a ton of direct traffic.
In 2019, Airbnb generated 23% of traffic from paid performance marketing channels, with the remainder from direct or from organic search results. While Booking Holdings has said about half of its customers come direct.  
Generating unpaid online traffic is the holy grail for all travel businesses, but when Airbnb does put its foot on the marketing pedal, it's marketing dollars go further, wider and deeper.
Every dollar Airbnb spent on brand and performance marketing in 2019, yielded $33 in gross bookings; at Expedia it was $21, and at Booking $19.
This competitive advantage should stand the company in good stead in the coming quarters, which by the company's own admission will be fraught with difficulty amid a surge in Covid-19 infections.
Boasting a story that is easily understood by investors and the star power that generates repeat business from customers, Airbnb is one the few IPOs that makes the top of the list of fashionable investing.
The Bear Case
Airbnb is going for a $30 billion valuation, which would make it nearly as big as world-leader Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR)t’s $43 billion market value and about the same as  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (NYSE:HLT). Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H), meanwhile, has a market cap of just $7 billion.
It gets bravery points for attempting an IPO in an environment hostile to hospitality companies. Revenue through September this year is down 32% from the same period last year after a horrible first and second quarter saw bookings dry up. Airbnb cut 25% of its workforce and slashed salaries and marketing budgets. 
And it reoriented its home rental business to appeal to people who wanted a change of scenery -- a quick getaway during pandemic times, not too far from home but just enough to make the prolonged period working and studying from home bearable.
Longer-term, Airbnb has something going for it that gets at the heart of the Millennial generation: The desire to experience a new place like a local, not just a tourist. 
Guess what will happen once a vaccine makes widespread travel likely, again? People are going to want to stay in places where other people pick up after them and cook for them, and that isn’t Airbnb.
That could be a long way off, still. In its registration filing, Airbnb acknowledges the giant hurdle the tourism, travel and hospitality sectors face in overcoming Covid-19. “Our future revenue growth depends on the growth of supply and demand for listings on our platform, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide as well as trends in the global travel and hospitality industries,” it says.
In addition, there is significant regulatory risk to Airbnb. While the company has made renting out someone else’s house seem normal, it faces legal challenges from the hotel industry as well as local governments seeking to more tightly regulate the sharing economy. Big cities in tourist-magnate Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, have recently embraced curbs on short-term vacation rentals, for example. A group of 22 mayors from cities throughout Europe have been talking to the European Commission about the regulation of short-term rentals.
Finally, it comes down to competition. When Airbnb started shaking up the hotel industry, hotels were forced to respond, which they did in a big way with more limited-service, low cost and boutique experience properties. 
Airbnb may well be one of 2020’s biggest IPOs, but its lasting role in the hospitality industry is still too early to tell.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: After blazing energy rally, investors check the fuel gauge","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are gauging how far a rally in beaten-down energy shares could run, as an expected recovery for the coronavirus-hit economy clashes with skepticism about the long-term prospects of fossil fuels.
Energy shares overall soared nearly 27% in November, leading the charge among sectors expected to benefit from the broad economic revival promised by encouraging developments for several vaccines against COVID-19.
The longer term outlook for the sector, however, remains uncertain, as companies throughout the oil and gas supply chain face challenges from the increasing use of ""green"" energy sources such as wind and solar. Another concern is resistance among fund managers to investing in fossil fuel companies over environmental concerns.
""It's always hard to be extremely bullish on a sector that is likely in secular decline, and the traditional fossil fuel sector is very likely in secular decline,"" said Doug Cohen, a portfolio manager at Fiduciary Trust International.
Coronavirus-related developments will continue to draw investor attention next week, as a U.S. health advisory panel meets Thursday to discuss whether to recommend emergency use authorization of a vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX).
The energy sector remains down 37% this year, even as a 13.5% rise has sent the S&P 500 to fresh records. Declining oil prices have seen energy stocks underperform the broad market since the Great Recession, and the market value of energy companies has shrunk to 2.4% of the S&P 500, down from over 15% in 2008, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
November rattled that trend, as the release of positive data from three separate coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc sparked massive rallies in the shares of companies across the sector.
Shares of oil majors  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) rose 17% and 25%, respectively, while Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) soared over 72% and  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN) surged nearly 57%.
""The notion of a vaccine being sometime around the corner gives some hope that oil demand may recover,"" said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research, adding that energy shares will stay sensitive to news about vaccines or coronavirus cases in the near-term.
(Graphic: US energy shares vs broad stock market https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdadzwpo/Pasted%20image%201607008357633.png)
Hopes of an economic rebound have drawn plenty of attention to the battered sector. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in November all upgraded their ratings on the energy sector to market-weight or neutral.
The sector is ""the poster child for deep value,"" Savita Subramanian, BofA Global Research's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, said during the firm's 2021 outlook event. The firm last month lifted its rating on the sector from underweight to overweight.
The relatively high dividends of many energy stocks also could draw investors, said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. Exxon's dividend yield is 9%, Chevron's is about 6% compared to a 2% yield for the overall S&P 500.
Still, many are worried that energy stocks could weigh on portfolio performance in the years ahead.
BMO Capital Markets rated the energy sector as underweight in its 2021 outlook, saying that forecasts for oil consumption in 2021 are ""subdued,"" with demand likely to drop below levels in 2018 and 2019.
Longer-term trends are also pointing away from fossil fuels.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects renewable energy sources to amount to about 45% of U.S. power generation by 2035, more than double their current level.
So-called ""sustainable"" funds using environmental or social criteria to pick stocks continued to draw money at a record pace in the United States during the third quarter, taking in nearly $10 billion of net new deposits, according to Morningstar.
Cabot (NYSE:CBT) Wealth Management, an investment advisor which manages $900 million, is staying away from oil and gas companies, said Chief Investment Officer Rob Lutts.
Instead, the firm owns shares of companies it believes will benefit from a push to alternative energy, such as solar firms and generator maker  Generac Holdings  (NYSE:GNRC) Inc.

""I am a big picture guy, and the big picture is not good for fossil fuel,"" Lutts said.

""The pandemic is certainly a factor that will be taken into account when determining the variable compensation,"" Rohner told the newspaper.
""Bonuses should reflect performance, and here the pandemic is a factor that plays a role,"" he said. ""It is obvious that after such a year you will not see record bonuses."" 
The chairman, who is leaving Switzerland's second biggest bank next year after a 12-year term on the board, said the company would have to wait for the 2020 business results before making final decisions. 
Rohner will be replaced by outgoing Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank Chief Executive António Horta-Osório. 
He declined to comment directly on the rumoured merger talks between Credit Suisse and cross-town rival UBS.
Both Rohner and UBS Chairman Axel Weber were reported to support a deal, but talks dropped off after the summer.
""I am not saying that the idea is absurd, quite the opposite,"" Rohner said in the interview. ""Every chairman, if he understands his role correctly, will think through such a constellation as well as other scenarios from time to time.
""I have done so several times,"" he said, although mergers between big banks tended to be very complex and had to deal with regulatory, cultural and timing issues.

""Such factors determine whether a merged company is successful or not,"" Rohner said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) said on Thursday it would buy U.S. wealth manager  Waddell & Reed  (NYSE:WDR) Financial Inc for $1.7 billion, its first major deal under a new CEO that expands its presence in the world's largest retail finance market.
The purchase, one of the biggest finance industry buyouts by an Australian entity, puts Macquarie in the top 25 U.S. fund managers, it said, and reinforces a core business of a company that has diversified into running M&A deals, owning infrastructure, trading commodities and selling home loans.
CEO Shemara Wikramanayake, who started in the role two years ago after running the division responsible for Thursday's purchase, had previously said she wanted to make large acquisitions. The choice of Waddell & Reed, a 70-year-old Kansas firm with 922 advisers, shows Wikramanayake keeping a global focus without reinventing the company's business profile.
""We see the deal as financially compelling,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts in a client note. ""This signals (Macquarie) is ready to deploy excess capital.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said ""the potential scale benefits make sense"" and suggested Macquarie would target a similar opportunity in Europe for its next purchase with A$8.5 billion in surplus capital.
Shares of Waddell & Reed soared 47% in extended trading, in line with the premium Macquarie offered to its last closing price, while Macquarie shares were flat against a slightly higher Australian market.
As part of the deal, Macquarie will sell Waddell & Reed's (NASDAQ:REED) wealth management platform to U.S. investment adviser LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) Holdings Inc for $300 million, and then begin a partnership with the firm.
Waddell & Reed had in recent years become a ""diversified and growth-oriented financial services enterprise (and) the long-term partnership between Macquarie and LPL as part of this transaction accelerates that transformation"", the target company's CEO Philip J. Sanders said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - JD (NASDAQ:JD) Logistics has asked banks to pitch for the lead role in its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) of up to $3 billion as it moves towards launching the deal in the first half of 2021, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The logistics business, the offshoot of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc, would be the latest subsidiary of the parent company to be spun off and listed in Hong Kong.
The IPO could raise between $2 billion and $3 billion, said the sources, adding the company was yet to set a firm target.
Investment banks made presentations to JD Logistics executives on Nov. 27 as part of the selection process, the sources said.
The people could not be named as the information has not yet been made public.
JD Logistics did not immediately respond to a request for comment
JD.com spun off its logistics unit into a standalone entity in 2017 and then opened up its delivery and warehousing services to third-party companies. An IPO for the unit has been under consideration for almost a year.
Official mandates have yet to be given to the banks but JD is known to be close to UBS, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Haitong Securities, the people said.
UBS and Bank of America declined comment. Haitong did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Those three banks sponsored the JD Health IPO which raised nearly $3.5 billion in Hong Kong this week. UBS and BofA also sponsored JD.com's $4.4-billion secondary listing in June, the largest listing in Hong Kong in 2020.
A timetable for the JD Logistics IPO has not yet been set, but the two sources suggested a deal was expected in the first half of 2020.
The JD Logistics IPO was discussed during JD Health listing presentations last week with the parent's management, which indicated a deal could come earlier in the new year, a separate investor source said.

The source was not authorised to speak to media so could not be named.

(Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc will be able to produce 500 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in 2021, Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said on Friday.
The company has submitted applications seeking emergency use authorization in the United States and the European Union after full results from a late-stage study showed the vaccine was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns.
""For 500 million, I am very comfortable we are gonna get there (2021),"" Bancel said at the Nasdaq Investor Conference.
He also said the company would be able to maintain a premium price of $37 for its vaccine doses, although the premium is expected to fall to $25 for big-volume supplies, such as the one to the U.S. government. 
The Food and Drug Administration is set to hold an advisory committee meeting on Dec. 17 to discuss the company's request for emergency authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine.
Bancel said the company has seen renewed demand from many countries seeking additional doses after it reported clinical data.
Earlier on Friday, Moderna extended its contract with the Israeli health ministry to supply an additional 4 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
The company said on Thursday it would supply up to 125 million doses of the vaccine by the first quarter of 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co on Friday joined General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in exiting a group of automakers that had backed U.S. President Donald Trump in his bid to prevent California from imposing its own vehicle emissions rules.
GM last week reversed course in an ongoing court fight and abandoned the outgoing Republican president, winning praise from Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20. 
""We are confident that productive conversations among the auto industry, the Biden administration and California can deliver a common-sense set of national standards that increases efficiency and meets the needs of all American drivers,"" Nissan said in a statement.
GM had joined Nissan,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and other automakers in October 2019 in support of Trump effort's to bar California from setting its own fuel-efficiency rules, or zero-emission requirements, for vehicles - separate from federal requirements.
Others still backing Trump include Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp, Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors Corp Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp and the National Automobile Dealers Association. 
The industry still remained split on how to move forward after it held a meeting Tuesday.
Biden has made boosting electric vehicles a top priority and pledged to spend billions of dollars to add 550,000 charging stations for such vehicles. He also supports new tax credits for purchases of electric vehicles and retrofitting factories for their production.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Honda Motor Co, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and BMW AG in July 2019 struck a voluntary agreement with California on reducing vehicle emissions that is less stringent than rules previously adopted under President Barack Obama but higher than the Trump administration's rollback.

Ford has urged other automakers to back the California framework as a way to move forward.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) LLC funds posted strong gains in November to extend year-to-date returns into the double digits after the billionaire investor overhauled his portfolio and the firm a few months ago.
The Third Point Offshore Fund gained 9.1% in November and is now up 12.3% for the year, while the Third Point Ultra fund gained 12.1% last month and is now up 14.2%, according to a performance update seen by an investor.
The gains were fueled mainly by investments in credit as well as fundamental equity bets, particularly in the media and internet and enterprise technology sectors.
Loeb added stocks including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) during the year. During the third quarter he trimmed the stakes in Amazon and Disney slightly, regulatory filings show.
The gains represent a dramatic swing coming only months after Third Point was caught off-guard by the coronavirus and massive market sell-off to end the first quarter with double-digit losses. The Offshore fund lost 16% while the Ultra fund was down 21% at the end of the first quarter.
Third Point, which now oversees $14.8 billion in assets, has always had a flexible investment mandate and while the firm has been known for some of its recent large activist bets, Loeb shifted course some this year.
In May, he took back the reins from Munib Islam who had been promoted to co-chief investment officer last year and had largely been the face of Third Point's activism positions, including a bet this year on Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Plc.
Activism, which Third Point also calls constructivism, weighed on returns this year, the source said.
Third Point is handily outperforming the average hedge fund, which gained only 1.2% in the first ten months of 2020, according to Hedge Fund Research data. More recent data is not yet available.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A potential wave of bankruptcies and a collapse in the commercial real estate market in the United States could weigh heavily on smaller banks, a regulatory panel said on Thursday in an assessment of risks to financial stability from the pandemic.
The annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council urged regulators to remain vigilant for weaknesses across markets, pointing to March turmoil in short-term funding markets as an example of where problems can flare up. 
Thursday's report was the first from the panel, which is comprised of the heads of the major U.S. financial regulators, since the novel coronavirus upended the global economy and will be the last issued by President Donald Trump's administration.
The Treasury Department-led council will be taken over in January by President-elect Joe Biden's administration, which is likely to take a more cautious, tougher stance on safety and soundness issues.
Some risks flagged by the panel include record high levels of corporate debt, including nearly $2 trillion in non-financial debt that has been downgraded by rating agencies since March. A growing number of bankruptcy filings could stress court systems, making it harder to restructure debt and forcing more firms to liquidate, it said.
The panel also warned of ""potentially significant structural vulnerabilities"" in short-term wholesale funding markets, including money market funds, citing extreme March turmoil in those markets that required government intervention.
While noting that large banks had weathered the pandemic relatively well, the report recommended regulators ensure the largest institutions maintain sufficient capital and liquidity. 

The report cited the significant build-up in capital and liquidity cushions banks had made during the past decade as a main reason they have so far been able to weather the stress of the last year.

""Deliveries will begin the summer rather than the spring. That's being driven by COVID-related challenges some of our suppliers are experiencing,"" Ford spokesman Said Deep said.
The suppliers, which Ford did not identify, have had development work for tooling delayed by the pandemic, Deep said. Asked whether the launch could face further delays, Deep said Ford was monitoring the outbreak closely.
The pandemic caused the U.S. auto industry to shutter plants for two months earlier in the year, but since production restarted automakers have been largely successful in preventing the spread of the virus within their facilities. 
Ford still expects to begin building the Bronco at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan in the spring, Deep said. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company is already shipping the smaller Bronco Sport, which is built in Mexico.
Customers' ability to place orders for the Bronco also has been delayed from Dec. 7 to mid-January, Deep said.
Earlier on Friday, industry officials said a shortage of chips used in auto manufacturing could disrupt vehicle production in China well into next year. Deep said Ford's issues were not related.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors worried about whether a looming government shutdown could slow U.S. stocks' recent surge can take comfort in history: markets have tended to shrug off shutdowns despite their potentially nasty economic impact.
Since 1984, the S&P 500 has averaged a 1.3% gain during government shutdowns, having edged lower in only two out of the last 10 instances.
The most recent shutdown, which lasted for five weeks, shaved 0.1% and 0.2% from real U.S. gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, respectively, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
It did not do much to deter stocks, however, with the S&P 500 rising more than 9% during that period.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes touched all-time highs on Thursday as investors looked past bleak economic data, while remaining focused on a COVID-19 vaccine.
""Markets understand that artificial deadlines created by governments got designed as negotiating tools,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group.
""It is nothing more than a pause ... and most of the time it's resolved in very short order,"" he said.

More may be at stake this time, spurring lawmakers to act more decisively while also potentially boosting investor concerns as government funding for nearly all federal agencies expires on Dec. 11.
Failure by the Democratic-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate to pass a bill on how to allocate around $1.4 trillion to be spent by Sept. 30, 2021, when the fiscal year ends, could have dire consequences.
Some healthcare operations could be short-staffed or interrupted at a time when U.S. COVID-19 cases have been spiking, with more than 270,000 fatalities so far.
The massive spending bill could also be the vehicle for providing billions of dollars to state and local governments to help them handle coronavirus vaccines that are on track to be available in coming weeks and months.
With the economy reeling from COVID-19 and high unemployment, ""there will be tremendous political pressure ... to hammer out a deal,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, portfolio manager for Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston.
So far, the threat of a sharp slowdown in government spending has done little to dull investors' appetite for stocks, given the breakthroughs in a vaccine against COVID-19, hopes for more stimulus and a wave of stronger-than-expected corporate earnings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments rose 2.8% to $175 billion in the latest fiscal year, officials said on Friday, with looser restrictions under President Donald Trump boosting purchases during his time in office.
The U.S. State Department disclosed military sales figures for the 2020 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. Sales of U.S. military equipment in the prior fiscal year had totaled $170 billion.
Sales of fighter jets and guided missiles have risen in the past year as U.S. allies sought to gain access to the latest technology from companies including  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co and and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX). Major deals in fiscal 2020 included Japan's purchase of 63 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin for as much as $23 billion.
There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S. companies: direct commercial sales negotiated between a government and a company; and foreign military sales in which a foreign government typically contacts a Defense Department official at the U.S. embassy in its capital. Both require U.S. government approval.
The direct military sales by U.S. companies jumped 8.4% to $124.3 billion in fiscal 2020 from $114.7 billion in fiscal 2019, while sales arranged through the U.S. government fell 8.3% to $50.78 billion in 2020 from $55.39 billion the prior year, the State Department said.
On average, foreign military sales under Trump amounted to $57.5 billion per year, versus an average of $53.9 billion per year for the eight years under his predecessor Barack Obama, in 2020 dollars, according to Bill Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Program at the Center for International Policy think tank. Sales averaged about 6% more per year under Trump, Hartung said.

Trump's administration in 2018 rolled out a new ""Buy American"" program that relaxed restrictions https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-arms-insight/arming-the-world-inside-trumps-buy-american-drive-to-expand-weapons-exports-idUSKBN1HO2PT on military sales while encouraging U.S. officials to take a bigger role in increasing business overseas for the U.S. weapons industry.

World stocks hit fresh highs in December after best-ever monthly gains on hopes of a swift vaccine-driven economic recovery next year. BofA expects global gross domestic product to rise 5.4% in 2021, the strongest gain in nearly half a decade.
A record $115 billion was poured into equity funds in the past four weeks, the U.S. investment bank said, citing data from EPFR. Equity funds saw $9.7 billion of inflows for the week ending Dec 2.
Safe-haven gold, by contrast, has seen $9 billion in outflows in the last three weeks.
The past 10 months has been characterised by the ""quickest bear market of all-time... greatest policy panic of all-time... greatest Wall Street rally of all-time,"" BofA said.
Vast government spending and central bank stimulus have also raised expectations for a return of inflation from its decade-long slumber. That helped Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) attract $2 billion last week, the second-largest weekly total.
BofA also noted the ""dollar debasement"" theme, saying should the dollar index dip below 90, there could be a disorderly drop in the world's top currency and lead to disorderly jump in U.S. Treasury yields and a likely pop in speculation in bitcoin. The index against other major currencies was at 90.567 on Friday.
A dramatic post-summer decline in dollar has coincided with a spectacular rally in bitcoin, which has risen nearly 170% this year to record high levels.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Drug industry trade groups filed two lawsuits against the Trump administration on Friday challenging new U.S. rules to lower drug prices, potentially undermining one of President Donald Trump's flagship efforts to take on high drug costs.
The suits were filed by PhRMA, the pharmaceutical industry trade group, and a group of biotechnology industry trade organizations, including Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), in federal courts in Maryland and California, respectively.
The administration last month announced it has finalized a rule, which will take effect on Jan. 1, that would tie payments for some drugs made by Medicare, a U.S. government insurance program, to the lowest price paid by certain other countries.
Since he lost the presidential election, Trump has been issuing and finalizing a host of rule changes in areas ranging from energy, healthcare to immigration in a bid to bolster key areas of his agenda prior to his departure from the White House in January.
The new reimbursement rules will affect 50 drugs and be tied to the lowest price charged among a list of rich countries. The administration says the move could save taxpayers and patients $85 billion over seven years.
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America's lawsuit claims the rule change is illegal because it relies on laws allowing the administration to test new drug pricing models but is too far-reaching to qualify as a pilot. It requests that the court halt the rule before it can be implemented.
""It's not a test when it impacts the entire country and implicates 90% of (Medicare's hospital drug) spending with no control group,"" said Steve Ubl, PhRMA's chief executive officer.
PhRMA is joined in its suit by the Association of Community Cancer Centers, a network of cancer treatment providers.
Lower reimbursements for drugs could push some cancer treatment centers out of business, particularly those that rely heavily on Medicare, said Christian Downs, the ACCC's executive director.
Both suits claim, among other things, that the administration did not follow the appropriate process by failing to collect feedback from stakeholders before announcing the new rule.
The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Efforts by the administration to curb drug prices, such as a proposed rule to force drugmakers to reveal list prices in advertisements, have been undermined by successful industry lawsuits in the past.

STAT news was first to report BIO's lawsuit.

Investing.com – The Dow closed at record highs Friday, as lawmakers talked up the prospect of a stimulus deal to shore up the economy amid signs of weakness in the jobs market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.83%, or 248 points to close at a record of 30,218.  The S&P 500 was up 0.90%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.70%, with both indexes also hitting closing at record highs.
The U.S. economy created just 240,000 jobs in December, missing a forecast for 469,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 6.7% from 6.9%.
""Today's data underscore the urgent need for additional policy support. Fiscal authorities are clearly better equipped to offer relief, and recent developments are encouraging. If Congress fails to deliver next week, we would expect the Fed to step in. Either way, help is on the way,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday she held talks with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell about adding the new bipartisan $908 billion coronavirus relief legislation to a government funding omnibus, which must pass within the next week.   
A day earlier, McConnell said a compromise was “within reach” on a bipartisan Covid-19 relief package. 
Value stocks – those linked to the progress of the economy – were in demand as financials, industrials and energy climbed, with the latter pushed higher by rising oil prices.
Energy stocks jumped more than 5% after OPEC and Russia agreed to raise production by 500,000 barrels per day from January, sending oil prices up more than 1% as investors bet on further tapering of production cuts ahead.
“This is a slower ramp-up than the previously planned 1.9 mb/d January increase … OPEC+ was able to clear the important hurdle of exiting its current cuts in a coordinated way, strongly reducing the tail risk of an OPEC+ taper tantrum,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), and  Diamondback Energy Inc  (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the biggest gainers, with the latter up about 13%.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",Russia to Germany gas pipeline targeted in U.S. defense bill,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The annual U.S. defense policy bill unveiled by lawmakers late on Thursday contains sanctions that backers say will halt one of Russia's biggest projects in Europe: the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
The $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, led by Russian state energy company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and aimed at doubling the existing pipeline's capacity, is more than 90% complete. Russia says the project to deliver gas under the Baltic Sea to Europe via Germany will begin operating next year.
But President Donald Trump's administration, which is eager to offer Europe U.S. shipments of gas, and many U.S. lawmakers oppose the pipeline. They say the project, which would bypass Ukraine, depriving it of lucrative transit fees, would boost Moscow's economic and political leverage over Europe.
The sanctions in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) target any companies and individuals providing help to the project, including upgrading of a ship needed to lay the pipeline, verification of equipment used to lay the pipeline, and insurance.
The NDAA is expected to be passed by the U.S. House of Representatives early next week and soon after by the Senate. Trump has vowed to veto the bill over a bipartisan provision to strip the names of Confederate military leaders from U.S. bases.
But vetoing the massive bill would carry significant political risk. If Trump vetoes the legislation and Congress upholds his veto, it would end a 59-year streak of passing the NDAA. 
TOUGHER SANCTIONS
""These sanctions significantly toughen existing provisions ... to cover critical components of the pipeline project,"" said a U.S. official familiar with the process of crafting sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The Obama administration had also opposed the project and the incoming Biden administration is expected to maintain that policy.
Backers say the sanctions will deprive Russia of the capability to upgrade Gazprom's vessel, the Akademik Cherskiy, to lay the type of pipe used in the project, required insurance, and necessary certifications. 
""Without any of this, they are just not going to be able to finish the pipeline,"" said Daniel Vajdich, president of Yorktown Solutions, a lobbyist for Ukraine's state energy company Naftogaz, which opposes the project. 
The Kremlin said the threat of new U.S. sanctions was a sign of unfair competition and promised Russia would defend its interests and commercial projects.
Nord Stream 2 did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said last month the sanctions would directly or indirectly hit about 120 companies from more than 12 European countries and that it was up to governments and the European Commission to protect them from ""illegal extraterritorial sanctions.""
Only a final stretch of about 100 miles (160 km) in Danish waters needs to be completed, but the work is complicated by unexploded World War Two bombs on the seabed in the project's path.
In addition, fear of sanctions has led important companies doing work necessary for the project to drop out. Last month Norway's DNV GL, a company that had been monitoring the testing and preparation of equipment used by ships to lay the pipeline, suspended work. 

In September, the world's largest group of shipping insurers said they would not insure vessels involved in Nord Stream 2. Associations belonging to the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, including the Shipowners' Club and the London P&I Club, said they would not provide coverage for any activity involving the Nord Stream 2 or TurkStream, a pipeline project to bring Russian gas to Turkey.

Lufthansa workers represented by Verdi, a service workers union, backed the deal struck a month ago to cut costs by 200 million euros ($243 million) in return for a promise of no forced redundancies in 2021, according to the document.
Verdi represents 24,000 Lufthansa ground staff, who agreed as part of the deal to forgo Christmas and vacation bonuses through 2021.
A formal announcement is expected on Monday.
The deal with Verdi followed months of on-off talks, during which the union accused management of seeking to cut jobs even after taking a 9-billion-euro government bailout to keep its planes flying.
The airline and its subsidiaries, Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian and Brussels Airlines, have slashed their schedules, fleet and staff, with air travel not expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels before 2025. It aims to cut 22,000 full-time jobs.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>",Lasting high? Cannabis industry aims to build on Thanksgiving rush,"By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - U.S. cannabis sales hit record levels over the Thanksgiving weekend, prompting industry predictions the combination of COVID-19 anxiety and a trend towards legalisation has triggered a permanent uplift in demand.
After years of sluggish official sales, buying soared in early March and April when lockdowns began and consumers, fearing supply disruptions, stockpiled the drug.
Though many expected the initial surge to fade, monthly sales have kept hitting records.
One of the top cannabis data aggregator and research companies Akerna (NASDAQ:KERN) said sales on Green Wednesday, as the eve of Thanksgiving is known, climbed by 80% above the daily average this year, hitting an all-time one-day record.
The company's calculations, based on data collected from its partner dispensaries in 19 U.S. states and adjusted to project the full market, show total cannabis sales of around $238 million during the Thanksgiving weekend, nearly 14% above last year.
By keeping people at home, limiting their entertainment options and adding to stress, the pandemic has helped to drive demand for cannabis for much of the year.
Four in 10 users increased their overall consumption and more than half said they turned to cannabis to improve mental health, an advance copy of a report by research firm New Frontier Data, which is to be published next week, showed.
'COME TO JESUS' MOMENT
Even if COVID-19 vaccines can bring back a degree of normality, insiders and observers say 2020 is likely to mark a watershed for the cannabis industry, as for many other sectors.
""The shutdowns created a real 'come to Jesus' moment for a lot of stakeholders,"" Avis Bulbulyan, Chief Executive of cannabis consultancy Siva Enterprises, said. ""Consumer acceptance went through the roof.""
As a result, operators upgraded their plans and attracted mainstream investors that before showed little interest in the nascent industry.
Further legitimacy came from the decision of state regulators to designate cannabis retailers as ""essential business"" during lockdowns, and, in the U.S. elections on Nov. 3, initiatives to legalise recreational or medical marijuana, which five states put on the ballot, sailed through.
Graphic: Big Wins for Marijuana Ballots - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-CANNABIS/gjnvwbmndpw/chart.png
Thirty-five states allow medical marijuana use, some with restrictions, and 15 states, plus the District of Columbia, have legalised its recreational use. 
Opposition persists, however, with some groups saying it causes addiction and that not enough research has been carried out to prove medical benefits.
The states of Idaho and Nebraska have bans in force. Activists in favour of cannabis are seeking a vote to try to overturn them in 2022 mid-term elections.
Stuart Titus, an early cannabis investor and CEO of Medical Marijuana Inc, says 2021 could be the year when cannabis becomes as readily available as alcohol and tobacco.
""Shortly in restaurants, consumers will have the choice of an alcoholic beverage or a cannabis-based beverage,"" he said.

FEDERAL VERSUS STATE
Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which has limited the industry's access to banking services and funding. 
Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' has promised to change that and decriminalising weed is part of the Democrats' platform.
Industry insiders acknowledge it may take years for any changes to make their way through the legislative process, but shifts in sentiment are moving more quickly.
A Gallup poll in November showed support for marijuana legalisation had reached 68% support, the highest level yet and up from 66% last year.
At the same time, a separate Gallup poll found 70% of U.S. adults consider smoking marijuana to be ""morally acceptable,"" a 5 point rise in a year.
Solid majorities for legalisation in traditionally conservative states, such as North and South Dakota or Missouri, could also help to win over Republican lawmakers and local politicians, Steve Allan, chief executive of Californian producer The Parent Company, said.
""With many Republican Senators now representing states that have passed cannabis legalisation measures by wide margins, we will likely see increased support from Republicans for federal cannabis reforms,"" he said.
Akerna CEO Jessica Billingsley said her company has received a record number of research requests from state governments, which have lost tax revenues to business closures during the pandemic and are looking for new sources of income.
""Lawmakers see cannabis legalisation as a great way to shore up their balance sheets and provide jobs during this time of economic uncertainty,"" she told Reuters.
The experience in Canada could yet serve as a cautionary tale. 
It became the first major nation to legalise recreational weed in 2018, but industry hopes were dashed by oversupply, black markets and lack of profitability.
Producers and research firms say the United States is better placed to succeed because of the vast size of the potential market, new products and greater awareness of the therapeutic benefits of cannabis.

""What used to be a 'recreational drug' is being better understood to be a complex compound with a long list of potential benefits for both the mind and body,"" The Parent Company's Allan said.(This story refiles to fix typo in eighth paragraph from end)

The plans centre around the concept of conducting multiple tests so that travellers can have more trust that the chances they or others are carrying the virus during their voyage are small.
Under the KLM plan, passengers receive one test five days before their flight, another shortly before the flight, and a third after landing.
""Only passengers with negative test results will be accepted on-board,"" KLM said in a statement. 
After testing negative again upon arrival at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, U.S. and European Union passengers travelling from Atlanta will be able to skip a 5-day quarantine in the Netherlands.
Alitalia announced a similar scheme for Rome to New York flights earlier on Friday, and Delta last week introduced one from Atlanta to Rome. Delta, Air France and Alitalia cooperate under the ""SkyTeam"" airline alliance.
The KLM flights from Atlanta to Amsterdam will run four times a week starting from Dec. 15, the company said, adding that it intends to adopt the system more widely if it is successful.

BEIJING (Reuters) - German auto suppliers Continental, Bosch and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) the world's largest carmaker, on Friday warned about a shortage of semiconductor components needed for automotive production.
The pandemic has hit auto and auto parts production globally, and car-making has grown increasingly reliant on imported chips for electronic parts, such as electronic control units and electronic stability programmes.
Production slowed down during hard lockdowns triggered by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier in 2020. But a strong rebound in China demand has led to a shortage of parts.
""Although semiconductor manufacturers have already responded to the unexpected demand with capacity expansions, the required additional volumes will only be available in six to nine months,"" Continental said on Friday. ""Therefore, the potential delivery bottlenecks may last into 2021.""
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), the biggest foreign automaker in China, said on Friday that China's overall auto production could be interrupted after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted chip supplies globally for some electronic components. 
""The chip supply for certain automotive electronic components has been affected due to uncertainties caused by the pandemic,"" a Volkswagen representative told Reuters in an emailed statement.
""This has led to a potential interruption in automotive production, with the situation getting more critical as demand has risen due to the full-speed recovery of the Chinese market,"" the statement, which refers to China's overall auto production and not specifically Volkswagen's, said.
Germany-based auto supplier Bosch said it too was seeing supply chain bottlenecks for certain components.
""Currently there is a shortage of certain semiconductor components in global procurement markets, including the automotive sector,"" Bosch said. 
""No supplier can elude this market development. We are in close contact with our suppliers and customers to maintain the supply chains as much as possible despite the tense market situation.""
One senior industry official, who declined to be named, told Reuters that he expects the shortage of chips will continue to impact China's car production for a while and several international and local car companies will face production interruptions in the short-term but at different levels.
China is expected to sell over 22 million vehicles in the first 11 months, down just 3% from the same period a year earlier.
Volkswagen also said it was closely monitoring the situation and had already started coordinating with suppliers to take appropriate countermeasures.

The Wolfsburg-based company has local joint ventures with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, China FAW Group Corp Ltd and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp Ltd (JAC).

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes jumped to all-time highs on Friday as data showing the slowest jobs growth in six months reinforced investors expectations for a new fiscal stimulus bill to help revive the economy from its worst downturn in decades.
All the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, with value stocks such as energy and financials, which have lagged the broader market this year, leading the gains.
Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) climbed about 3% each, lifted by a rise in crude prices, as major oil producers agreed on a compromise to extend the bulk of existing supply curbs. 
The Labor Department's closely watched report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 245,000 jobs in November, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 610,000 in October.
Analysts said the dismal report could spur policymakers to push harder for a stimulus bill as more than 13 million people were due to lose their government-funded unemployment benefits on Dec. 26 without quick action by Congress. 
""The bad news of the weakening jobs picture is potentially good news for investors because it means that the stimulus bill is much more likely to take place in a fairly short time frame,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in North Carolina. 
At 11:21 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 158.14 points or 0.53% to 30,127.66, the S&P 500 gained 22.68 points or 0.62% to 3,689.40 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 51.20 points, or 0.41% to 12,428.14. 
A $908 billion coronavirus aid plan gained momentum in the Congress on Thursday after a months-long standoff between Republicans and Democrats over the size of the potential package.
The two parties also face a Dec. 11 deadline to pass a $1.4 trillion budget or risk a shutdown of the government.
Positive vaccine updates from major drugmakers have eased worries around grim economic data and a surge in infections, setting Wall Street's main indexes for another week of gains after the benchmark S&P 500 clocked its best November.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's chief said on Friday he had a ""robust discussion"" with the White House this week about the timeline for COVID-19 vaccine approvals and believes vaccinating 20 million Americans this year is realistic.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 3.3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 2.5-to-1 on the Nasdaq. 

The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 279 new highs and 13 new lows.

A spokeswoman for the Munich prosecutor's office said it had examined the complaint brought by the APAS oversight board, adding that opening such an investigation was a procedural requirement.
""We continue to conduct our investigations in the entire Wirecard complex against numerous suspects,"" the spokeswoman said, adding the outcome of the inquiries was open.
EY said on Friday that ""it is not aware of any indications of criminal behaviour by its auditors at Wirecard. EY has supported the investigations of the responsible authorities from the outset and will continue to do so in full.""
Wirecard collapsed into insolvency in June after EY, its auditor for more than a decade, was unable to confirm the existence of 1.9 billion euros ($2.3 billion) purportedly held in offshore trustee accounts.
Former CEO Markus Braun and other senior executives have been held in investigative custody on suspicion of masterminding a criminal racket to fake the company's accounts and defraud creditors of billions of euros.
EY on Thursday criticised the APAS filing as premature, saying had not allowed to respond to the watchdog's findings, the Financial Times reported.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday it had fined restaurant chain  The Cheesecake Factory  (NASDAQ:CAKE) $125,000 to settle charges that it misled investors about the impact of the pandemic on its business, the first such case brought by the regulator. 
In March 23 and April 3 regulatory filings, the company said its restaurants were ""operating sustainably"" when in fact internal documents showed it was losing approximately $6 million per week due to pandemic lockdowns and had only about 16 weeks' of cash remaining, the SEC said. 
Although the company did not disclose this information with public investors, it did share it with potential private equity investors and lenders as it sought additional liquidity, the SEC said. The regulator's probe also found that The Cheesecake Factory failed to disclose in its March filing that it had already informed its landlords that it would not pay rent in April due to the harm COVID-19 had inflicted on its business.
The Cheesecake Factory's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
While the SEC penalty is small, it underscores the regulatory risks COVID-19 has created for public companies wrestling with how best to communicate the pandemic's impact to investors, with white collar crime lawyers predicting similar SEC actions. 
Reuters reported https://br.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-ppp-idUSKBN22Q3NE in May that the SEC had asked public companies that took emergency pandemic aid to prove they qualified for the funds and had made consistent representations to investors about their need for the aid. 
""When public companies describe for investors the impact of COVID-19 on their business, they must speak accurately,"" said SEC Director of Enforcement Stephanie Avakian. 

""The Enforcement Division... will continue to scrutinize COVID-related disclosures to ensure that investors receive accurate, timely information, while also giving appropriate credit for prompt and substantial cooperation in investigations.""

504,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",EU plan to label climate-harmful investments faces finance industry pushback,"By Simon Jessop and Kate Abnett
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A European Union plan to label polluting activities as ""unsustainable"" is facing resistance from some leading finance firms, amid concerns it could prevent investment getting to companies trying to clean up their act.
The EU's executive Commission last month proposed rules for what can be called a green investment, under its so-called sustainable finance taxonomy which aims to steer money to companies and projects that will help the EU meet its climate goals.
But a parallel plan is proving more contentious - as the Commission considers whether to create a list of polluting activities such as coal mining and force providers of financial products to flag them as ""unsustainable"" investments.
Brussels will assess the move based on upcoming recommendations from its advisers and the results of a consultation, which the Commission is ""still analysing"", a spokesperson said.
Of the 161 responses to that consultation from respondents in the financial sector that specifically addressed the issue, 54% supported the ""unsustainable"" taxonomy plan and 46% opposed it, according to analysis by NGO Reclaim Finance, shared with Reuters.
While a majority of financial authorities such as the European Central Bank backed the idea, many of the region's biggest financial sector groups such as trade bodies opposed it. Service providers were split on the issue.
Reclaim Finance, which supports the creation of an ""unsustainable"" taxonomy, said the pushback was inconsistent with some financial institutions' claims to be leaders in efforts to limit global warming.
Several opponents of the plan said the EU should focus on promoting investment in climate-friendly activities, rather than penalising polluters. Others said the sustainable taxonomy already created a defacto polluters list of those activities or companies that fail to get a green label.
Some were also concerned that labelling activities as unsustainable would cut off funding to companies that need cash to retool their business models.
Henrik Pontzen, Head of ESG at Union Investment, said a simple distinction between green activities and those harming the planet overlooked the need for investors to engage with companies seeking to become cleaner.
""It is precisely through the critical dialogue on such initiatives and our voting behaviour that we can accompany companies on their transformation path much better than by simply excluding them,"" he told Reuters.
In its reply to the consultation,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said an unsustainable taxonomy could have ""destabilising"" knock-on effects.
""A green taxonomy is (the) best tool to identify appropriate signals where and how to shift industry sectors at the lowest social and economic cost, which will lead to a shift in financing portfolios,"" it said.
    Markus Mueller, Head of the Chief Investment Office of the International Private Bank at Deutsche Bank, told Reuters that quickly imposing multiple regulations could make it harder to get the industry ""buy-in"" needed to make the taxonomy a success.
Others expressed concern that an extra EU taxonomy could overwhelm industry - given that the first sections of the green taxonomy include 500 pages of technical information.
Tycho Sneyers, Managing Partner at LGT Capital Partners, said he was a ""big believer"" in identifying the activities that negatively impact the bloc's climate-related objectives, but regulation needed to be manageable.
""We're a mid-size asset manager and it's causing an enormous amount of work for us, but if you're a smaller asset manager how can you cope with this? That’s not an easy one.""
Supporters of the unsustainable taxonomy include German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) and French asset manager Mirova, part of Natixis. 
Mirova said in its consultation response that regulation is needed to deter polluting investments, given the current ""slow pace of financial flows"" out of climate-harmful activities.

By identifying assets exposed to transition risks, an unsustainable taxonomy could also underpin stress-testing scenarios and financial sector disclosures on climate-related risk, it added.

507,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 10:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: FDA chief had 'robust discussion' with White House about vaccine timelines,"By Jeff Mason and Julie Steenhuysen
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's chief had a ""robust discussion"" with the White House this week about the timeline for coronavirus vaccine approvals and believes vaccinating 20 million Americans this year is realistic, he said on Friday.
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn declined to lay out a specific timetable for approval of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech but said he hoped the regulator would make a decision this month.
Many federal officials are expecting a vaccine approval within days of a Dec. 10 meeting of experts, though one FDA official recently said an approval decision could take weeks.
""We expect to move quickly,"" after that meeting, Hahn told Reuters in an interview.
Britain leapt ahead of the United States this week in approving Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, intensifying scrutiny on U.S. regulators as they consider whether to grant emergency use in the country that leads the world in coronavirus infections. 
Hahn has come under pressure from outgoing President Donald Trump, who is eager to claim credit for a successful vaccine, to speed up the process.
The FDA head discussed the situation at a White House meeting with chief of staff Mark Meadows earlier this week to explain the timing and the ""balancing act"" required to make sure a vaccine is safe and effective.
""Mr. Meadows asked for a briefing and we gave it, and it went very well,"" Hahn told Reuters. ""We had a very robust discussion, and I know that term sometimes is loaded, robust, but we did.""
Though he declined to give a specific timeline for vaccine approval, Hahn gave a nod to its likelihood by endorsing the White House's goal of having 20 million Americans inoculated by the end of the year.
""I think given what we know about supplies, it is realistic,"" Hahn said of that goal. ""It'll very much depend upon ... the vaccination campaign.""
Trump, a Republican who lost the Nov. 3 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden but has declined to concede the race, said last week he deserved credit for the vaccine.
GETTING TO 20 MILLION
Dealing with the virus that has killed more than 276,000 people in the United States as well as the economic fallout from the crisis is one of Biden's top priorities once he takes office on Jan. 20.
Hahn said Biden's team had not been in touch with him but he would be happy to provide information about the vaccine approval process. The cancer specialist said he had not made plans for a new job after the Biden administration takes over.
To get to 20 million people, the FDA would need to approve both Pfizer's vaccine and the shot developed by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) soon so they can go to the states quickly. 
Data from late-stage trials of Moderna's vaccine, which uses the same mRNA technology as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, is due to be reviewed on Dec. 17.
Based on a scenario in which people get two doses, Pfizer plans to provide the United States with enough vaccine for 12.5 million people and Moderna has said it will have enough for 10 million people this year.
Pfizer and Moderna have tested their products as two-shot vaccines given weeks apart, but Hahn said officials at the agency were combing through their data and might consider them as a single-shot if warranted.
""I can't prejudge what our scientists will decide, but we will look at that,"" Hahn said. A single shot vaccine would be much easier to manage because it would not require millions of Americans to return for a second shot weeks later, a major logistical challenge for public health officials. Trump's Operation Warp Speed program has struck deals with several drugmakers in an effort to help speed up the search for effective treatments to fight the global pandemic.
Of the vaccines being evaluated, only Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s candidate is being tested as a single-shot vaccine. 
A speedy vaccine approval could be a political win for Trump's outgoing administration, which has been pushing for effective treatments to help restore a sense of normality to daily life and a hard-hit U.S. economy.

Hahn said he would be eager to be inoculated as soon as there is an approval. ""I will be first in line and I will encourage my family to take this vaccine,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co is recalling 129,000 U.S. vehicles for an engine issue that can increase the risk of a fire, U.S. regulators said Friday.
The recall covers some 2015-2016 Veloster, 2012 Santa Fe, 2011-2013 Sonata Hybrid, and 2016 Sonata Hybrid vehicles because connecting rod bearings inside the engine may wear prematurely, which over time can result in engine damage. Dealers will conduct inspections and if bearing damage is found, the engine will be replaced, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.
Hyundai said all recalled vehicles will also receive an enhanced engine control software update containing a new Knock Sensor Detection System that monitors engine vibrations for unusual patterns potentially indicating an abnormal condition with the engine, such as a damaged connecting rod bearing.
Last week, Hyundai and Kia Motors' U.S. units agreed to a record $210 million civil penalty after U.S. auto safety regulators said they failed to recall 1.6 million vehicles for engine issues in a timely fashion.
NHTSA said the two affiliated Korean automakers agreed to consent orders after it said they had inaccurately reported some information to the agency regarding the recalls.
Hyundai agreed to a total civil penalty of $140 million, including an upfront payment of $54 million, an obligation to spend $40 million on safety performance measures, and an additional $46 million deferred penalty if it does not meet requirements.

The settlement covered recalls in 2015 and 2017 for manufacturing issues that could lead to bearing wear and engine failure.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, with the S&P hitting a new record, as a sharp slowdown in hiring was seen as raising the chances of a substantial fiscal relief package from Congress in short order.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 110 points, or 0.4%, at 30,080. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that the pace of hiring in the U.S. economy slowed sharply in November, adding only 245,000 new nonfarm jobs. That was the smallest gain since May, and well below expectations for 469,000 new jobs.
James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, called the labor market report “a disappointing read throughout,” that left total U.S. employment still nearly 10 million below February's level.
Meanwhile, labor force participation edged down to 61.5%,  1.9 percentage points below its February level, suggesting that unemployment and underemployment remains markedly higher than the official jobless rate, which fell to 6.7% from 6.9%.
The report comes at the end of a week when Congressional Republicans and Democrats have restarted talks on a stimulus package. Democrats in both chambers have embraced a bipartisan package worth just over $900 billion, but Senate Leader Mitch McConnell still prefers a stripped-down bill worth some $400 billion less, according to various reports.

German industrial orders rose more than expected on the month in October, data showed on Friday, raising hopes the manufacturing sector in Europe's biggest economy started the fourth quarter on a solid footing during a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Asian shares hit a record high overnight. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.82%, surpassing its Nov. 25 high, led by gains in the tech sector. Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.22% on profit-taking.
BREXIT DEAL?
The pound rose 0.2% to $1.3475, a shade below recent one-year highs, with traders hoping for a trade deal between the European Union and Britain.
Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said it was an important day in the talks as he left his hotel in London, while his planned update for national envoys to the bloc was cancelled due to ""intensive negotiations"", an EU spokesman said.
A negotiated deal was ""imminent"" and expected before the end of the weekend, barring a last-minute breakdown in talks, an official with the bloc told Reuters. But a British minister said the talks were in a difficult phase. 
Emerging markets continued their gains. The Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, South African rand, Russian rouble and Polish zloty have all jumped 7% to 11% over the past month, adding to 5%-12% leaps in China, Taiwan and Korea's currencies since June. 
Oil prices got an additional lift after OPEC and Russia agreed to reduce their deep oil output cuts from January by 500,000 barrels per day. They failed to find a compromise on a broader and longer-term policy.
The increase means the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, a group known as OPEC+, would move to cut production by 7.2 million barrels per day, or 7% of global demand from January, compared with current cuts of 7.7 million barrels per day.

Brent crude rose as high as $49.92 per barrel, its highest price since early March, and last stood at $49.36, up 1.3%.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, maintaining the recent positive tone ahead of the release of the influential monthly employment report.  
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract rose 110 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 46 points, or 0.4%. 
The major indices are on course to record another positive week, with investors buoyed by the rapid progress towards the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines as well as by apparent movement toward a stimulus package. 
A record $115 billion was poured into equity funds in the past four weeks, the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said, citing data from EPFR. Equity funds saw $9.7 billion of inflows for the week ending Dec 2.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), along with partner BioNTech, insisted Thursday it was still on course to roll out 1.3 billion vaccines in 2021, after earlier cutting its production expectation for 2020 by 50 million. Additionally,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said it expects to supply up to 125 million doses of its vaccine around the world in the first quarter of 2021.
On Capitol Hill, the recently introduced bipartisan $908 billion coronavirus aid plan appeared to be gathering more support, with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying a deal was “within reach”.
These lawmakers may receive more pressure to come to a compromise when the monthly official employment report is released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to show an addition of 469,000 jobs for November compared with 638,000 for October, showing that the jobs recovery is slowing. 
ADP’s monthly payrolls report on Wednesday showed private payrolls grew at their slowest pace since July.
Oil prices gained Friday, climbing to eight-month highs, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, a group known as OPEC+, agreed late Thursday to ease production cuts by 500,000 barrels per day from January 2021. The group had originally planned to raise output by 2 million barrels a day. 
The group will also meet once a month to review conditions, but stated that any monthly increases will not be greater than 500,000 barrels per day.

The capital injection, Aston Martin's third this year, was announced in October along with plans that Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) unit Mercedes-Benz would lift its stake in the British company to up to 20% by 2023, making it one of Aston Martin's largest shareholders.
Shares in the London-listed company, which have lost half of their market value this year, rose 4.5% to 78.65 pence by 1106 GMT.
The October plan involves Mercedes getting shares in exchange for expanding an existing supply deal, giving Aston Martin access to key Mercedes' technology such as hybrid and electric drive systems. It did not involve any cash from the German automaker.
Billionaire Lawrence Stroll in January agreed to buy up to 25% of Aston Martin, making him the biggest stakeholder in the company popular for being James Bond car of choice.

The announcement follows a health ministry order issued late last month and in force until Feb. 15 under which passengers flying between Rome and some U.S. destinations can be tested for the coronavirus 48 hours before departure and on arrival at the airport, to avoid the mandatory 14-day quarantine Italy imposes on incoming travellers.
In September, in an effort to resume domestic travel after the first wave of the epidemic, Alitalia experimented with COVID testing on some flights between Rome's Fiumicino and Milan's city airport Linate, Italy's biggest hubs.
However, the government progressively restricted movement between regions to tackle a second wave of infections.
Fiumicino saw its passenger traffic plummet this year due to the coronavirus crisis and early in March it was forced to announce a partial closure.

MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Sabadell is considering more job cuts and striking product distribution alliances with other European banks after merger talks with rival BBVA (MC:BBVA) fell through last week, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter. 
Shares in the mid-sized Spanish lender slumped after the pair failed to agree on the price of their transaction, with investors now worried about Sabadell's ability to handle the expected pick-up in bad loans in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis if it goes it alone.
Sabadell has said it is considering selling its British unit TSB, but sources said fresh cost saving measures are also under consideration. 
Two sources familiar with the bank's strategy said Sabadell would try to strike alliances with other lenders in Europe in segments such as consumer and insurance services. Two further sources told Reuters the bank was also considering additional job cuts of up to 2,000 people in Spain in 2021 on top of its already announced 1,800 job cuts.
Sabadell declined to comment.
Bankers warn though that Sabadell's options are limited, and additional cost saving measures may only buy it time until it is forced to again consider merging with a larger rival. 
""Sabadell has been caught in some kind of nowhereland. It is too small to play a role with the big Spanish players but bigger than most of the regional lenders,"" a banking source said, adding that non-performing loans in the corporate sector could start to rise once support measures to cope with the impact from COVID-19 are lifted.
Spanish broker Alantra has said that BBVA and Sabadell might resume M&A talks at some point next year once BBVA's sale of its unit for $11.6 billion in cash to PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) is expected to be closed.
Sabadell and BBVA declined to comment on this option. 
TSB 'HARD SELL'
Differences between BBVA and Sabadell over the value of TSB - a mid-sized UK bank bought by Sabadell in 2015 for 1.7 billion pounds ($2.29 billion) - were partly to blame for merger talks breaking down, a source directly aware of the talks said.
""The market and BBVA were putting a zero valuation on TSB,"" this source said, adding that the valuation could be higher and even close to 1 billion euros depending on whether a potential domestic buyer could generate cost-savings.
BBVA did not want to pay more than 2.5 billion euros for Sabadell, while Sabadell was not willing to accept anything less than 3 billion euros, the source said, with the difference partly down to TSB.
Sabadell is aiming to sell the loss-making British unit in the first quarter, which was hobbled by major IT problems two years ago. But it finds itself in a crowded market with rival domestic lenders the Co-op Bank and the financial services arm of supermarket giant Sainsbury's also for sale.
Analysts say TSB has been put on a surer footing by CEO Debbie Crosbie, who pushed through a restructuring programme after joining last year, although it racked up pre-tax losses of 209 million euros over the nine months to September.
A spokesman for TSB declined to comment on Sabadell's negotiations, but added: ""We've seen good momentum in underlying business growth and have accelerated the delivery of our strategy, including taking full control of our IT, delivering a right-sized modern branch network and reducing overall operating costs."" 
Sabadell says it expects TSB to break even in 2021.

524,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 05:11AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Oil Stocks Take off in Response to OPEC+ Deal,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Oil and gas stocks in Europe were flying on Friday morning on a surge of relief that major producing countries are still cautious enough about the outlook for the world market to maintain a relatively degree of output restraint. 
The EURO STOXX Oil & Gas index was up 2.5% at 256.52 by 5 AM ET (1000 GMT), its highest level since the early days of the pandemic in March. Integrated majors such as BP (NYSE:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  ENI  (MI:ENI),  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and Equinor ASA (OL:EQNR) all rose by between 2% and 3.5%, while smaller independent companies and oilfield services firms, who have been hardest hit by the collapse in prices in the middle of the year, made bigger gains.  Technip  (PA:FTI) stock rose 6.4% while  Hunting  (LON:HTG) stock and Petrofac (LON:PFC) stock both rose over 5%.
The sector has had a miserable year - the Stoxx sectoral index is still down 22% year-to-date - but the chance of it recouping much of those losses by year-end now seems greatly enhanced by the results of a meeting between OPEC and its allies which resulted in a compromise that proved the bloc is still able to lead the market through consensus-building, rather than pushing the survival of the fittest through a new and destructive price war.
The so-called OPEC+ grouping decided on Thursday to raise output by 500,000 barrels a day from January 1. It's illuminating that crude prices rallied after that decision, even though it went against prior expectations that the current production level would be ""rolled over"" for another three months. The enduring consensus and the presentation of a united front counts for a lot. 
The group has made a virtue out of necessity. Higher prices - Brent is up over 30% since the start of November, when the progress of Covid-19 vaccine development reached a critical stage - were bound to encourage higher production. The desperation of many members to plug holes in their budgets would have led to higher output in January, whether or not it was approved. OPEC+ essentially accepted a slightly higher output ceiling that would be respected, rather than lose credibility by seeing the current ceiling violated left, right and center. 
In addition, the OPEC+ ministers agreed to review output levels on a monthly basis, which will enhance the current framework's flexibility. That, too, increases the chance that production discipline will last for longer. Why break a framework that can be bent more easily? Such pragmatism is born of the realization that discipline will be needed for some time yet, given the huge remaining uncertainty over the long-term impact on demand from the pandemic. Even after January's tweak, OPEC+ members will still be keeping 7.2 million barrels of production capacity off line, waiting for a recovery in demand that may be slow, irregular and ultimately incomplete.
That is still a huge supply overhang, equivalent to over 7.5% of current global demand. So the downside risks to crude prices - and to oil stocks - are still there. But there is very little downside to a decision that recognizes such risks and manages them as deftly as this one does."

On Friday, London indicated that the chance of a breakthrough regarding a post-Brexit trade deal was receding. A British minister said talks are in the difficult phase and a deal can only be struck if the European Union accepts that Britain is a sovereign nation.
But analysts were hopeful of an eventual deal. ""As long as a basic deal is struck that avoids a no-deal scenario, that would help sentiment,"" Madden said.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",U.S. in talks with Huawei CFO Meng on resolving criminal charges: source,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are discussing a deal with lawyers for Huawei finance chief Meng Wanzhou to resolve criminal charges against her, a person familiar with the matter said, signaling a potential end to a case that has strained ties between the United States, China and Canada.
Negotiations between Meng's attorneys and the U.S. Justice Department picked up after the U.S. presidential election a month ago, the person said, but it is still unclear what kind of deal could be struck. 
Meng, 48, was arrested in Canada in December 2018 on a U.S. warrant. She faces bank fraud charges for allegedly misleading  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, which was subject to U.S. sanctions.
Meng does not think she did anything wrong and so is reluctant to make admissions that she does not think are true, the person said. Further negotiations are expected to take place on Friday, the person said. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported on a possible deal. It said the case might be resolved with a ""deferred prosecution agreement"" under which Meng would admit to some of the allegations against her and prosecutors would defer and later drop the charges if she cooperated. 
In the case, which was filed in New York, Huawei and Meng are accused of conspiring to defraud HSBC and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei's relationship with Skycom Tech Co Ltd, a suspected front company that operated in Iran. 
Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner, but U.S. prosecutors said it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei's Iran business. 
U.S. authorities say Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system. The charges against the company include violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
The source said the negotiations do not appear to be part of a larger deal with Huawei, which was hit with additional charges in the case in February, including conspiring to steal trade secrets from six U.S. technology companies.
U.S. Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi declined to comment. Huawei also declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing that Meng was innocent and that the U.S. had ""choreographed"" the case to contain Chinese high-tech companies, without commenting directly on the reports. 
""We urge the U.S. to drop this extradition warrant and arrest order on Ms Meng and we urge the Canadian side to release her and allow her to return to China at an early date,"" she said. 
Shares in Huawei's greater China suppliers, such as Wus Printed Circuit Kunshan, Shennan Circuits and Hon Hai Precision Industry, rose after the news, bucking a broader retreat in the market.
'END THIS NIGHTMARE' 
The Trump administration has targeted Huawei's business worldwide in an effort to thwart its ambitions to supply next generation 5G networks. 
In pressuring other countries to bar Huawei from their cellular networks, the United States said it was worried its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. The company has repeatedly denied the allegation. 
Meng is due back in British Columbia Supreme Court on Monday as she fights extradition to the United States. 
If she were to admit wrongdoing, the Trump administration could claim victory in a thorny dispute with China, and relieve the pressure on Canada, which has found itself in the cross fire of the U.S.-China trade war.
After Meng's arrest, China cut off imports of canola seed from Canada and detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, for alleged spying. They remain behind bars.
""Ottawa has been pressing Washington to try to come and help us in any way possible, and this would be a great way to end this nightmare,"" former Canadian ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 
Reuters broke news of the bank fraud charges two years ago and exclusively reported last year on how an internal HSBC probe helped lead to the charges against Huawei and Meng. 
The U.S. sanctions investigation was spurred by Reuters reports more than six years ago that detailed the close ties between Huawei and Skycom.

​ U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters after Meng's arrest in 2018 that he would intervene in the case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China. Meng's lawyers expressed concern at the time that she was a pawn.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mostly higher Friday, helped by increasing confidence of a U.S. stimulus package that is reinforcing the positive sentiment generated by the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded largely flat, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.7%. 
Global stock markets have seen strong gains over the last few weeks, helped by investor optimism that vaccine developments will support a global recovery in 2021. Adding to the confidence is the idea that a bipartisan, $908 billion coronavirus relief plan is gaining traction in the U.S. Congress. 
On top of fiscal support, the European Central Bank is widely expected to increase its bond buying next week and the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to adjust its guidance around its asset purchase scheme later in December.
Earlier Friday, German industrial orders rose more than expected in October, rising by 2.9% on the month, while September's figure was upwardly revised to an increase of 1.1%. 
"" The increase at the start of Q4 lifted the level of new orders to 0.8% above its pre-virus level, pointing to significant upside to manufacturing production, which was still languishing some 10% below its pre-Covid level at the end of Q3,"" said Claus Vistesen, an analyst with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in emailed comments.
Talks between the EU and U.K. negotiators to secure a Brexit deal have continued Friday, but a U.K. government source warned chances for a breakthrough were receding while France said it would veto any deal if it is considered unsatisfactory to French interests.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",Europe set to tiptoe into SPAC-land as shell company deal pipeline builds,"By Clara Denina , Abhinav Ramnarayan and Arno Schuetze
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - After watching from the sidelines as a boom in the listing of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) reshaped U.S. capital markets, Europe is preparing to play catch up next year with around 10 such deals said to already be in the pipeline.
SPACs are shell companies that use the proceeds from going public to buy another company, not yet identified at the time of listing. The resulting merger with a target company, often a start-up in a high-growth sector, offers it a faster and lower cost way to market than a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
Boosting the profile of a previously niche product, notable U.S. deals this year have included April's merger between online sports betting company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Diamond Eagle Acquisition, and June's merger between electric truck maker Nikola and VectoIQ Acquisition Corp. 
While $63 billion has been raised through 190 SPAC listings in the United States this year, according to Refinitiv data, by investors including Bill Ackman and Michael Klein, it has been slim pickings in Europe. Small cash shells priced in London and Amsterdam but the only attempt at a major deal -- Martin Franklin's $750 million The Harvester Holdings -- was cancelled due to a lack of demand.
There was a glimmer of hope this week though when French telecoms magnate Xavier Niel and banker Matthieu Pigasse said they were looking to raise at least 250 million euros ($299.65 million) via a SPAC that will scour for sustainable and organic food companies that source locally.
Three banking sources working on potential SPAC deals told Reuters that a successful transaction could trigger a spate of issuance, with up to 10 SPACs in line to raise about $300 million on average. 
They said listings destined for Europe tended to be focused on the healthcare, technology and consumer sectors, with Euronext's exchanges in France, the Netherlands and Southern Europe set to see the most activity. 
Saadi Soudavar, co-head of equity capital markets (ECM) at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in EMEA said a ""decent"" pipeline of European SPAC deals was building for next year, without giving further details. 
He added that a successful merger, or so-called ""de-SPAC-ing"", phase in the United States would likely free up additional capital and give further confidence to U.S. and European investors that such vehicles are a viable alternative to traditional IPOs.
Niel's 2MX Organic could target a first purchase in France as soon as 2021, ideally worth around 2 billion euros, and then expand by buying more companies, two sources said.
FEE BOOST
For European ECM bankers, a surge in SPAC deals would mean a fee boost. On average, banking fees for European IPOs stand at 3.4% of the deal value, while a SPAC would generate around 4.6%, paid in full at the merger stage, according to Refinitiv data.
So far, bankers say European SPACs have been hindered by a less flexible regulatory environment compared to the United States -- where investors are typically allowed to redeem their shares if they don't want to back the acquired company -- and by a poor track record.
""It is legally more difficult to set up a SPAC in Germany and in some parts of Europe due to the legal structuring question - whether you are building a company or an investment fund - which comes with its own set of regulations"", said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s Joachim von der Goltz, head of ECM Northern Europe.
SPACs led by European investors and targeting European companies, such as the one recently launched by private equity fund Investindustrial, have ditched European exchanges to list in New York, where investors are more familiar with the product.
""European investors would rather have an ability to take a view on the vehicle they will invest in to be sure they can place their trust in the management teams,"" said Darrell Uden, global co-head ECM Europe at RBC Capital Markets.
""The rapid evolution and success of SPACs in the U.S. and expectations of a more conducive regulatory environment in some European countries are likely to facilitate the launch of European SPAC listings in coming months.""

532,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 02:06AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Largely Higher; U.S. Stimulus Gains Traction,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely higher Friday, helped by increasing confidence of a U.S. stimulus package that is reinforcing the positive sentiment generated by the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%, while the CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1%.
Global stock markets have seen strong gains over the last few weeks, helped by investor optimism that vaccine developments will support a global recovery in 2021. The U.K. is set to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine as early as next week. 
Adding to the confidence is the idea that a bipartisan, $908 billion coronavirus relief plan is gaining traction in the U.S. Congress. This potential deal was endorsed by Democrat leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released his own smaller plan, but he did see “hopeful signs” for reaching a relief agreement before the end of the year.
On top of fiscal support, the European Central Bank is widely expected to increase its bond buying next week and the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to adjust its guidance around its asset purchase scheme later in December.
Elsewhere, talks between the EU and U.K. negotiators to secure a Brexit deal continued, although a U.K. government source warned chances for a breakthrough were receding.
Looking at economic data Friday, German factory orders increased by 2.9% in October, a rebound from September’s revised 1.1%, but the major release will be the monthly U.S. official employment report. This is expected to show an addition of 469,000 jobs for November, a slowdown from the 638,000 seen in October. 
Oil prices gained Friday after a group of leading producers agreed to continue restricting production given the severe hit to demand in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, a group known as OPEC+, agreed Thursday to ease production cuts by 500,000 barrels per day from January 2021, backing down from the original plans to raise output by 2 million barrels a day.
The group will also meet once a month to review conditions, but stated that any monthly increases will not be greater than 500,000 barrels per day. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $46.28 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.6% to $49.51, with the two benchmarks heading for their fifth consecutive week of gains.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,846.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2155, having hit a new 31-month high overnight.

""We take our role as a provider of mission-critical technology seriously and apologise to ASX, its customers and all those impacted"", Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said.
Australia's central bank and corporate regulator had expressed concerns over bourse operator ASX Ltd's trading systems after the glitch halted trade on Nov. 16.
ASX and its technology provider Nasdaq said they had identified the root cause of the outage as a software issue that caused incorrect functionality in the tailor made combinations (TMC) order book.
TMC is a tool primarily used by retail and institutional traders of equity derivatives which enable the trading of multiple options in one transaction, the companies said.

ASX said it plans to reintroduce some TMC functionality on Dec. 21.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Thursday asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to designate its ride-hail and delivery drivers as non-health essential workers entitled to early COVID-19 vaccine distribution.
The company, in a letter to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said its drivers provided critical transportation for essential workers and allowed others to stay home and order food.
""Early access to a vaccine would help drivers and delivery people continue to play their essential role while also reducing the risk that they may inadvertently contract, or possibly transmit, the virus,"" said the letter, signed by Uber's head of federal affairs, Danielle Burr.
The letter comes as several industry groups, including in the food production, agricultural, consumer goods and trucking industry, are asking officials to prioritize their workers for early vaccine distribution.
U.S. government officials have said that up to 20 million people could be vaccinated by the end of 2020, but that it would take until the middle of 2021 for most Americans to gain access to effective inoculation.

536,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Top AI ethics researcher says Google fired her; company denies it,"By Paresh Dave and Jeffrey Dastin
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - A top Google scientist on ethical artificial intelligence says she was fired after criticizing the company's diversity efforts, a claim the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit disputed on Thursday, in the latest brush-up between the internet giant and worker activists.
Timnit Gebru, who is Black, said on Twitter she was fired on Wednesday after sending an email to colleagues expressing frustration over gender diversity within Google's AI unit and questioning whether company leaders reviewed her work more stringently than that of people from different backgrounds. Gebru co-founded the nonprofit Black in AI that aims to increase representation of people of color in artificial intelligence and co-authored a landmark paper on bias in facial analysis technology. 
Jeff Dean, head of Google's AI unit, told staff in an email reviewed by Reuters that Gebru had threatened to resign unless she was told which colleagues deemed a draft paper she wrote was unpublishable, a demand Dean rejected. 
""We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google,"" Dean wrote in the email, adding, ""we all genuinely share Timnit's passion to make AI more equitable and inclusive.""
Gebru said in a series of Twitter posts that Google cut her off from its systems without warning or conversation with her about her concerns.
Gebru's abrupt departure adds to years of angst, including several resignations and firings, in the AI department and other organizations at Google over diversity and whether the company's efforts to minimize the potential harms of its services are sufficient.
More than 150 employees expressed support for Gebru, demanding Google strengthen its commitment to academic freedom and explain why it chose to ""censor"" her paper, according to a petition posted online. Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP's Legal Defense and Educational Fund, wrote on Twitter that Gebru's firing was ""absolutely infuriating"" and ""a disaster.""
Just Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint accusing Google of unlawfully monitoring and questioning several workers who were then fired for protesting against company policies and trying to organize a union. 
Gebru's paper contended that technology companies could do more to ensure AI systems aimed at mimicking human writing and speech do not exacerbate historical gender biases and use of offensive language, according to a draft copy seen by Reuters. 
In his email to staff, Dean said the paper had not been given to the company for review in a timely fashion and was submitted to a conference without Google's permission. 
He also took issue with some of its conclusions, which he said relied on outdated concerns, including about the environmental impact of large numbers of computers crunching data. 
Responding to the company's rejection of her work, Gebru wrote on Twitter last week: ""Nothing like a bunch of privileged White men trying to squash research by marginalized communities for marginalized communities by ordering them to STOP with ZERO conversation. The amount of disrespect is incredible."" 
Google declined to comment on her departure beyond Dean's email, which was first reported by tech news site Platformer. 
Gebru previously worked at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Research, and she co-authored a widely cited 2018 paper that found higher error rates in facial analysis technology for women with darker skin tones.

Her new paper, co-authored with non-Google staff, is still expected to be presented at a computer science conference in March, according a person familiar with the matter.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s Warner Bros studio will debut all of its 2021 films in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service on the same day, the company said on Thursday, an unprecedented shift that hammered shares of struggling cinema operators.
The movies, which are expected to include ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" and ""The Suicide Squad,"" will be available on HBO Max for one month starting on the same day they hit theaters, the studio said in a statement.
""Mortal Kombat,"" a new version of ""Dune"" and a ""Matrix"" sequel also are scheduled to follow the new release pattern.
Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), the world's largest theater operator fell almost 16%, and rival Cinemark dropped about 22%. AT&T shares closed up slightly.
The change, led by WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, was the most aggressive move to date to bring movies into homes sooner, and it sent a shock across Hollywood. Theaters have long resisted attempts by studios to shorten the time that cinemas can offer new movies exclusively.
Kilar, a former Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) executive and the founding CEO of Hulu, took over AT&T's media division in May and has restructured businesses to focus on HBO Max, the company's new competitor to Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Warner Bros executives said the strategy was prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, which has limited moviegoing and kept many cinemas closed, and would stay in effect for one year.
""We know new content is the lifeblood of theatrical exhibition, but we have to balance this with the reality that most theaters in the U.S. will likely operate at reduced capacity throughout 2021,"" said Ann Sarnoff, chair and CEO of WarnerMedia Studios and Networks Group.
For consumers, watching at home could cost less than a trip to the theater. HBO Max charges $15 a month, while the average cost of two movie tickets in the United States reached $18.32 in 2019, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. 
Cinema operators did not embrace the plan. AMC CEO Adam Aron said Warner Bros was sacrificing profits at its movie studio to boost HBO Max, adding: ""we will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do so at our expense.""
""We will aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business,"" Aron said in a statement.
A Cinemark representative said Warner Bros had not shared details of its plan and it would make near-term booking decisions ""on a film-by-film basis."" 
Theater chains have been devastated by the pandemic and forced to lay off workers and borrow funds to stay afloat. Smaller chains are lobbying for U.S. government aid.
Cinemark and AMC have reached agreements with Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Universal Pictures to show films that will be made available for home viewing as soon as 17 days after they reach theaters. 

Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co has moved some movies from theaters to its Disney+ streaming service. The company is expected to unveil details about its streaming plans on Dec. 11.

539,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 06:36PM ET</span>",Oil Set for Fifth Weekly Advance After OPEC+ Compromise Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil held onto a fifth weekly gain after OPEC and its allies reached a compromise deal to gradually taper output curbs following a week of acrimonious deliberations.
Futures in New York were little changed, after rising 0.8% on Thursday to the highest closing level in more than a week. OPEC+ ministers reached an agreement for the cartel to add 500,000 barrels a day to the market in January. The group will now hold monthly consultations to determine how to adjust production in subsequent months, a delegate said, asking not to be named because the information was private.
The market had widely expected OPEC+ to extend current production cuts by a quarter, although the oil futures curve is suggesting that additional output is needed. Brent’s nearest futures are at a premium to later ones, a structure known as backwardation that indicates tight supply. Meanwhile, the December 2021-December 2022 spreads for both West Texas Intermediate and Brent have recently moved to backwardation and furthered their rally on Thursday.
The OPEC+ compromise deal comes following a clash earlier in the week between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on next year’s output plans. Maintaining the delicate balance the oil market finds itself in has been a complex task, with demand recovering at varying speeds worldwide and prospects for a vaccine buoying the outlook further out even as near-term risks persist.
Any adjustments to tapering oil production cuts can be in any direction, with a potential decision based on all factors, both negative and positive, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said at a news conference following Thursday’s OPEC+ meeting.
Adding to oil’s bullish tone were signs that Democrats and Republicans are moving closer to agreeing another round of fiscal stimulus to lift the pandemic-hit economy ahead of a widespread vaccine rollout. While talks remain at an impasse that’s lasted since the summer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday it was “heartening” that Democrats embraced a smaller price tag for a stimulus package without giving any indication he was willing to raise his own offer to get a deal.

Conditions for the oil and gas companies currently operating in Danish waters will remain unchanged until production stops in 2050. The decision will cost the country about 13 billion kroner ($2.1 billion), according estimates by the energy ministry.
Denmark expects to produce 83,000 barrels of oil in 2020 and natural gas equivalent to 21,000 barrels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci apologized on Thursday for casting doubt on the rigor of the British regulators who approved the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) vaccine against COVID-19, saying he had faith in the quality of their work.
Britain announced the approval of the vaccine on Wednesday, with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) saying it had rigorously assessed the vaccine data and had cut no corners.
It gave the UK the jump in the race to begin mass inoculation against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally and hammered the world economy. U.S. and European Union regulators are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have yet to give their approval.
In a CBS interview on Thursday, Fauci suggested the British regulators had failed to scrutinize the data carefully enough and had waved the vaccine through - comments that were prominently reported on the main British TV news channels.
He later gave an interview to the BBC in which he said his earlier comments had come out wrong.
""There really has been a misunderstanding, and for that I'm sorry, and I apologize for that,"" he said. ""I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community in the UK,"" Fauci said.
""I did not mean to apply any sloppiness (to the UK regulatory process), even though it came out that way,"" he added.
Fauci said the point he had been trying to make was that in the U.S. context, with widespread vaccine scepticism, it would not have been appropriate to conduct the process in the same way and at the same speed as what happened in Britain.
""If we had for example approved it yesterday or tomorrow, there likely would have been pushback on an already scrutinising society,"" he said.
""You know, at the end of the day, it's going to be safe, it's going to be effective, the people in the UK are going to receive it and they're going to do really well, and the people in the United States are going to receive it and we're going to do pretty well,"" Fauci said.
In response to his earlier criticism, the MHRA issued a statement saying it had ""rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible without compromising the thoroughness of our review"".
The regulator also said its emergency approval had allowed ""some stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed, but it does not mean steps and the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been bypassed"".
Fauci is the most high-profile member of the White House coronavirus task force and has often clashed with President Donald Trump on how to protect Americans from the virus, which has caused about 273,000 U.S. deaths.

President-elect Joe Biden said on Thursday he had asked Fauci to be the chief medical adviser on his COVID-19 team when he takes office on Jan. 20. [nW1N2HQ0GG]

542,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",Vitol pays $164 million to resolve U.S. allegations of oil bribes in Latin America,"By Tom Hals, Gram Slattery and Julia Payne
(Reuters) - Vitol Group's U.S. subsidiary agreed to pay $164 million to resolve probes by the U.S. government that the energy trader paid bribes in Brazil and other countries to boost its oil trading business, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. 
Under a three-year deferred prosecution agreement, the Swiss trading firm admitted guilt and agreed to improve internal reporting and compliance functions.
Vitol, run out of London, is the world's largest independent oil trader, trading some 8 million barrels of oil a day.
""Vitol paid bribes to government officials in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico to win lucrative business contracts and obtain competitive advantages to which they were not fairly entitled,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. 
The energy trader will pay the Department of Justice (DOJ) a criminal penalty of $135 million to resolve the probes. Brazilian authorities will receive $45 million from that amount.
Vitol will also pay back the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over $12.7 million in ill-gotten gains, plus $16 million in fines, according to the DOJ statement. 
""Vitol is committed to upholding the law and does not tolerate corruption or illegal business practices. As recognised by the authorities, Vitol has cooperated extensively throughout this process,"" Vitol CEO Russell Hardy said in a statement.
Brazilian police have for years been investigating several major companies for the alleged use of bribes to win contracts with state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), as part of the wide-ranging 'Car Wash' probe.
In October, police expanded the investigation at Petrobras based in part on secret recordings made by a former executive of Vitol, according to court documents. 
Vitol and its co-conspirators paid over $8 million to at least four Petrobras officials between 2005 and 2014, the DOJ said. In an effort to hide the schemes, the company used ""sham"" consulting agreements, shell companies, and fake invoices with its co-conspirators, who in turn communicated with code names like 'Batman', 'Dolphin' and 'Tiger.' 
Petrobras said in a statement that it had assisted prosecutors with dozens of investigations into alleged corruption involving employees.
ECUADOR AND MEXICO
Vitol also admitted to bribing or agreeing to pay over $2 million to officials in Ecuador and Mexico in other to secure and retain business there for oil products, according to the DOJ statement.
Prosecutors said the bribes went to employees at Mexico's state-run Pemex and Ecuadorian state oil company Petroecuador.
Petroecuador and Pemex did not respond to requests for comment.
Brazilian prosecutors announced in late 2018 that they were investigating Petrobras' oil deals with trading houses, including the world's biggest oil traders - Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY).
In early 2019, the DOJ opened its own probe into the three company's dealings in Brazil. The FBI investigated two key Vitol executives who were overseeing the region during those years, including the head of Vitol's U.S. arm, Michael ""Mike"" Loya, who retired earlier this year.
Loya did not immediately respond to a message sent to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) account. 
Trafigura said no charges had been brought against any Trafigura company or its current management. Glencore declined to comment. 

Brazilian prosecutors charged two former Trafigura employees, including a former board member, in late 2018 over allegations of paying bribes to Petrobras employees.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) LLC funds posted strong gains in November to extend year-to-date returns into the double digits after the billionaire investor overhauled his portfolio and the firm a few months ago.
The Third Point Offshore Fund gained 9.1% in November and is now up 12.3% for the year, while the Third Point Ultra fund gained 12.1% last month and is now up 14.2%, according to a performance update seen by an investor. 
The gains were fueled mainly by investments in credit as well as fundamental equity bets, particularly in the media and internet and enterprise technology sectors.
Loeb added stocks including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) during the year. During the third quarter he trimmed the stakes in Amazon and Disney slightly, regulatory filings show. 
The gains represent a dramatic swing coming only months after Third Point was caught off-guard by the coronavirus and massive market sell-off to end the first quarter with double-digit losses. The Offshore fund lost 16% while the Ultra fund was down 21% at the end of the first quarter.
Third Point, which now oversees $14.8 billion in assets, has always had a flexible investment mandate and while the firm has been known for some of its recent large activist bets, Loeb shifted course some this year.
In May, he took back the reins from Munib Islam who had been promoted to co-chief investment officer last year and had largely been the face of Third Point's activism positions, including a bet this year on Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Plc.
Activism, which Third Point also calls constructivism, weighed on returns this year, the source said.
Third Point is handily outperforming the average hedge fund, which gained only 1.2% in the first ten months of 2020, according to Hedge Fund Research data. More recent data is not yet available.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A potential wave of bankruptcies and a collapse in the commercial real estate market in the United States could weigh heavily on smaller banks, a regulatory panel said on Thursday in an assessment of risks to financial stability from the pandemic.
The annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council urged regulators to remain vigilant for weaknesses across markets, pointing to March turmoil in short-term funding markets as an example of where problems can flare up. 
Thursday's report was the first from the panel, which is comprised of the heads of the major U.S. financial regulators, since the novel coronavirus upended the global economy and will be the last issued by President Donald Trump's administration.
The Treasury Department-led council will be taken over in January by President-elect Joe Biden's administration, which is likely to take a more cautious, tougher stance on safety and soundness issues.
Some risks flagged by the panel include record high levels of corporate debt, including nearly $2 trillion in non-financial debt that has been downgraded by rating agencies since March. A growing number of bankruptcy filings could stress court systems, making it harder to restructure debt and forcing more firms to liquidate, it said.
The panel also warned of ""potentially significant structural vulnerabilities"" in short-term wholesale funding markets, including money market funds, citing extreme March turmoil in those markets that required government intervention.
While noting that large banks had weathered the pandemic relatively well, the report recommended regulators ensure the largest institutions maintain sufficient capital and liquidity. 

The report cited the significant build-up in capital and liquidity cushions banks had made during the past decade as a main reason they have so far been able to weather the stress of the last year.

Investing.com - Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) lifted guidance for fourth-quarter comparable-store sales but reported a mixed third-quarter performance as earnings beat, but revenue fell of Wall Street expectations as stores temporarily closed due to COVID-19.
Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) fell more than 6% following the report.
""While it is difficult to predict future impacts of the pandemic on demand this holiday season, we have increased our sales expectations for the fourth quarter and now anticipate comparable store sales will decline in the range of 12% to 14%,"" the company said.
Comparable sales decreased 8.9% in the quarter, compared with an increase of 3.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. That was better than estimates for a 9.6% decline.
Looking ahead to the full-year 2020, the company said it expects to incur between $180 million and $190 million in PPE and COVID-19 related operating costs, and lowered its capital spending forecast to be between $150 million and $160 million, compared to the previous expectation of between $180 million and $200 million.
""Today, we reported financial results that exceeded our expectations as we continue to navigate a year of uncertainties with agility and strength,"" the company said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of hospitalized U.S. coronavirus patients surpassed 100,000 on Thursday, as former presidents volunteered to get vaccinated on television if needed to boost confidence in the safety of inoculations that promise to slow the raging pandemic.
With COVID-19 threatening to produce a 9/11-like death toll of 3,000 per day over the next two months, and nearly 200,000 new U.S. cases reported on Wednesday, U.S. healthcare officials are running out of tools to constrain the virus.
Vaccines offer a ray of hope, with two promising candidates poised to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this month. But inoculations face opposition from significant numbers of Americans who reject medical science, as well as from those wary of the safety of vaccines developed at record speed.
A Gallup poll released Nov. 17, found 58% of Americans say they would get a COVID-19 vaccine, up from 50% in September. That is still not enough, experts say, to achieve widespread immunity.
Moreover, many Americans still refuse to follow even basic public health guidance such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds.
But former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have volunteered to get their COVID-19 shots on television to promote their safety, according to aides to Bush and Clinton and an Obama interview on Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) radio. 
""I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science,"" Obama said in the interview that aired on Thursday.
At least one former skeptic said she and her husband would take the vaccine, given the surge in infections and her high blood pressure and age, which increase the risk of severe illness.
""I didn't think I'd say this but right now, yeah, I absolutely would,"" said Nina Lyons, 65, a retiree living in Pittsburgh. ""I trust it. And if there's repercussions along down the line I am going say that it's worth taking that risk.""
A U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel of outside advisers will meet on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to recommend emergency use authorization of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine. U.S. health officials predict the first inoculations could start days or weeks later.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's vaccine is expected to be reviewed on Dec. 17. Both vaccines proved highly effective at preventing illness in large clinical trials. Several other COVID-19 vaccines are also in later stages of development.
SOBERING DATA
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates, who has tackled public health problems through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said he would get inoculated and hoped more people would shed their vaccine skepticism.
""Whatever my place in line rightly is, I will immediately step up and take the vaccine,"" he told NBC News in an interview that aired on Thursday. ""They're all good vaccines."" 
He noted that vaccinating the public would be ""tricky"" without a national plan, and criticized the administration of outgoing President Donald Trump, who has yet to articulate an effective strategy to contain the virus beyond promoting vaccine development. 
The Republican president has largely avoided the subject for months aside from touting vaccines. His few public appearances since the Nov. 3 election have been aimed at overturning the victory of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who will assume office on Jan. 20.
Meanwhile, the toll from COVID-19 reached its second-highest level ever on Wednesday with 2,811 lives lost, according to a Reuters tally, one short of the record set April 15.
The sobering data came as Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Wednesday warned that December, January and February were likely to be ""the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.""
The United States could start losing around 3,000 people - roughly the number that died in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 - each day over the next two months.

""Before we see February, we could be close to 450,000 Americans that have died from this virus,"" Redfield said. The U.S. death toll since the start of the pandemic stands at around 273,000.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. passenger and cargo airline industry saw total employment fall by nearly 29,000 workers through the month ending in mid-October as government restrictions on laying off staff expired.
The U.S. Transportation Department said U.S. airlines employed 673,278 workers in mid-October, which was 81,749 fewer than in March when U.S. travel demand started falling dramatically due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
The department said that since March, United Airlines had reduced its workforce by 32%, or 29,243 employees, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) eliminated 32% of its jobs, affecting 28,751 employees.
In October, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines said they were furloughing more than 32,000 workers after the prior $25 billion payroll assistance program expired on Sept. 30.
The U.S. airline industry is still losing billions of dollars a month as travel demand remains down more than 60% and recent coronavirus travel advisories have discouraged holiday travel.
Delta said Thursday it expects a cash burn of about $12 million to $14 million per day in the fourth quarter as slowing demand amid a spike in COVID-19 cases adds about $2 million per day to its burn rate.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that he backs another $20 billion in additional government payroll support for airlines that could help tens of thousands of workers return to payrolls.
Passenger carriers have made steep cuts even as cargo carriers have added workers.

The government report said American Airlines had shrunk its payroll by 18,262 employees, or 17%, to 90,846, while Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)' had fallen 6% to 58,134.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday said  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s lawsuit to recoup some of the nearly $900 million it mistakenly paid Revlon Inc's lenders appeared on track for trial next week after receiving assurances he had authority to conduct it.
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan had late Wednesday said he could not be sure all the defendants were citizens of different states than the bank's South Dakota-based Citibank unit, a jurisdictional requirement for the planned Dec. 9 nonjury trial.
But at a hearing, lawyers for Citigroup and the defendants said they were making substantial progress on that issue, and confident at least most defendants could stay in the case.
""I'm relieved in that it seems like it won't blow up the trial on this issue,"" Furman said.
The lawsuit stemmed from Citigroup's having on Aug. 11 sent $893 million of its own money, rather than a $7.8 million interest payment, to Revlon's lenders.
Citigroup was acting as the loan agent for the struggling cosmetics company, which lacked sufficient cash to fully repay the loan, which was due in 2023.
The bank blamed human error for the blunder, and said the defendants knew the payment was a mistake but have nonetheless refused to return $508 million. It said about 200 lenders have returned the remaining $385 million.
But the defendants, including Brigade Capital Management and HPS Investment Partners, said they were not obligated to return money Revlon owed, and had no reason to believe a global bank such as Citigroup would transfer the full amount by accident.
Some defendants also said they thought Revlon's controlling shareholder, billionaire Ronald Perelman, would never let Revlon fail, and might have stepped in to bail the company out as he had done before.
A trial is expected to last four days.

The case is In re: Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-06539.

(Reuters) - U.S. oil major  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) on Thursday cut billions off its long-term capital and exploratory budget even after a major restructuring of its operations as it tries to ride out a collapse in oil prices and preserve its dividend.
Oil majors have written off around $80 billion in asset values this year, cut output and laid off thousands of staff to save money in the face of a sharp decline in oil demand and revenue.
Chevron said it expects total capital and exploratory budget through 2025 to be between $14 billion and $16 billion, well below the prior forecast of up to $22 billion.
Its move to restrain spending on new oil projects, hold outlays flat next year and cut about $6 billion from last forecast was a sign it expects low energy prices for years.
The reduction came despite the addition of massive projects in the United States, Middle East and Africa, acquired by Chevron as part of a $4.1 billion purchase of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL).
Detailing its 2021 budget of $14 billion, the company said it will spend $11.5 billion on exploration and production and $2.1 billion for refining related operations.
Chevron's 2021 Permian basin spending of $2 billion is half of what it planned at the start of 2020 and lower than 2019 levels of $3.6 billion, said Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets, adding that the company has been true to its recent message of ""lower for longer capex"".
Despite the cut to the overall budget, the company said starting 2022 it was likely to raise investments in the Permian basin and the Gulf of Mexico, helped by an anticipated drop in capital needed for a Kazakhstan project.
In contrast with Chevron, which has been praised for its capital discipline, its U.S. rival  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Monday said by 2025, it will boost expenditures above this year's $23 billion level.

Chevron shares were up about 1% at $90.72 in early morning trade.

LONDON (Reuters) - More than 400 lawmakers from 34 countries have signed a letter to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) boss Jeff Bezos backing a campaign that claims the tech giant has ""dodged and dismissed … debts to workers, societies, and the planet,"" organisers said.
The ""Make Amazon Pay"" campaign was launched on Nov. 27 - the annual Black Friday shopping bonanza - by a coalition of over 50 organisations, with demands including improvements to working conditions and full tax transparency.
The letter's signatories include U.S. Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, former UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Vice President of the European Parliament Heidi Hautala, co-convenors Progressive (NYSE:PGR) International and UNI Global Union said.
""We urge you to act decisively to change your policies and priorities to do right by your workers, their communities, and our planet,"" the letter said. 
""We stand ready to act in our respective legislatures to support the movement that is growing around the world to Make Amazon Pay.""
Amazon, the world's biggest retailer, has faced criticism for its tax practices before, including in the UK and the EU. It says its profits remain low given retail is a highly competitive, low margin business and it invests heavily. 
It said on Thursday that while it accepted scrutiny from policymakers, many of the matters raised in the letter stemmed from misleading assertions.
""Amazon has a strong track record of supporting our employees, our customers, and our communities, including providing safe working conditions, competitive wages and great benefits,"" it said, adding it was ""paying billions of dollars in taxes globally."" The company has also pledged to be net carbon neutral by 2040.
Amazon grew rapidly during the pandemic, with sales soaring as restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus closed bricks-and-mortar shops and sent consumers online.
Governments worldwide are considering tougher rules for big tech to assuage worries about competition.
The European Union, for example, last month charged Amazon with damaging retail competition, alleging it used its size, power and data to gain an unfair advantage over smaller merchants that sell on its online platform.
Amazon disagreed with the EU assertions, saying it represented less than 1% of the global retail market and there were larger retailers in every country in which it operated.

558,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Biden’s White House Team Delights His Fans on Wall Street,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street has spent years wondering how closely the next Democrat to occupy the White House would listen to the industry. As President-elect Joe Biden builds his administration, the reaction across the financial landscape is relief.
Biden’s supporters in the business, Democrats as well as some Republicans, are satisfied and in some cases jubilant as he starts filling his White House and other posts, even though he hasn’t given key perches to billionaires or financial titans such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s Jamie Dimon or BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). co-founder Larry Fink.
The Biden team is poised to include alumni of finance, venture capital, private equity and asset management. And Janet Yellen, who would be the first woman to run the Treasury, is seen as a consensus pick. That’s enough to placate the finance industry, according to interviews with executives and billionaires.
“Everybody I’ve talked to, including people on Wall Street, seem very delighted with the selections,” said Bruce Heyman, a former partner at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). “Nobody has said to me that this is really disappointing. In fact, it’s the opposite. They’ve just said, ‘This is great.’”
Heyman, who was President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Canada and bundled donations for Biden, said he was less concerned with an official’s Wall Street ties than competence and experience. “The markets have told you how they feel. The markets are excited.”
Biden’s chief of staff will be Ron Klain, who helped lead the Obama administration through economic and public-health crises. He’s spent years as a top executive at Revolution, the venture capital firm run by Steve Case, though he’s also been rooted on by progressive House stars Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar.
“President-elect Biden has chosen groundbreaking, experienced nominees and staff who share his values,” said Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for Biden’s team. “They also reflect the diverse, unprecedented coalition -- driven by bringing our nation together -- that won this election.”
Jeff Zients, on leave as head of the Cranemere Group, a holding company that buys businesses, is co-chair of Biden’s transition. He led the Obama administration effort to fix the Obamacare website and may be named to a leadership role on the pandemic, people have told Bloomberg News.
Erika Karp, who founded advisory firm Cornerstone Capital Group after decades inside global banks, said the finance industry is feeling “a grudging hopefulness” about Biden’s team. “For me, it’s kind of smiling, with one eyebrow up. The eyebrow says, ‘Oh, this could be interesting.’”
Even if BlackRock’s Fink remains out of the picture, at least two recent colleagues are in it. Adewale Adeyemo, Biden’s choice to be deputy Treasury secretary, was a senior adviser and interim chief of staff to Fink before leaving last year. On Thursday, Biden picked Brian Deese, a current executive and former economic adviser to Obama, to lead the National Economic Council.
Fink or Dimon “would have been able to do a fantastic job,” said Jon Corzine, who ran Goldman Sachs before becoming New Jersey’s governor and a U.S. senator. But that would have alienated progressives, and “there’s plenty of room for people who come with slightly different resumes.” Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman partner, leads President Donald Trump’s Treasury.
Former Biden national security adviser Antony Blinken, tapped to be secretary of state, is on a leave of absence from his stint at Pine Island Capital Partners, according to the private equity firm’s website. John Thain, who ran Merrill Lynch in the run-up toward the financial crisis, is Pine Island’s chairman.
George Walker, who runs Neuberger Berman and is former President George W. Bush’s second cousin, said he was encouraged by Biden’s team so far. “It’s a loss for the country” when executives are stopped from taking White House jobs, he said, and the push against them has “certainly had a chilling effect on individuals’ willingness to serve.”
Hoping for More
Some critics of the industry’s power are less satisfied.
“So far, I’m disappointed,” said Jeremie Greer, an executive director of Liberation in a Generation, a group that advocates for more economic influence for people of color. “It is disappointing that the people in the Biden administration are not implementing a personnel strategy that’s focused on empowering people who currently do not have power.”
Biden’s economic team includes Cecilia Rouse, who would be the first Black woman to head the Council of Economic Advisers, and Neera Tanden, who would be the first Indian-American to run the Office of Management and Budget. Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, two progressive Democrat economists picked to join Rouse, are “a move in the right direction,” Greer said. “But I’d like to see more of it.”

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touched all-time highs on Thursday as investors looked past bleak economic data, while remaining focused on a COVID-19 vaccine, with the blue-chip Dow getting a boost from Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares. 
 Boeing Co  jumped about 7% after budget airline Ryanair ordered 75 additional 737 MAX jets with a list price of $9 billion, throwing a commercial lifeline to the embattled U.S. planemaker.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's 4% gain underpinned the Nasdaq after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to ""buy"" in the run-up to the electric-car maker's addition to the S&P 500.
Earlier in the day, data showed the number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but remained extraordinarily high at 712,000, while a separate survey showed U.S. services industry activity slowed to a six-month low in November.
""Markets are discounting the bad economic news and focusing on a vaccine implementation plan ... they are optimistic that a vaccine will bring a recovery in the second half of next year,"" said Mike Cornacchioli, chief investment strategist at Clarfeld Citizens Private Wealth.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said there was some positive movement in congressional efforts to reach a compromise on a new coronavirus aid bill but gave no hints on when such a deal could be struck.
At 11:38 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 180.08 points, or 0.60% to 30,063.87, the S&P 500 gained 9.03 points, or 0.25% to 3,678.04 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 58.22 points, or 0.47% to 12,407.61. 
Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy sector leading gains. 
The communication services index hit its highest since its creation in 2018.
Progress in developing a working COVID-19 vaccine before the end of the year has driven the Wall Street's main indexes to record levels recently. 
That also helped lift the S&P 1500 airlines index up 6%. Cruise operators Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp jumped 8% and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd surged 9%.
Cloud-security provider Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) Inc surged 25% as it reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and adjusted profit. 
 Waddell & Reed  (NYSE:WDR) Financial surged 49%, extending gains from the previous session, after Australia's Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) announced a deal to buy the wealth manager for $1.7 billion.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.9-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. 

The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and no new low while the Nasdaq recorded 241 new highs and 10 new lows.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbnb, the U.S. home rental company that will make its market debut next week, is making it harder to book apartments on New Year's Eve in Paris, New York, London and other top destinations to limit the risks of illegal parties in the time of COVID-19.
As of Thursday, travellers who don't have positive reviews on their Airbnb profile won't be able to rent a place for a single night on Dec. 31 in the United States, France, Britain, Canada, Mexico, Australia and Spain, the San Francisco-based company said in a statement. 
People planning to spend the last day of the year in properties let through Airbnb will also have to pledge they won't organise any parties on New Year's Eve and they are aware of the legal charges they might face if they fail to abide by the rule, the company said. 
All bookings made under previous conditions will be maintained, Airbnb said. But it added that most single-day reservations aimed at organising large year-end gatherings were usually made in December. 
Last-minute bookings by people seeking to rent a place close to their own home and who haven't received positive reviews will also be restricted, Airbnb said. 
The new temporary rules come on top of previous measures put in place in August, under which Airbnb forbade all parties and gatherings of more than 16 people in its listed flats worldwide to limit the spreading of the novel coronavirus. 
The firm also made it impossible to rent a full home for a single night on Halloween in the United States and Canada to prevent illegal parties.

Airbnb's new restrictions come a few days before its initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq stock market, which it hopes will help it gain a valuation of up to $35 billion.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. meatpacker Smithfield Foods has offered to help health officials distribute COVID-19 vaccines and store them in ultra-cold freezers that are in high demand to support a vaccination campaign, the company's chief administrative officer said on Thursday.
U.S. states, cities, and hospitals are scrambling to buy freezers that can safely store  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine at temperatures of minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 C (36-46 F).
Smithfield, owned by China's WH Group (OTC:WHGLY), has multiple ultra-cold freezers. The company is ""ready and willing to assist health agencies should storage capacity become constrained,"" said Chief Administrative Officer Keira Lombardo. 

""As it becomes more clear that successful vaccines will become available, we have communicated our capabilities and continued willingness to partner with health officials, including with vaccine distribution and storage,"" she said in a statement to Reuters.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>","Russian, Chinese intelligence targeting Norwegian oil secrets: report","OSLO (Reuters) - Russia, China and other countries are using espionage to glean secrets of Norway's petroleum industry and plans by its government to cut or increase production, the Norwegian counterintelligence service PST said.
In a report dated Nov. 5 but published on Thursday, the service warned of possible attempts to recruit sources or hack computers, as in a major cyber attack six years ago, and said renewable energy could become a focus for foreign spies.
""PST expects that the use of economic tools and network operations will increase in the next 18 months,"" it said.
The warning comes less than four months after Norway expelled a Russian diplomat on suspicion of espionage and detained his contact, a Norwegian citizen. 
Risk management and quality assurance consultancy DNV GL has said the Norwegian suspect worked at its oil and gas unit, specialising in 3D printing and materials technology.
Spies are after oil and gas technology which could have both civilian and military uses, commercial secrets and any details of plans by western Europe's largest oil producer for new exploration licenses or regulation of oil production, PST said. 
Norway joined OPEC and allies including Russia in imposing national output cuts after oil prices crashed in April as the COVID-19 pandemic quashed demand. 
While the OPEC+ group is considering whether to extend the curbs into 2021, Norway's oil and energy ministry told Reuters on Tuesday it did not plan to do so.
Oslo could hand out a record number of licenses for exploration in the Arctic Barents Sea next year.
The report said more than 50 Norwegian oil and gas companies including Equinor and the oil and energy ministry had been the subject of a cyber attack in 2014. 
""Russian, Chinese and other countries' intelligence services have large technological and human resources, and they work long-term, purposefully and with a large degree of patience,"" the counterintelligence service said.

Investing.com --  Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) sank 23% after missing estimates and getting a range of price target decreases. 
The software company reported a loss per share of 7 cents, well below the expected earnings per share of 9 cents with sales of $558 million missing the estimated $613 million.
Splunk provided guidance for fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue of between $650 million and $700 million, with negative operating margins. The expectation has been for revenue of $777 million, according to StreetInsider.
Annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the cloud rose 71% from a year earlier, while total ARR increased 44%. for a total $2.07 billion  
Mizuho Securities called the results  “very disappointing,” on the back of the lower than expected bookings and ARR. The firm downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, lowering the price target to $180 from $235, according to StreetInsider.
Mizuho noted the company withdrew 2023 guidance, which had helped support the surge in shares this year, when they hit an all-time high. 
Other firms, including Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) and BTIG also dropped price targets for Splunk.

568,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Ryanair agrees to buy 75 extra 737 MAX jets in boost for Boeing,"By Eric M. Johnson and Conor Humphries
SEATTLE/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Budget airline Ryanair on Thursday ordered 75 additional Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets with a list price of $9 billion, throwing a commercial lifeline to the embattled U.S. planemaker after regulators lifted a 20-month safety ban. The order from the Irish airline, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier and one of Boeing's most important customers, is the largest for the jet since 2018 before two fatal crashes led to its grounding. Boeing shares were up 5.2% on the news.
""This is the beginning of the fulfilment of a more robust order book,"" Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said at a signing event in Washington DC. ""I've always had faith that the order book would begin to fill with the return of the industry."" 
Ryanair already has 135 of the 197-seat MAX 200 on order, and expects to receive its first jet early next year and the final one by the end of 2024. 
""The Boeing MAX is a fabulous aircraft,"" Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said. 
Ryanair did not disclose the price it will pay, but traders say deals typically include discounts in excess of 50% of list prices. 
Ryanair was expected to win an even bigger discount of well over two-thirds in return for a headline-grabbing relaunch of the MAX that helps fill gaps left by cancellations, sources said. 
Part of the discount was compensation for the 18-month delay to the first delivery of the MAX, O'Leary said. He did not say whether a cash sum had also been paid. 
PIVOTAL MOMENT
The order could be a pivotal moment in efforts by Boeing to rehabilitate the MAX, its fastest-selling model before it was grounded in March 2019 following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in which 346 people died.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Ryanair was close to placing an order for up to 75 Boeing jets.
As regulators move to clear the aircraft for flight after revisions to cockpit software and pilot training, executives are hoping for several eye-catching MAX deals that will help put the crisis behind it, sources have said. 
The jet staged its first post-grounding flight with media on board on Wednesday, weeks before the first commercial passenger flight on Dec. 29.
Boeing is also negotiating with airlines including Southwest and Delta and Alaska Airlines, which last month agreed to lease 13 Boeing MAX jets, industry sources have said.
Ryanair has a record of striking deals to lock in low costs when its bargaining power is highest, most famously by placing an order for 100 new 737s at rock-bottom prices in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. 
That deal laid the foundation for its transformation into one of Europe's dominant airlines.

On Thursday Ryanair said it would pass on any lower aircraft costs in lower fares.

The carrier said fourth-quarter revenue could fall to 30% of 2019 levels, which was $11.44 billion.
Meanwhile, Delta is partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to keep international customers informed of potential COVID-19 exposure through contact tracing.
The airline said it will ask customers traveling to the United States from an international location to voluntarily provide five pieces of data to aid contact tracing and public health follow-up efforts beginning Dec. 15.

Earlier in the day,  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) said it expects its load factor for the fourth quarter to average about 70%, despite the slowdown in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Fortune or foresight? AstraZeneca and Oxford's stories clash on COVID-19 vaccine,"By Ludwig Burger, Kate Kelland and Abhirup Roy
LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University have given conflicting accounts of how they came upon the most effective dosing pattern for their COVID-19 vaccine, a rare instance of public dissension between major institutions collaborating on a pivotal project.
The discrepancy, reported for the first time by Reuters, centres on the regimen administered to a smaller group of volunteers in the late-stage trials, of half a dose followed by a full dose. This diverged from the original plan of two full doses, given to the majority of participants.
The half-dose pattern was found to be 90% effective, versus the 62% success rate of the two-full-dose main study, based on interim data.
AstraZeneca's research chief told Reuters 10 days ago, when interim trial data was released, the half-dose was given inadvertently as a first shot to some trial participants, and emerged as a stroke of fortune - ""serendipity"" - that scientists expertly harnessed. 
This narrative was refuted by a leading Oxford University scientist, however, who told Reuters on Monday that the half-dose shot was given deliberately after thorough consultations. 
Uncertainty over how the dosing regimen came about raises questions about the robustness of the data, according to some experts who said it risked slowing down the process of gaining regulatory approval for the shot and denting public confidence.
""These differing accounts are worrying,"" Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, told Reuters. 
""Trust is at a premium when it comes to vaccines and we must not do anything that might in any way undermine it."" 
There is also the potential impact on AstraZeneca, whose shares have underperformed rival vaccine developers that have also announced successful results, partly due to concerns from scientists about the relatively small sample size for the half-dose sub-group that led to the 90% efficacy finding.
AstraZeneca declined to comment about the conflicting accounts.
An Oxford University spokesman said that a media briefing would be held once the detailed interim trial results are peer-reviewed and published in a scientific journal.
""This will be the appropriate time to discuss the complicated intricacies of the global trial design,"" he said.
OXFORD SCIENTIST: 'THAT'S NOT TRUE'
More than 20 countries, including many poorer nations, have ordered the vaccine, which costs less than some rival shots and is easier to distribute. 
The trial data was released on Nov. 23, when developers hailed ""a vaccine for the world"". Hours later, AstraZeneca's head of non-oncology research and development, Mene Pangalos, told Reuters the half-dose schedule had been a case of miscalculated dosing given to some volunteers. 
It came to light, he said, after side effects in some participants turned out to be surprisingly mild. 
""The reason we had the half dose is serendipity,"" he said.
However, professor Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford which co-developed the COVID-19 shot with AstraZeneca and led the UK trials, told Reuters in a phone interview on Monday that it was a conscious decision by researchers to administer a lower dose.
""There had been some confusion suggesting that we didn't know we were giving a half dose when we gave it - that is really not true,"" he said. 
""What we were aware of was that we were using a different batch of a vaccine from a different manufacturer. We knew the measurements on it and we had been in discussions with regulators about how to move forward.""
""The dosing that we started with that new batch, was a half dosing compared to what we had used previously,"" he added, without giving details about the different manufacturer.
Both AstraZeneca and Oxford University scientists said they had consulted health regulators and were given the go-ahead to continue with the half-dose among a limited group of volunteers in Britain, and to follow up with the full-dose booster shot at the scheduled time. 
Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said its rolling review of the vaccine is ongoing and that any vaccine must undergo robust clinical trials in line with international standards.
""No vaccine would be authorised for supply in the UK unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met,"" a spokeswoman said. She did not comment on when the regulator was consulted about the half-dose regimen.
The European Medicines Agency did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
'NEED TO BE CLARIFIED SWIFTLY'
For Oxford's vaccinologists, the confusion is a far cry from last week's euphoria when interim data appeared to vindicate almost three decades of work.
But the conflicting versions of events are the latest twist for the vaccine data, which has drawn scrutiny from scientists and investors since its release.
""Whether or not they are accurate, and whether or not they affect the validity of the data released last week, they need to be clarified swiftly,"" Riley of the University of Edinburgh said of the contradictory accounts.
While U.S. regulators have said a minimum of 50% efficacy for a COVID-19 vaccine to be considered for approval,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer-BioNTech have set a high bar, reporting efficacy data above 90% for their shots.
Independent scientists have expressed concerns that the AstraZeneca-Oxford half-dose group - with just over 2,700 participants - was too small to yield a robust efficacy result. 
That's a fraction of the tens of thousands of participants in trials that resulted in the high efficacy data from Pfizer-BioNTech's and Moderna's vaccines. 
""All we have to go on is a limited data release,"" Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said last week. ""We have to wait for the full data and to see how the regulators view the results,"" he said, adding that U.S. and European watchdogs ""might possibly take a different view"" from each other.
AstraZeneca has lost almost 7 billion pounds ($9.35 billion) in value since the interim trial results amid such worries.
It has said it hopes that more trial data gathered over time in that group will solidify the interim findings. It is also considering a new global trial based on the dosing pattern for added clarity.
Oxford and AstraZeneca say they have submitted their read-out to regulators across the world to seek marketing approval. They say the dosing pattern is also subject to discussions with regulators.

The university said last Friday it supported the idea of further and ongoing trials, but added that the interim analysis had already ""shown the vaccine is highly effective in a global study of 24,000"".

575,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",North American farmers profit as consumers pressure food business to go green,"By Karl Plume and Rod Nickel
CHICAGO/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Beer made from rice grown with less water, rye planted in the off-season and the sale of carbon credits to tech firms are just a few of the changes North American farmers are making as the food industry strives to go green.
The changes are enabling some farmers to earn extra money from industry giants like Cargill,  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) and Anheuser-Busch. Consumers are pressuring food producers to support farms that use less water and fertilizer, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and use more natural techniques to maintain soil quality. 
Investments in sustainability remain a tiny part of overall spending by the agriculture sector, which enjoyed healthy profits in 2020. They may help to head off more costly regulations down the road now that Democratic climate advocate Joe Biden was elected U.S. president.
Some companies, like farm retailer and fertilizer producer Nutrien , are also opening new revenue potential for farmers by monetizing the carbon their fields soak up. The companies say technology is improving measurement and tracking of carbon capture, although some environmental activists question the benefit of such programs and how sequestered greenhouse gas volumes can be verified. 
Sustainable techniques farmers are adopting include refraining from tilling soil at times to preserve carbon. Some are adding an off-season cover crop of rye or grass to restore soil nutrients instead of applying heavy fertilizer loads over the winter that can contaminate local water supplies. 
A study conducted by agriculture technology company Indigo Ag estimated that if U.S. corn, soy and wheat farmers employed no-till and cover crops on 15% of fields, they would generate an additional $600 million by reducing costs, bolstering soil productivity or selling carbon credits.
Indigo has a partnership with brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev NV, which plans to buy 2.6 million bushels of rice this year grown with less water and nitrogen fertilizer than conventional rice. Anheuser-Busch said that is up from 2.2 million bushels last year and accounts for 10% of its U.S. rice supplies. 
Bill Jones, the brewer's manager of raw materials, said farmers voluntarily growing rice with a lower environmental impact along the sensitive Mississippi River would be less disruptive to supplies than having local authorities require such practices by legislating changes to water and nitrogen use.
""We look at supply chain security. I see this gaining traction,"" he said, noting that Minnesota and other U.S. states and conservation districts worried about polluting the Mississippi are already introducing limits on how much manure farmers can spread on fields.Arkansas farmer Carson Stewart used the program for the first time this year, earmarking his entire 340-acre rice crop to Anheuser-Busch. Depending on milling quality, his rice may earn up to $1.50 a bushel more than conventional rice, a premium of about 27%, he said. 
10 MILLION ACRE SHIFT 
While companies expect Washington and Ottawa to grow more committed to funding and regulating sustainable farming, industry sources and activists said widespread adoption remains far off. 
""They come with high up-front costs,"" said Giana Amador, managing director at climate-focused NGO Carbon180. ""We're seeing a huge differentiation in quality among all these corporate commitments.""In September, privately held Cargill Inc said it would help North American farmers shift 10 million acres to regenerative practices during the next 10 years by offering them financial support and training.
Pushed by demand for greener foods from food companies that buy its products, Cargill has already signed up 750 farmers to green programs, representing 300,000 acres, said Ryan Sirolli, Cargill's director of row crop sustainability. With projects like one that pays Iowa farmers to leave soils untilled or to create field buffers to prevent fertilizer runoff, Cargill hopes to cut 30% of its supply chain greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade.
""We've done a lot to stop soil erosion. And we've had a reduction of 538 tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of taking 104 passenger cars off the road,"" said Iowa farmer Lance Lillibridge, who estimates he will earn about $37 an acre in a Cargill pilot project this year.
Environmental groups and consumer activists are sceptical about such corporate sustainability pledges, noting that Cargill has not made good on its promise to eliminate deforestation from supply chains by 2020.
As more premium-paying buyers emerge, more farmers will be enticed into sustainable growing, said Devin Lammers, CEO of Gradable. The unit of input dealer Farmers Business Network matches farmers using sustainable practices with buyers such as Unilever (NYSE:UL),  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and ethanol producer POET. 
CARBON CREDITS
Some farmers are making money by verifying the amount of climate-warming emissions their fields soak up and selling carbon credits to polluting companies seeking to reduce their net emissions. Agribusiness companies call that a double win for farmers as their fields become healthier and they earn extra cash.
This week, Saskatchewan-based Nutrien said it was launching a sustainable agriculture program on 100,000 acres in the United States and Canada, with expansion planned later in South America and Australia.
Nutrien Chief Executive Chuck Magro estimated that farmers will earn an additional $50 per acre in profits under the program - $20 per acre for carbon credits and $30 per acre worth of higher crop yields.
The announcement followed Nutrien's 2018 purchase of digital farming company Agrible, which helps farmers log reduced emissions and water use. Magro said in an interview that the aim is to enable farmers to use that data to sell carbon credits. He noted that previous efforts produced meagre returns that were not worth the effort for farmers who had to wade through hundreds of pages of documents.
Agriculture accounts for 3% of the global carbon credit market, but that looks to grow to 30% by 2050, Magro said. ""We see carbon being the next big agricultural revolution,"" he said.
Matt Coutts, chief investment officer of 100,000-acre Coutts Agro in Saskatchewan, plans to sell carbon credits through Nutrien for up to 10,000 acres per year of canola, lentils and spring wheat. He expects they could eventually generate at least C$75,000 in annual additional revenue.Ohio-based start-up Locus Agricultural Solutions helped Iowa farmer Kelly Garrett create 22,400 tonnes in carbon credits by verifying his fields locked in about 1.4 tonnes per acre from 2015 to 2019. Garrett received a check for 5,000 of those credits in November, after e-commerce platform Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) bought them on the carbon trading marketplace Nori for $75,000.
""The ability to sell our carbon credits through the Nori system and help the rest of the world be more green is a wonderful benefit to our economy and our finances,"" Garrett said.
Still, Nori noted that  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) passed on a deal to buy most of Garrett's remaining credits because they were not verified by on-farm soil tests. Nori deems individual soil tests too costly, and instead verifies its credits based on soil type, crops planted and other data, said Alexsandra Guerra, the company's director of corporate development.
Microsoft declined to comment.Few North American farmers have gone through the vetting process Garrett underwent, which also limits supplies of the high-quality carbon credits that some buyers seek.Some critics say carbon saved from no-till farming can easily escape if the soil is tilled again. ""Statements that soils can sequester all of our emissions and more are overstated ... There's no way we could make that shift fast enough to address the climate crisis,"" said Tara Ritter, senior program associate with the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. 
PAYING UP FRONT 
Despite those doubts, food companies are banking more on carbon capture and regenerative agriculture.  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) offers farmers technical advice while other companies pay growers up front to adopt greener practices.PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), maker of Quaker Oats and Frito-Lay chips, pays farmers $10 an acre to plant cover crops over winter, which can reduce erosion and control weeds and insects.
This helps PepsiCo meet its sustainability targets and secure its food supply, said director of sustainable agriculture Margaret Henry. PepsiCo subsidized cover crops such as rye and radish last year across 50,000 Midwest acres and plans to grow the program further.

Henry pointed to an added benefit: Cover crops soak up excess moisture, making many fields ready for spring planting two weeks earlier than fields that lay fallow.""We want this to be a win win for the long term,"" she said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened in subdued fashion on Thursday, with most of the momentum from the recent vaccine-driven rally having petered out, and with investors wary of buying too early into news of a fiscal stimulus package from a still-divided Congress.
News from the Labor Department that initial jobless claims fell for the first time in three weeks gave only moderate support, but it was enough to push a modestly negative overnight session into the green.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 78 points, or 0.3% at 29,950 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%.
Initial jobless claims totaled 712,000 last week, down from 775,000 the week before, in what is the most up-to-date snapshot of the labor market available. The official labor market report for November, which is due out on Friday and which is expected to show a rise of 459,000 non-farm jobs, only covers the period through the middle of the month.
Of the early movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock gained 3.2% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded its stance to “buy” from “neutral”, raising its price target to $780, reckoning with the more rapid adoption of electric vehicles.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock, meanwhile, rose 0.1% after the oil major cut another $5 billion from its central case scenario for annual capital spending through 2025. Oil and gas stocks in general were overshadowed by a further delay to the start of a key meeting between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, notably Russia. 
The meeting had already been pushed back by two days amid disagreements over whether or not to raise production at the start of next year. 
Elsewhere, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) stock fell 25% after the data-analysis software provider reported a wider loss for the fiscal third quarter, as well as 11% dip in revenue. 
The increase in demand for remote IT services due to the pandemic was also in evidence in positive earnings reports from two cybersecurity companies, Crowdstrike and Secureworks. Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock rose 14.8%, while Secureworks (NASDAQ:SCWX) stock rose 10.5%.
 On the downside, Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock fell 5.8% to an eight-month low after a disappointing quarterly update that accelerated switching out of the defensive grocery store stock.

COVID's effects were evident in Europe on Thursday. The IHS Markit's composite PMI, considered a guide to economic health, sank to 45.3 in November from October's 50.00, the level separating growth from contraction.
But optimism recovered on hopes raised by a vaccine, the IHS Markit survey showed.
Euro zone government bonds held ground on Thursday with Germany's 10-year bund yield down about 1 basis point to -0.53%.
Asian shares were mixed on Thursday after a choppy day of Wall Street trade, thanks in part to a disappointing U.S. jobs report.
Hopes that the pandemic will finally be brought under control sparked a risk-on rally in currency markets with the Australian and New Zealand dollars advancing.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>","Sainsbury's, Asda and Aldi waive tax relief as UK supermarkets hand back $2.3 billion","By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's, Asda and Aldi will forgo UK property tax relief during the pandemic, following rivals Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Morrisons and taking the total saved by the government from supermarket groups to 1.74 billion pounds ($2.34 billion).
Sainsbury's said on Thursday it would now pay 440 million pounds ($591 million) of so called business rates, while Walmart (NYSE:WMT) owned Asda will pay 340 million pounds and German-owned Aldi will pay 100 million pounds.
In March, the British government and devolved administrations exempted all retailers from paying the tax on their stores for the 2020/21 financial year to help them through the crisis.
Britain's supermarket groups have seen sales soar during the pandemic, but have been criticised by lawmakers and media for paying shareholder dividends while receiving tax relief.
However, on Wednesday, market leader Tesco said it would repay the 585 million pounds it had claimed because some of the risks of the crisis were now behind it, and returning the money was ""the right thing to do"".
That stance put pressure on rivals to do the same.
Morrisons followed, saying it would pay 274 million pounds.
Sainsbury's said it had performed ahead of expectations, particularly since the start of the second national lockdown in England last month.
""With regional restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, we believe it is now fair and right to forgo the business rates relief,"" CEO Simon Roberts said.
Asda CEO Roger Burnley said the group recognised there were other industries for whom the effects of COVID-19 would be much more long lasting.
Tesco CEO Ken Murphy denied its decision to pay was a calculated one to damage competitors who do not share its financial strength.
""When we made the decision, we didn't really think about the competition at all,"" he told Sky News.
Murphy also said the move was unconnected to Tesco's plan to pay shareholders a 5 billion pound special dividend when the sale of its Asian business was completed.
PRESSURE ON OTHERS
Analysts said the pressure was now on other food retailers to also forgo the relief.
Discounters Lidl and B&M declined to comment.
The Co-operative Group said it plans to review its position at year-end. M&S and Waitrose owner, the John Lewis Partnership, have said they will not forgo it.
A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters the government welcomed any decision to repay support ""where it is no longer needed"".

It will prioritise dividend payments to shareholders over cutting debt in 2020-21, which will push back its timetable for debt reduction.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>","Dollar stores thrive in pandemic, but hold back forecasts","(Reuters) -  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday, as the discount retailer benefited from higher demand for cheaper groceries and household items during the coronavirus-induced economic downturn. 
High unemployment and falling household income this year due to the COVID-19 crisis have boosted demand for lower-priced cereals, vegetables and other essentials, lifting sales at dollar stores.
The strong demand also carried through to the current quarter, with Dollar General reporting same-store sales growth of about 14% for the period between Oct. 31 and Dec.1.
Still, the company did not provide a forecast for the rest of the year, like its peer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), citing the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.
Shares of Dollar General, which typically sells products for $10 or less, were down nearly 3% in premarket trading after having risen about 40% so far this year. 
Dollar General has stores concentrated in rural locations, which makes them a one-stop place for customers - who have few other options nearby - to buy everything from home decor, party supplies to everyday essentials. 
For the third quarter ended Oct. 30, Dollar General posted sales and same-store sales that beat analysts' expectations as people bought more on average despite cutting down on the number of trips.
Net income rose to $574.26 million, or $2.31 per share, from $365.55 million, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier. 

Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $2.00 per share, Refinitiv IBES data showed.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) said on Thursday it would buy U.S. wealth manager  Waddell & Reed  (NYSE:WDR) Financial Inc for $1.7 billion, its first major deal under a new CEO that expands its presence in the world's largest retail finance market.
The purchase, one of the biggest finance industry buyouts by an Australian entity, puts Macquarie in the top 25 U.S. fund managers, it said, and reinforces a core business of a company that has diversified into running M&A deals, owning infrastructure, trading commodities and selling home loans.
CEO Shemara Wikramanayake, who started in the role two years ago after running the division responsible for Thursday's purchase, had previously said she wanted to make large acquisitions. The choice of Waddell & Reed, a 70-year-old Kansas firm with 922 advisers, shows Wikramanayake keeping a global focus without reinventing the company's business profile.
""We see the deal as financially compelling,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts in a client note. ""This signals (Macquarie) is ready to deploy excess capital.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said ""the potential scale benefits make sense"" and suggested Macquarie would target a similar opportunity in Europe for its next purchase with A$8.5 billion in surplus capital.
Shares of Waddell & Reed soared 47% in extended trading, in line with the premium Macquarie offered to its last closing price, while Macquarie shares were flat against a slightly higher Australian market.
As part of the deal, Macquarie will sell Waddell & Reed's (NASDAQ:REED) wealth management platform to U.S. investment adviser LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) Holdings Inc for $300 million, and then begin a partnership with the firm.
Waddell & Reed had in recent years become a ""diversified and growth-oriented financial services enterprise (and) the long-term partnership between Macquarie and LPL as part of this transaction accelerates that transformation"", the target company's CEO Philip J. Sanders said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - JD (NASDAQ:JD) Logistics has asked banks to pitch for the lead role in its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) of up to $3 billion as it moves towards launching the deal in the first half of 2021, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The logistics business, the offshoot of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc, would be the latest subsidiary of the parent company to be spun off and listed in Hong Kong.
The IPO could raise between $2 billion and $3 billion, said the sources, adding the company was yet to set a firm target.
Investment banks made presentations to JD Logistics executives on Nov. 27 as part of the selection process, the sources said.
The people could not be named as the information has not yet been made public.
JD Logistics did not immediately respond to a request for comment
JD.com spun off its logistics unit into a standalone entity in 2017 and then opened up its delivery and warehousing services to third-party companies. An IPO for the unit has been under consideration for almost a year.
Official mandates have yet to be given to the banks but JD is known to be close to UBS, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Haitong Securities, the people said.
UBS and Bank of America declined comment. Haitong did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Those three banks sponsored the JD Health IPO which raised nearly $3.5 billion in Hong Kong this week. UBS and BofA also sponsored JD.com's $4.4-billion secondary listing in June, the largest listing in Hong Kong in 2020.
A timetable for the JD Logistics IPO has not yet been set, but the two sources suggested a deal was expected in the first half of 2020.
The JD Logistics IPO was discussed during JD Health listing presentations last week with the parent's management, which indicated a deal could come earlier in the new year, a separate investor source said.

The source was not authorised to speak to media so could not be named.

The company has seen air freight demand surge as the cargo capacity usually available in passenger planes has evaporated during the COVID-19 pandemic as air travel all but shut down.
MBK, which is working with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on the divestiture, is marketing the firm to logistics groups such as Europe's DSV, North American Expeditors or Kuwait-based Agility, the sources told Reuters.
MBK, Morgan Stanley, DSV and Agility declined to comment, while Expeditors was not immediately available for comment.
Apex, which also offers ocean freight - specialising in trans-Pacific routes - as well as trucking and warehousing services, was bought by MBK Partners in 2015. 
A number of transportation companies are up for sale in Asia, including China's CJ Rokin Logistics Supply Chain and Toll's Australia and Asia-focused Global Express courier services division.
On the back of a strong increase in sales, Apex is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $120 million this year, some of the people said. 
Bidders are expected to value the company at 12-15 times core earnings in a potential deal, these people said, adding that one of the big valuation questions is the sustainability of the profit figures once the pandemic subsides. 
First-round offers are due in mid-December, they added.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman, who cautiously hedged his portfolio before the historic market sell-off in March, has extended his gains to 62.8% for the year so far.
Last month, Ackman's publicly traded Pershing Square Holdings portfolio gained 13.4%, lifting the $11.4 billion portfolio to a net gain of 62.8% in the first 11 months of 2020, according to a performance review.
Ackman recently told investors that the firm is having its best ever year and that he is ""bullish"" for 2021. But he warned of possible volatility ahead as the coronavirus continues to take its toll.
To guard against swings, Ackman said he put on a new hedge -- roughly one third the size of the one he put on earlier this year -- as corporate credit spreads are very tight. He earned $2.6 billion in profits from the first hedge and plowed that money back into the market, buying more of the stocks he already owns at cheaper prices.
This summer Ackman raised the biggest blank-check fund ever helping swell his firm's total assets under management -- including all hedge funds and Pershing Square Tontine Holdings -- to $17 billion.
The average hedge fund gained 1.2% through the end of October, according to Hedge Fund Research. November data is still being compiled.

Managers of SPAC companies are not held to the same level of liability about potential growth prospects as managers who raise cash via an initial public offering (IPO) on equity markets, spurring concerns about an investor bubble. 
""You can get so much money now for companies that do not have a product. Personally I am scared a little bit,"" Rimac told the Financial Times Future of the Car summit on Thursday.
""When we go public, I want to show the numbers, to go public on reality, and not on hype,"" Rimac said. 
""I hope that these SPACs will be successful. A lot of them won't. I hope it won't hurt the industry too much.
SPACs are small companies with an established track record of filings at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which are then used to buy up promising companies in high-growth sectors. 
Wall Street has used SPACs to sidestep the IPO process, with their shorter preparation time and fewer legal hurdles making it easier to tap the investor optimism towards electric vehicles that helped Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reach a $554 billion valuation. 
""We were profitable last year, and we want to be profitable this year as well,"" Rimac said, adding that he built up his company, which was founded in Croatia in 2009 and now employs 900 people, by focussing on profitability rather than growth. 
""For a start-up, we have built up steam the hard way,"" he told the FT's web based conference, adding that sometimes he feels like he is missing out by not pursuing the SPAC path. 
Rimac had a hard time raising money in 2011 after electric car maker Fisker went bankrupt and with Tesla yet to establish itself as a high growth company.
Rimac was thus forced to raise money by taking on development contracts for other carmakers. Today Porsche, Kia and Hyundai are shareholders and Rimac makes electric powertrains for supercars built by Aston Martin, Koenigsegg and others. 
""We started with hypercars and we are now working with more mainstream vehicles,"" Rimac said. ""Want to be the leader in high performance electric vehicle components. Want to be the intel inside.""

Rimac declined to comment on speculation that he would buy Bugatti, but added cryptically ""maybe soon"".

The approval from Caixabank's shareholders to create a bank with more than 650 billion euros in total assets will bring the total number of banks in Spain down to 11 from the current 12, on par with countries like in Italy and France, Caixabank's Chief Executive Officer Gonzalo Gortazar said.
The deal still needs to the approval of the Spain's watchdog competition CNMC, which could force divestitures in some businesses or try to limit the impact of the transaction in some regions where the banks have a dominant market share, such as Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and Madrid. 
The economy ministry also has to approve the 4.3 billion euros ($5.21 billion) acquisition of Bankia by Caixabank.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Thursday, pausing around record highs as investors await more fresh news on Covid-19 vaccines and potential fiscal stimulus.  
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract fell just 5 points, S&P 500 Futures traded 1 point higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 31 points, or 0.2%. 
The major indices had a quiet session on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 gaining 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1%. The slight move higher for the S&P 500 resulted in a new record high, its 28th record close this year.
Positive news over the development of Covid-19 vaccines, with the U.K. becoming the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech injection for emergency use on Wednesday, have helped global stock markets post strong gains.
However, the roll out of this vaccine, and others are likely to be approved shortly, will likely take several months. The U.S. is still set for a difficult winter, with more than 100,000 people currently in hospitals across the country sick with Covid-19, for the first time ever.
This puts pressure on U.S. lawmakers to come up with new stimulus to help the battered economy. There have been signs of movement over this, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer backed a $908 billion deal, a smaller proposal than they were prepared to accept prior to the election. 
They also urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to use this deal as the basis for relief talks. McConnell had reportedly planned to bring a much smaller bill back to the Senate floor for a vote.
There will be more evidence of what the surge in coronavirus cases is doing to the labor market, with the release of the weekly initial jobless claims number later in the session. This follows Wednesday’s disappointing ADP monthly employment report and comes ahead of Friday’s official jobs report.
In the corporate sector, the grocery chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) is expected to report earnings Thursday, along with cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) and discount retailer Dollar General (NYSE:DG).
Oil prices weakened slightly Thursday, with the focus remaining on whether leading producers will extend record production cuts set in place to balance out the severe hit to demand from the pandemic.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, a group known as OPEC+, had been widely expected to roll over cuts of 7.7 million barrels per day, at least until March 2021. However, there has been disagreement within the group of the need to do so, with the recent progress on vaccines greatly improving the demand outlook for 2021.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $44.97 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract was down 0.2% at $48.17.

590,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 05:57AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Nestle's Costly, Necessary Bid to Get Greener","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It costs a lot of money to stay on the right side of the ESG crowd. However, management at Nestle (SIX:NESN) obviously consider that it will cost shareholders more in the long run if it doesn’t.
The Swiss-based food giant said on Thursday that it will spend nearly 3 billion euro ($3.6 billion) over the next five years to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero.
The initiative comes on top of a promise to spend $2 billion to reduce its use of plastic packaging.  It breaks down into three areas: farming, operations management and product portfolio.
The company promised that “These investments will be financed primarily through operational and structural efficiencies to keep this initiative earnings neutral” which sounds reassuring but may leave investors wondering why, if there was so much fat on the company, it’s only being addressed now.
The first area of focus is “regenerative agriculture practises”. This boils down to paying farmers more than the minimum necessary so that farmers can invest in things like soil health and not feel compelled to raise yields to the maximum by the excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides.
The standout component here is a promise to dissociate itself completely within two years from the issue of deforestation as it pertains to its sourcing of palm oil and soy.
The second area of focus it at its own sites, which will migrate to 100% reliance on renewable electricity within five years. It’s by no means the first company to do so, but given that it operates 800 sites in 187 countries, it’s a good illustration of the underlying demand that has propelled the stocks of renewable energy companies around the world this year.
Nestle also said it intends to “offset” the emissions from its business travel by 2022 (there was no mention of reducing overall travel by increased reliance on remote work).
The final area of focus is the product itself. The world’s largest maker of chocolate may be able to stop farmers using pesticides, but it can’t stop cows, er, releasing methane, one of the most powerful greenhouse gases. The company is already accelerating the rollout of plant-based alternatives to conventional milk where it can, but this will surely add further momentum.
Nestle’s management naturally presents the measures as part of a spontaneous and voluntary effort to be a good global citizen, and it would be cynical to deny that completely. But it is acting against a backdrop of increasing scrutiny of corporate environmental practises.
According to Morningstar, funds with the ‘Environmental, Social and Governance’-themed moniker attracted inflows 10 times as fast as conventional investment funds in the first nine months of the year and their assets were up 30% year-on-year by the end of September.  The trend is also catching on in the U.S.  Nestle cannot afford to be dumped by such funds for doing too little. The share price is already under pressure after profiting from its defensive characteristics during the early stages of the pandemic, and it fell another 0.5% to a new eight-month low on Thursday. The announcement looks expensive, but unavoidable.."

592,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",Analysis: More U.S.-listed Chinese firms seen seeking backup listings as new audit law looms,"By Scott Murdoch and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The rush by U.S-listed Chinese companies to secure a secondary listing in Hong Kong or China is only set to intensify as the United States readies a new law allowing it to kick firms off its exchanges if they do not comply with U.S. auditing rules.
The ""Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act"" is expected soon to be signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump after it was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday. It stipulates that failure to comply with the U.S. Public Accounting Oversight Board's audits for three years in a row will mean a U.S. delisting.
While it applies to companies from any country, the legislation's sponsors intended it to target Chinese firms.
Authorities in China have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms, citing national security concerns. If they do not bend, there may be little the companies themselves can do to prevent a delisting.
""The passage through the House will mean that wave of secondary offerings will continue as China is unlikely to make a concession on the accounting access front,"" said Aequitas Research partner Sumeet Singh, who publishes on Smartkarma.
""Even if it does make a concession, it will probably do so at the last minute, in year three, and hence most companies will have already hedged their bets by then with a secondary offering in Hong Kong.""
Escalating U.S.-China tensions that have included the U.S. blacklisting of major firms such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd have already spurred a swathe of U.S.-listed Chinese firms to embark on ""backup"" listings over the past two years.
This year, a record number carried out secondary listings in Hong Kong with $19.1 billion raised in 12 transactions, according to Refinitiv data, compared to $14.8 billion in 2019.
Among them were e-commerce giant JD (NASDAQ:JD).Com, gaming company NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) and Yum China, the exclusive licensee of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in the world's second-biggest economy.
While analysts expect Joe Biden to likely stick with the Trump administration's harsh policies towards Chinese tech giants when he enters the White House in January, some expect that over the next three years, U.S. and Chinese regulators will make compromises that will allow continued U.S. listings.
REGULATORY COMPROMISE 
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news briefing in Beijing on Thursday that China was firmly opposed to the way the United States was politicising securities oversight.
""This law severely weakens the trust global investors have in U.S. capital market, and will ultimately harm the international status of U.S. capital market and the interests of U.S. itself,"" she said.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said last month it looked forward to holding discussions with its counterparts as soon as possible on ""specific plans"" to conduct joint inspections of Chinese firms listed in the United States
It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Experts also believe that, despite the new law, at least some Chinese firms looking to go public will factor in that a compromise will be worked out and still seek to list in the United States.
""The U.S. markets remain extraordinarily deep pools of liquidity and sector expertise that produce strong valuations for quality issuers. (China)-based companies will continue give considerable weight to the many commercial advantages of being listed in the United States,"" said Jason Elder, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown.
There are 217 Chinese companies listed in the United States worth a combined $2.2 trillion, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said in early October.
In a sign that Wall Street has not yet lost its allure as a listing venue despite the passing of the auditing bill through both houses, China's 17 Education and Technology Group is seeking to raise $288 million in a Nasdaq listing and is due to price its shares on Thursday.

The tutoring business could be valued at up to $2.2 billion, according to its regulatory filings.

TULSA, Oklahoma (Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)' maintenance team is scrambling to complete safety changes to its fleet of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets ahead of a phased return to service, while deliveries of new jets are set to begin as early as this week.
American's maintenance base, the largest in the world, has housed its 24 MAX planes during a 20-month safety ban that followed the second of two fatal crashes for the aircraft in March 2019, forcing some 400 MAX jets in service to be grounded.
It has handled some unexpected tasks while caring for the idled jets, including evicting wildlife and custom-making tarps.
""Birds like to nest in things. Combating that has been rather interesting,"" said Erik Olund, managing director of base maintenance in Tulsa, Oklahoma, under the wing of a 737 MAX. 
Following a Nov. 18 order from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) detailing necessary changes for the jet to fly again, 260 American Airlines' specialists divided into three shifts are working round the clock, seven days a week to roll out two jets every seven to 10 days.
But as the aircraft returns during a pandemic that has crushed air travel demand and left questions over customers' willingness to fly, American is planning a phased re-introduction to its commercial schedule.
""We don’t want to bring them out so fast that we’re not flying them (...) and have to put them back into storage,"" said American's chief operating officer David Seymour at the hangar, where the company hosted media on Wednesday.
American is launching commercial service on Dec. 29 with a daily flight between Miami and New York City and will gradually reintroduce the jets as its 2,600 737 pilots cycle through a 2-1/2 hour-simulator training.
It plans to take delivery of eight new 737 MAX jets from Boeing this month that would already have the FAA-mandated system upgrades, Seymour said. The first delivery could happen this week, and some of those new jets may fly before the maintenance crew works through all 24 in Tulsa.
Boeing has a backlog of 450 jets parked at its own facilities that it built during the grounding, when MAX deliveries were frozen.
""There’s a lot at stake here and nobody is going to rush this airplane before it’s operationally ready or safe,"" Olund said. 
Each plane will take an operational readiness flight and receive FAA sign-off before flying passengers.
One of the early problems American's team encountered when the jets were grounded was finding enough tarps to cover the engines. So the team made the covers themselves in the floorboard shop, using foam and corrugated plastic sheets. 
Then, every 10 days mechanics would remove all of the covers, run the engines, cycle the flaps and rotate the tires. They also moved wiring bundles after a regulatory mandate in March and conducted a full sweep of the fuel tanks to ensure no foreign objects.

All said, they spent 64,000 hours keeping the jets in shape during the longest grounding in commercial aviation history.

Global stock markets have seen strong gains on the idea that vaccines to combat the Covid-19 virus are coming shortly, returning the world’s economies back to some form of normalcy.
On Wednesday, the U.K. became the first country to grant emergency approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The U.S. and Europe are expected to follow in short order, while drugmakers  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) are also seen shortly offering up their products for approval.
China’s Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index for November came in at 57.8, ahead of expectations, but the data in Europe has been more mixed. The Eurozone composite PMI for November was revised up slightly from the flash reading, but at 45.3 still represented a sharp slowdown from October's 50.0 and a clear contraction in overall terms.
A potential fly in the ointment could be the negotiations surrounding the future trading relationship between the U.K. and the European Union after the end of the post-Brexit transition period on Dec. 31.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The CEO of Singapore ride-hailer Grab told employees in an internal note on Thursday that the firm is in a position to make acquisitions, following a report it is close to a merger with regional rival Gojek.
The two firms have made substantial progress in talks to merge Southeast Asia's two most valuable startups, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. 
Sources familiar with the matter have previously told Reuters that over the last few years, large investors of the two companies have backed a merger of both loss-making firms.
""There is speculation again about a Gojek deal,"" Anthony Tan told employees in a note on the company's internal communication platform, seen by Reuters.
""Our business momentum is good, and as with any market consolidation rumours, we are the ones in a position to acquire.""
Tan did not give any specifics about a potential deal with Gojek. Grab declined comment on Tan's note and the media report. Gojek declined comment.

Grab, Southeast Asia's biggest start-up, is now valued at over $15 billion, Reuters reported in October, according to a source familiar with the matter. Gojek's worth has been estimated at $10 billion.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely unchanged Thursday, pausing for breath while waiting for more news about Covid-19 vaccine approvals as well as Brexit trade negotiations.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded just 0.01% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.03% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.

There was positive economic news earlier in the day, as the Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index for November came in at 57.8, beating expectations and showing the Chinese economy is well on the way to recovery.
The equivalent European figures are due later in the session, but are unlikely to be as upbeat given the restrictions in place throughout much of the continent to combat the latest surge of the virus.
Another potential fly in the ointment could be the negotiations surrounding the future trading relationship between the U.K. and the European Union after the end of the post-Brexit transition period on Dec. 31.
France warned Wednesday it could veto a trade deal between the two parties if it doesn’t like the terms, a move that could mean trade with the U.K. next year would become subject to tariffs and quotas.

602,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>",Corporate Singapore faces crunch time in rare clash with activist funds,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A year-long spat between activist funds and a small real estate investment trust (REIT) over a merger is nearing a climax in Singapore, a battle that could embolden more investor dissent in a sleepy market dominated by retail shareholders.
The activists say a proposed deal between Sabana REIT and ESR-REIT, whose managers are both owned by a unit of Asian logistics giant ESR Cayman Ltd, undervalues Sabana REIT and are confident of blocking it.
Despite being a global financial centre, shareholder activism in Singapore is not common due to its conservative market and tightly controlled companies.
A victory at Sabana REIT's investors' vote on Friday would mark a rare win for activists in the city-state and signal their growing clout with retail shareholders.
But Sabana, one of Singapore's smallest REITs, says voting down the deal with a rival four times its size would harm its growth prospects amid a lack of alternative bidders.
""When we agreed to the merger process, it was due to a bigger ship sailing past and we wanted to hop onto it so we could continue the journey whatever the weather,"" Donald Han, a 30-year property market veteran, who became Sabana REIT's CEO in 2018, told Reuters.
Singapore is home to REITS collectively worth over $70 billion, making it Asia's largest REIT market. Many investors prefer to own units in trusts mandated to pay 90% of rental income as dividends, seen as a better alternative to bank deposits.
Activist Quarz Capital had proposed Sabana REIT and ESR-REIT merge last year in a cash-plus-stock deal that would value Sabana REIT at S$0.545 a unit, while Black Crane Capital had voiced concerns about Sabana REIT's market valuations.
When both REITs announced an all-stock deal in July - just as the pandemic pummelled the sector - valuing Sabana REIT at S$397 million ($296 million) or 37.7 Singapore cents a unit, both activists rejected it.
They said last month that Sabana REIT had failed to close the net asset value discount and had recommended ""a value destructive merger with a REIT controlled by its owner.""
To press their point, the funds set up a website called ""Save Sabana REIT"" stacked with presentations against the merger, sent letters to management and held webinars to win over retail investors.
They also sought regulatory intervention to disallow ESR Cayman from managing both REITS if the merger fails, although the central bank has said there are no rules restricting such arrangements.
TIGHT VOTE
The merger proposal needs approval of over 50% of unitholders, representing no less than 75% of the value of votes cast. ESR-REIT managers and others holding 24.6% of Sabana REIT are not allowed to vote.
Quarz Capital, run by a Swiss investment executive along with its Singapore-based research head, has previously campaigned against undervalued REITS and other Singapore firms, though this is its most high profile clash in the city-state.
Its current partner, Hong Kong-based Black Crane, is founded by a former UBS banker. The activists together control over 12% of Sabana REIT, the biggest fund ownership in the firm.
They say an overlapping investment mandate of the two REITs, whose managers are owned by ESR Cayman, has potential to create conflicts of interest, a claim both companies reject.
Sabana REIT says its units were already trading at a discount before the merger announcement. As ESR-REIT has termed its offer as final, it is prohibited from raising its price.
""The activists have pinned themselves into a corner. Is Sabana worth more? Yes, but is there anyone else who can unlock its value in this weak market? No,"" said Justin Tang, research head at United First Partners.
This is the second merger attempt by both REITs after talks were terminated in 2017.
Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis & Co. have recommended the current deal.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 12:35AM ET</span>",U.S. bans cotton imports from China producer XPCC citing Xinjiang 'slave labor',"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration expanded economic pressure on China's western region of Xinjiang, banning cotton imports from a powerful Chinese quasi-military organization that it says uses the forced labor of detained Uighur Muslims.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said on Wednesday its ""Withhold Release Order"" would ban cotton and cotton products from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), one of China's largest producers. 
The move, which could have a sweeping effect on companies involved in selling textiles and apparel to the United States, is among several the Trump administration has been working on in its final weeks to harden the U.S. position against China, making it more difficult for President-elect Joe Biden to ease U.S.-China tensions.
The targeting of XPCC, which produced https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cotton/top-china-cotton-producer-resists-reforms-in-restive-xinjiang-idUSKBN0LN26U20150220 30% of China's cotton in 2015, follows a Treasury Department ban in July on all dollar transactions with the sprawling business-and-paramilitary entity, founded in 1954 to settle China's far west. 
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli, who oversees the border agency, called ""Made in China"" a ""warning label.""
""The cheap cotton goods you may be buying for family and friends during this season of giving - if coming from China - may have been made by slave labor in some of the most egregious human rights violations existing today in the modern world,"" he told a news conference.
Cuccinelli said a region-wide Xinjiang cotton import ban was still being studied.
The United Nations cites what it says are credible reports that 1 million Muslims held in camps have been put to work. China denies mistreating Uighurs and says the camps are vocational training centers needed to fight extremism.
BROAD IMPACT
While the Treasury sanctions target XPCC's financial structure, Wednesday's action will force apparel firms and other companies shipping cotton products into the United States to eliminate XPCC-produced cotton fiber from many stages of their supply chains, said Brenda Smith, CBP's executive assistant commissioner for trade.
""That pretty much blocks all Chinese cotton textile imports,"" said a China-based cotton trader, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Identifying cotton from a specific supplier will sharply raise manufacturing costs, and only the few large companies with fully integrated operations across the complex textile supply chain could guarantee that no XPCC product has been used, the trader said.
""It really depends on how much proof they want. If they want real proof that this cotton has not been used, that's going to be extremely difficult,"" he added.
Major clothing brands including Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), Patagonia Inc and Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) have told the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation that did not source from factories in Xinjiang - but that they could not confirm that their supply chains were free of cotton picked from the region.
The XPCC could not immediately be reached for comment. The China National Textile and Apparel Council declined to comment. The China Cotton Textile Association could not immediately be reached. 
In September, CBP considered a much broader import ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang, but after dissent from within the Trump administration, it announced narrower bans on products from specific entities, including two smaller cotton and apparel producers.
U.S. apparel makers had criticized a broader ban as impossible to enforce, but on Wednesday clothing and retail groups welcomed the XPCC-specific ban. The groups, including the American Apparel and Footwear Association and the National Retail Federation, said in a statement https://www.aafaglobal.org/AAFA/AAFA_News/2020_Press_Releases/Joint_Association_Statement_Prohibit_XPCC_Cotton.aspx they were on the ""front lines of efforts to ensure forced labor does not taint our supply chains or enter the United States.""

Biden has pledged to work with U.S. allies to bring pressure on China to curb human rights and trade abuses. Trump in recent weeks has increased action against major Chinese state companies, banning access to U.S. technology and investments.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, despite a muted start as investors took stock of the market optimism surrounding the approval of a COVID-19 vaccine and the possibility of U.S. stimulus measures.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.48% by 10:58 PM ET (2:58 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.33%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for November came in at 57.8, beating both the 56.5 reading in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 56.8 figure.
However, U.S.-China tensions were up as the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation that could see Chinese companies, such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, getting kicked off U.S. exchanges should they not allow regulators to review their financial audits.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.29%.

Meanwhile,  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) also awaiting clearance for its candidate mRNA-1273 in the U.S. and Europe.
Global shares saw a record month in November, but investors are now focusing on bonds. Treasury yields saw one the year’s biggest spikes on Tuesday, leading to speculation over rising rates’ potential impact on shares and corporate debt.
However, some investors remained optimistic.
“The market has almost immediately priced in a better-than-expected 2021, particularly in the second half and that’s what we are seeing here, and on the yield curve as well … the message here really is that better days are ahead and that dips and consolidations are eminently buyable,” BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Investment Management chief strategist Alicia Levine told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for immediate talks over the latest stimulus measures and urged that a bipartisan $908 billion aid proposal form the foundation for talks with Republicans. Congress has until Dec. 11 to reach a consensus on the measures should it wish to avoid a government shutdown.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also said on Wednesday that there were no hard feelings between the Fed and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over the latter’s sunsetting of emergency lending programs in November. Powell’s comments came during a second day of testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
The Fed and the European Central Bank will both convene for their respective policy meetings, the last for 2020, in the following week.
Some investors remained cautiously optimistic.
“Markets are quite likely to muddle through from here. The vaccine is increasingly priced in. A couple of months ago, no one knew how deep coronavirus would be, or what the outcome of the election was. Now both sources of uncertainty have been removed,” Frazis Capital Partners portfolio manager Michael Frazis told Reuters.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian prosecutors will ask a court to disregard a former U.S. government lawyer's affidavit submitted by Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's legal team in her U.S. extradition case, arguing it is ""irrelevant"" and ""unnecessary,"" documents released on Wednesday showed.
The affidavit was submitted in July in which Michael Gottlieb, who was a White House lawyer under President Barack Obama, testified that U.S. President Donald Trump had departed from longstanding legal policies designed to promote the ""impartial administration of justice,"" with his comments that he was willing to use Meng as a bargaining chip in trade talks with China.
Meng's lawyers have argued that the extradition should be thrown out in part because the case against her in the United States is tainted by political interference, pointing to comments from Trump about her extradition.
She was arrested in December 2018 on a warrant from the United States. She is facing charges of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Meng, 48, has said she is innocent and is fighting the extradition while under house arrest in Vancouver.
In a submission dated Nov. 3, prosecutors asserted that Gottlieb's evidence should be struck from the record arguing that it is ""inadmissible expert opinion evidence"" that is ""irrelevant"" and ""unnecessary"" to Meng's case.
""The key factual matters arising from (Meng's) allegations are whether certain statements by foreign officials have ... prejudiced the integrity of the Canadian justice system,"" prosecutors wrote.
Gottlieb's testimony would ask the court to ""determine not only whether foreign officials have complied with foreign legal principles"" but also ""review their conduct in light of internal governmental policies and norms.
""This Court lacks the expertise to engage in such an inquiry,"" prosecutors wrote.
The prosecutors are set make the request in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Monday, when witness testimony in the case resumes.
Gottlieb is a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP in Washington. 
Huawei officials were not available for an immediate comment.
Prosecutors have accused Meng's lawyers of trying to litigate the case against her in the United States in the Canadian court, which Meng's lawyers have denied.

The extradition case is scheduled to wrap up in April 2021, although the potential for appeals on either side means the case could drag on for years.

Shenzhen-based AutoX has modified a number of vehicles from various manufacturers and tested them in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Wuhu. 
To attract deep-pocketed partners, startups seek to test their technology with different production vehicles in a variety of cities. 
In July, AutoX became the second firm after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo to test a passenger vehicle on California's public roads without a safety driver in the front. 
Unlike rivals WeRide and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which are testing their driverless vehicles in China but use a remote centre to take control of their vehicles if needed, AutoX will not have a remote centre. 
""We think with current communications infrastructure, remote control brings safety issues as 5G signals are not stable yet and hackers might attack the vehicles,"" AutoX Chief Executive Xiao Jianxiong told Reuters. 

In China, companies such as Toyota-backed Pony.ai and Didi Chuxing are also testing autonomous cars, but all with one or two safety staff onboard. The people onboard take control in unexpected situations.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>",The new black gold? Big Oil bets on retail networks in an electric era,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - For Big Oil, coffee and chocolate could be the new black gold. 
Under pressure from investors and governments alike to cut emissions, major European oil companies are ploughing billions into renewable energy but are struggling to craft business plans that promise the returns shareholders have come to expect. 
Europe's big oil firms, however, have another card to play: their vast global networks of filling stations.
BP (NYSE:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total all say they are betting on higher profits from sales of groceries and snacks at their retail networks, which will still be an essential port of call for motorists in an electric era.
Paying at the pump to fill up with petrol may only take a few minutes, but even with the fastest electric vehicle (EV) chargers, customers would have at least 10 to 15 minutes to kill - plenty of time to grab a coffee and do some shopping.
While the so-called marketing operations of big oil firms - retail sales of fuel, lubricants, groceries and TV dinners - usually contribute a smaller slice of profits than oil and gas production, they typically have higher margins.
The renewable energy and power businesses oil companies are moving into, however, tend to have lower returns on investment, making it important for firms such as BP and Shell to find ways to boost their overall returns in low-carbon economies.
That's why Shell plans to expand its retail network by more than 20% to 55,000 sites worldwide by 2025. BP aims to increase its network of filling stations by nearly 50% to 29,000 by 2030 and boost its EV charging network to 70,000 points.
Total, meanwhile, is planning to increase its EV charging network in Europe to 150,000 points by 2025 from 18,000 now.
Subway and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the world's two biggest food chains, both have fewer outlets than Shell. U.S. giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the world's biggest retailer by sales, has 11,510 stores globally.
BP and Shell are also betting that daily contact with tens of millions of customers will give it masses of data that it can use to tailor sales for shoppers in small towns, cities or even specific petrol stations throughout the world.

LOCKDOWN PREVIEW
While there are relatively few electric cars on the road now, oil companies have already had a glimpse of the potential of their retail networks during coronavirus lockdowns this year. 
Fuel sales slumped as travel restrictions kicked in, but people still nipped to nearby petrol stations with convenience stores to stock up on daily necessities.
In fact, Shell's retail division, known as ""marketing"", which has the world's biggest network of filling stations, had its best quarter on record in the three months to Sept. 30, bringing in $1.6 billion in adjusted earnings.
So far in 2020, Shell's marketing division has contributed 60% of its overall earnings, which are traditionally dominated by its upstream oil and integrated gas businesses.
Huibert Vigeveno, Shell's head of refining, chemicals and marketing, said the company holds a daily call to check on customer preferences for anything from engine oil to croissants so it can constantly adapt.
""Having 45,000 retail sites over more than 80 countries allowed us to learn very fast,"" he told Reuters. 
""It started in January, when we saw what was happening in China and how consumers were behaving. And we shared that immediately with all the 80 countries in which we operate.""
Shell's marketing profits were also helped by strong sales of premium fuels, which have higher margins, and lubricants. 
BP and Total benefited from a boost at their retail divisions during the pandemic months too, helping to plug revenue shortfalls from lower fuel sales and reinforce their plans to expand rapidly into convenience stores and EV charging.
""We saw during the pandemic people shopping online and topping up in local stores like ours, but it's a long-term trend, too,"" said Emma Delaney, BP head of customers and products.
Total's Chief Financial Officer Jean-Pierre Sbraire told investors in October that retail sales in Europe were back at pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter, even though fuel sales remained very weak.
LOW VOLATILITY
BP's profit margins from convenience stores have risen 8% a year since 2015 and they delivered a gross margin of more than $1 billion in 2019, a figure the company aims to more than double by 2030, Delaney told Reuters.
BP's return on investment - or the return on average capital employed - at its convenience and mobility business, which includes sales of fuel and lubricants as well as its stores, was more than 20% in 2019.
Shell too had a return on investment of over 20% at its marketing division, which includes retail, business-to-business fuel sales and lubricants, and Vigeveno said it expects the business to grow 6% to 7% a year until 2025 and beyond.
""The volatility in retail is very low ... but the margin is high,"" said Mirko Rubeis of the Boston Consulting Group. (Graphic: Shell's marketing business delivers steady profits, https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-RETAIL/yzdpxkzelvx/chart.png) 
Return on investment has been in the spotlight since oil majors such as BP announced this year that it plans to cut its fossil fuel production and invest more heavily in low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar power. 
Shell is also looking to accelerate its shift towards low-carbon energy and is due to announce its long-term transition strategy in February.
While big oil firms typically target a return on oil investments of about 15%, returns on low-carbon electricity are expected to be far lower and investors are wondering how they will square the circle.
IS DATA THE NEW OIL? 
When it comes to retail, fuel sales already produce lower profit margins than convenience stores sales, which are often in partnership with well-known grocery brands, and that's one of the reasons for the push into areas dominated by supermarkets.
""Redefining convenience is about much more than fuel. Sure, convenient fuel payment via our app works, but customers on the go want much more than fuel. And so we bake pastries, brew coffee, package deliveries for customers,"" Delaney said.
BP works with Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) in Britain while Shell has a partnership with British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to offer a range of deli food. In the United States, BP has teamed up with food and drink outlet ampm.
During the months of the pandemic, convenience sales at hundreds of sites were also helped by deliveries to homes using online apps such as Deliveroo and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, Vigeveno said. 
BP estimates that more than half the customers who visit Marks & Spencer at its filling stations come for convenience shopping only. Shell's Vigeveno, meanwhile, said half of their sales in northwest Europe were non-fuel.
Even with a retail push, fierce competition among power companies, supermarket giants such as Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) in Britain or  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) in France and new entrants in the EV charging sector could also narrow profit margins in the future.
And with oil consumption possibly already near its peak, energy companies will need to radically rethink their retail businesses to keep making money. 
""To successfully adapt, fuel retailers must embrace a new mindset. Making modest changes or tweaks to the business will not suffice,"" said Boston Consulting Group's Rubeis, adding that the customer data they amass could be crucial.
BP aims to double the daily number of ""customer touchpoints"" in its retail business over the next decade to 20 million while Shell is aiming for 40 million by 2025 from 30 million now.

""Retail is the only thing in the oil and gas value chain that gets you closer to the customer. If you want to have insight into the future trends of mobility, energy transition and so on, that's the only thing that can get you data,"" Rubeis said. ""Customer data is the new oil.""

610,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>",Chinese firms on U.S. exchanges threatened by bill headed to Trump's desk,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a law to kick Chinese companies off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not fully comply with the country's auditing rules, giving President Donald Trump one more tool to threaten Beijing with before leaving office. 
The measure passed the House by unanimous voice vote, after passing the Senate unanimously in May, sending it to Trump, who the White House said is expected to sign it into law.
""The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act"" bars securities of foreign companies from being listed on any U.S. exchange if they have failed to comply with the U.S. Public Accounting Oversight Board's audits for three years in a row.
While is applies to companies from any country, the legislation's sponsors intended it to target Chinese companies listed in the United States, such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), tech firm  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc and oil giant PetroChina Co Ltd.. 
Measures taking a harder line on Chinese business and trade practices generally pass Congress with large margins. Both Democrats and Trump's fellow Republicans echo the president's hard line against Beijing, which became fiercer this year as Trump blamed China for the coronavirus ravaging the United States.
Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who co-authored the bill with Republican Senator John Kennedy, said in a statement that American investors ""have been cheated out of their money after investing in seemingly-legitimate Chinese companies that are not held to the same standards as other publicly listed companies.""
Kennedy said China was using U.S. exchanges to ""exploit"" Americans. ""The House joined the Senate in rejecting a toxic status quo,"" he said in a statement.
The act would also require public companies to disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.
The American Securities Association praised passage of the bill saying it was necessary to protect Americans from ""fradulent companies controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.""
'NON-DISCRIMINATORY ENVIRONMENT'
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said before the vote that it was a discriminatory policy that politically oppresses Chinese firms.
""Instead of setting up layers of barriers, we hope the U.S. can provide a fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign firms to invest and operate in the U.S.,"" Hua told a news conference.
A spokesman for Alibaba pointed to a comment on the bill from May, when it was passed by the Senate. Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu told investors the firm would ""endeavor to comply with any legislation whose aim is to protect and bring transparency to investors who buy securities on U.S. stock exchanges.""
Chinese authorities have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms, citing national security concerns. 
Officials at China's securities regulator indicated earlier this year they were willing to allow inspections of audit documents in some circumstances, but past agreements aimed at solving the dispute have failed to work in practice. 
Shaun Wu, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Paul Hastings, said increased enforcement against Chinese companies was likely even though Democrat Joe Biden will become president in January. 
He said if the bill becomes law, ""all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. will face enhanced scrutiny by the U.S. authorities and inevitably consider all available options."" 

This could include listing in Hong Kong or elsewhere, he said. Several U.S.-listed Chinese firms, including Alibaba and KFC China operator Yum China, have recently carried out secondary listings in Hong Kong.

There is likely to be a wide variation in the incentives payout, with sectors linked to trading seeing an increase of as much as 30% due to the sharp recovery in markets from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lows. Payouts in real estate are expected to drop by about 10%, the firm said.
CEO compensation will receive additional scrutiny this year as it would be difficult to justify an increase in salaries in a mediocre pay year, Johnson Associates added.
The estimates of the Johnson Associates are closely watched by financial professionals.
Financial services industry headcount is expected to decrease meaningfully due to the continued ""revenue challenges"", with the firm estimating a 10% drop from February 2020 to July 2021.

The San Mateo, California-based company, which has 3,554 customers, raised $3.36 billion in its initial public offering after it was priced above the target range in the biggest U.S. listing so far this year.
Snowflake said product revenue, or sales from services on its platform, more than doubled to $148.5 million, accounting for 93% of total revenue in the quarter. 
Founded in 2012 in San Francisco, Snowflake sells a cloud data platform which offers to consolidate a business' data onto one platform. Cloud-based business services have seen rapid growth this year as offices around the world adapted to working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net loss for the quarter ended Oct. 31 widened to $168.9 million from $88.1 million a year earlier, the company said.

Total revenue for the quarter more than doubled to $159.6 million. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $147.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 climbed to a record high close on Wednesday and the Nasdaq Composite Index dipped as investors weighed upbeat vaccine developments and a potential coronavirus fiscal package against a bleak private jobs report.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress remained unable to reach agreement on fresh relief for a pandemic-hit U.S. economy, although some investors said bad economic news could spur policy makers to push harder for a deal.
U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also expressed hope that a deal could be reached ""in the next few days.""
Signs of progress in the race to distribute a vaccine have driven U.S. stocks higher in recent days. In the latest upbeat development,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine got the green light for use in Britain, the first Western country to approve a shot for COVID-19. Pfizer jumped 3.5% and BioNTech surged about 6%.
Underscoring the argument for fiscal stimulus, data showed private payrolls increased less than expected in November, likely as soaring new infections and business restrictions hampered the labor market's recovery.
Moreover, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report showed ""little or no growth"" in four of the central bank's 12 U.S. districts and only modest growth elsewhere in recent weeks.
Any potential sign of a worsening labor market in Friday's broader jobs report could put more pressure on Congress to agree on a stimulus package, said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird.
""They are watching this stuff as much as investors are,"" Mayfield said. ""It could be one of those reports where bad news is good news if it spurs the right stakeholders to come to the table.""
Positive updates on coronavirus vaccine have helped investors raise bets on a swift economic rebound next year, powering the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs on Tuesday.
A rotation into value stocks continued, with the S&P 500 financial index and energy index stocks gaining, while consumer staples dropped.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% to end at 29,883.79 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18% at 3,669.01. 
The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.05% to 12,349.37, dragged by a 2.7% slide in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Getting a generous stimulus package through Congress is a top priority, President-elect Joe Biden said in an interview with the New York Times. He also said he would not immediately cancel the Phase 1 trade deal that Trump struck with China.
The biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow was a nearly 9% slump in Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) after the software company agreed to buy workplace messaging app provider Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc in a $28 billion deal as it bets on an extended run for remote working. Slack fell more than 2%.
Cloud data service provider NetApp Inc (NASDAQ:NTAP)'s shares jumped 9% after it forecast third-quarter profit above expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.46-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.16-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 89 new highs and 12 new lows.

Investing.com -- A long-awaited federal stimulus plan edged closer to reality on Wednesday, helping to boost stocks despite gloomier news on the progress of containing Covid-19.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer backed a $908 billion deal that includes support for small businesses and unemployed Americans. The deal should be used ""as the basis for immediate negotiations,"" they said in a joint statement.
Overnight, the U.K. approved temporary emergency use of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)’s Covid-19 vaccine, adding to hopes U.S. approval may not be far behind.
And it can’t come quickly enough. Covid cases in the U.S. are now above 13.3 million, and the number of deaths approaches 270,000 Americans.
The spread of the virus has led to a new wave of business restrictions, and that was seen in the ADP private payrolls report on Wednesday, which increased less than expected for November.
Here are three things that may affect markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings from a grocery giant and a beauty emporium
The grocery chain Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) is expected to report earnings per share of 66 cents on revenue of $29.9 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA), the cosmetics retailer that recently struck a store within a store deal with  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT), is expected to report EPS of $1.44 on revenue of $1.56 billion.
2. More data on jobs, or the lack thereof
After Wednesday’s disappointing report on private payrolls from ADP, we get the weekly readings on new and continuing jobless claims, and the trends have shown elevated levels of unemployment as the pandemic rages on.
Initial jobless claims are expected to be 775,000 for last week, about the same as the reported number the previous week. Continuing jobless claims are expected to be 5.9 million. Joblessness going into the holiday season may weigh on lawmakers as they consider another stimulus round. The numbers are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
3. Non-manufacturing business activity data
Covid-19 has hit the services industry especially hard as retailers, entertainment venues, restaurants, and hotels are just some of the businesses forced to shut all or somewhat. 
On Thursday, the ISM non-manufacturing business activity reading for November is expected to come in around 60.9 compared to 61.2 for October, indicating a slowdown. The data will be released at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).

Renewed action on the value trade in the wake of positive vaccine news – bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economy– also benefited cruise lines, casinos, and airlines.
As well as vaccine optimism, positive comments on a stimulus for the aviation industry lifted sentiment on the sector.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday he supported another $20 billion in additional government payroll support for U.S. airlines.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said on Wednesday it will hear oral arguments on Dec. 14 on the government's appeal of an order that blocked a ban on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offering TikTok for download in U.S. app stores.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington on Sept. 27 blocked the Commerce Department order hours before it was to prohibit new downloads of the Chinese-owned short video-sharing app.
The appeals panel consists of Judge Judith Rogers (NYSE:ROG), Patricia Millett and Robert Wilkins. All three were nominated by previous Democratic presidents. 
The Trump administration last week extended to Friday a deadline for Chinese TikTok parent ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. assets. The Trump administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China’s government. TikTok, which has over 100 million U.S. users, denies the allegation.
The administration previously granted ByteDance a 15-day extension of the order issued in August. President Donald Trump on Aug. 14 directed ByteDance to divest the app's U.S. assets within 90 days.
Under pressure from the U.S. government, ByteDance has been in talks for months to finalize a deal with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to shift TikTok’s U.S. assets into a new entity.
ByteDance made a new proposal aimed at addressing the U.S. government’s concerns, Reuters reported last week.
The U.S. Treasury said last week the extension was granted to review a recently received ""revised submission.""
ByteDance made the proposal after disclosing on Nov. 10 that it submitted four prior proposals, including one in November, that sought to address U.S. concerns by ""creating a new entity, wholly owned by Oracle, Walmart and existing U.S. investors in ByteDance, that would be responsible for handling TikTok’s U.S. user data and content moderation.""
U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone on Oct. 30 blocked another aspect of a Commerce Department order scheduled to take effect Nov. 12 that would have effectively barred TikTok from operating in the United States.

Beetlestone enjoined the agency from barring data hosting within the United States for TikTok, content delivery services and other technical transactions.

Investing.com - The Dow cut losses Wednesday led by a rise in value stocks following positive news on  Pfizer  's Covid-19 vaccine and optimism for a stimulus relief package.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.05%, or 13 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.11%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.13%.
In a boost to hopes that lawmakers may roll out a fiscal package to support the economy U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer backed the bipartisan $908 billion stimulus deal that includes support for small businesses and unemployed Americans. The deal should be used ""as the basis for immediate negotiations,""  Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement.
The positive update on stimulus arrived on the back of positive vaccine news after the UK approved temporary emergency use authorization for Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)'s and development partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s vaccine.
Approval from the U.S. is not far behind, with many expecting the Pfizer vaccine to get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before year-end.
Renewed action on the value trade in the wake of positive vaccine news – bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economy– also benefited cruise lines, casinos, and airlines.
As well as vaccine optimism, positive comments on a stimulus for the aviation industry lifted sentiment on the sector.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday he supported another $20 billion in additional government payroll support for U.S. airlines.
""I think that would be very meaningful in terms of employment and saving the industry,"" Mnuchin said at a House hearing, according to Reuters.
 American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were up more than 2%.
On the economic front, a weaker-than-expected private sector jobs report for November was largely downplayed by analysts.
""The ADP employment report showed a 307,00 increase in private employment below our forecast of 750,000... but it also showed that the ""broad-based job gains across firm size continued,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
In tech, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) fell 8% after confirming the $27.7 billion acquisition of Slack that will boost its battle against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in enterprise technology.
In other news, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) fell 14% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight, citing little change in the fundamental story of the company since its IPO. "

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta objected in particular to what he said was a too-broad definition of highly confidential information that would be available only to Google's outside counsel without special permission.
Arguing for Google, John Schmidtlein said he opposed the government's proposals.
""My experience is that they are going to designate all or nearly all of the information that they produce as highly confidential,"" he said in a pre-trial hearing by telephone. ""That's what's going to happen."" 
In a filing, the government had defined highly confidential information as ""any confidential information that the parties or any third parties reasonably believe to be so competitively or commercially sensitive that it is entitled to extraordinary protections that a lesser designation cannot provide."" 
Judge Mehta asked for the definition to be narrowed to something that went to the essence of the business. ""Could we agree to some definition that could capture that very narrow category of information?"" he asked.
Judge Mehta asked the two sides to produce a revised protective order by Dec. 14 while companies, like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) or AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), which produced the information, would have until Dec. 15 to respond.
The Justice Department, which sued the search and advertising giant in October, put at the core of its antitrust case the billions of dollars that Google paid to be the default search engine on Apple's iPhones. Apple noted in its filing that sensitive data was used to write the complaint.

Judge Mehta also indicated that he planned to put in the order penalties for attorneys who violate the protective order.

U.S. venture capital investments as of Dec. 1 totaled $139.6 billion across 9,898 deals, compared with $137.3 billion across 12,189 deals last year, according to previously unreleased data from PitchBook. 
That makes 2020 the third straight year for U.S. venture capital investments to exceed the $100 billion mark.
Several investors have said that they are betting the pandemic will have the lasting effect of pushing more economic activity online, making up for the businesses boarding up on Main Street. 
The investors added that they are investing in startups that aim to enable the further digitization of sectors like banking, retail and healthcare.
Fintech was a big focus for U.S. venture capital investors in 2020 with trading app Robinhood Markets Inc raising more than $1.2 billion over two deals, alternative lending company Affirm raising $500 million and digital bank Chime raising $485 million.
Other big rounds of funding this year include autonomous driving company Waymo, which raised $3 billion, and Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX, which raised $1.9 billion.

Investing.com - Zoom Video Communications reported Monday guidance that topped estimates on better-than-expected third-quarter results, but warned of higher churn in the final quarter of the year.
 Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) fell 5.6%, to $26.98.
The company said it expected to see increased churn in the fourth quarter when compared to historic churn levels due to a ""higher percentage of customers who purchased monthly subscriptions.""
For the fourth quarter, the company sees earnings in the range of 77 cents to 79 cents on revenue of $806 million to $811 million, compared with consensus estimates earnings of 63 cents on revenue of $721.2 million. 
For fiscal 2021, the company guided earnings in the range of $2.89 to $2.91 on revenue of $2.57 billion to $2.58 billion, above  Wall Street estimates for earnings of $2.51 a share on revenue of $2.41 billion.  
The company reported earnings 99 cents, up from 9 cents a year earlier, on revenue of $777.2 million, up 367%, beating estimates for earnings of 76 cents on revenue $693.4 million.
Growth in customers with more than 10 employees jumped 485% year-on-year, the company said. The number of customers contributing more than $100,000 in TTM revenue rose 136% year-over-year.
""We expect to strengthen our market position as we finish the fiscal year with an increased total revenue outlook of approximately $2.575 billion to $2.580 billion for fiscal year 2021, or approximately 314% increase year-over-year,"" the company said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday he backs another $20 billion in additional government payroll support for U.S. airlines.
""I think that would be very meaningful in terms of employment and saving the industry,"" Mnuchin said at a House hearing. A bipartisan proposal released Tuesday called for $17 billion in payroll support for airlines to extend the program for four months.
In October, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines furloughed more than 32,000 workers after a prior $25 billion payroll assistance program expired.
Airlines spent months seeking a new bailout and have won overwhelming support in the U.S. Congress, but lawmakers have been reluctant to support airlines, while other transportation modes like transit, buses, and rail railroad Amtrak are also seeking emergency aid.
The Treasury separately offered $25 billion in loans to airlines; to date it has approved more than $21 billion in loans, including $7.5 billion for both American and United.

Mnuchin also said he backed aid for the struggling private motorcoach industry. The bipartisan proposal released Tuesday would extend $8 billion to bus companies.

626,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>","Congress Pushes for Stimulus Deal by Weekend, Top Democrat Says","(Bloomberg) -- House and Senate leaders are striving for a deal on a pandemic relief package by the weekend to set up votes by the middle of next week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Wednesday.
The Maryland Democrat said he talked with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday and they agreed “it would be optimal if we could get to an agreement by this weekend.”
He acknowledged that timetable is optimistic, but said the recent flurry of proposals on a compromise offer “positive steps” forward for the long-stalled negotiations.
Still, both sides appeared to be holding to some of the earlier positions that left negotiations at a standstill. They again accused each other of putting partisanship ahead of compromise, and it was unclear on Wednesday whether Democrats and Republicans have moved far enough to provide a breakthrough.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer have presented a new stimulus proposal to McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, though they refused to release details. McConnell responded by circulating his own plan to fellow Republicans, saying it had the blessing of President Donald Trump. While he labeled it a new proposal, an outline distributed to GOP senators showed it was largely a revision of an earlier $500 billion plan that had been rejected by Democrats as inadequate.
Bipartisan Pitch
Separately, a bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House and Senate have offered a $908 billion compromise package, which so far hasn’t been embraced by leaders in either party.
Mnuchin told reporters Wednesday that he had spoken “briefly” with Pelosi Tuesday about her new pitch, but declined to offer public comment on it. He said that he didn’t plan to speak with her again Wednesday.
Asked what Trump will sign, Mnuchin said Trump favors the approximately $500 billion McConnell plan. Prior to losing the election, Trump said he wanted more than $2.2 trillion in stimulus.
The emergence of the proposals reflected the rising concerns that the economy needs another boost amid evidence that surging Covid-19 cases are undermining the recovery as past fiscal support runs out.
The pandemic also is driving action in Congress. Hoyer and other lawmakers said the continued spread of the coronavirus across the country is adding urgency to efforts to wrap up congressional business so members can return home and safely quarantine before the holidays.
Over the next 10 days, Congress also has to deal with passing a $1.4 trillion annual spending bill to fund government operations. The U.S. government has been working under a stopgap measure since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1. That expires Dec. 11, and missing the deadline would trigger a partial government shutdown.
The must-pass measure has emerged as the potential vehicle for pandemic-related relief measures, such as aid for small businesses and funding or vaccine distribution. However, there are differences there as well. Those include Trump’s demand for border wall and immigration enforcement funding, West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito said. However, she predicted a deal could be struck in time in part because lawmakers want to leave the Capitol to avoid catching Covid.
“I think we can get this done, agree on the omnibus, agree on the outlines of a Covid-19 bill” by this weekend, Hoyer said.

627,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",TUI secures third bailout in COVID travel slump survival battle,"By Arno Schuetze, Michael Nienaber and Klaus Lauer
FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - TUI secured a third bailout on Wednesday, striking a deal with the German government, private investors and banks for an extra 1.8 billion euros ($2.2 billion) as the world's largest holiday company tries to ride out the coronavirus-linked travel slump. 
London-listed TUI has already received 3 billion euros in state loans this year and the latest government aid prompted calls from opposition lawmakers for Berlin to ensure that it came with strings attached.
TUI, which last year took 23 million people on holiday, lost 1.1 billion euros in the second quarter after the COVID-19 pandemic brought global travel to a halt.
The travel slump has wiped out TUI's revenue and strained its balance sheet as it burned through between 550 million euros and 650 million euros a month. 
TUI's largest shareholder, Russian billionaire Alexey Mordashov, who owns 25% of the company, said he is expanding his investment as part of the capital measures. 
Mordashov's stake will increase to 36% if he gets an exemption from financial watchdog Bafin from making a mandatory takeover offer. Otherwise, he will hike it to 29.9%.
Including the new rescue package, TUI now has 2.5 billion euros as of the end of November, its chief executive Fritz Joussen said, adding that TUI was healthy before the crisis and now has the funds to prepare for life after the pandemic. 
The package comes with a ban on management bonuses and dividends, a German economy ministry spokeswoman said.
However, budget lawmaker Sven-Christian Kindler from the opposition Greens called on the government to include strict rules on climate and job protection into the package.
""The federal government must not repeat the same mistakes it made with the Lufthansa rescue deal,"" Kindler said, referring to a bailout of Germany's flagship airline in June.
The new TUI rescue package includes a 500 million euro capital increase with subscription rights and a 420 million euro so-called silent participation from Germany's economic support fund WSF, which can be converted into equity at any time.
It also includes a non-convertible equity hybrid from WSF worth 280 million euros, a state guarantee of 400 million euros, an extra 200 million euro credit facility from state bank KfW and the extension of an existing KfW facility to July 2022. 
The nominal price of TUI's shares will be reduced to 1 euro from 2.56 euros, followed by a rights issues of 509 million new shares, which shareholders still need to sign off at an extraordinary general meeting in January.
Some of the proceeds will be used to repay 300 million senior notes of TUI due in October 2021.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Citi and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are organising the capital hike.

The application for full approval is ""in parallel"" with emergency use approval (EUA), said Berkeley Phillips, medical director of Pfizer UK, in a briefing.
He said regulators will review the same data provided for the emergency use by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech for the full approval. He did not say when that decision may come.
Deliveries, which could land in British warehouses as soon as the weekend, could not have started until the regulators had given their go ahead, he said. Regulators will assess each batch of the vaccine for quality.
Other countries are looking at possibly following in Britain's footsteps and applying for emergency use in an effort to speed up access to the vaccine, said Ralf Rene Reinert, Pfizer Vaccines' vice president, regional lead medical and scientific affairs. He declined to name countries that are doing this.

There is no cap on volumes delivered under the EUA, said Ben Osborn, manager of Pfizer UK.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange is set to win EU antitrust approval for its $27 billion takeover of data company Refinitiv, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, bolstering its footprint in a rapidly consolidating sector.
The market for financial data has exploded with the advent of computer driven trading, triggering a rash of takeovers as companies seek to create one-stop shops to serve clients and get an edge over traditional rivals in supplying data, dubbed the new ""oil"".
A merged LSE and Refinitiv would still be eclipsed by financial data leader Bloomberg LP but it will outrank a combination of S&P and IHS Markit, whose $44 billion deal announced this week was the largest acquisition of 2020. 
The LSE, seeking to diversify into the financial data sector and reduce reliance on unpredictable trading volumes, unveiled its plan to buy Refinitiv last year, but faced hurdles in Brussels, with the deadline for EU approval pushed back to January 2021.
Last month the exchange offered to allow rivals unrestricted access to its clearing and data operations for the next 10 years as part of a package of concessions that included the sale of its Borsa Italiana operations to pan-European rival Euronext.
The sources declined to provide details of any changes to the concessions, though some said EU officials considered the Borsa Italiana sale to be a major divestment.
The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Jan. 21, declined to comment. 
The LSE and Refinitiv, which is 45%-owned by Reuters' parent  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), also declined to comment.
LSE shares tripled gains on the Reuters story and were up 8.6% in latest trade.
Like the LSE, other leading stock exchanges are looking to diversify into data and other services.
LSE rival Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) has already moved deeper into data, and in August also bought Ellie Mae, a technology platform for the mortgage finance industry, for $11 billion.
Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), whose attempt to buy Borsa Italiana was thwarted by Euronext, said last month it would buy 80% of Institutional Shareholder Services for about $1.8 billion.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc began the permanent shutdown of its 211,146 barrel-per-day (bpd) Convent, Louisiana refinery, the company said on Tuesday.
Sources familiar with plant operations told Reuters the permanent shutdown of the refinery, which Shell has been unable to sell as fuel demand has been hammered in the COVID-19 pandemic, began on Monday night.
""We’re engaged in a phased shutdown of Convent and (will) take all of the time necessary to safely accomplish that,"" said Shell spokesman Curtis Smith in an email on Tuesday.
The shutdown began when Shell idled the 12,000-bpd isomerization unit on Monday night, the sources said. The company was taking offline the 36,000-bpd diesel hydrotreater on Tuesday.
Shell said on Nov. 5 it would permanently shutter the refinery after failing to find a buyer for the plant, which had become unprofitable because of reduced demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Shell will keep the refinery on the market after it completes the shutdown by the Christmas holiday, the sources said. 
Shell and the United Steelworkers union (USW) reached agreement last week on a severance package for 350 hourly workers at Convent.
The USW and Shell agreed hourly employees will be paid three weeks for every year of service with a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 78 weeks, sources familiar with agreement said. 
That package is similar to what Shell salaried employees are being offered, they said. The number of salaried and hourly staff is about equal. Another 400 contractors work at the Convent refinery.

DALLAS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX is poised to make its first public appearance with media onboard since being grounded over fatal crashes, as one of its biggest customers, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), seeks to prove it is safe for passengers.
Wednesday's planned flight from Dallas, Texas, to Tulsa, Oklahoma, comes weeks before the first commercial passenger flight on Dec. 29, and is part of a concerted PR effort to restore the jet's image following a 20-month ban.
American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said on Instagram he had flown on the MAX with his wife and airline colleagues on Tuesday ""with the utmost peace of mind"".
Boeing's best-selling jet was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes in five months killed a combined 346 people, marking the industry's worst safety crisis in decades and undermining U.S. aviation regulatory leadership.
Wednesday's flight marks the first time anyone besides regulators and industry personnel have flown on the MAX since the grounding, which rocked the aviation industry and ignited investigations focusing on software that overwhelmed pilots.
Last month, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared the jet following design changes and new training. 
A smooth return to service for the MAX is seen as critical for Boeing's reputation and finances, which have been hit hard by a freeze on MAX deliveries as well as the coronavirus crisis.
It is bracing for intense publicity from even routine glitches by manning a 24-hour ""situation room"" to monitor every MAX flight globally, and has briefed some industry commentators on details on the return to service, industry sources said.
Boeing has said that airlines will take a direct role in demonstrating to passengers that the 737 MAX is safe. 
""We are continuing to work closely with global regulators and our customers to safely return the fleet to commercial service,"" a spokesman said.
Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes is planning a similar media event this month, with cautious hopes to fly its first commercial flights as soon as next week. 
CEREMONY SCRAPPED
The PR efforts are designed to highlight software and training upgrades which the FAA has said remove any doubt about the plane's safety.
But families of some victims of the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia have protested the return to service, saying it is premature before a final investigative report on the second crash has been released.
Boeing toned down its original plans for the plane's return as the crisis dragged on longer than it expected - scrapping a high-profile publicity campaign, a ceremony in the Seattle area and a tour using an Oman Air 737 MAX, industry sources said.
Airlines and leasing companies have spent hundreds of billions of dollars buying the latest upgrade of the 737, the world's most-sold passenger aircraft. 
Lured by sharp discounts and anxious to help repair the MAX's reputation around which they have built their fleet plans, some airlines are now stepping in to show commercial support.

Alaska Airlines agreed to lease 13 Boeing 737 MAX last week and Ireland's Ryanair is expected to place a large order for the jets as soon as this week.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday as the vaccine-fueled rally of recent days ran out of steam, President-elect Joe Biden cooled hopes for an early end to the trade war with China, and fresh data indicated that the economy slowed in November under the pressure of the latest wave of the pandemic. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 126 points or 0.4% at 29,698 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was also down 0.4%.
Payrolls processor ADP reported that private-sector payrolls rose by only 307,000 in the month through mid-November, well below the 410,000 gain expected. On a brighter note, October’s numbers were revised up to 404,000 from 365,000.
The numbers strike a downbeat tone ahead of the official government labor market report on Friday.
The New York Times had earlier cited Biden as saying in an interview that he would leave the existing import tariffs on Chinese goods in place for now and signaled a hard line against Chinese abuses in the field of trade and industrial espionage. The comments, which were at odds with the non-confrontational approach taken while he was Vice President, suggested that there will be no quick improvement in relations between the world's two largest economies. 
The momentum of the Trump administration's more hardline policy was in evidence as the House of Representatives prepared to pass a bill requiring Chinese companies to delist from U.S. exchanges if they fail to satisfy U.S. audit requirements.
The bill's arrival in the House triggered a sell-off in some Chinese tech stocks that had in any case appeared ripe for profit-taking after a violent rally in recent weeks. Electric car make Nio's (NYSE:NIO) ADRs fell over 12% at the open but recovered to be down only 6.1% by 9:45 AM ET.  Other EV companies' ADRs also suffered, with Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) falling 4.8%, Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) falling 4.6% and  China Automotive  (NASDAQ:CAAS) falling 8.1%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, meanwhile, fell 3.9% after an internal e-mail from Elon Musk claimed that the stock could fall sharply if the company failed to get its costs under control. 
""Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that’s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!” CNBC reported the e-mail as saying. 
Tesla stock is still within touching distance of the all-time high it hit earlier this week in anticipation of its inclusion in the S&P 500.

Europe's largest low-fare carrier, which has an option to expand its current order by 75 jets to 210 aircraft, declined to comment. Boeing could not immediately be reached for comment.
Ryanair has been negotiating for months to expand its order for 135 aircraft as part of discussions with Boeing over compensation for delays caused by the grounding, but no decision had been expected until the plane was cleared to resume flights.
U.S. and European regulators lifted the almost two-year flight ban last month following changes to cockpit software and training.
Ryanair is one of Boeing's largest worldwide customers and an order from the Irish carrier is seen as a pivotal moment in efforts by Boeing to rehabilitate the troubled 737 MAX, once its fastest-selling model.
The upgraded single-aisle jet was grounded in March 2019 following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in which a total of 346 people died, spawning multiple investigations.
Each MAX is worth about $125 million at list prices but jets typically sell for closer to half their catalogue value and Ryanair is expected to win even steeper discounts for placing a key order amid cancellations by some buyers, the sources said.
Alaska Airlines last month agreed to lease 13 Boeing MAX jets.
Boeing shares rose marginally to $213.38 in premarket trade.
Aviation photographer Michael Kelly tweeted a picture of a Boeing-operated private jet landing in Dublin, fuelling speculation that Ryanair bosses would travel to the United States for an announcement, echoing a previous Boeing jet deal.

In a further move to restore the jet's reputation, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was due to make the first post-grounding demonstration flight with media later on Wednesday.

639,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 08:51AM ET</span>","North Korea-linked hackers targeted J&J, Novavax in hunt for COVID research","By Raphael Satter and Jack Stubbs
WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Suspected North Korean hackers have recently tried to break into at least nine health organizations, including pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and vaccine developer  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc, revealing a broader effort to target key players in the race to develop treatments for COVID-19.
Four people who have investigated the attacks said the spate of hacking attempts began in September, and used web domains mimicking online login portals to try and trick staff at the targeted organisations into revealing their passwords.
The hacking attempts included a bid to get inside British drugmaker and vaccine developer AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), which Reuters first reported last week was in Pyongyang's crosshairs.
North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus infections, but South Korea's National Intelligence Service has said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the country had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China - the source of the pandemic - before shutting the border in late January. 
A Reuters review of publicly-available Internet records show that web domains and servers used by the attackers have previously been identified by the U.S. government and security researchers as part of a North Korean hacking campaign. 
Other targets identified by the sources, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, included the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, the University of Tuebingen in Germany, and four South Korean pharmaceutical firms: Genexine Inc, Boryung Pharma Co Ltd, Shin Poong Pharm Co Ltd and Celltrion Inc.
Reuters was not able to determine if any of the hacking attempts, some of which were reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Wednesday, were successful.
North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A message sent to an email address used by the hackers was not returned. Pyongyang, which has no direct line of contact for foreign media, has previously denied carrying out cyberattacks.
Novavax spokeswoman Amy Speak said her company was ""aware of this threat"" and was coordinating with government agencies and private cybersecurity experts.
""We are confident we can continue to progress with our COVID-19 vaccine candidate without disruption and that these incursions do not pose a risk to the integrity of our data,"" she said.
A spokeswoman for the University of Tuebingen said staff were repeatedly targeted by hackers but all recent attacks ""were detected and blocked by our IT-Team at an very early stage, no damage occurred.""
Genexine said it was aware of a malicious website impersonating a company login portal but had not recorded any direct attacks against its staff. Celltrion said it had recently identified and successfully blocked a number of hacking attempts as part of its regular security work.
Johnson & Johnson, Beth Israel, and Shin Poong declined to comment. Boryung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Simon Choi, an expert at South Korean cybersecurity group IssueMakersLab, said he had attributed the hacking attempts to North Korea and it was clear the attackers were specifically hunting for information about COVID-19. 
In the case of South Korea's Celltrion, for example, he said the spies tried to break into an email account set up to field queries about Remsima, a monoclonal antibody which is being studied as a treatment for severe cases of the disease.
A person familiar with the matter said that some of the fake login pages had been spotted by security experts at  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), helping prompt an alert the company issued last month about the threat of North Korean espionage to COVID-19 researchers. 
Microsoft stopped short of naming the targeted organizations in its Nov. 13 blog post, but said they were ""leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers"" in countries including the United States and South Korea.
Lawmakers in South Korea also appear to have alluded to the digital espionage campaign, saying last week that its intelligence service thwarted attempts by Pyongyang to hack into South Korean companies developing coronavirus vaccines, although they provided no further details.
Officially, North Korean authorities have reported no cases of coronavirus in their country, making it the only non-island nation - aside from Turkmenistan - to do so. But North Korean leader Kim Jong Un raised eyebrows last month when he was quoted by state media as ordering officials to intensify their anti-coronavirus work. 
Digital espionage against health bodies, vaccine scientists and drugmakers has intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic as state-backed hacking groups scramble to obtain the latest research and information about the outbreak.
Reuters has previously documented how hackers linked to Iran, Vietnam, South Korea, China and Russia have on separate occasions been accused of trying to steal information about the virus and its potential treatments.

Western officials say any stolen information could give foreign governments a valuable strategic advantage as they fight to contain a disease.

Car manufacturers are securing additional supply routes as policymakers in Brussels and Westminster seek to strike a deal to determine the future trading relationship with continental Europe after Britain exits the European Union.
Bentley, which makes high end sports cars, buys 90% of its components from continental Europe, and sells around 24% of its cars into Europe, Chief Executive Adrian Hallmark told the Financial Times' Future of the Car summit.
""We have spent two years planning. We have five Antonovs that we have on reserve to fly bodies to Manchester,"" Hallmark said, adding that in addition to shifting car bodies by air, Bentley has hiked the level of spare parts stored for production.
""We used to run just-in-time with two days stock. Now we have 14 days stock. That's 14 working days, so that's three weeks of stock,"" he said.
The company has booked additional warehouses and planned new logistics routes in case traditional supply methods are hampered by bottlenecks.
If Britain fails to secure a negotiated trade agreement with European policymakers, Bentley would be able to absorb 10% import tariffs by raising prices and cutting costs. This would be less damaging than supply disruptions.
""It is not existential as long as everything flows. Stopping flows is far more dangerous than Brexit tariffs,"" Hallmark said, referring to supply bottlenecks.
This year Bentley expects to sell more than 10,000 luxury cars and to reach breakeven, mainly thanks to a rebound in demand in China, Hallmark said.
China sales are up 35% when compared with before the COVID-19 crisis. Sales in Europe and the United States up 15% Hallmark said.

""Overall we are in a position where we will do well over 10,000 sales this year,"" he said via Webcast. ""We are on the cusp of going beyond breakeven.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) beat expectations for fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday, as they set aside less capital than analysts had anticipated to cover potential loan losses. 
Provisions for credit losses at Royal Bank, Canada's largest lender, fell to C$427 million ($329.65 million) in the three months through October, by over a third from the previous quarter's multi-year high and 14% from its year-ago, pre-pandemic level. Analysts had expected nearly C$800 million. 
National Bank, the smallest of Canada's six largest lenders, took provisions of C$110 million, versus the nearly C$160 million expected. 
Over the past three quarters, Canadian banks have set aside billions of dollars to cover a spike in sour loans due to the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. While the surge has resulted in profit declines, their allowances for bad loans are now at multi-year highs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain approved  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, jumping ahead of the United States and Europe to become the West's first country to formally endorse a jab it said should reach the most vulnerable people early next week.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted the medicine authority's approval as a global win and a ray of hope amid the gloom of the novel coronavirus which has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally, hammered the world economy and upended normal life.
Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted emergency use approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which they say is 95% effective in preventing illness, in record time - just 23 days since Pfizer published the first data from its final stage clinical trial.
The world's big powers have been racing for a vaccine for months to begin the long road to recovery, and getting there first may be seen as a coup for Johnson's government, which has faced criticism over its handling of the crisis.
""It's fantastic,"" Johnson said. ""The vaccine will begin to be made available across the UK from next week. It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
The approval of a jab for use almost exactly a year since the novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, is a triumph for science, Pfizer boss Albert Bourla and his German biotechnology partner BioNTech.
But the breakneck speed at which approval was given drew criticism from Brussels where, in an unusually blunt statement, the European Union's drugs regulator said its longer procedure to approve vaccines was more appropriate as it was based on more evidence and required more checks.
British leaders said that, while they would love to get a jab themselves, priority had to be given to those most in need - the elderly, those in care homes and health workers.
'NO CORNERS CUT'
The U.S. drugmaker said Britain's emergency use authorization marks a historic moment in the fight against COVID-19. Pfizer announced its vaccine breakthrough on Nov. 9 with stage III clinical trial results. 
""This authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK,"" said CEO Bourla.
Britain's medicines regulator approved the vaccine in record time by doing a ""rolling"" concurrent analysis of data and the manufacturing process while Pfizer raced to conclude trials. 
""No corners have been cut,"" MHRA chief June Raine said in a televised briefing from Downing Street, adding that the first data on the vaccine had been received in June and undergone a rigorous analysis to international standards. ""Safety is our watchword.""
""With 450 people dying of COVID-19 infection every day in the UK, the benefits of rapid vaccine approval outweigh the potential risks,"" said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Liverpool.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is set to meet on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to recommend emergency use authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it could give emergency approval for the shot by Dec. 29.
""The data submitted to regulatory agencies around the world are the result of a scientifically rigorous and highly ethical research and development programme,"" said Ugur Sahin, chief executive and co-founder of BioNTech.
BioNTech said it expected FDA and EMA to make a decision in mid December. 
Anti-poverty campaigners, meanwhile, warned against rich countries hoarding vaccines at the expense of poorer ones. ""The worst thing we can do at this moment is allow a small number of countries to monopolise access to vaccines like this,"" said Romilly  Greenhill  (NYSE:GHL), UK director of the ONE organisation. 
FIRST IN LINE? 
Britain said it would start vaccinating those most at risk of dying early next week after it gets 800,000 doses from Pfizer's manufacturing centre in Belgium.
""Age is by far the single most important factor in terms of risk from COVID-19,"" said Wei Shen Lim, head of Britain's COVID-19 vaccine committee. Lim said there had been no suggestion a vaccine would be compulsory. 
The speed of the rollout depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine - and the extreme temperature of -70C (-94F) at which the vaccine must be stored. 
Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the jab are needed per person to gain immunity.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said hospitals were ready to receive the shots and vaccination centres would be set up across the country, but he admitted distribution would be a challenge given storage at temperature typical of an Antarctic winter.
Pfizer has said the shots can be kept in thermal shipping boxes for up to 30 days. Afterwards, the vaccine can be kept at fridge temperatures for up to five days.

Other frontrunners in the vaccine race include U.S. biotech firm  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which has said its shot was 94% successful in late-stage clinical trials, and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), which said last month its COVID-19 shot was 70% effective in pivotal trials and could be up to 90% effective.

646,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Tesla’s S&P 500 Entry Takes Away Secret Weapon for Stock Pickers,"(Bloomberg) -- The celebration that has greeted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s addition to the S&P 500 has the potential to leave one of its constituencies cold: star managers who have ridden the electric-car maker’s ascent to superior returns.
Not many of the 215 active managers with at least $500 million in assets whose funds are indexed to the equity gauge have ventured to invest in Tesla. But the 21 who have are richer for the move. Almost 80% of them have beaten the benchmark this year with an average gain of 24%. Compare that to the 194 who didn’t take the plunge. Only 28% are ahead of the index, with a smaller gain of 13%.
Tesla’s entry into the S&P 500 in three weeks will rob them of that edge. The carmaker will enter as a top 10 weighting with its current market-cap of nearly $550 billion, giving it sway over the most-tracked benchmark. While its addition will no doubt spark volatility as investors offload stocks of other companies to make room, it’ll likely also create headaches for managers using Tesla to profit in a rough year for active investing.
“It could create more of a hurdle for active managers because this is obviously a stock that’s had phenomenal performance over the past few years that hasn’t been included in a lot of active managers’ prospective benchmarks and now will be,” said Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. “If Tesla continues on its run, that could be a second-derivative of including it into the S&P 500 -- it’s a more challenging environment for active managers.”
Tesla is up almost seven-fold this year, trouncing the S&P 500’s 13% and ballooning its market cap from just $75 billion at the start of 2020. S&P Dow Jones Indices -- the index’s overseer -- had considered adding the company in several steps due to its mammoth size, but announced Monday that it would include it in one shot on Dec. 21.
Tesla surged 46% in November alone, largely attributable to investors piling into it ahead of forced purchases by passive funds that track the S&P 500. Those gains might not be finished , according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Large-cap core funds opting to buy Tesla at its benchmark weight would trigger purchases totaling $8 billion, strategists including Ben Snider wrote. That’s 1.5% of the automaker’s value.
Others argue that Tesla is due for a pullback that could make it harder for the S&P 500 to move meaningfully higher. That could give managers who trail their benchmark an opportunity to catch up.
“It’s more of a question of whether Tesla will be a winner in the future like it has been in the past,” Tim Hoyle, chief investor officer at Haverford Trust Co., said by phone. “Putting stuff into an index after they’ve quintupled, probably makes it easier for active managers to beat the index.”
While Tesla’s elimination as an “alpha generator” gets press, in certain respects the phenomenon illustrates the gulf separating mutual fund performance metrics from the real-world experience of investors. To wit: An active manager who owned the stock prior to inclusion can, obviously, keep owning it afterward, maintaining exposure to Tesla’s upside. That the fund’s performance will track more closely to the S&P 500 should matter little to an investor who is, say, saving money for retirement.
Still, for managers looking to post benchmark-beating returns in hopes of attracting new clients, Tesla’s addition makes that marginally more difficult.
“Stock selection is obviously a big part of it, and owning Tesla, an outside of a benchmark name was one way,” SSGA’s Bartolini said. “But going forward, it’s going to be trickier.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%, hitting an intraday record, the S&P 500 climbed 1.1% to close at an all-time high, while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 1.3%, also a new record.
Earlier Wednesday, U.K. authorities approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, the first western country to take such a step, with the shot set to be rolled out from early next week.
This medication is also in front of both European and U.S. regulators, with the expectation that approval from these bodies should also be received fairly promptly.
The U.S. suffered more than 2,500 deaths due to Covid-19 in a 24-hour period through Tuesday, the highest total since April, while the number of hospitalizations also rose to 99,000, a new record. Hospital admissions as a percentage of positive cases are falling across the U.S., suggesting that the strain on hospitals is causing the bar for admissions to be raised.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in their testimony to the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, referenced the hit to the economy from this new surge in infections while urging lawmakers to agree on another economic stimulus package. They both testify in front of the House later Wednesday.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a $908 billion stimulus plan on Tuesday. This was quickly shot down by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, but the fact the two sides are talking again has boosted sentiment.
The main economic release Wednesday is the ADP monthly employment report, ahead of Friday’s official jobs report. The U.S. private sector is expected to have added 410,000 people to payrolls in November, up from 365,000 in October.
In the corporate sector, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) will be in focus after the cloud-based software company announced Tuesday it was buying workplace messaging app Slack (NYSE:WORK) for $27.7 billion, in what would be one of the biggest tech mergers in recent years.
Oil prices were mixed Wednesday, amid growing uncertainty after OPEC and its allies postponed to Thursday a decision over the level of next year’s supply, raising concerns that pressure is growing within the group to raise output despite the current weak overall demand.

""There will be consolidation. Not everybody will be able to afford these complex platforms. We will see emerging a smaller number of very large players who will drive this transformation,"" Hitzinger told the FT's Future of the Car summit.
The need to connect autonomous driving sensors to electric motors, batteries and high-definition maps is forcing carmakers to design vehicle underpinnings and car software operating systems in house rather than stitching together legacy code and systems provided by a myriad of suppliers.
Project Artemis is VW's attempt to do just that. 
""Cars are so complex that the traditional concept where you outsource to tier one manufacturers does not work any more,"" Hitzinger explained in a Webcast. 

The investment sums and the complexity of the technology favours larger players since falling sales, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, is making it harder for smaller companies to stem the investments needed to develop cutting edge cars, he said.

649,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 06:04AM ET</span>",StockBeat: IWG Bets on the Return of the Office,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets, like the U.S.’s, have bought in to the idea of a vaccine-driven recovery next year so heavily that there is no energy left among buyers to reward a company for positioning itself to do likewise.
On a day when the broader market was taking a breather after another giddying rally to kick off December, IWG (LON:IWG) shares fell over 7% as the office rental company moved to take advantage of the acquisition opportunities created by the pandemic.
IWG, whose longer-term outlook had already been substantially improved by rival WeWork’s implosion last year, said Wednesday it’s raising around 300 million pounds in convertible bonds with an eye to snapping up opportunities in the U.S., Europe, the U.K. and Asia, betting that the city office (and, equally, the suburban office) has a bright future as and when the coronavirus recedes.  
That’s a clear change in tone from its third-quarter results posted only a couple of weeks ago, which were still dominated by news of rationalizations, rent deferrals and provisions. The company’s sales were down 13% in constant currency terms as of September, while occupancy rates fell over 4 percentage points to 70.5%.
Even then, there were signs that IWG was turning the corner, having managed to swing to a net cash position. But Wednesday’s announcement is a very different kettle of fish. It’s the act of a company that knows that bargains are available now that may not be available for very long.
IWG has already begun snapping up properties, notably from WeWork itself. Last week, it took over a 79,000 square foot former WeWork location in Williamsburg, just across the East River from Manhattan. It’s also taken over another WeWork location in Hong Kong.
The bonds being offered will run for five years with coupons of between 0.5% and 1.25%. The initial conversion price is expected to be set at a premium of between 35% and 40%, which would guarantee founder Mark Dixon – the owner of the shares underlying the conversion option – a price equivalent to the one where they were trading before the pandemic struck.
Skeptics may see the move as a sell-down by the company’s biggest shareholder. The company would argue that it has prioritized keeping debt at manageable levels in such an uncertain environment and, having succeeded, doesn’t want to undo the good work by issuing plain vanilla debt now.
Either way, the shares, which were on a tear before the pandemic, have still only recovered half of their losses since February. That only makes the company’s optimism even more conspicuous."

The move marks a reorganisation of the company's disparate operations on the continent, bringing them within one entity headed by Mike Whitfield, who has previously served as managing director of Nissan's units in both South Africa and Egypt.
""Beyond internal operating enhancements, this also positions Nissan to focus on the massive opportunity that Africa presents to the organisation globally,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
Sub-Saharan Africa's population and household incomes are rising. But its 1 billion inhabitants account for only 1% of the world's new passenger car sales, based on industry data. 
Most carmakers have focused manufacturing and sales in South Africa - the continent's most developed economy - which accounts for 85% of Africa's new car purchases.
Nissan, along with competitors Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW, and Toyota, have been lobbying African governments to grant conditions that favour local assembly and manufacturing while curbing imports of cheap used cars. 

Carmakers are also hoping to take advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area, which is expected to come into force early next year and will reduce tariffs and ease the flow of goods between its members states.

The Houston-based company in August filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, joining a list of brick-and-mortar retailers succumbing to the hit from the COVID-19 pandemic.
It confirmed a restructuring plan last month that consisted of a $430 million lending facility. 
Tailored Brands said on Tuesday it now operates with a capital structure that includes an exit term loan of $365 million, which it expects will support its ongoing operations and strategic initiatives. 

The company in July announced plans to cut its workforce by 20% and shut as many as 500 stores, in response to the impact of the pandemic.

653,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Ant considers Paytm stake sale amid tensions with India - sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee, Aditi Shah and Anirban Sen
HONG KONG/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chinese fintech giant Ant Group is considering selling its 30% stake in Indian digital payment processor Paytm amid tensions between the two Asian neighbours and a toughening competitive landscape, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Financial details of the possible transaction have not been firmed up and Ant, the Alibaba-backed payments-to-consumer credit behemoth, has not launched a formal sale process yet, four people told Reuters.
Paytm, which is also backed by SoftBank Group Corp among others, was valued at about $16 billion during its latest private fundraising round a year ago. At that valuation, Ant's stake in the Indian firm is worth about $4.8 billion.
Both Ant and Paytm said that the information was incorrect. A Paytm spokesman said ""there has been no discussion with any of our major shareholders ever, nor any plans, about selling their stake.""
Ant's possible exit from Paytm would mark another reversal for the Chinese company hot on the heels of the dramatic suspension of its $37 billion stock listing last month, which would have been the world's largest.
It also would be a step back from its ambitions of becoming a global payments leader. Sources told Reuters in October that Ant was cutting its financial support to many of the overseas affiliated e-wallet firms.
The main trigger for Ant to consider the divestment of its stake in Paytm is the worsening diplomatic relations between India and China in the past few months, said the people, who declined to be named as the deliberations are confidential.
Relations between the countries are at a nadir, with troops locked in a border face-off in the western Himalayas for months after a clash in June in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.
Since the clash India has tightened rules for investments from China and banned dozens of Chinese mobile apps, including from tech giants Tencent,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and ByteDance. It banned 43 more apps late last month.
""There is a growing realisation within Ant management that it would not be able to raise its stake in the company,"" one of the people with direct knowledge said, adding senior managers at Ant have discussed the idea recently. 
Even so, Ant was in the middle of an investment review and it could still decide to shelve a divestment if it failed to get the desired valuation, he said.
Two other sources said that as a result of the review Ant could end up retaining a small stake in Paytm.
COMPETITIVE INTENSITY
Indian start-ups are heavily funded by Chinese investors such as Alibaba and Tencent. Bankers have previously said they were looking to bolster their presence in the country with an aim to grow their revenue outside China.
Alibaba has invested over $4 billion in India so far and had plans to invest around $5 billion in 2021, which have now been put on hold, one of the sources said.
Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment.
Ant first invested in Paytm in 2015 and owns its 30% stake in the firm via its parent company, One97 Communications, according to Ant's initial public offering prospectus, which described the Indian firm as a major associate.
In addition to the tighter investment rules for Chinese companies in India, tougher competition is likely another factor behind Ant's calculations regarding Paytm, which is losing its dominance, two of the people said.
Online transactions, lending and e-wallet services have been growing rapidly in India, led by a government push to make the country's cash-loving merchants and consumers adopt digital payments.

That has led to the entry and expansion of Facebook-owned WhatsApp, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Pay, and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s PhonePe. Some domestic players are also expanding operations.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks hovered near record highs on Wednesday on hopes for a coronavirus vaccine and additional U.S. economic stimulus, though enthusiasm for riskier assets left the dollar stuck at a 2-1/2 year low.
Britain on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use, saying it would start rolling it out early next week.
The two drug firms and competitor  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have also sought emergency use approval from European regulators this week.
Top U.S. health officials have announced plans to start vaccinating Americans as early as mid-December once regulatory approvals are in place. Nationwide deaths hit 2,295 on Monday the highest toll in six months. 
""Approval of a highly effective vaccine may mark the beginning of the end to the COVID-19 economic turmoil and the beginning of a new bull market for equities,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 
""The scientists have come to the rescue and delivered what investors were hoping for Christmas.""
Despite the positive news, European stocks struggled to add to their recent surge in early trading but MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe inched up 0.1% to keep it near an all-time high. 
The dollar was stuck at 2-1/2 year lows against the euro and an index of major currencies as investors sought out the higher risk currencies that had fallen during the earlier stages of the pandemic. 
Yields on euro zone government bonds edged up to their highest in three weeks at -0.51%.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech said their vaccine could be launched in the European Union as early as this month, though a European regulator clouded the schedule when it said it would complete its review of their vaccine by Dec. 29.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said the early approval and roll-out of the vaccine in Britain ""raises the prospect that life could return closer to normal early next year"". 
Shares in BioNTech surged by more than 8% before trimming gains, though European shares slipped overall by 0.3%, shuffling below recent nine-month highs. 
HOT OIL 
Markets were also hoping for more fiscal relief. Top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Congress should include new coronavirus stimulus in a $1.4 trillion spending bill aimed at heading off a government shutdown in the midst of the pandemic.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden told the New York Times his priority is getting a generous aid package through Congress even before he takes office in January.
U.S. stock futures declined 0.23% following a record closing high for Wall Street shares.
The pound was under some pressure, however, as a senior EU diplomat said UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union ""still hangs in balance"".
Sterling fell more than 0.5% to $1.3354. UK blue-chip stocks were steady. 
In Asia, shares in China recovered from early losses and rose 0.12%.
Tokyo stocks were little changed after setting a new 29-year high. Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group shares fell 0.66% after Bloomberg News said the tech investor is winding down its options trades on companies including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
Oil prices were also lifted by the vaccine optimism, reversing earlier losses made after OPEC and its allies left markets in limbo by postponing a formal meeting to decide whether to lift output in January.

Brent crude futures rose 0.15% to $47.49 per barrel, while U.S. crude was down 0.09% at $44.51 per barrel. Oil has raced up nearly 30% over the last month.

(Reuters) - European shares slipped on Wednesday as investors took stock following a near 14% rally last month, while shares in BioNTech surged after UK became the first country to approve its COVID-19 vaccine developed with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
London's blue-chip index outperformed regional peers, up 0.1% after Britain said the vaccine will be rolled out from next week, and as the pound slid on Brexit trade deal uncertainty.
""As vaccines get approved and rolled out, the outlook for the economy should improve,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics.
The FTSE 100 has been inching towards pre-pandemic levels, having recovered 60% from March lows.
BioNtech's Frankfurt-listed shares jumped 7.5%, compared with a 0.5% fall for Germany's benchmark DAX index. Data showing a higher-than-expected rebound in retail sales in Europe's largest economy in October did little to cheer investors.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.3%, with auto stocks leading declines as carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) slipped 2.1% amid uncertainty about top management.
""(The moves) come against the backdrop of a few weeks of very sharp rallies in European markets on the vaccine, so it's not unusual that there will be days when the rally moderates slightly,"" Gambarini said.
""I certainly don't think this will be the beginning of a correction, as more positive news will probably be coming our way regarding the vaccines.""
Stimulus developments were also on the radar after the New York Times reported that U.S. President elect Joe Biden said his priority was getting a generous coronavirus aid package through Congress even before he takes office in January.
Biden added he will not act immediately to remove the Phase 1 trade agreement with China reached by President Donald Trump, according to the report. A tariff war between the world's two biggest economies had roiled markets and slowed global economic growth.
Investors also kept an eye on moves by Britain and the European Union as Brexit trade talks were still stuck.

""A deal still hangs in the balance"" the EU's Brexit negotiator said on Wednesday. The bloc had said it would launch contingency measures on Wednesday or Thursday, if unable to reach an agreement by then.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group said on Wednesday it will introduce an electric vehicle-only platform early next year that will use its own battery technology to cut production time and costs.
The plan underscores efforts by the world's No.5 auto group to become a major player in the global EV market, as car makers around the world are pouring billions of dollars of investment to improve battery technology, which keeps EV prices high compared with combustion engine models.
Market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said in September it aims to halve the cost of its EV batteries and bring more production of the key auto component in-house to lower EV prices to $25,000 each.
Hyundai expects its dedicated Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) will allow it to use its own battery module technology across various EV models and cut the number of components by 60%.
""E-GMP will be highly effective in expanding the Group's EV leadership position as it will enable the company to enlarge its EV line-up over a relatively short period through modularisation and standardisation,"" it said in a statement.
An electric vehicle based on E-GMP will offer a driving range of 500 kms (310 miles) or more on a single charge, an improvement of at least 23% from the Kona EV, the longest driving range model among Hyundai's EV lineups.
However, Hyundai's R&D chief Albert Biermann said the company doesn't see the need to make its own battery cells and is content with cooperating with its suppliers including SK Innovation Co Ltd and LG Chem Ltd's LG Energy Solution. 
Hyundai Motor and its sister company Kia Motors together aim to sell 1 million EVs in 2025 to become the world's third-largest seller of EVs. 

It has promised 23 new EVs including 11 all-electric models by 2025 and plans to introduce a family of EVs under the Ioniq brand from early next year to spearhead its near-term transition toward EV production.

At 4:05 AM ET (0905 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index outperformed, climbing 0.1%. These indices posted strong gains Tuesday, the first day of December, continuing the previous month’s sharp move higher.
In Europe, British regulators approved Wednesday the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use, with distribution beginning next week. This positive news is likely to be duplicated in the European Union shortly, with this vaccine, as well as Moderna’s, already in front of the European regulator. 
German retail sales rebounded in October, climbing 2.6% on the month, while negotiators from both the European Union and Britain tried to strike a post-Brexit trade deal before the end of the week.
In corporate news, G4S (LON:GFS) stock rose 7.5% after Canada's GardaWorld increased its offer for the British security services company to 235 pence a share from 190p, now valuing it at 3.68 billion pounds ($4.92 billion).
On the flip side, office provider IWG (LON:IWG) fell 7.7% after launching a 300 million pound convertible bond offering.
A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers unveiled a $908 billion stimulus plan on Tuesday. Although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly killed the proposal, the fact a new plan is back on the table has investors hopeful for a new package in the near future.
Oil prices were mixed Wednesday, amid uncertainty over whether a group of leading producers will maintain current supply levels going into the new year.
Industry data from the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday showed U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.1 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a draw of 2.3 million barrels. Official data are due later in Wednesday’s session.
This release emerged after OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, had postponed to Thursday a decision over the level of next year’s supply, raising concerns that pressure is growing within the group to raise output despite the current weak overall demand.

(Reuters) - A recovery from the pandemic will be erratic but loose monetary policy around the world and vaccine optimism would keep risk assets supported, a global markets strategist at Invesco said on Wednesday.
Asia-Pacific equities, specifically markets in Greater China and North Asia, are expected to rise on COVID-19 containment measures, a rebound in economic activity and increased capital expenditure from the 5G rollout, David Chao, global markets strategist for Asia Pacific at Invesco, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
""I am very much overweight equities over fixed income... 2021 could be a great year for emerging market (EM) stocks,"" Chao said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, 2021.
Stock markets in the United States are expected to go through a period of correction, Chao said, adding that a broader rotation into value and cyclical stocks in the near-term was likely.
""From a fundamental standpoint, widespread inoculation will fuel a pickup in global demand, which should see cyclicals and value stocks rally relative to growth,"" he said.
From a valuation perspective, Chao said, the disparity between value stocks, at 17 times price-to-earnings (P-E), and growth stocks, at 38 times P-E, was greater than the early-2000 record.
""For a continued rally of value stocks, there needs to be economic growth, higher inflation, rising bond yields and improved corporate earnings, which will hinge on a vaccine being approved and available to the public,"" he added.
Chao expected the U.S. dollar to weaken in the first half of 2021 due to ample liquidity from the Federal Reserve's ultra-loose monetary policies and additional fiscal stimulus measures.
For those same reasons and as a vaccine becomes available, Chao said inflation could ""finally start to rear its head"" in the second half of 2021.
""There will be a day of reckoning ... and the first sign will be inflation and then credit defaults. However, that day isn't on the horizon just yet,"" he said, while adding that those policies are needed globally to ensure the pandemic doesn't cause permanent economic damage.

(Reuters) - Earnings of Chinese banks in the third quarter slipped by a smaller margin than in the prior quarter, signalling a potential turnaround for a sector whose valuations are near five-year lows.
An analysis of 24 major Chinese banks by market capitalisation showed that combined profit fell just 4.8% in the third quarter, compared with a 24% slump in the prior quarter.
Earnings were bolstered by a surge in loan growth and smaller provisions for loan losses, the data showed.

""Chinese banks are showing the first signs of recovery after taking a big hit from the coronavirus pandemic,"" Alicia Garcia Herrero, a chief economist at Natixis said in a report.
The banks were supported by faster asset growth, which surged to 11% in Q3 2020 from 8.1% in 2019, she said.
""Although the monetary stance has turned prudent from June 2020, loans are still growing faster than in 2019,"" she said.
Data from the China Banking Regulatory Commission showed that loan loss provision ratio of commercial banks fell to 3.53% in the third quarter, slightly less than in the prior quarter.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvklmrqpm/Chinese%20commercial%20banks'%20loan%20loss%20provision%20ratio.jpg
Shen Juan, an analyst at Huatai Securities, expects the net profit of listed banks to grow 7.1% year-on-year in 2021, as policy support for smaller firms, private enterprises and the infrastructure sector boost lending. 
Shares of Chinese banks have slumped about 7% this year, versus the overall market's 25% gain.
Refinitiv data show the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of the MSCI China Bank index at 4.67 by the end of last month, slightly above 4.4 in September – the lowest in nearly five years.
For a graphic on Chinese banks' forward 12 month PE ratio:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakvexlazpr/Chinese%20banks'%20forward%2012%20month%20PE%20ratio.jpg
The banking sector's valuation may be boosted as regulators hasten the opening-up of the capital market and investment flows into mainland shares increase, said Huatai's Shen.
However, the sector still faces a few challenges in terms of margins and asset quality, analysts say.
China's interest rates, indicated by Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, have climbed this year.
However, the bank prime loan rate rate has not moved much, implying pressure on interest margins. Banks use prime loan rates as a benchmark to determine lending rates.
A spurt of missed debt payments by three Chinese state-owned firms has also shaken the credit markets, fanning some fears that banks have to set aside more money as provisions for loan losses.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, consolidating after recent strong gains, although hopes for more U.S. fiscal stimulus as well as Covid-19 vaccine expectations continue to provide support.
There will be a particular focus on the U.K. market, after British regulators said they had approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use and would begin distribution next week. 
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. was down 0.2%. 
The major averages posted strong gains Tuesday, the first day of December, with the FTSE 100 closing up 1.9%, the CAC 40 up 1.1% and the DAX gaining 0.7%, continuing the previous month’s sharp move higher.
A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers unveiled a $908 billion stimulus plan on Tuesday. Although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly killed the proposal, the fact a new plan is back on the table has investors hopeful for a new package in the near future.
In Europe, both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have sought emergency approval of their vaccine candidates from the European regulator, suggesting these vaccines could be launched in the European Union as early as this month. 
German retail sales rebounded in October, climbing 2.6% on the month, although this figure won’t take in the recent restrictions to try and curb the second surge of the Covid-19 virus.
Additionally, negotiators from both the European Union and Britain are rushing to strike a post-Brexit trade deal before the end of the week, with fishing rights seen as the main obstacle remaining.
Oil prices fell Wednesday, weighed by a surprise increase in crude inventories in the U.S. as well as uncertainty over whether a group of leading producers will maintain current supply levels going into the new year.
Industry data from the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday showed U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.1 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a draw of 2.3 million barrels. Official data are due later in Wednesday’s session.
This release emerged after OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, had postponed to Thursday a decision over the level of next year’s supply, raising concerns that pressure is growing within the group to raise output despite the current weak overall demand. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $44.25 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $47.19. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,814.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2074.

(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Wednesday it would lift the $35 minimum order value that subscribers of its loyalty service had to meet for next-day or two-day shipping, as the retailer gears up for a holiday season dominated by online shopping.
The change, starting Friday, only applies to items on the retailer's website such as toys, appliances and clothing, the company said, adding that groceries, which are delivered from stores, will still have the $35 minimum.
Walmart Plus, touted as a rival to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime subscription service, was launched just over two months ago aiming to attract new customers and make existing ones more loyal as consumers consolidate their shopping to just a few retailers due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Walmart Plus costs $98 a year or $12.95 a month.
With coronavirus infections spiking across the United States, expectations have grown that Americans will do a bigger chunk of their holiday shopping from their living rooms and home offices instead of going out to stores.
""We just thought that now, in advance of the holidays, given where we are with the state of the pandemic, now is the absolute right time to have free shipping with no minimum,"" Janey Whiteside, chief customer officer at Walmart, told Reuters.
 
The number of online-only shoppers jumped 44% during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in the United States, the National Retail Federation said on Tuesday.

Japan has traditionally prided itself on being racially homogeneous, although successful mixed-race athletes such as tennis star Naomi Osaka are challenging that image.
The commercial, ""Keep Moving: Yourself, the Future,"" released on Nov 30, shows several teen girls bullied in school over their race or other differences, but who ultimately find confidence through soccer prowess.
One scene features a girl whose father is Black surrounded by fellow students, squealing and pulling her hair.
The video, viewed 14.1 million times on Nike Japan's Twitter feed by noon (0300 GMT) Wednesday, had racked up 63,000 likes but also a cascade of critical comments from many who vowed never to buy Nike products again.
""Nowadays, you often see one or two people of different nationalities going to school perfectly peacefully. The one that's prejudiced is Nike,"" wrote one user named ""hira1216"".
Another asked, ""Is it so much fun to blame Japan?""
Although Japanese sports fans have celebrated Osaka, who counts Nike as a sponsor and makes a cameo appearance in the ad, she was once depicted as a cartoon character by another sponsor, Nissin, with pale hair and light brown hair, while a comedy duo said she ""needed some bleach"".
Nike Japan was not immediately able to comment on the response, but said on its website it believes in the transformative nature of sports.
""We have long listened to minority voices, supported and spoken for causes that fit our values,"" it added.

""We believe sports have the power to show what a better world looks like, to bring people together and encourage action in their respective communities.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has given U.S. start-up Eat Just the greenlight to sell its lab-grown chicken meat, in what the firm says is the world's first regulatory approval for so-called clean meat that does not come from slaughtered animals.
Demand for alternatives to regular meat is surging due to consumer concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment. Plant-based meat options, popularised by Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc and Impossible Foods, increasingly feature on supermarket shelves and restaurant menus.
But so-called clean or cultured meat, which is grown from animal muscle cells in a lab, is still at a nascent stage given high production costs.
""The first-in-the-world regulatory allowance of real, high-quality meat created directly from animal cells for safe human consumption paves the way for a forthcoming small-scale commercial launch in Singapore,"" Eat Just said on Wednesday.
The firm said the meat will be sold as nuggets and had previously pegged their cost at $50 each.
But co-founder and CEO Josh Tetrick said the cost has since come down and the meat would be priced at parity to premium chicken when it first launches in a restaurant in Singapore ""in the very near term"". He declined to give exact details or costs.
The company is targeting operating profitability before the end of 2021, and hopes to go public soon after, Tetrick added.

Globally more than two dozen firms are testing lab-grown fish, beef and chicken, hoping to break into an unproven segment of the alternative meat market, which  Barclays  (LON:BARC) estimates could be worth $140 billion by 2029.

Oil and gas producers have cut the value of their assets by about $80 billion and shed tens of thousands of jobs this year as the coronavirus pandemic savaged global energy demand and pushed energy prices down. 
ConocoPhillips posted a loss of $1.93 billion through the first nine months of this year, compared with a $6.47 billion profit in the same period last year. Its shares traded at $39.27 on Tuesday, down about 40% year to date. 
Affected employees will be notified Feb. 1, about when ConocoPhillips expects to complete its $9.7 billion acquisition of U.S. shale producer Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Inc. Employees who lose their jobs will receive severance pay and help finding new positions, it said. 
Administrative and oil-exploration jobs were identified as facing cuts when the Concho deal was disclosed in October. Executives have targeted $500 million in cost and capital savings through 2022.
“We have been transparent with employees that targeted workforce reductions in certain areas of our business may be necessary from time to time to align organizational capacity with expected future activity levels,"" said spokesman John Roper, describing the cuts as among actions. 
Conoco's global staff numbered about 10,400 at the start of the year and Concho had about 1,450 employees.

671,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",Oil Trader Trafigura Denies Brazil Prosecutor Bribery Claims,"(Bloomberg) -- Trafigura Group Ltd. denied bribery allegations leveled by Brazilian prosecutors in a civil lawsuit claiming the commodities trader and its staff participated in a kickback scheme to win business with state oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
The Brazilian legal claim names Trafigura’s head of oil trading Jose Larocca and Chief Operating Officer Mike Wainwright as defendants.
“The Brazilian authorities’ allegations against the company and any suggestion that Trafigura’s current management authorized or had knowledge of improper payments to employees of Petrobras are not supported by evidence,” a Trafigura spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
The suit marks the most serious legal action yet against an international commodity trading house in Brazil’s long-running ‘Lava Jato’ or Carwash corruption probe. The claim seeks fines and penalties against Trafigura as the company itself cannot be criminally charged in Brazil.
Federal prosecutors allege the trading house and staff paid 6.9 million reais ($1.3 million) in bribes to Petrobras employees to win fuel oil contracts in 2012 and 2013. Trafigura earned ill-gotten profits of $37.3 million from the deals to the detriment of the state-controlled company, the prosecutors say in the civil lawsuit. They are seeking to freeze as much as 1 billion reais in assets from Trafigura and some staff.
Trafigura “strongly denies these allegations,” the spokesperson said.
Code Names
The legal escalation marks another setback for the commodities trading industry which has, for years, tried to shake off a reputation for furtive deal-making around the world.
Petrobras traders, using code names such as Phil Collins, Mr. M and Popeye, negotiated the payment of a bribe of 10 to 20 cents per barrel of fuel oil sold to Trafigura, according to emails and documents attached to the lawsuit. The documents were provided by former Petrobras traders and Mariano Marcondes Ferraz, a former Trafigura board member and senior executive, who was convicted and sentenced in 2018 as part of the Carwash probe.
Ferraz, according to a sworn affidavit, says Trafigura’s late co-founder Claude Dauphin and Larocca, the current head of oil, had knowledge of the bribery payments, although they were not on the front line dealing with Petrobras.
In the aftermath of the Carwash corruption scandal, Petrobras put a stronger compliance and governance system in place, and is cooperating with authorities, Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco said in an interview.
“The positive side of this case is the company learned many lessons on how not to do things,” Branco said. “It’s like an MBA in corruption and mismanagement.”
Laptop Seized
Ferraz said he spoke directly with chief operating officer Wainwright any time he needed more funds to make the bribery payments, the prosecutors allege in the suit. Ferraz’s laptop, apprehended by the federal police, also had a draft of an email listing some of the illicit payments, according to the lawsuit.
Asked for comment from the individual executives named in the suit, Trafigura referred to the company statement.
One of the Petrobras traders involved in the alleged scheme, Rodrigo Berkowitz, has agreed to plead guilty to a felony in the U.S. and is cooperating with U.S authorities. The former Trafigura executive and board member, Ferraz, was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison on corruption charges in 2018. He resigned from the board in 2016 after being arrested.
Many of the biggest trading houses including Trafigura, Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc and Gunvor Group have vowed to stop using intermediaries or agents in foreign countries in an effort to root out bribery and corruption. They’ve also agreed to disclose some payments made to governments for oil deals.
Rival international commodity traders Vitol Group and Glencore have also been targeted by investigators in Brazil as part of the Carwash probe. The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation are also involved in the cases, Brazilian officials have said. In Switzerland, where many of the top traders have major operations, local police searched the Geneva offices of Trafigura and Vitol in 2019, as part of the probe.
Vitol, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, has said it has a “zero tolerance” policy regarding bribery and corruption and is cooperating with Brazilian investigators. Chief Executive Russell Hardy has said he expects the Brazil investigation involving Vitol to be resolved this year.

The 10 days of tests were part of the Boeing Airpower Teaming System programme, which has developed prototype ""Loyal Wingman"" aircraft with the Royal Australian Air Force that can carry weapons and shield manned fighter jets.
""With the size, number and speed of aircraft used in the test, this is a very significant step for Boeing and industry in the progress of autonomous mission systems technology,"" said Emily Hughes, director of Boeing's Phantom Works International.
Defence contractors are investing increasingly in autonomous technology as militaries around the world look for a cheaper and safer way to maximise their resources.
Hughes said the tests in Australia demonstrated success in applying artificial intelligence algorithms to ""teach"" the aircraft's brain to understand what was required of it.
""The data link capabilities enabled the aircraft to communicate with the other platforms so that they could collaborate to achieve a mission,"" she said.
The Loyal Wingman prototype is expected to make its first flight this year and Boeing sees mass production likely happening by the middle of the decade.
The Loyal Wingman aircraft is 38 feet long (11.6 metres), has a 2,000 nautical mile (3,704 km) range and a nose that can be removed to fit various payloads.

The 3.4 metre surrogate jets reached speeds of up to 270 kilometres (167 miles) per hour, Boeing said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nikola Corp's stock dropped 15% on Tuesday, extending its recent drop as certain insiders were allowed to sell shares of the electric truck maker a day after General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) revised its deal with Nikola.
The stock posted a fourth straight session of declines. The share lockup period expired on Monday, 180 days after the startup's June merger with VectoIQ Acquisition and its Nasdaq public debut. 
By late Tuesday, more than $1.2 billion worth of Nikola's shares had been traded on U.S. exchanges, compared with a daily average of about $1.9 billion over the past five sessions, according to Refinitiv data.
Nikola shares sold off Monday after GM scrapped its deal that involved an equity stake in the startup and plans for building Nikola's Badger electric pickup truck. It replaced it with a non-binding agreement where GM will supply its fuel-cell system to Nikola.
Analysts at RBC cut their price target on the stock by $2 to $17 following the news. The stock closed Tuesday at $17.37.
Nikola's former boss Trevor Milton owns most of Nikola's locked up shares, and under U.S. Securities and Exchange requirements would need to file notice within two business days following a sale of his shares.
A spokesman for Milton, who owns 91.6 million shares in Nikola, declined to comment on Milton's plans for his stake.
Milton stepped down as executive chairman in September following a squabble with short-seller Hindenburg Research over allegations of nepotism and fraud.
The short-seller report came days after GM first said it would help scale up Nikola's Badger electric pickup production and take an 11% stake and $700 million, putting the deal under scrutiny.
As of Monday, Nikola's short-sellers were profitable in 2020, with a net-of-financing mark-to-market profit of $309 million for the year, according to a report Monday from Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.
""More stock loan supply coming from Trevor Milton's potential stock sales should ease the pressure on stock loan rates but also help drive down its stock price as well,"" Dusaniwsky noted. 

Shares of Nikola, which were at $33.75 after its early June market debut, surged to a record high of $93.99 later that month after Milton announced the company would start taking reservations for its highly anticipated Badger pickup.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group representing major automakers on Tuesday vowed to work with President-elect Joe Biden on efforts to reduce vehicle emissions even as the industry remains split over whether to let California set its own emission rules.
John Bozzella, who heads the Alliance for Automotive Innovation representing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and most major automakers, said the group ""looks forward to engaging with the incoming Biden administration ... to advance the shared goals of reducing emissions and realizing the benefits of an electric future.""
Biden has made boosting electric vehicles (EV) a top priority and pledged to spend billions to add 550,000 EV charging stations. He also supports new tax credits for EV purchases and retrofitting factories for EV production.
""The long-term future of the auto industry is electric,"" Bozzella said in a statement after automakers held a virtual meeting Tuesday. ""We are investing hundreds of billions to develop the products that will drive this electric future, and we are committed to working collaboratively.""
Ford urged automakers to consider backing a framework deal with California on vehicle emissions in a bid to reach industry consensus before Biden takes office, according to a letter first reported by Reuters on Monday, but automakers did not immediately take that step.
Last week, GM abruptly announced it would no longer back the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to bar California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules.
In October 2019, GM joined Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and other automakers in backing President Donald Trump in the California fight.
Environmental Working Group President Ken Cook said Tuesday ""by continuing to support this futile fight, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler are signaling their disregard for cleaning our air, curbing the climate crisis and saving motorists millions at the gas pump.""
Ford, Honda Motor Co, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW in July 2019 struck a voluntary agreement with California on reducing vehicle emissions that is less stringent than Obama-era rules but higher than the Trump administration's rollback .

Aides said there is bipartisan backing for the measure. Measures taking a harder line on Chinese business and trade practices generally pass Congress with large margins.
The bill, sponsored by Republican Senator John Kennedy and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, passed the Senate in May by unanimous consent, so House passage would send it to the White House for President Donald Trump to veto or sign into law.
White House aides did not respond to a request for comment on the president's plans, but congressional aides said they did not expect the president would object to the measure. Trump is a strong critic of China's business practices.
The measure also would require public companies disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.
The bill would give Chinese companies like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp Ltd and China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd three years to comply with U.S. rules before being removed from U.S. markets.

The backdrop of progress on the vaccine front helped eased some investor fears that infections could continue to ramp in the weeks ahead as more people gather over the holidays.
U.S. coronavirus cases in America have doubled in a month to a record four million.
The impact of the rising Covid-19 cases appears to have triggered a sense of urgency among lawmakers to ramp-up efforts on a stimulus relief program that many argue is needed to support the economy until a widespread vaccine rollout.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to reignite talks over a new stimulus deal as lawmakers on Capitol Hill reportedly proposed a $908 billion coronavirus relief bill that includes aid for various parts of the economy including small businesses and unemployed Americans.
The positive news on vaccines prompted optimism from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell who touted upside risks in the medium-term for the economy, though continued to reiterate a long road to recovery. 
In the medium term, there is upside risk, though there in the near term, there are a lot of small businesses in danger of going out of business this winter,"" Powell said. ""We do have a long way to go on recovery.""
Value stocks – those linked with the performance of the economy, clawed back some of their losses from a day earlier, with financials among the biggest gainers, up nearly 2%.

681,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 04:01PM ET</span>",Airbnb aims for $35 billion valuation in long-awaited IPO,"By Anirban Sen, Joshua Franklin and Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Airbnb Inc said on Tuesday it is aiming for a valuation of up to $34.8 billion in its initial public offering (IPO), in what would cap a stunning recovery in its fortunes after the U.S. home rental firm's business was heavily damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year.
In a regulatory filing, Airbnb set a target price range of between $44 and $50 apiece to sell 51.9 million shares, which would pull in $2.6 billion. Airbnb could end up selling $2.85 billion at the upper end of the range.
Of the shares being sold, Airbnb founders Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk will together sell nearly $100 million worth of shares in the IPO launch. 
Airbnb struggled in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic as travel came to a grinding halt. It had to lay off a quarter of its workforce and seek $2 billion in emergency funding from investors, including private equity firms Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners.
But as lockdowns eased, more travelers opted to book homes instead of hotels, helping Airbnb post a surprise profit for the third quarter. The San Francisco-based firm also gained from increased interest in renting homes away from major cities.
""Looking at Airbnb there's a lot to like. The company's third quarter has shown they've bounced back better than a lot of their travel rivals,"" said Matthew Kennedy, senior strategist at IPO research firm Renaissance Capital.
At the top of Airbnb's target range, the IPO will give Airbnb a fully diluted valuation, which includes securities such as options and restricted stock units, of $34.8 billion. This is nearly double the $18 billion Airbnb was worth in an April private fundraising round and above the $31 billion in its last pre-COVID-19 private fundraising in 2017.
Airbnb's market capitalization at $50 per share would total $29.8 billion. Chesky's stake would be valued at about $3.8 billion, while those of Gebbia and Blecharczyk would be worth about $3.5 billion each. Sequoia Capital, which first invested in Airbnb in 2009, would have a stake worth more than $4 billion. 
Airbnb made its IPO registration public earlier this month. Reuters was the first to report in October that the startup was aiming to raise around $3 billion in its IPO that could value it at more than $30 billion.
Airbnb plans to list on Dec. 10 under the symbol ""ABNB"" on Nasdaq.
LONG-AWAITED IPO
Airbnb's stock market debut will be one of the largest and most anticipated U.S. IPOs of 2020, which has already been a bumper year for flotations. Record label Warner Music Group, data analytics firm Palantir Technologies and data warehouse company Snowflake Inc have all gone public in the past few months.
Airbnb was launched by Chesky and Gebbia in 2008 as a website to take bookings for rooms during conferences, including the Democratic National Convention that year in Denver.
It has since expanded listings to include apartments, houses and vacation rentals, allowing millions of ordinary homeowners to make money by renting their flats and houses while on their own holidays.
Airbnb achieved ""unicorn"" status in 2011, with listed properties in 13,000 cities across more than 180 countries at the time, after being valued at more than $1 billion in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz.
Some of Airbnb's other investors include Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher, buyout firms General Atlantic, TPG, Hillhouse Capital and investment management firms Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are the lead underwriters for the IPO.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court justices question human rights claims against Nestle and Cargill,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared wary of barring lawsuits against American companies over alleged human rights abuses abroad but signaled they could toss out a case accusing Cargill Inc and a Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) subsidiary of knowingly helping to perpetuate slavery at Ivory Coast cocoa farms. 
The two companies are asking the nine justices to reverse a lower court ruling that allowed the lawsuit, filed in 2005 on behalf of former child slaves from Mali who worked at the farms, to proceed. 
The case concerns a 1789 U.S. law called the Alien Tort Statute that lets non-U.S. citizens seek damages in American courts in certain instances. The business community has long sought to limit corporate liability under this law.
Some justices questioned whether the lawsuit actually made clear that company officials knew that the farms involved used child slavery.
""After 15 years, is it too much to ask that you allege specifically that the defendants ... who are before us here specifically knew that forced child labor was being used on the farms or farm cooperatives with which they did business?"" conservative Justice Samuel Alito asked.
The court could toss out the lawsuit on those grounds but stop short of a ruling that would curb corporate liability altogether under the law, with some justices expressing reservations about taking that step.
Liberal Justice Elena Kagan, for example, asked what would happen if a group of slaveholders who could normally be sued individually formed a corporation in order to avoid liability.
""And now you are saying you can't sue the corporation?"" Kagan asked lawyer Neal Katyal, who argued the case for the companies.
Alito also appeared to share that concern, saying that Katyal's arguments would ""lead to results that are pretty hard to take"" because they would shield U.S. corporations from liability for even the most egregious conduct.
The litigation targeted the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss-based Nestle, the world's biggest food producer, and commodities trader Cargill, one of the largest privately held U.S. companies.
The plaintiffs accused the companies of aiding and abetting human rights violations through their active involvement in purchasing Ivory Coast cocoa and turning a blind eye to the use of slave labor on the farms despite being aware of the practice in order to keep cocoa prices low.
A federal district court in Los Angeles dismissed the lawsuit twice, most recently in 2017. That court found that the claims were barred by recent Supreme Court decisions that made it harder for plaintiffs to sue corporations in U.S. courts for alleged violations overseas.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018 revived the claims, citing the allegations that the companies provided ""personal spending money"" to local farmers to guarantee the cheapest source of cocoa. The 9th Circuit found that the payments were akin to kickbacks and that the low price of cocoa was dependant upon the child slave labor.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business interests backed the two companies in the case, as did President Donald Trump's administration.
The Supreme Court in 2013 and 2018 cases curbed the ability of plaintiffs to sue corporations in U.S. courts under the Alien Tort Statute for overseas human rights violations. But the court did not definitively rule that companies can never be sued under that law.
Since the 2018 ruling - a 5-4 decision - the court has shifted further to the right with Trump's appointment of conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. 

A ruling is due by the end of June.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Tuesday announced voice recognition as part of a suite of call-center services for businesses, as the company sees growing demand for its cloud tools during the coronavirus pandemic.
Speaking at the company's annual re:Invent conference, executive Andy Jassy announced Amazon Connect Voice ID, which uses machine learning software to authenticate customers who dial into call centers.
Jassy, who runs the firm's cloud computing division Amazon Web Services, said AWS builds a voice print for customers who opt in to save time on calls. Enterprises using the service set how confident it needs to be for authentication to be automatic, or for requiring manual confirmation of a customer's account.
Amazon is also adding a machine learning tool that helps call-center agents find answers for customers and another that help them personalize service.
The news reflects rising demand for Amazon's cloud - and for call-center tools in particular. Jassy said COVID-19 has accelerated businesses' cloud adoption by several years, and more than 5,000 customers turned to the Amazon Connect service for call-center help during the pandemic. U.K. grocer Morrisons is one such example.
Voice authentication is AWS' latest work in the field of biometrics, which has attracted criticism from civil liberties advocates. Amazon in June announced a year-long moratorium on police use of its facial recognition software.
Amazon used the event to launch many unrelated products including Trainium, which targets Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp's core business of powerful chips to train machine learning algorithms.
Trainium will complement Amazon's Inferentia computing chip that analyzes incoming data from platforms like its Alexa voice assistant.

Amazon also announced an equipment-monitoring system for predictive maintenance; computer vision for onsite cameras in manufacturing, construction or retail; and a query tool that lets businesses enter jargon-filled questions and have AWS suggest answers to them.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued its first airworthiness certificate for a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX built since March 2019, the agency said on Tuesday.
The FAA on Nov. 18 lifted a 20-month-old grounding order on the MAX after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. The FAA is requiring a series of software changes and new pilot training requirements before planes can return to service. 
Boeing has about 450 737 MAX airplanes that have been built since 2019 and are awaiting approval by the FAA before they can be delivered to airlines. Boeing declined to comment on the FAA approval. 
""We expect to have sufficient number of inspectors on hand to meet Boeing’s planned delivery schedule for the foreseeable future. We’ll defer to Boeing to discuss the company’s manufacturing and delivery plans,"" FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said.
The FAA separately last week approved an American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) training plan for pilots to resume 737 MAX flights, the agency and airline confirmed. That approval clears the way for American to resume MAX flights starting Dec. 29 once it completes required tests and software upgrades to parked planes.
American plans to begin with a single daily MAX flight from Miami to New York's LaGuardia airport. That will mark the return of the MAX to U.S. commercial service.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank profits were significantly higher in the third quarter than the first half of 2020, although the industry still lagged behind 2019 levels, a regulator reported on Tuesday.
The industry's profits jumped 173% in the third quarter to $51.2 billion, after firms spent the first half of the year setting aside billions of dollars to offset expected pandemic-driven losses. But that amount is still 10.7% lower than 2019 levels, and roughly half of banks reported lower profits than a year prior.
""The banking industry remains well-capitalized with ample liquidity and has, to date, weathered the economic effects of the pandemic,"" said FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams in a statement.
The new data suggests some return to normalcy for banks after a tumultuous first half of the year. Bank profits were down 70% in the first two quarters as firms built up massive cushions to guard against future losses.
The sizeable increase in profits from the second to the third quarter was due in large part to banks slowing such aggressive preparations. The FDIC reported provisions for credit losses fell 76.8% from the second quarter. Although there were still some signs of potential trouble, as the share of unprofitable banks rose to 4.7%, and noncurrent loan balances rose 7.9%.
The FDIC also reported that an explosion in bank deposits appears to have slowed. The uncertainty brought on by the pandemic drove businesses and individuals to deposit over $2 trillion in banks in the first half of the year, but total deposit balances rose just $156 billion in the third quarter.

The influx of deposits actually resulted in the FDIC's deposit insurance fund dropping below its legally required minimum ratio of 1.35%. That level now stands at 1.3%, and banks could be required to pay more to boost it if it does not rise on its own in coming months.

An alleged quote from Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. 
The one chosen case that was submitted by Facebook, rather than a user, was a post in a group claiming certain drugs could cure COVID-19, which criticized the French government’s response to the pandemic.
The board has opened a week-long public comment period on these first cases. The cases will be reviewed by panels of five board members.
Three of the six cases involved content that Facebook removed for breaking hate-speech rules. An Oversight Board spokesman said hate-speech cases had been ""the most significant proportion"" of appeals received.
""Hate speech is an especially difficult area,"" Jamal Greene, one of the board's co-chairs and a professor at Columbia Law School, told Reuters in an interview. ""It's not that easy ... for an algorithm to get the context of"" such speech.
In November, Facebook for the first time disclosed numbers on the prevalence of hate speech on the platform, saying that out of every 10,000 content views in the third quarter, 10 to 11 included hate speech.
Greene said the cases, which also involved content removed over rules on adult nudity, dangerous individuals and organizations, and violence and incitement, raised ""important line-drawing questions."" (Link https://www.oversightboard.com/news/719406882003532-announcing-the-oversight-board-s-first-cases-and-appointment-of-trustees to full list of cases)
Facebook can also ask the board for nonbinding policy recommendations, but Greene said it had not yet done so.
The board, which has been criticized for its limited remit, also aims to expand its scope to hear cases from users in early 2021 about content that has been left on the site, as well as posts taken down. 
This week, a group of Facebook critics dubbed ""The Real Facebook Oversight Board"" said it would hear three cases not yet eligible for users to take to the official oversight board, including a dispute about the Facebook account of Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump's former adviser.

Asked about this group, a spokeswoman for Facebook's Oversight Board said: ""Lots of people have opinions about Facebook. The Oversight Board is focused on making binding decisions and issuing policy recommendations that will hold Facebook to account.""

690,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 11:56AM ET</span>",Tesla CEO says electric cars will double global electricity demand,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday that electricity consumption will double if the world's car fleets are electrified, increasing the need to expand nuclear, solar, geothermal and wind energy generating sources.
Increasing the availability of sustainable energy is a major challenge as cars move from combustion engines to battery-driven electric motors, a shift which will take two decades, Musk said in a talk hosted by Berlin-based publisher Axel Springer.
""It will take another 20 years for cars to be fully electric. It is like with phones, you cannot replace them all at once,"" Musk said in a talk streamed on the Bild.de web site, adding that around 5% of vehicles are replaced every year.
Once electric cars become the norm, electricity from intermittent generating energy sources such as wind and solar will need to be stored, probably through battery technology, he said. 
""Together with large battery packs, both things need to be combined, wind power with battery packs and solar energy,"" Musk said.
Tesla is embarking on plans to build its fourth gigafactory in Europe's largest economy. 
""The best wind turbines are made in Germany,"" he said. 
""I always have a good time when I am here. I like the engineering culture. People want to get things done.""

Tesla has recently acquired a licence to trade electricity across western Europe, and the company has also been surveying customers in Germany about potentially using Tesla electricity in their cars.

Investing.com --  Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) jumped 14% after announcing a long-term partnership with beauty queen Sephora.
""Sephora at Kohl's"" will be a fully-immersive beauty destination within a 2,500 square foot space and located at the front of the store. The news comes three weeks after  Target  (NYSE:TGT) said it will create a similar shop within a shop with Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), sending the latter up to its highest since before the pandemic hit in March. 
The first 200 locations will open in the fall season of 2021, and will expand to at least 850 stores by 2023. Sephora will bring its trial and immersive beauty experience with more than 100 curated beauty brands to Kohl’s 65 million customers across the U.S.  
""This is not a pop-up collaboration, but an investment our brand partners can rely on for the long-term,"" said Jean-André Rougeot, chief executive officer of Sephora Americas. Sephora has about 500 stores in the Americas, while Kohl's has more than 1,150 in 49 states. Sephora at Kohl’s shops will replace Kohl's current in-store beauty assortment. Online, the Sephora at Kohl's experience will launch on Kohls.com in Fall 2021, making Sephora the exclusive beauty partner on Kohls.com.   
Ulta Beauty at Target will debut at more than 100 stores in 2021, with plans to scale to hundreds more over time, though the footprint will be smaller than Sephora's, with about 1,000 square feet of retail space located next to the existing beauty section. 
Sephora, owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (PA:LVMH), launched in the U.S. 21 years ago.

(Reuters) - A former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc factory employee will pay Elon Musk's electric car maker $400,000 after it accused him of tipping reporters about alleged production inefficiencies and delays, a court filing shows.
The payment by Martin Tripp, a former process technician at Tesla's Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, was part of a settlement detailed in a Monday filing with the federal court in that city. It requires approval by Chief Judge Miranda Du.
Tesla and Musk became embroiled in a public dispute with Tripp in June 2018, when it fired and then sued him.
The Palo Alto, California-based company accused Tripp of writing software to hack into its manufacturing operating system, stealing trade secrets, and making false claims to reporters about information he stole.
Du has said Tripp characterized himself as a whistleblower who had identified production inefficiencies and delays in Tesla's effort to produce 5,000 Model 3 cars each week.
In September, the judge dismissed Tripp's defamation counterclaim over statements from Tesla, including an email to employees where Musk accused him of ""sabotage,"" saying Tripp did not show actual malice.
According to the court filing, Tripp did not contest Tesla's claims that he stole trade secrets, and acknowledged that his counterclaims were funded by a short seller of Tesla stock. The filing was signed by Tripp and a Tesla lawyer.

The case is Tesla Inc v Tripp, U.S. District Court, District of Nevada, No. 18-00296.

697,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>","Cyber Monday Shoppers Spent $10.8 Billion, Missing Projection","(Bloomberg) -- Online shoppers in the U.S. spent $10.8 billion on Cyber Monday, missing Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc.’s original projection by almost $2 billion, evidence that retailers pulled sales forward by offering deals earlier than usual.
Still, the gusher of online spending was a record, rising 15% from 2019.
“Cyber Monday continued to dominate the holiday shopping season, becoming the biggest online shopping day in U.S. history, despite early discounts from retailers,” Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights, said in a statement. “Throughout the remainder of the holiday season, we expect to see record sales continue and curbside pickup to gain even more momentum as shoppers avoid crowds and potential shipping delays.”
Hot sellers included toys such as Lego sets and scooters, video games like Super Mario 3D All-Stars, and electronics including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) AirPods, Hewlett Packard & Dell Computers and Chromecast, Adobe said.
The pandemic-fueled stampede online was a valuable opportunity for retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.,  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT),  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY)., which had been preparing for the 2020 holiday deluge for months. There were occasional hiccups, but the industry’s investments in delivery capacity and parking lot pickup helped get it through the Thanksgiving weekend and Cyber Monday.
Black Friday spending of $9 billion also missed Adobe’s forecast of $10.3 billion, another sign of cautious consumer spending during the pandemic and shoppers reacting to deals earlier in the holiday season. Amazon vacuumed up $1 in every $5 spent over the Black Friday weekend, the first time the Seattle-based giant accounted for the highest share of spending for the period, according to market research firm Numerator.
But Cyber Monday will likely still be the peak, because many shoppers are conditioned to hold off on big purchases in anticipation of price cuts.
Cyber Monday deals mostly weren’t much better than Black Friday deals, said Kristin McGrath, editor at BlackFriday.com, which monitors web deals. Harkening back to traditional door-buster Black Friday tactics, many digital shops are likely to offer eye-popping discounts on popular products that usually sell out quickly to attract people to their site, hoping they linger and load up shopping carts with other things.

Investing.com --  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) slumped 12% after reporting its margins were under pressure, even as sales more than quadrupled.
Non-pay users, including students and teachers, pushed gross profit margin to 66.7%, which was below the estimated 72.1% and the pre-pandemic average of about 80%, according to Reuters.
The company nonetheless beat expectations, with earnings per share of 99 cents beating the 76-cent estimate on sales of $777 million. In the same period a year earlier, revenue came in at $166.59 million.
The video conferencing company has seen business boom after offices and schools closed in March and employees, students and teachers made do online to get business and learning done. Zoom shares are up more than 500% this year as a result, and is one of the biggest winners of the Covid-19 pandemic. DocuSign Inc  (NASDAQ:DOCU), which offers digital signatures to seal deals, is another company that's been blessed amid the spread of the coronavirus, with shares up almost 200% since January. They are trading down 5% on Tuesday.
Zoom may also be impacted by news of vaccines with high effectiveness that may start being distributed as soon as this month in the U.S.
Zoom expects fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue of between $806 million and $811 million, with earnings per share of up to 79 cents. Full fiscal sales are set to come in between $2.757 billion and $2.58 billion, with EPS of up to $2.87. 
At the end of the third quarter, Zoom had about 433,700 customers with more than 10 employees, up some 485% from the same quarter last fiscal year.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Debenhams set to shut shop after 242 years as pandemic hammers UK retail,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - British department store group Debenhams is set to close all its UK shops after 242 years in business, putting 12,000 jobs at risk in the country's second major corporate failure in as many days.
The decision to liquidate Debenhams comes after Philip Green's Arcadia fashion group collapsed into administration on Monday, threatening 13,000 jobs, after the COVID-19 pandemic hit business.
Arcadia is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams, accounting for about 5% of Debenhams' sales, and its collapse looks to have been the final straw, making a sale of Debenhams that would be worth more than a winding down process impossible.
Administrators FRP Advisory said on Tuesday that Debenhams would be wound down after it failed to find a buyer.
Sportswear and clothing retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion had been seen as the department store operator's last hope for a rescue deal but it confirmed on Tuesday it had ended takeover talks with Debenhams, which trades from 124 UK stores. 
Debenhams, founded in London in 1778, has struggled for years and was placed in administration for the second time in a year in April by its owners led by U.S. hedge fund Silver Point Capital.
""Given the current trading environment and the likely prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the outlook for a restructured operation is highly uncertain,"" FRP said.
""The administrators have therefore regretfully concluded that they should commence a wind-down of Debenhams UK, whilst continuing to seek offers for all or parts of the business.""
The administrators will continue to trade Debenhams' stores and online business through Christmas to clear its current and contracted stocks.
""On conclusion of this process, if no alternative offers have been received, the UK operations will close,"" FRP said.
LIQUIDATION PROCESS
Debenhams' pension schemes, which have about 11,000 members, have been in an assessment period for the government's Pension Protection Fund since April 2019 when the group first went into administration.
Debenhams' Danish business Magasin du Nord is not impacted by the liquidation process.
Former chairman Ian Cheshire believes some parts of the UK business can be saved.
""(There) is a fantastic business inside it, probably 70 stores, and a very good website which I'm sure someone will be buying, so I don't think all these jobs are going,"" he told Sky News.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the government stood ready to support those employees affected by the winding-down decision.
Shopworkers union Usdaw urged the government to develop an urgent recovery plan for retail.
Even before the pandemic, bricks-and-mortar retailers in Britain were facing a major structural challenge with the economics of operating stores on traditional leases proving increasingly difficult as more trade migrates online.
Britain's department store sector has particularly struggled.
BHS went bust in 2016, House of Fraser was bought out of administration in 2018 by Mike Ashley's  Sports Direct  (LON:FRAS), now called Frasers Group, and even John Lewis has seen profits crash.
Frasers said on Monday it was interested in participating in the Arcadia sale process.
Frasers was Debenhams' biggest shareholder before the department store went into administration for the first time, wiping out Frasers' 150 million pound ($200 million) investment.
Ashley walked away from buying Debenhams this time round but analysts expect him to take another look at its assets in the liquidation process, which is being run by turnaround specialist Hilco.
""Ashley continues to give a very good impression of somebody who tries to win a game of 'Monopoly' by buying up the useless brown and light blue squares on the board,"" said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets surged to new record highs at the opening of trade on Tuesday, as optimism over the early roll-outs of vaccines to treat the Covid-19 coronavirus sustained a broad rally in everything from Brazilian iron ore miners to online pet food stocks.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened at record highs, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose back toward the 30,000 level. By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow was up 284 points or 1.0% at 29,922 points, while the S&P was also up 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%.
Helping the gains were reports that a bipartisan group of Senators had drafted a compromise plan to provide some $908 billion in fresh support for the economy, a figure that included $240 billion for state and local governments. That had been a key sticking point in negotiations between Congressional Republicans and Democrats before the election earlier this month. Newswire headlines suggested that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would speak later at 1 PM ET.
Before that, the session seemed likely to be dominated by testimony in Congress from Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, the first time they have appeared together since Mnuchin refused to extend government authority for a handful of lending programs that the Fed had set up at the start of the crisis. 
Among the big initial gainers was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which rose 3.6% to a new record high after S&P Dow Jones Global Indexes said that the stock would be incorporated into the S&P 500 in one go, rather than over two discrete dates.  Elsewhere, there were more big gains for vaccine makers after  Moderna  filed in the EU for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 drug. Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose another 11%, while  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock rose 4.2%, a day after it and partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) asked the Food and Drug Administration to approve their vaccine.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 2.8%, helped by reports that rival Samsung (KS:005930) will discontinue its Galaxy Note smartphone in the new year. That removes some competition for the iPhone maker at the high end of the market.
On the downside,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) stock, a favorite stay-at-home play for most of this year, tumbled 11.8% after its latest quarterly report - although strong - failed to live up to the rarified expectations of its shareholders. 
However, the day got off to a bright start as research firm IHS Markit said its purchasing managers index for U.S. manufacturing rose in November despite the slowdown in broader economic activity due to the latest wave of the pandemic. The PMI rose to 56.7 from 53.6 in October.
""Although demand for consumer goods remained somewhat subdued, mainly reflecting rising virus infection rates, demand for investment goods such as business equipment and machinery rose especially sharply,"" IHS Markit said in its release. 
The more closely watched ISM manufacturing index fell, however, to 57.5 from a 20-month high of 59.3."

The new rules will require most Nasdaq-listed companies to have, or publicly explain why they do not have, at least two diverse directors, including one who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+.
All companies will be expected to have one diverse director within two years of the SEC's approval of the new rule. 
""Our goal with this proposal is to provide a transparent framework for Nasdaq-listed companies to present their board composition and diversity philosophy effectively to all stakeholders,"" said Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman.
""We believe this listing rule is one step in a broader journey to achieve inclusive representation across corporate America,"" she said. 
Foreign companies and smaller companies would have additional flexibility in satisfying the diversity requirement with two female directors.
The exchange operator said that over two dozen studies found an association between diverse boards and better financial performance and corporate governance.

Companies that are not able to meet the board composition objectives within the required time-frames will not be subject to delisting if they provide a public explanation of their reasons for not meeting the objectives, Nasdaq said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer-BioNTech are in a tight race to launch their COVID-19 vaccines in Europe after both applied for emergency EU approval on Tuesday, though there was uncertainty over whether a rollout could begin this year.
The applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) came a day after Moderna sought emergency use for its shot in the United States and more than a week after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech did the same.
U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German development partner BioNTech said their vaccine could be launched in the European Union as early as this month.
""We can start to deliver within a few hours (of an approval),"" said Sierk Poetting, head of operations and finance at BioNTech. ""We have been stocking up. And everything that is there can really be distributed within a few hours."" 
The EMA clouded the timeline, however, when it said it would complete its review for that vaccine by Dec. 29 at the latest, and for Moderna's shot by Jan. 12. It added its schedule may be subject to change as its evaluation proceeds. 
The European Commission, the EU executive body, said it would likely give its final authorization for a vaccine's rollout days after a recommendation by the EMA.
An effective immunization is seen as the main weapon against the pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.4 million lives and ravaged economies across the globe. Close to 50 potential vaccines are being tested on volunteers worldwide.
Both U.S. biotech firm Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have reported preliminary findings of more than 90% effectiveness - an unexpectedly high rate - in trials of their vaccines, which are both based on new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.
CUSTOMISED GENETIC CODE
Their work validates that of several biotech experts, who for years have been labouring to prove a once-unorthodox idea: The human body can act as its own vaccine factory.
Both inoculations work by injecting people with customised genetic code that instructs human cells to make key virus proteins to induce an immune response. 
Pfizer and BioNTech reported final trial results on Nov. 18 that showed their vaccine candidate, known as BNT162b2, was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, with no major safety concerns. 
Moderna Inc said on Monday that full results from a late-stage study showed its candidate, mRNA-1273, was 94.1% effective, also with no serious safety concerns.
Any clearance in the EU and United States for the vaccines will be ""conditional"" or for ""emergency use"", meaning developers are obliged to continue trials and provide more trial results as they emerge.
The European filings complete so-called rolling reviews, initiated by the EMA on Oct. 6 in the case of Pfizer and on Nov. 16 for Moderna, aimed at speeding up the process by doing a real-time assessment of the data as it lands.
The EMA said on Tuesday it had started a rolling review of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccine candidate after preliminary results showed it triggered production of antibodies and immune cells against the virus. The review will go on until enough evidence ss available for a formal marketing authorisation application, the regulator added.

The British government said https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-welcomes-the-mhra-review-into-pfizer-and-biontech-vaccine last week that Pfizer and BioNTech had reported the data from their clinical trials to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

(Reuters) - Canadian cannabis producers are likely to scale back their investments in Europe as they come under pressure to cut costs and deliver profit, according to a joint report by two industry consultants on Tuesday. 
Depending on the pace of legalization, the market for European cannabis could grow at a compound annual rate of 52% for the next five years, hitting $3.1 billion in sales by 2025, Chicago-based research firm Brightfield Group and London-based consultancy Hanway Associates said. 
They, however, projected the current market at just a tenth of that value and said some Canadian companies may choose to follow two of the sector's big players - Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) Inc and  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) Corp - in trimming spending outside North America.
""Though they remain a tremendous force in Europe, forward momentum among (Canadian) liquidity providers will slow in the future, especially in newer or smaller markets,"" the consultants said, adding this would give more room for European players.
Cannabis investment in North America has surged in the past three years as Canada became the first major country to legalize the drug for recreational use, giving its firms a head start at a time when Europe and U.S. Federal rules remain more restrictive. 
Aurora already has a distribution network in Germany, while Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) have established major production hubs in Denmark and Portugal, and may not need additional investment, the report said.
When asked if Aurora was cutting investments in Europe, the company's managing director for the UK & Ireland, Don Perrott, said, ""We have not changed our view that this market represents a significant opportunity, despite slower-than-expected growth to date across many EU member states."" 

""Europe remains a core part of Aurora's growth strategy and we are constantly evaluating opportunities to expand our business in the region,"" Perrott said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Alexander Hitzinger, a 49-year-old engineer who defected to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after helping to develop Porsche's winning 919 racecar, has been lured back to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group for perhaps his biggest challenge yet - building an electric car to take on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
While Volkswagen, the world's largest automaker, has been rolling out electric vehicles from the ID.3 compact to the high end Porsche Taycan, analysts say it needs a more comprehensive system that integrates electric power with new self-driving and infotainment technologies if it hopes to overtake Tesla. 
It has turned to Hitzinger, whose ability to conceptualise clean-sheet designs and manage projects helped Porsche develop a racecar that won the Le Mans endurance race in 2015, 2016, 2017. 
After a stint working on Apple's autonomous cars, Hitzinger now heads up Volkswagen's ""Project Artemis"", named after the Ancient Greek goddess of hunting, with the aim of chasing down electric car pioneer Tesla.
""At Porsche, I always thought of a vehicle as a comprehensive system. This is a very important point. It is what Tesla does well,"" he explained in a video interview.
The task of building a car has gotten more complex with the advent of electric and autonomous driving technologies, forcing new battery-driven powertrains to compete for electricity with camera, radar, and lidar sensors, plus infotainment systems. 
Rather than stitching together separately designed systems, Artemis wants to create something new and seamlessly integrated, from the ground up, Hitzinger told Reuters.
""The idea behind Artemis is to have a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle. When something is optimised, this has knock-on effects and these need to be understood.""
Allocating processing power between propulsion, automated driving and infotainment systems such as satellite navigation and music streaming is a key challenge, he said.
But it's not the only one.
""The human-machine interface, the interior design, the exterior design, aerodynamics and the range are all interconnected. If I modify something on the exterior, it will impact the aerodynamics and the efficiency,"" Hitzinger said.
Volkswagen Group, whose brands range from budget Seats and Skodas to high-end Audis and Bentleys is now focussing on developing systems that can handle all these new demands. 
The car, which is due to be produced in 2024, will make use of components developed for Porsche and Audi's premium electric vehicle platform, PPE. The group's factory in Hanover, Germany, is being retooled to build an electric sport-utility vehicle for Audi, Bentley and Porsche.
Having a small team of highly qualified engineers, who are empowered to take decisions unencumbered by the corporate bureaucracy of the Volkswagen empire, should end up producing a better vehicle more quickly.
Project Artemis will have between 200 and 250 staff once Hitzinger is done hiring, up from 10 at present. 
""I am putting the team together on a top down basis. The managers come first. Then I look for A-players, who will attract other A-players. I don't want managers, but people who love to develop technologies, who are prepared to take risks,"" he said.
Artemis will seek to draw on existing skills within the Volkswagen Group, such as expertise in making vehicle bodies at Audi, but take the lead in developing new techniques which speed up production and improve the customer experience.
""We want to set new standards for what a customer can do in a vehicle and how he interacts with the car,"" Hitzinger said.
He declined to elaborate on what user experiences the new car would offer, citing the confidential nature of the project. 

He also declined to comment on a power struggle unfolding at Volkswagen, which has convened its executive committee to meet on Tuesday to decide whether to extend CEO Herbert Diess's contract.

Under the new rules, all passengers can bring a small bag for free, but only those who pay for a seat in the front of the plane or extra leg room can also bring a larger bag to go in the overhead locker.
EasyJet is only flying 20% of its capacity this winter due to travel restrictions related to the pandemic, and has said it continues to review options for additional funding after posting a 1.3 billion pound annual loss.
The airline said the new luggage rules, which bring its approach more into line with larger rival Ryanair, would be positive for customers.
""Our new policy will improve boarding and punctuality for everyone, as well as give our customers certainty of what they will have with them onboard,"" easyJet (LON:EZJ)'s chief commercial and customer officer Robert Carey said in a statement on Tuesday.
Previously, all easyJet passengers were allowed to bring a large bag for the overhead locker, although some of these were placed in the hold when the lockers became full.

Pre-COVID, easyJet's ancillary revenues, which include sales from checked baggage and allocated seating, accounted for about a fifth of the airline's total 2019 annual revenues of 6.4 billion pounds.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) for the first time has reached beyond Swiss borders and proposed outgoing Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank Chief Executive António Horta-Osório should succeed Urs Rohner, who has spent nearly a decade as chairman.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank is seeking to move on from a year of controversy that began with an internal spying scandal that prompted the ouster of former CEO Tidjane Thiam and heightened shareholder censure of Rohner.
Under new chair Horta-Osorio, whose appointment must be confirmed by shareholders on Apr. 30, the bank will face outstanding questions over the size of its investment bank and the profitability of its asset management unit.
Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein in his first 10 months in the role has announced cost cuts to the investment bank and Swiss business, further consolidating a shift from risky trading to more stable wealth management initiated under predecessor Thiam.
He has also flagged a strategy reboot for the bank's ailing asset management.
Impairments and legal provisions totalling nearly $900 million earmarked for the fourth quarter - one on a hedge fund equity stake, and another on a 2008 financial crisis legacy case announced on Tuesday - add to the bank's troubles.
TIME FOR CHANGE
Rohner, 61, departs Credit Suisse as expected after reaching a 12-year term limit on the board.
The news of his successor takes place a day after the announcement of Horta-Osorio's replacement at Lloyds, which he revived following a 2008 government rescue during the financial crisis. The bank returned to private ownership in 2017.
During his time at Lloyds, the Portuguese-born Horta-Osorio, 56, won plaudits for championing mental health issues at companies after he was signed off work for two months in 2011 for stress-induced insomnia and exhaustion.
But he was criticised by lawmakers for his high pay package and for the bank's handling of a fraud at its HBOS Reading branch that led to six people being jailed in 2017.
""I am extremely happy that we can propose a highly-proven and recognised professional of the international banking business as my successor,"" outgoing Credit Suisse chairman Rohner said in a statement.
During his 16 years at the bank, Rohner saw Credit Suisse weather the financial crisis better than rival UBS as general counsel and chief operating officer, and won support from analysts and shareholders in 2009 when he was appointed to the board in preparation for becoming chairman.
But his tenure since 2011 as chairman has witnessed problems ranging from nearly $1 billion in trading write-downs following U.S. investment banker Brady (NYSE:BRC) Dougan's exit as CEO in 2015 to an ongoing investigation by Swiss financial market supervisor FINMA over the spying affair.
FINMA declined to comment on whether the new appointment would affect its proceedings.
The bank, during Rohner's time, also contended with costly tax evasion settlements after the unwinding of Swiss bank secrecy and more recent censure over shortcomings in a series of high-profile corruption cases.
Shares in the bank have lost some two-thirds of their value over the period.

""Horta-Osorio faces a great challenge. His priority will be regaining shaken investor confidence,"" Zuecher Kantonalbank analyst José Javier Lodeiro said in a note.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, continuing November’s record-breaking gains, helped by the expected prompt delivery of Covid-19 vaccines and signs of a global economic recovery.  
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract rose 330 points, or 1.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 36 points, or 1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 91 points, or 0.8%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended November almost 12% higher on the month, its best individual month since January 1987. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both gained around 11%.
Earlier Tuesday, American pharmaceutical giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and German partner BioNtech, announced that they have applied to European authorities for authorization to rollout their Covid-19 vaccine. This follows similar moves in the U.S. and the U.K.
This adds to Monday’s positive news from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), with the biotech firm stating it was applying for U.S. and European emergency authorization for its vaccine candidate after full results from a late-stage study showed it was effective, with no serious safety concerns.
The outlook for the global economy is improving as vaccines emerge, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest report, raising its view on growth this year to a contraction of 4.2%, from a drop of 4.5% at its last report in September. 
Still, the second wave of the Covid-19 virus remains in focus, with hospitals coming close to being dangerously overloaded in populous states like New York and California as cases continue to rise.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will speak with Congress late Tuesday. Powell called the U.S. economic outlook “extraordinarily uncertain”, in prepared remarks ahead of his testimony.
The economic slate sees the release of the ISM manufacturing PMI number for November, after the European manufacturing sector held up fractionally better than expected.
In corporate news, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reports earnings, but eyes will be likely to be on  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) after its stock fell sharply in after-hours trading and on  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), which announced a massive $20 billion writedown on Monday.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, as Reuters reported that the OPEC+ meeting to discuss production levels has been delayed until Thursday after Russia and the United Arab Emirates proposed a 500,000 barrels a day increase.
The group has been expected to maintain the current cap on supply, rather than raising by 2 million barrels a day in January as previously agreed, given the current weak overall demand. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $45.23 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $47.84. Both benchmarks surged by 27% in November, boosted by hopes for three promising coronavirus vaccines.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.6% to $1,809.60/oz, after dropping almost 6% in November, its worst month in four years, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1968.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>",Volkswagen faces leadership crisis as CEO demands confidence vote,"By Jan Schwartz and Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the world's largest vehicle maker by sales, risked a leadership crisis on Tuesday after Chief Executive Herbert Diess forced a vote of confidence in his reform efforts by asking for an early contract extension.
The multi-brand car and truck maker is convening its Executive Committee to discuss Diess's demand for the contract extension, long before his current term comes to an end in 2023, three sources told Reuters on Monday.
Volkswagen Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch is seeking to avert a clash between labour leaders and Diess by postponing discussions about a contract extension, a person familiar with the matter said.
Diess, who defected from BMW in 2015, and helped Volkswagen to reform after its diesel scandal with a 73 billion euro ($87 billion) electric vehicle investment plan, has grown frustrated with German labour leaders blocking cost cuts.
The supervisory board's Executive Committee, which is headed by Poetsch, and includes Wolfgang Porsche and Hans Michel Piech, members of the carmaker's owning families, as well as labour boss Bernd Osterloh, is due to meet on Tuesday, the three sources told Reuters.
Volkswagen declined to comment.
""The families continue to support Diess,"" a spokesman for Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the company which holds a majority voting stake in Volkswagen said on Tuesday. 
The meeting comes on the day that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s CEO Elon Musk is due to receive the Axel Springer award in Berlin for his achievements in engineering, after the electric carmaker decided to build a factory on the outskirts of the German capital. 
Analysts said the Volkswagen committee meeting highlighted the difficulties in reforming a carmaker where labour representatives control half the seats on the board of directors and local politicians have a 20% voting stake, allowing them to vote down significant strategic reform proposals.
""The company has some of the most amazing and most global brands, it has the scale to deploy any technology and the innovation power to be an early mover. What it appears to be lacking is the right corporate governance,"" Bernstein autos analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a note late on Monday. 
""There should be no illusion, this transformation will always trigger conflicts. Whether there is a new CEO or not, the questions will remain the same, and any VW CEO will need the full backing from VW's largest shareholders, the Porsche families.""
Volkswagen is worth 77.2 billion euros ($92.4 billion), far below rival Toyota's market value of $155.7 billion and Tesla's $555 billion. 
And that's despite the fact that Volkswagen sold 10.96 million vehicles last year - the most by any carmaker in the world - while Toyota came in second with 10.74 million. Tesla sold only 367,500 cars in the same period.
Analysts say that's because Volkswagen is less efficient and has higher costs. Volkswagen Group had 671,205 employees at the end of 2019, compared with 359,542 at Toyota at the end of its fiscal year, and 48,016 at Tesla last year.
FORCING THE ISSUE
German companies customarily deliberate contract extensions for management board members only a year ahead of expiration. Diess, however, forced the issue after labour leader Bernd Osterloh stifled his reform efforts.
These included Diess's attempts to install allies Arno Antlitz as chief financial officer and Thomas Schmall as chief procurement officer on the management board, the three sources told Reuters.
Rather than approving each individual appointment, the labour leaders insist on approving a ""package solution"" which is ""harmonious"", two people familiar with the deliberations said.
Osterloh is also said to oppose an early contract extension for Diess, one of the three sources said.
In a post on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) this week, Osterloh said there was no fight about management appointments because no committee on the supervisory board had been formally consulted about the issue.
Diess, for his part, voiced his frustration in a column in the German daily Handelsblatt published on Friday.
""When I took office in Wolfsburg, I had firmly resolved to change the VW system. This meant breaking up old, encrusted structures and making the company more agile and modern,"" he said.
""Together with many companions with the same level of motivation, I succeeded in doing this in many places, but not in some, especially not yet at our corporate headquarters in Wolfsburg.""

Data on Tuesday showed lockdowns in France and Italy slowed manufacturing activity in November.
But keeping hopes of economic recovery alive, a business survey echoed official numbers from a day earlier which showed robust growth in China's factory activity.
Investors, however, may have already started to price in consistently good data from China, Bell said.

719,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Unicredit's March of Folly,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The shareholders are revolted, and rightly so. UniCredit (MI:CRDI) has forced out its chief executive Jean-Pierre Mustier, one of the most highly-respected CEOs in Europe.
It has done so in order to pursue a politically-driven domestic merger whose rationale is at best ambitious and at worst outright dangerous for shareholders.
The reaction of Unicredit’s share price says it all: down 6% on a day when everything else is melting up in a liquidity-fuelled euphoric anticipation of an economic recovery next year.
Mustier has had wretched luck. Earlier this year, just before the pandemic struck, he had unveiled plans for the biggest and boldest return of capital to the bank’s shareholders in years, an emphatic statement that he had found a way not only to preserve value, but to create it, despite all the headwinds of low euro interest rates, low growth and declining working-age populations in its core markets.
Then Covid-19 struck, and Unicredit was commanded by its regulators to keep all that surplus capital for absorbing a next wave of loan losses. All might have been well, had the bank been allowed to concentrate just on absorbing its own losses, but politicians in Rome had other, grander ideas.
In the spring, they engineered the appointment of career politician Pier Carlo Padoan as chairman. Padoan had overseen the nationalization of perennial basket-case Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) while finance minister, but the state now urgently needed to find a private buyer to take care of it.
Under state ownership, BMPS had planned a sale of 8 billion euros of bad debts and an accompanying capital increase to fix its balance sheet and allow a return to private ownership, but the European Central Bank had said its numbers didn’t add up, and demanded it find another 700 million euros (according to La Repubblica).
There was no way Mustier was going to blow all that accumulated capital on solving someone else’s problem, especially given BMPS’s reputation for finding a succession of black holes in its accounts. So he had to go.
The board’s argument is that Unicredit needs to bulk up in Italy, to respond to consolidation elsewhere.   Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) forced through a hostile takeover of UBI Banca earlier this year, giving it an even stronger hold on the lucrative northern Italian market, while Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) has made a move on third-tier lender Creval (MI:PCVI) after trying to tighten its alliance with Banco Bpm (MI:BAMI).
The shame is that Unicredit, having been a truly international bank capable of driving consolidation at the European level, is now doomed to become more inward-looking, more dependent on a stagnant Italian economy and, in all probability, doomed to become less profitable as a result. It could be a decent addendum to Barbara Tuchman's 1984 book ""The March of Folly"", a reflection the enduring ability of people to take decisions against their best interests, from the Trojans bringing in the Wooden Horse to the U.S. getting sucked into Vietnam.
It's a sad end to one of the few encouraging stories to come out of European banking in recent years.

MILAN/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares edged up to just below record peaks on Tuesday after robust China data boosted expectations of a recovery from the COVID-19 downturn and as drugmakers seek fast approval for their vaccines and authorities look set to keep stimulus support.
Bets of more easing from the Fed in the United States to help the pandemic-hit economy through the winter weighed on the dollar, as riskier currencies rose, while crude prices missed out on the bounce after OPEC+ countries delayed a decision on output cuts.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.4% by 0849 GMT. 
Breakthroughs in vaccine developments from top drugmakers  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) last month along with a market-friendly outcome of the U.S. presidential election helped the index score its best month on record, up 12% to new all-time peaks.
""We believe the rally can continue, with the current pipeline of expected vaccine rollouts in line with our central scenario of widespread availability in the second quarter of 2021,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management in Zurich.
""We also believe that a divided U.S. government - which looks the most likely outcome - is no impediment to a rising market,"" he added.
In Europe the pan-regional STOXX 600 benchmark was up 0.7% in early deals, while U.S. stock index futures also pointed to a strong start on Wall Street with investors focusing on November manufacturing surveys from Europe and the United States.
Earlier the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 1.3%, while China's blue-chip CSI300 index jumped 2.2% after a business survey showed on Tuesday activity in China's factory sector accelerated at the fastest pace in a decade in November. 
Japan's Nikkei rose 1.3% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.1% after Australia's central bank said the country's economy would need fiscal and monetary support ""for some time"".
""What we are seeing today is that upward trend reasserting itself, given the positive news on the vaccine front, China's growth picking up, and the tremendous faith in the ability of central banks to keep the markets afloat,"" said Stephen Miller, market strategist for GSFM Funds Management.
Moderna Inc applied for U.S. emergency authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine after full results from a late-stage study showed it was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns.
In foreign exchange markets, the dollar was under pressure after closing out its worst month since July with a little bounce and as investors reckon on even more U.S. monetary easing.
The dollar index was last down 0.3% to 91.706.
In a speech released late on Monday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said a slowing recovery and a surging pandemic meant the U.S. was entering a ""challenging"" few months, with the potential deployment of a vaccine still facing hurdles.
Elsewhere sterling hit a three-month high as traders clung to hopes for a Brexit trade deal before the year's end, while risk-related currencies such as the Canadian and Aussie dollar rose against the greenback.
The U.S. bond market was steady, as the U.S. Congress began a two-week sprint to secure government funding and avoid a possible shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. 10-year yields were up slightly at 0.8438%.
Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield hovered near three-week lows, while southern European debt yields kept record lows in sight ahead of next week's European Central Bank meeting.
Germany's Bund yield was a touch lower in early trade at -0.574%, close to Monday's three-week low of -0.60%. 
Reflecting the upbeat mood, copper prices rose with Shanghai prices hitting a more than eight-year high, helped by the robust Chinese data.
Oil prices however were slightly lower after leading producers delayed talks on 2021 output policy, while the coronavirus pandemic continued to sap fuel demand. 
OPEC+ delayed talks on output policy for next year until Thursday, three sources told Reuters, as key players still disagreed on how much oil they should pump amid weak demand/

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, boosted by more positive Covid-19 vaccine news as well as strong Chinese factory activity, pointing to a global economic recovery.
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.7% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 1%.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) sought clearance on Monday for its coronavirus vaccine in both the U.S. and Europe after full results from a late-stage study showed it was 94.1% effective, with no serious safety concerns.
This adds to potential vaccines from both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) which look set to be rolled out in the near future, and increases hopes of a swift economic rebound next year.
Meanwhile, earlier Tuesday the Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index showed activity in China's factory sector, an important global growth driver, accelerated at the fastest pace in a decade. The recovery in Chinese manufacturing has driven a big rally in industrial metals, pushing London-listed copper miner  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) to a series of fresh 12-month highs. Antofagasta stock was up 1.4% and is up 26% over the last month.
In Europe, the economic data was also generally positive, with the German unemployment rate falling to 6.1% in November, while the euro-zone manufacturing PMI actually increased to 53.8.
The spread of the Covid-19 virus appears to be weakening in a number of countries in the region, but the impact continues to be felt.
U.K. fashion group Arcadia collapsed into administration late on Monday, with more than 13,000 retail jobs at risk. Deloitte has been appointed the group's administrator and will now seek buyers for brands like Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins. Debenhams, another chronically-challenged fashion chain, also appears on the verge of collapse after JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports (LON:JD) walked away from rescue talks earlier Tuesday.
Elsewhere, UniCredit (MI:CRDI) stock fell 6.4% after the Italian bank’s CEO Jean Pierre Mustier said he would leave at the end of his term in April due to divergences with the board over strategy.
Staying with banks,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock rose 0.4% after the Swiss bank proposed Lloyds Banking Group's (LON:LLOY) departing chief executive officer Antonio Horta-Osorio as its next chairman.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, despite Reuters reporting that the OPEC+ meeting to discuss production levels has been delayed until Thursday after Russia and the United Arab Emirates proposed a 500,000 barrels a day increase.
The group has been expected to maintain the current cap on supply, rather than raising by 2 million barrels a day in January as previously agreed, given the current weak overall demand. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $45.69 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.8% to $48.26. Both benchmarks surged by 27% in November, boosted by hopes for three promising coronavirus vaccines.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,795.70/oz, after dropping almost 6% in November, its worst month in four years, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.1976.

UniCredit announced late on Monday Chairman elect Pier Carlo Padoan and the board would start looking for a replacement.
News of Mustier's departure comes on the backdrop of quickening consolidation in Italian banking, where the Treasury is looking for a buyer for bailed-out bank Monte dei Paschi.

723,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>","Tesla S&P Debut to Come All at Once, Rippling Across Markets","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. will be added to the S&P 500 Index in one shot on Dec. 21, a move that will ripple through the entire market as money managers adjust their portfolios to make room for shares of the $538 billion company.
Given Tesla’s massive market size, S&P had sought a consultation with investors earlier in November, asking for feedback on whether the stock should be folded into the index all at once or in two parts, which would have been unprecedented. The electric-vehicle maker will be the seventh-biggest company in the S&P 500 at its current market value, falling between  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa) and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V).
With about $11 trillion in funds tied to the S&P 500, money managers have been looking toward a few busy weeks ahead no matter how Tesla was included in the index. Whether it was one fell swoop or two separate tranches, managers of index-tracking funds would still have had to offload stocks of several other companies to make room for the mammoth newcomer in their portfolios.
“It looks like they’re ripping the band-aid off,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR). “It’s ultimately less disruptive than trying something new with the largest index addition ever.”
Tesla shares rose more than 4% in postmarket trading after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced the plan in a brief statement on Monday. The index provider said it will release a full statement on Tuesday morning. The stock slipped 3.1% in Monday’s regular session from a record high on Nov. 27. Tesla shares are up about 580% this year.
Adding the company in the traditional way is “simple and easy to understand” said Gary Black, a private investor who was chief executive of Aegon (NYSE:AEG) Asset Management from mid-2016 through September.
S&P Dow Jones said it will announce which company Tesla will be replacing in the index on Dec. 11.
After the initial buying of Tesla into the Dec. 21 inclusion, the stock may pull back, if history is any guide, according to Black. The shares may fall about 10% to 20%, a pattern that would be consistent with what happened to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after its entry into the S&P 500 seven years ago.

SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which has long struggled with labour relations in South Korea, will have to renegotiate a preliminary labour deal after a majority of union members voted against it.
Only about 45% of members were in favour of an agreement reached with union negotiators last week for each member to receive a lump sum payment of 4 million won ($3,615) by early 2021, a union official said on Tuesday.
The union stepped up demands this year as wages have been frozen since 2018, when the U.S. automaker received a state-backed rescue package to stay in the country.
GM has rejected employee demands to raise the retirement age by five years to 65 and to build more vehicles at one of its South Korean plants. 
The two sides have had 24 rounds of negotiations since July and GM's South Korean workers staged two four-hour strikes daily over 14 days last month in protest.
That has cost the automaker about 25,000 vehicles in lost production, according to an official at GM's Korea unit, which comes on top of some 60,000 units lost earlier in the year due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.
This month, the automaker issued its strongest warning yet that the unrest could in the long term drive it out of the country.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Social transformations triggered by the coronavirus pandemic are making index-following, passive stock investments less attractive and could reverse a decline in active stock investments, the chief executive of Nissay Asset Management said.
Hiroshi Ozeki said a recovery to pre-pandemic levels will be difficult for some industries such as restaurants, airlines and train operators.
Energy-intensive sectors also would be pressured by the need to deal with climate change, he added. 
""Even after the pandemic is over and even with some government help, they won't return to where they were,"" said the chief of the 13 trillion yen ($125 billion) asset management firm.
""Up until now, passive style has been a vogue - it's been said to be the most efficient investment. But with that, you are automatically putting your money in those industries with no growth stories,"" he said.
Assets held by exchange traded funds (ETFs), among the most convenient passive investments, have been increasing globally over the last decade.
In contrast, active funds, which try to aim for higher returns based on stock picking, have seen large outflows in recent years. 
""In the coming few years, active investments are likely to outperform passive ones. The era of active investment may be back,"" Ozeki said.
Companies which Nissay scores highly for Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) had done better this year, he said. 
Enterprises poised to benefit from the shift to renewable energy would prosper after the United States and Japan join other countries in adopting ambitious targets to achieve carbon neutrality.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has committed to net zero emissions by 2050 and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in October set the same goal for Japan.
""Some companies that have committed to 100% renewable power targets, such as  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) and Ricoh, are saying that Japan is now becoming the bottleneck among the developed world in achieving that goal,"" he said, citing limited availability and high costs of renewable energy.
""So it means a lot that Suga has made that target. For investors, too, it reduces risk when the government clarifies its long-term goal,"" Ozeki said.
Ozeki also said for next year he expected:
* Global share prices to rally further as the pandemic lasts longer than expected, forcing policymakers to continue to support the economy through monetary and fiscal measures.
* Short-term U.S. interest rates to stay low, making currency-hedged dollar bond investments attractive for Japanese investors.

(Reuters) - Value stocks are poised to catch up with better-performing peers if Washington passes new stimulus spending or similar actions to restore economic growth, the chief executive of Calvert Management and Research, John Streur, said.
Financial and industrial stocks, as well as some utility companies, ""seem likely to play a bit of catch-up and make up for the ground they lost"" compared with growth stocks like technology companies, said Streur, who was interviewed on Monday for the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit 2020.
For example, he said, utilities or transportation companies would benefit from extra spending by business customers if they had new money from the government, seen as more likely with the incoming administration of President-Elect Joe Biden.
""The biggest impact of the election is the hope that we'll have significantly more stimulus,"" even if Congress remains divided, Streur said.
Value stocks have lagged many growth portfolios this year as the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of the U.S. economy and sent some technology companies soaring - ""pandemic darlings"" Streur called them. 
Others also have speculated that cheaper value stocks are poised for a comeback once vaccines become widespread.
Through Monday, the Russell 1000 value index was down 3% for the year so far, while the Russell 1000 growth index was up 31%.
Calvert, with $23.4 billion under management as of June 30, is one of the oldest managers focused on sustainable investing. It will stay intact even while its parent,  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) Corp, is being acquired by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Streur said.
Streur said Calvert recently sold positions in  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) on concerns about spending and privacy at the social media platform. Like rivals, Twitter has faced criticism about the spread of misinformation and threats and has implemented some restrictions.
Such policing costs money, Streur said. ""These are financial, material risks the company is having a difficult time managing.""

731,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 12:50AM ET</span>",Mirae Asset wins U.S. lawsuit against China's Anbang on scrapped $5.8 billion hotel deal,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean investment bank Mirae Asset Daewoo Co Ltd said on Tuesday it won a U.S. court case against Anbang Insurance Group, after Mirae Asset affiliates scrapped a $5.8 billion deal to buy 15 U.S. hotels from Anbang. 
A consortium led by Mirae agreed last year to buy the hotels from Anbang, which had been selling some of its overseas assets after the Chinese government took control of the troubled insurer in 2018.
But the coronavirus pandemic put several deals at risk this year, as the tourism industry was one of the hardest hit by global travel restrictions. 
Anbang had filed a suit saying Mirae Asset affiliates must fulfill their promised payment for the hotels, while Mirae affiliates filed a counterclaim that Anbang return the deposit, pay transaction costs, and related litigation costs, Mirae said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. 
A Delaware court on Monday rejected Anbang's claims for payment and ruled Anbang should return the deposit and pay expenses of $3.685 million, according to the court document reviewed by Reuters. 
Anbang has been liquidated and some of its assets have been revamped into a new entity called Dajia Insurance Group. A Dajia official could not be reached immediately.

Shares in Mirae Asset rose 6% in Seoul on Tuesday.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 12:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: LG Chem to double China battery capacity to meet Tesla demand - sources,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Chem Ltd plans to more than double production capacity of battery cells it makes in China for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc electric vehicles (EV) next year, sources said, to keep up with its U.S. client's growth in the biggest car market.
The firm, a supplier for Tesla's Shanghai-built Model 3, will also ship its increased output from China as well as Korea to Tesla's factories in Germany and the United States, said two people with knowledge of the matter, signalling an increased role in the supply chain of the world's leading EV manufacturer.
The plan comes as Tesla, LG Chem's primary customer, scrambles to secure cells as part of an aggressive global production expansion plan, as it targets soaring demand fanned by governments promoting EVs to curb air pollution.
LG Chem has already added production lines in South Korea this year mainly to meet demand from Tesla's U.S. plant, the people said. Moreover, the automaker has asked Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp - which supplies the U.S. plant - to also supply its Shanghai factory, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the matter was confidential.
""Tesla simply doesn't have enough battery cells,"" said the person. ""So LG Chem is going to more than double China output.""
Tesla's growth represents a boon for LG Chem, Panasonic and Chinese supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), with Chief Executive Elon Musk revealing plans in September to increase purchases.
Still, Musk said supplies were insufficient and announced Tesla's plans to make its own, cheaper battery cells - a prospect that could injure suppliers' pricing power.
""We're continuing to expand capacity for cylindrical battery cells in response to growing demand from automakers but we can't comment on specific customers,"" an LG Chem spokesman said.
LG Chem, whose battery cell business on Tuesday became an independent unit, in October said it would triple capacity of cylindrical cells to 60 gigawatt hours by 2023, without naming Tesla or disclosing other details. Its China plan and Germany and U.S. destinations are reported here for the first time.
Tesla was not immediately available for comment. Panasonic declined to comment.
MODEL Y
LG Chem will invest $500 million over the next year to raise annual production capacity of 21700 cylindrical battery cells - a type used by Tesla - at its Nanjing plant by 8 GWh, the local government said last week, without disclosing current capacity.
The two people told Reuters the plan involved increasing the number of production lines to at least 17 from eight.
LG Chem, alongside CATL, supplies battery cells for Tesla's Model 3 sedan built in Shanghai, where production began last year and whose current annual capacity is 250,000 cars. Tesla aims to start making its Model Y sport-utility vehicle at the plant next year, for which capacity will reach 250,000 by 2022, Morningstar previously reported.
Each model uses 4,416 battery cells, and each LG Chem line is able to produce up to 7 million cells a month, one of the people said. LG Chem's 17 lines in Nanjing would therefore be able to cater for up to 323,000 vehicles a year, a Reuters calculation showed.
Initially, LG Chem will be the sole supplier for Shanghai-built Model Y cars, said one of the people. CATL was not immediately available for comment.

LG Chem's China factory will also initially supply battery cells for Tesla vehicles in Berlin when production there begins, the person said. The automaker needs permission should it want to make its own cells locally.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 11:50PM ET</span>",Exxon tries to put the worst behind it with $20 billion writedown,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Monday said it would write down the value of natural gas properties by $17 billion to $20 billion, its biggest ever impairment, and slash project spending next year to its lowest level in 15 years.
The oil major is reeling from the sharp decline in oil demand and prices from the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of bad bets on projects when prices were much higher. New cost cuts aim to protect a $15 billion a year shareholder payout that many analysts believe is unsustainable without higher prices. 
The writedown lays bare the size of the miscalculation that the company made in 2010 when it paid $30 billion for U.S. shale producer XTO Energy as natural gas prices went into a decade-long decline. The writedown also includes properties in Argentina and western Canada.
While smaller than the up to $30 billion charge the company forecast a month ago, the quarterly charge to earnings reflects the company's recent reduction in its outlook for oil and gas prices. 
Exxon will continue initiatives in offshore Brazil, Guyana, the Permian Basin shale field in the United States, and in performance chemicals despite plans to implement deeper spending cuts, it said. Not mentioned was its $30 billion Mozambique liquefied natural gas project, which sources do not expect final investment decision on until early 2022.
""Recent exploration success and reductions in development costs of strategic investments have further enhanced the value of our industry-leading investment portfolio,"" said Chief Executive Darren Woods. 
Business conditions are continuing to show signs of improvement despite the pandemic, he said. 
Exxon shares fell 5% in late trading to $38.13 and are down by half in the last five years.
The impairment charge ""further worsens the company's already substantial jump in financial leverage,"" said Pete Speer, senior analyst at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service. ""With this charge added to the big rise in debt this year, we see ExxonMobil’s debt/capitalization rising to nearly 30%, from just over 20% at the start of 2020.""
Next year's spending will fall, to between $16 billion to $19 billion, but Exxon could increase spending by 2025 to more than this year's about $23 billion level, Woods said. 
The plan to return to higher levels of capital expense struck investor Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, as unusual.
""In this environment it makes no sense to me at all. What's the hurry?"" he said. ""I don't think it's going to help them with investors.""

Exxon said last month it could cut 14,000 employees, or 15% of its global workforce, by the end of 2021.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 11:00PM ET</span>",S&P deal for IHS likely to draw antitrust scrutiny from Biden administration,"By Diane Bartz and David French
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Data giant S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc's plan to buy IHS Markit Ltd for $44 billion will face hard questions from the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, which has indicated that antitrust enforcement will get tougher, anti-trust experts said on Monday. 
The deal creates a stronger No. 3 in the financial information market by bringing together S&P Global's expertise in providing debt ratings to countries and companies and data on capital and commodity markets, with IHS' pricing and reference data for financial assets and derivatives.
Consolidation among financial information services providers is intensifying as companies seek to become one-stop-shops for financial professionals using data to run models and algorithms that influence billions of dollars of capital flows.
The merged company will continue to trail industry leaders Bloomberg LP and Refinitiv - partly owned by  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp, the parent of Reuters News - according to market research firm Burton-Taylor.
Suppliers of financial markets data generated $32 billion of revenue in 2019, according to Burton-Taylor. Bloomberg held the largest market share with 32.8%, followed by Refinitiv at 21.4%. S&P generated 6%, and IHS represented 2% of total revenue.
However, the sheer size of the deal will prompt antitrust enforcers to scrutinize the planned merger not only for areas where the companies compete directly, the traditional focus, but also areas where the companies had plans to compete in the future, antitrust experts said.
""I think it's going to run into really tough scrutiny in the Biden DOJ (Justice Department),"" said Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel. ""It would have been better for them if they tried to do this last spring.""
Asked about potential antitrust concerns, Douglas Peterson, CEO of S&P Global, sounded an optimistic note.
""We don't believe there's going to be any regulatory issues which we can't resolve,"" he told Reuters.
In a similar deal involving two huge data providers,  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc sold Borsa Italiana to help appease European Union regulators' concerns over its $27 billion deal to buy Refinitiv.
A source familiar with the two companies, speaking on condition of anonymity, said S&P Global may have to divest IHS' Opis oil price information service because of an overlap with S&P's competing Platts product. The source said this would not affect the combined firm's profitability. 
The S&P/IHS deal would likely be investigated by the Justice Department, whose antitrust leadership may not be in place for months. One Biden transition team member said recently in a speech that antitrust enforcement should be toughened. Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats have advocated for this.
""Any enormous merger like this in this particular climate is going to get the attention of the enforcement agency, no matter what administration,"" said Anna Pletcher of the law firm O'Melveny. But she also noted that other big companies provide data to investors and said she would be surprised if, after any scrutiny, the deal was challenged.

Beyond Bloomberg LP and Refinitiv, other companies providing different kinds of financial and commodity data include Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Corp, Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME) and Factset Research (NYSE:FDS) Systems Inc.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Tuesday morning, starting the month on a high note despite U.S. shares closing November by slipping from record highs.
“U.S. markets were a little bit lower, that’s what was holding us back a little bit,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
But he added, “people are pretty optimistic for a good 2021.”
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.29% by 10:03 PM ET (2:03 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.09%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) came in at 54.9 in November, with a figure above 50 representing expansion. That was above the 53.5 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s figure of 53.6.
These numbers come as Monday’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs also beat expectations, indicating that China is continuing on its path towards economic recovery from COVID-19. The Caixin services PMI is due later in the week.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.37%. The spike in the number of COVID-19 cases will see stricter social distancing measures in the city that will come into effect on Wednesday, including dining restrictions and most civil servants working from home.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.39% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 1.13%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 soared 1.34%, with the Reserve Bank of Australia widely expected to hand down an unchanged policy decision when it convenes later in the day.
Investor confidence remains high after  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced plans on Monday to request clearance for its candidate mRNA-1273 in the U.S. and Europe, with the company’s shares soaring up to 20%. Meanwhile,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) are also awaiting word on their own approval request for their candidate BNT162b2.
“I feel pretty confident that portfolios should be positioned for continued good performance from equity markets as we head into 2021,” AXA Investment Managers chief investment officer for core investments Chris Iggo said in a note.
Meanwhile, investors continue to hope for further monetary easing policies from the U.S. Federal Reserve despite the vaccine news. They will be looking to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress later in the day and on Wednesday, as well as the Fed policy meeting on Dec. 15 and 16, for clues on the central bank’s next moves."
736,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 08:35PM ET</span>",U.S. judge rejects $648 million Bayer PCB contamination settlement,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A federal judge has rejected  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN)'s proposed $648 million settlement of class-action litigation by cities and other claimants over contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, made by the former  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co.
In a Nov. 25 decision, U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles said the accord appeared ""overly broad"" because it could shield Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) from future claims, and require the settling plaintiffs to indemnify Bayer against those claims.
Olguin also said most of the 2,528 class members stood to receive ""very modest"" payments of just $15,000 to $30,000, making the indemnification provision ""troubling.""
Bayer, which bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018, said in a statement it would work with the plaintiffs to address Olguin's concerns, and was confident it would reach a revised preliminary settlement by the Dec. 31 deadline he set.
Los Angeles County and the cities of San Diego, Baltimore and Portland, Oregon are among the plaintiffs, which came from 36 U.S. states. The payout was to include $550 million for class members and up to $98 million for legal fees and expenses.
The German company announced the settlement in June, when it also proposed paying roughly $12 billion to resolve litigation tied to Monsanto.
Most of that was to resolve claims that Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller caused cancer. Bayer has said Roundup is safe for human use.
PCBs were once used widely to insulate electrical equipment, and also used in such products as carbonless copy paper, caulking, floor finish and paint. They were outlawed by the U.S. government in 1979 after being linked to cancer and other health problems. Monsanto produced PCBs from 1935 to 1977.
The case is City of Long Beach et al v. Monsanto Co, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 16-03493.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",S&P 500 to swallow Tesla in one gulp; shares surge,"By Arunima Kumar and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares jumped 4% in extended trade on Monday after S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would add one of Wall Street's most valuable companies to the S&P 500 index all at once on Dec. 21.
Adding Elon Musk's Tesla to Wall Street's most followed benchmark will force index funds to buy about $73 billion worth of its shares, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.
The electric car maker's stock has surged over 40% since Nov. 16, when it was announced Tesla would join the index. 
At that time, S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would consult investors about whether to potentially add Tesla in two tranches a week apart to make the addition easier to handle for index funds.
""In its decision, S&P DJI considered the wide range of responses it received, as well as, among other factors, the expected liquidity of Tesla and the market’s ability to accommodate significant trading volumes on this date,"" S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a media statement.
With a stock market value around $550 billion, Tesla will be among the most valuable companies ever added to the index. Tesla will account for just over 1% of the S&P 500.
Up about 600% in 2020, the California-based car maker has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
A blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle related to profitability that had prevented Tesla's inclusion in the S&P 500.
About a fifth of Tesla's shares are closely held by Musk, the chief executive, and other insiders. Since the S&P 500 is weighted by the amount of companies' shares actually available on the stock market, Tesla's influence within the benchmark will be slightly diminished, putting it at around seventh place, currently held by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

S&P Dow Jones said it would announce on Dec. 11 which company Tesla would replace in the S&P 500.

738,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>",Unilever to try out four-day working week in New Zealand,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Global consumer goods giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) said on Tuesday it was poised to try out a four-day working week for all its New Zealand employees.
Unilever said all 81 staff members at its offices across New Zealand will be able to participate in the trial, which starts next week and will run for 12 months until December next year. 
The employees will be paid for five days while working just four. 
Unilever New Zealand managing director Nick Bangs said the aim was to change the way work is done, not increase the working hours on four days. 
""If we end up in a situation where the team is working four extended days then we miss the point of this,"" he said.
""We don't want our team to have really long days, but to bring material change in the way they work.""
After 12 months, Unilever will assess the outcome of the move and look at how it could work for the rest of its 155,000 employees globally.
""It's very much an experiment. We have made no commitments beyond 12 months and beyond New Zealand. But we think there will be some good learning we can gather in this time,"" he said.
There is no manufacturing in New Zealand and all the staff are in sales, distribution and marketing.
A shorter working week has been debated for a while in New Zealand with estate planning firm Perpetual Guardian making headlines last year for pioneering the idea and declaring it had seen big productivity increases.
The idea gained momentum this year when Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern encouraged firms to look at four-day weeks to offer flexibility to employees amid the coronavirus pandemic. She also said it may help boost domestic tourism while international borders remained shut.
""When the prime minister talked about it in the context of what the future of work would look like, that was encouragement for us,"" said Bangs.

However, the New Zealand government has not taken the idea on board in its offices yet.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump to add China's SMIC and CNOOC to defense blacklist - sources,"By Alexandra Alper and Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to add China's top chipmaker SMIC and oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, escalating tensions with Beijing before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, according to sources familiar with the matter and a document seen by Reuters.
The Department of Defense (DOD) is poised to designate four more Chinese companies as owned or controlled by the Chinese military, bringing the total number to 35. A recent executive order issued by President Donald Trump would prevent U.S. investors from buying securities of the blacklisted firms starting late next year.
It was not immediately clear when the new additions to the blacklist would be published in the Federal Register, making the move official. But the list includes China Construction Technology Co Ltd and China International Engineering Consulting Corp, as well as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), according to the document seen by Reuters and four sources.
SMIC said it continued ""to engage constructively and openly with the U.S. government"" and that its products and services were solely for civilian and commercial use. ""The Company has no relationship with the Chinese military and does not manufacture for any military end-users or end-uses,"" it said in a statement.
Shares in SMIC closed 2.7% lower on Monday. 
CNOOC's listed unit  CNOOC Ltd , whose shares fell by almost 14% on Monday, said in a statement that it had checked with its parent and no formal notice from relevant U.S. authorities had been received.
Asked about Washington's planned move, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing hoped the United States would not erect barriers and obstacles to cooperation and discriminate against Chinese companies.
Later on Monday, Bernstein Research downgraded CNOOC Ltd's stock to 'market perform' by applying a 30% discount to share price targets, citing sanction risks that range from a ban on U.S. funds owning CNOOC stock to prohibiting U.S. companies from doing business with CNOOC. 
The DOD did not respond to a request for comment. 
SMIC, which relies heavily on equipment from U.S. suppliers, was already in Washington's crosshairs. In September, the U.S. Commerce Department informed some firms they needed to obtain a license before supplying goods and services to SMIC after concluding there was an ""unacceptable risk"" that equipment supplied to it could be used for military purposes.
The expanded blacklist is seen as part of a bid to cement outgoing Republican Trump's tough-on-China legacy and to box incoming Democrat Biden into hardline positions on Beijing amid bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Congress. The Biden campaign declined to comment. 
The measure is also part of a broader effort by Washington to target what it sees as Beijing's efforts to enlist corporations to harness emerging civilian technologies for military purposes.
Reuters reported last week that the Trump administration is close to declaring that 89 Chinese aerospace and other companies have military ties, restricting them from buying a range of U.S. goods and technology.
The list of ""Communist Chinese Military Companies"" was mandated by a 1999 law requiring the Pentagon to compile a catalog of companies ""owned or controlled"" by the People's Liberation Army, but DOD only complied in 2020. Giants like Hikvision, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) were added earlier this year.
""Our government is right to treat these firms as puppets of the Chinese government,"" Republican Senator Tom Cotton said, when asked about the upcoming additions. Cotton, a China hardliner, had called on DOD to release the list last year.
TEETH FOR THE BLACKLIST
This month, the White House published an executive order, first reported by Reuters, that sought to give teeth to the list by prohibiting U.S. investors from buying securities of the blacklisted companies from November 2021.
The directive is unlikely to deal the firms a serious blow, experts said, due to its limited scope, uncertainty about the stance of the Biden administration and already-scant holdings by U.S. funds. 
Still, top U.S. asset managers Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) each own about 1% of shares of CNOOC's listed unit CNOOC Ltd, and together own roughly 4% of outstanding shares of SMIC, disclosures show.
Vanguard and BlackRock declined to comment.
Combined with other measures, the expected move deepens a rift between Washington and Beijing, already at loggerheads over China's handling of the coronavirus and its crackdown on Hong Kong.

Congress and the administration have sought increasingly to curb the U.S. market access of Chinese companies that do not comply with rules faced by American rivals, even if that means antagonizing Wall Street.

740,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",Philip Green's Arcadia UK fashion group falls into administration,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - British tycoon Philip Green's Arcadia fashion group has collapsed into administration, putting over 13,000 jobs at risk and becoming the country's biggest corporate casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic so far.
Deloitte said late on Monday it had been appointed Arcadia's administrator and would seek buyers for the group's brands: Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Miss Selfridge, Evans, Burton and Outfit.
The group trades from 444 leased sites in the United Kingdom and 22 overseas.
Deloitte said Arcadia's stores would continue to trade, its online platforms would remain operational and supplies to concession partners would continue.
It said no redundancies were being immediately announced.
“We will be rapidly seeking expressions of interest and expect to identify one or more buyers to ensure the future success of the businesses,"" said Matt Smith, Deloitte's joint administrator.
Green, who was pictured over the weekend in Monaco where his 100 million pound ($133.26 million) super yacht Lionheart is docked, acquired Arcadia for 850 million pounds in 2002.
He had no immediate comment but his CEO laid the blame for Arcadia's demise firmly on the pandemic.
""In the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe,"" said Ian Grabiner.
Britain's Business minister, Alok Sharma, said the administration was ""incredibly sad news"" and the UK government would support those affected.
While COVID-19 lockdowns pushed Arcadia over the edge, it has struggled in recent years, underinvesting and failing to keep pace with competitors in an increasingly online retail sector.
Its brands were squeezed between the likes of  Inditex  (MC:ITX)'s Zara, H&M, and Primark and online-only players ASOS (LON:ASOS) and Boohoo.
A restructuring deal was approved by creditors last year, cutting rents and closing stores, but proved only a temporary respite.
SALE PROCESS
Mike Ashley's Frasers Group said on Monday it was interested in participating in any Arcadia sale process.
Topshop, once the go-to destination for teenagers and fashion lovers, is regarded by analysts as Arcadia's most attractive asset.
Media reports have also identified Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY), Next and Boohoo, as well as private equity players, as potential bidders for individual brands. All three companies declined to comment.
Arcadia's collapse could have a knock-on impact on the future of department store chain Debenhams, which is already in administration and employs 12,000. 
Arcadia is one of Debenhams' biggest concession holders.
Shares in JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion, which has been linked with a takeover of Debenhams, closed up 5.9%, indicating it was losing interest. Shares in Frasers closed down 5.7%.
PENSION FUND DEFICIT
Arcadia's workforce also faces uncertainty over a deficit in the company's pension fund, estimated by analysts at about 350 million pounds.
As part of last year's restructuring Arcadia agreed to provide 210 million pounds of security over property assets to the pension schemes, while Tina Green, Philip's wife and the ultimate owner of Arcadia, agreed to contribute 100 million pounds to the schemes over three years.
""Philip Green should do the right thing and fill the Arcadia pension deficit,"" said opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer.
If he does not pay up, Arcadia's 10,000 pension scheme members should still receive the bulk of their entitlement through the government's lifeboat scheme, the Pension Protection Fund.
Sharma said the administrators had three months to file a report on the conduct of Arcadia's directors with The Insolvency Service which will determine whether a full investigation is required.
""I will be keeping a very close eye on this process,"" he said.
Even before the pandemic, bricks-and-mortar clothing retailers in Britain were facing a major structural challenge with the economics of operating stores on traditional leases proving increasingly difficult as more trade migrates online.
Already this year Oasis, Warehouse, Laura Ashley, Peacocks and Jaeger have fallen into administration.

741,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>",Stocks ready to rally in '21 but outgoing Trump is risk: Pacific Life Fund Advisors,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets are poised to rally in 2021, bolstered by the predictability of a new U.S. president, fresh stimulus and infrastructure spending, plus a coronavirus vaccine. But there is a potential wild card: outgoing President Donald Trump, the head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors said on Monday.
Markets have already signaled relief that the U.S. election is over and a winner declared, with former Vice President Joe Biden taking over the Oval Office in January. The Dow and Nasdaq reached all-time records last week after Biden began naming cabinet secretaries and three drug companies unveiled promising vaccine results.
""Overall we are bullish on 2021,"" said Max Gokhman, who oversees $32 billion in assets. ""But exactly how bullish depends on a number of factors,"" he told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit.
One factor is just how voluble Trump, who has long used Twitter as his megaphone, will be in the weeks before Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration, as well as beyond, Gokhman said.
""One of the key risks of 2021 remains Donald Trump,"" said Gokhman. ""Trump won't go away or be quiet. He could skew us to lower growth and lower equity returns.""
Pacific Life Fund Advisors cut its exposure to large-cap tech companies in favor of small-cap value in September, for example, and is now more neutrally positioned to get through the next weeks.
U.S. stocks rallied during Trump's presidency, up more than 60% from his 2016 election to the Nov. 3 Election Day. Stocks have continued to rally since then. 
Still, Gokhman noted some unpredictable actions by Trump since losing the election, such as firing the Pentagon chief, while his Treasury secretary said he will end programs designed to help markets and businesses survive the pandemic. Trump is also moving to sell drilling rights in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Few investors are talking about it publicly, since the Standard & Poor's 500 is up 12% this year, having rebounded 60% from March lows. But Gokhman said he worries about executive orders Trump could push through before he goes and how disruptive he could be in influencing fellow Republicans, considering he still commands a sizeable base of the electorate.
Both could complicate stimulus spending and infrastructure investments that markets are betting Biden favors and could prompt bigger gains for cyclical stocks down the road, Gokhman said.
Among the first indications for how strong next year's gains may be will be how Georgia voters decide U.S. Senate run-off elections on Jan. 5. ""For a value rotation to really take off, we would need Georgia to go blue,"" Gokhman said.
Financial stocks like banks could get a boost by making fresh loans to businesses, with growth forecast to pick up next year. Logistics companies, including FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS, could get a boost by participating in rolling out a coronavirus vaccine.
Even energy companies like  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM), whose stock prices have been battered this year, could see an uptick in demand as people begin driving more once the virus is more under control. In addition, equipment from  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and  United Rentals  (NYSE:URI), which would benefit from infrastructure spending, also run on oil products, suggesting a positive knock-on effect for energy companies, Gokhman said.
""If infrastructure, stimulus and vaccine deployment go well then you could have an absolutely incredible market"" next year, he said.

“That represents somewhere between a fifteen to thirty five percent growth over last year's Cyber Monday.”
Traditionally, Cyber Monday starts with people scouring for discounts online after the holiday weekend.
This year, it follows a blowout day for online sales on Black Friday, which pulled in a record $9 billion in online sales, according to Adobe.
That as shoppers turned up in smaller numbers at stores as they utilized the early deals and avoided stepping out into large crowds.
Consumers sought out deals for gifts and necessities including the latest Xbox and PlayStation consoles, Lego sets, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches."
743,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>","JPMorgan Chase may freeze some salaries while paying traders higher bonuses, source says","(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) plans to freeze salaries for most employees with titles of vice president and above even as it expects to increase bonuses for some traders as much as 20%, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The plans come as bank executives grapple with next year's budgets and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which include low interest rates and higher costs for loan losses even as trading revenue has surged.
As part of the incentive pay for traders, bonuses increase when market revenue rises. Wall Street firms routinely report higher compensation costs for traders after markets have been strong.
""Traders obviously had a very good year and you would expect them to be up,"" the source said.
At the same time, the bank has been keen to show that it is holding the line on expenses broadly. ""The bank's bonus pools this year are generally down,"" the person said.
The decisions were first reported by Bloomberg News.

744,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 04:14PM ET</span>","Salesforce, Zoom Video, Vehicle Sales: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Despite dropping on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded the best monthly gain since 1987, driven higher by a surge in big brand companies such as  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
Rising numbers of new Covid-19 infections, threatening a new set of business restrictions just as the holiday shopping season gets into gear, will weigh on markets. The bad news is countered by optimism that a vaccine is not far off.
Still, travel and leisure stocks aren’t likely to recover until life returns to more normal levels of activity. JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU), for example, fell on Monday after forecasting worse than expected revenue trends for the fourth quarter.
There have been some stocks that benefited from work-from-home trends, and two of them have earnings this week. Tuesday also offers data on car and truck sales, which have been gaining as people look to replace their public transportation options with more pandemic-friendly options.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Salesforce reports earnings and a deal
Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) reports earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday, the same day it is expected to unveil a deal to buy the office messaging app  Slack Technologies Inc  (NYSE:WORK). Shares of Slack surged in advance of the news, ballooning its market value to more than $20 billion.
Salesforce is expected to report earnings per share of 74 cents on revenue of $5.25 billion.
2. Zoom Video beats expectations, and stock could soar on Tuesday
 Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM), which reports after Monday’s closing bell, is widely seen as a beneficiary of pandemic-related stay at home orders that forced students and workers to communicate over video rather than congregate in person. Last week’s Thanksgiving holiday in the United States also featured a new facet of daily life in American households: the family Zoom call. This may well change once a vaccine is delivered to the vast majority of the population, but that’s a few months off.
Profit of 99 cents a share beat the expectations of analysts tracked by Investing.com, who forecast 76 cents on revenue of $693.4 million.
3. Vehicle sales show rush to pandemic-friendly travel options
People flocked to used car dealers this year to buy a vehicle that will keep them off public transportation, even though people aren’t driving as much to offices and schools, at least not now. This has been good for shares of online dealers such as  CarMax Inc  (NYSE:KMX) and  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA). 
Late on Tuesday, data on auto and truck sales are released. The numbers are reported along with total vehicle sales at 3:00 PM ET (1900 GMT). There were 16.2 million vehicles sold in October, up from 15.7 million in September and continuing this year’s trend higher.

748,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>","GM, Nikola announce reworked agreement; Nikola shares tumble 25%","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Nikola Corp on Monday announced a reworked agreement on a fuel-cell partnership that eliminates an equity stake in the startup for the Detroit automaker as well as plans for building Nikola's electric pickup truck, sending Nikola shares tumbling almost 25%.
In September, the companies announced a deal under which GM would supply batteries, a chassis architecture, fuel cell systems and a factory to build Nikola's proposed Badger electric pickup in return for an 11% stake and $700 million. 
But the deal came into question after a short seller criticised Nikola as a fraud, something Nikola has denied.
The new agreement, a non-binding memorandum of understanding that doesn't expire until the end of 2021, is subject to negotiation and a definitive deal, Nikola and GM said in separate statements. 
Under the new deal, GM will supply its fuel-cell system for Nikola's Class 7 and Class 8 commercial semi-trucks, Nikola said. The companies are also discussing Nikola's potential use of GM's Ultium electric battery system in its commercial trailers.
Nikola officials said the new deal focuses on the fuel-cell side of the business, where they see the greatest potential. They also said they remain confident of signing a deal by year end with an energy partner to build hydrogen-refueling stations.
Nikola's shares sank almost 25% in afternoon trading, while GM's fell 1.7%.
J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster said in a research note GM's decision not to take a stake in Nikola as originally planned would weigh on Nikola's shares, but longer term, the new agreement was positive for the startup as it could now focus on its commercial truck business.
In addition, the lock-up period preventing the sale of 161 million shares expires on Tuesday. That could put even more pressure on Nikola's value if they are sold because the stock's current float is only 117 million shares,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Emmanuel Rosner said. Most of the locked-up shares are owned by founder Trevor Milton, who resigned in September.
A spokesman for Milton, who owns 91.6 million shares in Nikola, declined to comment on his intentions for the stake. 
Nikola also said on Monday it would refund all previously submitted order deposits for the Badger as that rollout was dependant on a manufacturer partnership. Nikola officials said the Badger was ""paused indefinitely.""
“Heavy trucks remain our core business and we are 100% focused on hitting our development milestones to bring clean hydrogen and battery-electric commercial trucks to market,"" Nikola Chief Executive Mark Russell said in a statement. 

GM said Nikola will pay upfront for the capital investment necessary for the fuel-cell capacity. The fuel-cell system will be built at GM's Brownstown Charter Township battery plant in Michigan.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>",U.S. bond volatility players eye 2021 inflation bump,"By Aaron Saldanha and Lisa Pauline Mattackal
(Reuters) - After a decade of central bank bond buying, fund managers have begun to wonder if there is again money to be made in betting or hedging against volatility in the bond market caused by an economic recovery next year.
The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE Index, which tracks expectations of volatility in Treasuries, is again languishing near all-time lows after a spike in March was quelled by U.S. Federal Reserve intervention. 
But a handful of fund managers, and some major banks, warn of the risk of a spike in inflation next year that could spur losses for bond funds and more volatility before the Fed steps back in, or eventually even change the central bank's stance.
Nancy Davis, who manages the Quadratic Interest Rate Volatility and Inflation Hedge ETF, said she has seen a jump in interest in recent weeks from investors worried about the impact of rebound in some of the consumer and asset prices quashed by this year's crisis. 
She argues that while stock markets have accounted for COVID-19 vaccines spurring a swift recovery in 2021, debt market indicators of inflation have not budged, leaving bondholders exposed if headline price growth moves. 
""Equities already seem to be pricing this in, but the rates market hasn't,"" Davis told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF) last week.
""In the U.S., we are likely to get fiscal stimulus from the new administration combined with the loose monetary policy that could push inflation higher, it is probably an underpriced risk at this point,"" she added.
While any sustained spike in yields would likely be met by action from the Fed to talk them down, in the back of some investors' minds is the risk that officials could at some point be satisfied that economic growth justifies higher yields.
In the year through Nov. 18, Lipper data shows IVOL's assets under management rose more than nine times to $752.2 million.
OTHER SIGNS
As central bank bond purchases suppress rate volatility, investors have turned to markets like stocks and foreign exchange for signals on the macroeconomic outlook. 
Wall Street's consensus is that inflation will remain fairly dormant. U.S. 5-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities(TIPS), or inflation-linked bonds, show the anticipated ""break-even"" rate of inflation in five years at around 1.67%, below the Fed's average target of 2%. 
Yields on both 5-year and 10-year TIPS have been firmly in negative territory since March and are currently at -1.31% and -0.92% respectively.
Five-year breakeven rates, however, have picked up from under 1% in June, and some houses have listed unexpected inflation moves as a risk. 
Analysts at French fund manager Amundi said this month that overshooting inflation is unlikely, but recommended investors consider inflation-linked bonds to position for a remote yet possible snapback in inflation under an 'upside scenario'.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists recommend buying 5-year breakevens, forecasting break-even inflation rates across the U.S. curve to rise above 2% by the end of 2021. 
Countering that is the wide-ranging conviction that, even if inflation does tip higher, Fed buying will keep fixed rate bond prices high and quell yields as it seeks a more durable expansion in inflation expectations and growth. 
Another fund manager focusing on the need to vary bond strategies, David Wagner of Aptus Capital Advisors, told the GMF the Fed would keep pressure on yields. But he also pointed to a bumpier road ahead. 
""The underlying theme here is that we believe there could be increased volatility in the future,"" he said.

Investing.com --  Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is down 7% on expectations it will add office messaging app Slack to its arsenal.
The deal is set to be announced after the market close on Tuesday, according to CNBC, which cited sources. It should be half cash and half stock, and price Slack at a premium.
 Slack Technologies Inc  (NYSE:WORK) is up 5% on Monday, and Salesforce is scheduled to report quarterly earnings after the close on Tuesday.  
The Wall Street Journal had first reported the talks last week, driving Slack up almost 40%. The news comes as tech companies tap the work from home trend driven by Covid-19, and try to outdo each other.
Revenue at Slack rose almost 50% in the most recent quarter from a year earlier as the messaging company broke even for the first time.
Last year, Salesforce paid $15.3 billion for data visualization company Tableau and $6.5 billion for MuleSoft in 2018, according to The Street.
Wedbush said Salesforce would be making an ""aggressive move"" to expand the ""cloud enterprise product offering focused on further penetrating its golden installed base with what would be its biggest acquisition ($20 billion+) ever if Slack ultimately gets acquired tomorrow,"" The Street reported.
Slack shares are up 92% since the start of the year, while Salesforce has rallied about 47%.

Arcadia owns the Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Miss Selfridge, Evans, Burton and Outfit brands, trading from over 500 stores and employing over 13,000 people.
Its sales have been hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic and Sky News reported on Friday that it could go into administration as soon as Monday.

(Reuters) - DoorDash Inc said on Monday it is aiming to raise up to $2.8 billion in an initial public offering (IPO), which could double the value of the U.S. food delivery startup and be one of 2020's largest public market debuts.
DoorDash, the biggest U.S. third-party delivery company for restaurants, plans to sell 33 million shares priced between $75 and $85 apiece, it said in a regulatory filing.
At the top of its target range, the IPO would give DoorDash a fully diluted valuation - which includes securities such as options and restricted stock units - of $31.96 billion, nearly double the $16 billion DoorDash was worth in a June private fundraising round. DoorDash's market capitalization at $85 per share would total $27 billion. 
The hefty jump in DoorDash's valuation in a matter of months underscores the increased demand for meal delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as anticipation of continued investor demand for new stocks which promise growth. 
Companies have raised over $140 billion in the United States so far in 2020, making it the biggest year ever for IPOs, according to data from Dealogic.
Founded in 2013, DoorDash is backed by the Vision Fund managed by Japan tech giant SoftBank Group Corp, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), Singapore's sovereign wealth fund.
DoorDash and rivals Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats , Grubhub Inc and Postmates Inc have benefited from a surge in demand for food delivery services due to widespread COVID-19 restrictions.
The company posted a surge in revenue growth in 2020 and its first quarterly profit, it disclosed in its IPO filing earlier this month.
A number of big Silicon Valley names including Palantir Technologies Inc , Snowflake Inc and Unity Software Inc have gone public this year, riding on a stock market rally in the second half of the year fueled by stimulus money and hopes of an effective vaccine to end the pandemic.
DoorDash's IPO and a planned listing by home rental startup Airbnb Inc are set to make December a busy period for IPOs unlike in previous years and mark a strong finish to a blockbuster year for new listings.
San Francisco-based DoorDash plans to float its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 'DASH' on Dec. 9. It had confidentially filed for an IPO in February. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for the offering.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Analysis: Small caps set to keep surging as vaccines aid recovery,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Small cap stocks have far outperformed their larger counterparts in November en route to their best monthly performance on record, and look set to remain Wall Street leaders as companies poised to benefit from an economic recovery. 
The Russell 2000 and S&P 600 indexes of small cap stocks are up more than 19% for the month - the biggest monthly percentage jump for both indexes, which date back to 1979 and the end of 1993, respectively - as investors bet recent positive trial results for COVID-19 vaccines will help pull the economy out of a recession. 
While smaller names typically see outsized price moments compared to their larger brethren, the small cap gains for November have nearly doubled the roughly 11% gain in the S&P 500 this month. 
Mega cap work-from-home leaders like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) that have benefited from COVID-19 economic restrictions had helped the S&P 500 outperform smaller names since the pandemic lows in March. But they have begun to lag of late as optimism grows that highly effective vaccines will soon be available.
On Monday,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc said it would seek U.S. and European emergency authorization for its vaccine after full results from a late-stage study showed it to be 94.1% effective in preventing COVID-19, joining  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) in applying for emergency use.
""As you got this vaccine news you started to get this rotation into the reopening side of the economy into small cap stocks, value stocks,"" said Tom Hainlin from global investment strategist U.S. Bank Wealth Management's Ascent Private Wealth Group in Minneapolis. 
Small cap stocks are generally seen as the first to recover as the U.S. economy pulls out of a recession. They rely less on overseas revenue and are advantaged by a heavy concentration in cyclical sectors such as financials, materials, energy and industrials that also do well as an economy begins to expand.
""You’ve got a lot more domestic exposure, you have an economy doing better, that is going to work well,"" said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in New York.
According to FTSE Russell, as of Sept. 30, economically sensitive financials, industrials, materials and energy accounted for 36% of the weighting in the Russell 2000 index. In the S&P 600, those four sectors account for more than 43% of the total index weighting, per Refinitiv data. In the large cap S&P 500, the same four sectors account for about 24.5% of the overall index weighting. 
DeSanctis noted that even with the recent surge in smaller stocks, they are still below their long-term performance trend relative to the large cap S&P 500, giving them room to climb.

In addition, small caps appear comparatively cheap, even with the strong November performance. In a recent note to clients, Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/Suntrust Advisory Services in Atlanta points out the S&P 600 is trading at a discount relative to the S&P 500 on a number of valuation metrics, including price to earnings, price to sales and price to cash flow. 
Graphic: Small cap price to earnings relative to large cap https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakvexrmnpr/Pasted%20image%201606326123439.png
While the longer economic outlook may be positive, the next few months are expected to be rocky, which could lead to some volatility for small caps. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Michael Feroli recently forecast an economic contraction of a 1% annualized rate in the first quarter, down from the prior view of a 1.5% increase.
Recent economic data has been uneven, showing a slowing in the labor market and a drop in income, while spending on both the consumer and business side has held up. In their November policy meeting, Federal Reserve officials discussed how the central bank's asset purchases could be adjusted to provide more support to markets and the economy. 
""It’s not a perfect backdrop but if you look through to the second half of 2021, you can see things doing a lot better,"" said DeSanctis. 
While markets and the economy may stall in the near-term, investors should not mistake that for a double-dip recession, said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett, who noted upward earnings revisions for the Russell 2000 are at a 20-year high and ""such a development has typically augured well for a full economic recovery."" 
November has historically been the best month for the Russell 2000, however, December typically yields the second-best monthly performance, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. 
The Russell 2000 averages a 2.15% return in December, climbing 76% of the time for the highest frequency of advance, compared to an average gain of 1.47% for the S&P 500 and a 73% frequency of advance, Stovall noted.

756,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 11:16AM ET</span>",JetBlue Falls as Air Travel Stays Off Our Vacation Lists,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU) tumbled more than 5% after saying it will likely fly at 45% to 50% capacity in the fourth quarter compared to last year. It's also burning through more cash than expected.
The airline had previously expected a decrease of about 45%. Quarterly revenue is set to decrease approximately 70% year-over-year, as compared to the previous planning assumption of a decrease of approximately 65% year-over-year, JetBlue said in a statement.
The company plans to continue to manage capacity and align with demand on a rolling basis. Given recent booking trends, the company now expects its average daily cash burn in the fourth quarter to be in a range of $6 million and $8 million, compared to its prior expectation of a range between $4 million and $6 million.
Shares fell more than 60% from January to March, when the Covid-19 pandemic prompted governments around the world to issue stay-at-home mandates to prevent the spread of the illness. Months later, and amid a second wave of infections, airlines have laid off tens of thousands of employees as demand has plummeted and the future remains unclear. At least three vaccines have proved to be effective, but they must now be approved and distributed globally. Those challenges have yet to be tackled.
Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) trends remain volatile, and JetBlue continues to believe demand and revenue recovery will be nonlinear through the fourth quarter and beyond. ""We cannot predict changes due to additional COVID-19 related disruptions or other issues,"" the company said.
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter should drop at least 30%, and will continue to fluctuate based on flown capacity. 
Separately, Raymond James's Savanthi Syth downgraded Southwest Airlines Company (NYSE:LUV) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), saying that “While there could be upside, we are maintaining the trajectory in our revenue recovery forecasts, which already reflected a widely available vaccine by YE21,” Syth said in a note, according to StreetInsider. She did upgrade United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL).
“United appears to be taking a different approach from its legacy peers, creating flexibility (e.g., pilot agreement spanning towards the end of 2022 that provides more cost variability, no permanent fleet retirements) to be ready for a faster than anticipated recovery that could lead to market share gains (vs. competitors that would require more time to bring capacity back online),"" Syth wrote.   
Syth has a hold rating on JBLU.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>",Moderna to seek U.S. and EU authorization for its vaccine on Monday,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Michael Erman
(Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc will apply for U.S. and European emergency authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine on Monday after full results from a late-stage study showed it was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns, the company said.
Moderna also reported that its vaccine's efficacy rate was consistent across age, race, ethnicity and gender demographics as well as having a 100% success rate in preventing severe cases of a disease that has killed nearly 1.5 million people. 
The filing sets Moderna's product up to be the second vaccine likely to receive U.S. emergency use authorization this year following a shot developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech which had a 95% efficacy rate.
""We believe that we have a vaccine that is very highly efficacious. We now have the data to prove it,"" Moderna Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks said. ""We expect to be playing a major part in turning around this pandemic.""
Of the 196 people who contracted COVID-19 out of over 30,000 volunteers, 185 had received a placebo and 11 got the vaccine. Moderna reported 30 severe cases, all in the placebo group, which means the vaccine was 100% effective against severe cases. 
Moderna shares opened 13% higher at a record $144 following the results and then went on to hit a peak of $150.14, or a gain of 668% so far this year.
""As the numbers of cases reported grows, confidence grows that this amazing protection will be maintained in a product that can be rolled out to protect the public,"" said Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at Britain's University of Reading.
In addition to filing its U.S. application, Moderna said it would seek conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency, which is already reviewing its data, and would continue to talk with other regulators doing similar rolling reviews.
""Although we await the full details of these results in published form, we can now assume that this vaccine will be approved for use in December,"" said Gillies O'Bryan-Tear, chair of policy and communications at Britain's Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine.
He expected Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to approve the vaccine within two weeks.
Pfizer has already applied for emergency use authorization in the United States and Europe, putting it about a week ahead of Moderna.
'JUST OVERWHELMING'
Moderna said it was on track to have about 20 million doses of its vaccine ready to ship in the United States by the end of 2020, enough to inoculate 10 million people.
Switzerland's Lonza, which has a contract with Moderna to supply ingredients for the vaccine, rose 4.4%.
The vaccines developed by both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech use a new technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) whereas others, such as Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), are using more traditional methods.
AstraZeneca has announced an average efficacy rate of 70% for its shot and as much as 90% for a subgroup of trial participants who got a half dose, followed by a full dose. But some scientists have expressed doubts about the robustness of the 90% efficacy figure for the smaller group. 
Moderna's latest efficacy result is slightly lower than an interim analysis released on Nov. 16 of 94.5% effectiveness, a difference that Zaks said was not statistically significant.
""At this level of effectiveness, when you just do the math of what it means for the pandemic that's raging around us, it's just overwhelming,"" said Zaks, who said he cried when he saw the final results over the weekend.
Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines proved more effective than anticipated and were far superior to the 50% benchmark set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The past few weeks of positive vaccine results have ignited hopes for an end to a pandemic that has battered economies and come as new infections and COVID-19 hospitalizations are at record levels across the United States. 
Independent advisers to the FDA are scheduled to meet on Dec. 10 to review Pfizer's data and make a recommendation to the U.S. regulator. They will review Moderna's data a week later. 
Soon after getting the green light, Moderna expects its vaccine to be shipped to distribution points across the United States by the government's Operation Warp Speed program and drug distributor McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK).
The distribution is expected to be easier than Pfizer's because while it needs to be stored in a freezer, it does not require the ultra-cold temperature needed by Pfizer's vaccine.
CONSISTENT ACROSS AGE AND ETHNICITY
Moderna said the 196 COVID-19 cases in its trial included 33 adults over 65 years old and 42 volunteers from racially diverse groups, including 29 Latinos, 6 Blacks, 4 Asian Americans and 3 multiracial participants. There was one death related to COVID-19 in the placebo group during the trial.
""This is as black and white as an effect on a population will be. Your chances of actually being sick if you've been vaccinated are decreased 20-fold,"" said Moderna's Zaks.
Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, said Monday's details confirmed the vaccine was highly effective, including against severe cases.
""Whilst this does not exclude some risk of severe disease after vaccination given the relatively small number of severe cases, these results suggest very high efficacy,"" she said.
Moderna reported no new side effects since its interim analysis, which showed the most common side effects were fatigue, injection site redness and pain, headache and body aches, which rose after the second dose and were short-lived.
Zaks said the vaccine caused significant flu-like symptoms in some participants which, ""goes hand-in-hand with having such a potent vaccine."" But it has not caused any significant safety concerns so far, he said.
Moderna plans to start a new trial to test the vaccine in adolescents before the end of the year, followed by another in even younger volunteers early in 2021. It hopes to have the vaccine available for adolescents by September, Zaks said.

Other vaccine makers have said they are studying their vaccines in young people as well.

 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock also surged 16% to a new all-time high after it filed for emergency use approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in both the U.S. and Europe. The company said that final trial data showed the drug's efficacy to be over 94%, without any serious safety concerns.
By contrast, Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) stock fell over 23% to its lowest in over a year after it said that General Motors (NYSE:GM) no longer intends to buy a stake a company,  and that its Badger truck project would therefore not go ahead as planned (newswires cited sources saying that it had been shelved 'indefinitely'.
Nikola also announced a major stock offering to replace the investment capital it would have received from GM if their September deal had been finalized. The marketing for that offering coincides with the expiry of the lockup of founder Trevor Milton's shares. 
The market reacted positively to news of what is the biggest M&A deal announced so far this year, which is set to create a new giant in financial data. S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has agreed to buy IHS Markit  (NYSE:INFO) for some $39 billion and another $5 billion in debt in an all-stock transaction.

LONDON (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange's pan-European share trading platform, Turquoise, opened for trading on Monday, a spokeswoman for the exchange said, joining two rival operators.
The Amsterdam-based hub was set up to avoid disruption to the LSE's EU customers, who face having to trade euro-denominated shares inside the bloc from January because Britain's full access to the EU ends on Dec. 31.
Two other London-based share trading platforms, Cboe and Aquis Exchange, have opened so-called Brexit hubs in the EU to trade shares denominated in euros.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is also opening a platform in time for January.
Cboe, Euronext and LSE Group vie to be the largest pan-European share trading platform, each having roughly 20% of the market on any given day.
A notional 37.6 billion euros in shares were traded across all main platforms on Friday, according to figures from Cboe.
Cboe's Dutch hub has been up and running for months, but volumes are not expected to pick up until January. Aquis said its Paris unit came on stream on Nov. 11.
Turquoise offers trading in stocks that have a primary listing in the European Economic Area, with the same shares still being offered in London.
While opening alternative trading platforms in the EU won't lead to many jobs leaving London, other trading-related activities, such as clearing and settlement, are also likely to move over time.
Many international banks in London have opened Brexit hubs in the EU and are under pressure from regulators to undertake activities such as stock, bond and derivatives transactions for EU clients from inside the bloc rather than in London.

Travel rules in England will change from Dec. 15 so that if a traveller receives a negative test result from a self-funded test, they can reduce their quarantine from 14 to 5 days.
Desperate to stimulate the travel market after months of restrictions, airlines and airports are teaming up with testing firms to make it easier and cheaper to get a test. 
EasyJet, whose finances have come under severe pressure during the pandemic, said on Monday that passengers will receive a reduced rate of 75 pounds per home test with Confirm Testing or with CityDoc, 100 pounds per home test or 150 pounds per in clinic test.
The 75 pound rate is cheaper than the 85 pound rate available to Wizz Air passengers. Both are more expensive than Gatwick Airport's offer of 60 pounds per test for passengers who use its drive-through testing facility.
EasyJet said that the two companies it was working with aimed to provide results within 48 hours. 
There is also demand for tests prior to travel as some popular destinations like Spain and Italy require passengers to show a negative test on arrival.

In cooled warehouses on the fringes of Frankfurt airport,  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY) is preparing its depleted fleet for the gargantuan task of airlifting millions of doses of the vaccines meant to end the global pandemic.
Lufthansa, one of the world’s biggest cargo carriers, began planning in April in anticipation of the shots that  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) to  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc. and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc are developing in record time. A 20-member task force is at work devising how to fit more of the crucial payload onto the airline’s 15 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 777 and MD-11 freighters, along with hold space in a vast passenger fleet now flying at just 25% of capacity.
“The question is how we scale it up,” said Thorsten Braun, who leads Lufthansa’s part in the global effort.
Laid low by a Covid-19 outbreak that’s decimated passenger demand, airlines will be the workhorses of the attempt to eradicate it, hauling billions of vials to every corner of the globe. It’s an unprecedented task, made more difficult by the carriers’ diminished state after culling jobs, routes and aircraft to survive a crisis that’s reduced air traffic globally by an estimated 61% this year.
“This will be the largest and most complex logistical exercise ever,” said Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive officer of the International Air Transport Association, the industry’s chief lobby. “The world is counting on us.”
IATA estimates that the equivalent of 8,000 loads in a 110-ton capacity Boeing 747 freighter will be needed for the airlift, which will take two years to supply some 14 billion doses, or almost two for every man, woman and child on Earth. It’s a tall order, given about one-third of the global passenger fleet is still in storage, based on data from Cirium.
Katherine O’Brien, the World Health Organization’s head of immunization, likens the task of distributing the vaccines after the months-long development sprint to summiting Mount Everest having reached base camp.
“The climb to the peak is really about delivering the vaccines,” she said on Nov. 16.
Here are some of the biggest challenges along the way:
Cargo Capacity
There are around 2,000 dedicated freighters in use, carrying about half of all goods moved by air. The remainder typically goes in the bellies of the world’s 22,000 regular jetliners.
While the freighters are full, air-cargo volume has tumbled this year because so much belly capacity is sitting idle. Airlines have drafted about 2,500 passenger planes into cargo-only roles, but the job of distributing the vaccine would be easier if fleets were flying with usual frequencies to their usual destinations.
At the start at least, space will be limited. The massive undertaking is expected to begin at a peak time for cargo carriers, right as the online Christmas shopping frenzy, boosted this year by Covid-19, reaches its zenith.
Pfizer plans to ship 1.3 billion doses of its vaccine by the end of next year, with Moderna producing about 500 million. AstraZeneca has manufacturing capacity for 2 billion doses, half of those targeted to low- and middle-income nations.
“What we have to do is very quickly help the world get up on its feet,” said Dennis Lister, vice president for cargo at Emirates, the world’s largest long-distance airline. “Part of that is making sure we get vaccines on planes to people that need it, so we get people flying again.”
To allow more passenger jets to be brought back into service, governments should open up travel, says Glyn Hughes, IATA’s global head of cargo, striking a familiar industry refrain.
Deep Freeze
The Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine adds an extra layer of difficulty. It must be transported at minus 70 degrees Celsius, colder than winter in Antarctica, and the companies plan to use GPS-enabled thermal sensors to track the location and temperature of each vaccine shipment.
Upon arrival, the vaccine can be stored in ultra-low temperature freezers (which are commercially available and can extend the vaccine’s shelf life for up to six months), or in a fridge in a hospital for five days at 2-to-8 degrees Celsius, or in a special Pfizer thermal shipper, in which the doses will arrive. That can be used as a temporary storage unit by refilling with dry ice for up to 15 days. Once thawed, the vials cannot be re-frozen.
The choreography will be delicate, with controls in place from factory to clinic and all points between. Virtually no aircraft are capable of keeping items so cold. Airlines will instead rely on Pfizer’s specialized containers to cool the medicine.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. has begun flights to ready Pfizer’s vaccine for distribution if it receives regulatory approval, said a person familiar with the matter. The pharmaceutical company and the airline declined to comment on the flights, which were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. are among other carriers that said they are prepared to handle shipments of the Pfizer drug. American has both temperature-controlled containers and pre-packaged shipments with cold packs or dry ice.
Delta recently approved use of DoKaSch GmbH’s Opticooler RAP climate-control containers. It also increased allowable levels of dry ice, which is regarded as a “dangerous good,” according to IATA, meaning only about 50% of hold space can normally be filled with vaccine shipments packed this way.
“While distribution needs continue to evolve, a team approach will ensure that there will be enough air cargo capacity to handle demand,” said Vittal Shetty, director of innovation and delivery-airport excellence and cargo for American.
Storage
Despite the hurdles, a well-established global network for pharmaceutical distribution should expedite the flow of doses. Cities ranging from Miami, Dallas and London, to Liege in Belgium, Dubai, Mumbai, Singapore and Incheon in Seoul have well-established deep-freeze capabilities.
 United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). has built facilities in Louisville, Kentucky, and in the Netherlands with a total of 600 deep freezers that can each hold 48,000 vials of vaccine at temperatures as low as minus 80 degrees Celsius.
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). has added freezers and refrigerated trucks to its already extensive cold-chain network, and Richard Smith, who’s heading up the delivery firm’s vaccine effort, has pledged to free as much air and ground capacity as needed.
Delivery firms have experience transporting flu vaccines and medical samples at low temperatures. And both UPS and FedEx mobilized earlier this year to fly tons of needed medical supplies into the U.S. when the shortage was acute. They’ve since been coordinating with vaccine makers and government officials to prepare for the vaccine rollout.
“We’re just waiting until they tell us they have a vaccine ready and we will be ready to go out there and deliver it to every ZIP code in the U.S.,” Smith said. “We’ll be ready to deliver it around the world as well.”
Reaching the Poor
United Nations humanitarian relief agency Unicef has been recruiting airlines into its vast effort to distribute the vaccine to more than 170 countries.
While transporting vials from their point of manufacture to a major hospital or clinic in a big, developed city is one thing, the challenge gets steep in emerging nations, where infrastructure to remote villages and towns may be rickety and unreliable, or even non-existent.
Unicef held a call in November with about 40 carriers to make plans for the global airlift to 92 of the world’s poorest nations, for which it’s leading efforts to purchase and distribute Covid vaccines. With another 80 higher-income countries that have chosen it to procure inoculations they will buy, the agency’s effort will cover 70% of the world’s population.
PT Garuda Indonesia was certified last month to transport vaccines across a country that has Southeast Asia’s biggest outbreak with more than 520,000 confirmed cases. The nation also presents one of the toughest logistical challenges, with a population of some 273 million spread across the world’s largest archipelago.
Singapore, meanwhile, a close neighbor to some of Asia’s poorest nations, should be able to target a disproportionate share of the transit, according to Alex Hungate, chief executive officer of ground-handling giant SATS Ltd. The former Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) unit is IATA CEIV Pharma certified in Singapore, Beijing and Bangalore and is in the process of receiving the designation in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, he said.
The Last Mile
Delivery won’t be just about airlines. Cars, buses, trucks -- even motorcycles, bicycles and donkeys -- may be required to get the vaccine to rural areas. In some places, it may need to be carried in by foot.
“You just don’t have deep-freezers everywhere,” said Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India Ltd., the world’s biggest vaccine maker. It’s tied up with five developers, making 40 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine so far. The company aims to start manufacturing  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc.’s contender soon.
“These frozen vaccines, which are highly unstable, the developers need to work on stabilizing,” Poonawalla said.
The possibility of tampering, production of counterfeit shots and even attempts to disrupt distribution are also a concern, according to IATA. Drug companies have responded by requesting end-to-end security escorts, according to Dominic Kennedy, managing director for cargo at Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.
De Juniac, the IATA chief, insists that the industry is ready. “We will not disappoint,” he said.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",Britain bans new Huawei 5G kit installation from September 2021,"LONDON (Reuters) - British telecommunications firms must not install new Huawei 5G kit after September 2021, the government said on Monday, as part of a plan to purge the Chinese firm's equipment from high-speed mobile networks.
Britain has already ordered all Huawei equipment to be removed from its 5G network by the end of 2027, falling in line with intelligence allies including the United States who say the firm poses security risks. 
Telecoms companies had also been banned from buying new Huawei 5G kit after the end of the year. Some lawmakers had been concerned that the companies would stockpile equipment to be deployed up until the 2027 deadline.
Operators, however, said they would already be rolling out alternative equipment next year, making the 2021 cut-off ""manageable"".
China has criticised the move, while Huawei said last week it was disappointed Britain was looking to exclude it from the 5G roll-out after the publication of new laws that could see firms fined 100,000 pounds ($133,140) if they break the ban.
Monday's announcement comes ahead of a debate over new telecoms legislation in parliament, and fleshes out the timeline for equipment removal.
""I am setting out a clear path for the complete removal of high-risk vendors from our 5G networks,"" digital minister Oliver Dowden said in a statement.
""This will be done through new and unprecedented powers to identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security.""
The government also announced a new strategy to diversify the 5G supply chain, consisting of an initial 250 million pound investment, trials in collaboration with Japanese firm NEC, and the establishment of new research facilities.
British mobile operators BT, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and Three all launched 5G using Huawei in parts of their radio access networks.
They have switched to alternative suppliers such as Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK).
The government also set a deadline of Jan. 28, 2023 for its already-announced 35% cap on Huawei's equipment in fibre-to-the-premises and other gigabit networks.

Britain said its July decision was related to concerns that U.S. sanctions on chip technology could affect supply lines. Huawei said at the time the decision was disappointing, and about U.S. trade policy rather than security.

768,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",Cyber Monday Projected to Hit Pandemic-Fueled $12.7 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- Online shoppers in the U.S. are expected to drop a record-busting $12.7 billion on Cyber Monday -- the busiest e-commerce day of the year -- presenting a valuable opportunity for retailers whose websites, customer service departments and delivery operations can withstand the period of crushing traffic.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.,  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT),  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY). and others have been preparing for the 2020 holiday deluge for months. This week will be the ultimate test for their new investments in ramping up delivery capacity and adding features like parking lot pickup for digital orders.
The Covid-19 surge kept crowd-averse shoppers away from physical malls on Black Friday, reinforcing predictions that online shopping will soar this year. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics predicts that spending Cyber Monday spending for 2020 will climb by 35% -- more than double the growth rate in the years prior to the pandemic. That also means that any service interruptions on Cyber Monday -- slow websites, payment processing problems, shopping carts that vanish before checkout -- could be painful for companies.
“Even large retailers could be crippled with the demand,” said Mario Ciabarra, chief executive officer at Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Metric, which helps online retailers fix website problems.. “Every minute counts and every customer counts.”
There were already signs that some web stores are struggling to handle the load. Sites for prominent retailers had 39% more errors on Black Friday than they did a year ago, according to Quantum Metric.
U.S. Shoppers spent $9 billion online on Black Friday, according to Adobe Inc., missing its forecast of $10.3 billion, indicating shoppers reacted to deals earlier in the holiday season and warnings about potential shipping problems in December.
This year, retailers have been enticing people to shop earlier in the season to avoid capacity problems. But Cyber Monday will likely still be the peak, because many shoppers are conditioned to hold off on big purchases in anticipation of price cuts.
So far, Cyber Monday deals that have been announced aren’t much better than Black Friday deals, said Kristin McGrath, editor at BlackFriday.com, which monitors web deals. Harkening back to traditional door-buster Black Friday tactics, many digital shops are likely to offer eye-popping discounts on popular products that usually sell out quickly to attract people to their site, hoping they linger and load up shopping carts with other things.
Shoppers may find the net result is underwhelming. “Amazon is offering the exact same deals on Echo speakers and some other devices as they did on Black Friday,” McGrath said. “Cyber Monday is not really the day to wait for anymore.”
Another reason that discounts might not be deep on Monday is that customers would be mad if retailers who told them to shop earlier this year saved their best deals for Cyber Monday, said Andrew Lipsman, analyst at EMarketer. The upshot for retailers is the holiday season could be more profitable.
“There’s more room this year for retailers to take back some margin than in previous years,” Lipsman said. “Shoppers have heard about shipping problems and tight supplies, so if they see a good deal they’re going to take it. There’s no reason to be greedy.”

(Reuters) - U.S. insurers are taking a closer look at the recruiting and succession practices of corporate customers, worried about mounting lawsuits over a lack of diversity among top executives and directors, industry sources said.
Insurers are meeting company officials to examine diversity practices before renewing or signing new so-called D&O policies to cover lawsuits against directors and officers, insurers and brokers said.
Before pricing coverage, insurers want details about top-level succession planning and how companies recruit, they said.
""This is an operational risk that's not going to go away,"" said Amber Finch, a lawyer who negotiates insurance coverage for companies.
A California law set to take effect on Jan. 1 compounds the risk, she said. It will require publicly traded companies headquartered there to name board members from underrepresented communities.
Insurers are shifting practices after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, a Black man, on May 25, setting off protests across the country. Since then, at least seven lawsuits have been filed against major U.S. companies alleging deficiencies in diversity practices.
For instance, a September lawsuit against Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) alleges board members breached their duty by not having a Black director. The plaintiff's law firm, Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP, is prominent in shareholder litigation. In a statement, Cisco characterized the case as one of several identical lawsuits filed against U.S. companies that already seem to have ""strong diversity and inclusion initiatives.""
D&O coverage has become more expensive in recent years due to more lawsuits over what plaintiffs describe as widespread race and gender discrimination, sexual harassment or general corporate malfeasance.
A 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision compounded the issue by allowing some securities lawsuits to proceed in both state and federal courts. Insurers often pay for settlements, judgments and defending the cases.
The recent lawsuits are concerning, said Tricia Melley, who heads North America professional claims head for AXA XL, an AXA SA (PA:AXAF) unit. Her group held a meeting with underwriters in mid-September to discuss legal risk, she said.
""It's something that we're going to have to watch,"" Melley said.
AmTrust Financial Services Inc has also been meeting with corporate clients to better understand diversity practices and improvement plans, said Jim Seymour, whose division writes D&O coverage.
Underwriters previously replied on public documents, such as proxy statements, he said. That is no longer enough.
Insurers also want to know which directors are retiring and companies' plans to replace them, said Christine Williams (NYSE:WMB), who heads insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc's financial services group.
Insurers want to see companies using recruiters and HR teams to vet a broad pool of candidates rather than relying solely on inside organizational charts, Williams said.

""The concern is around the lack of diverse leadership and how you're impacting the company when you go down the ranks,"" Williams said.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Global funds make U-turn and favour equities on vaccine hopes: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar and Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds made a U-turn this month and recommended the highest equities exposure since February on recent COVID-19 vaccine progress, with a majority predicting the stock market bull run would last more than six months, Reuters polls found.
Recovering from last month's sell-off, global stocks hit repeated record highs in November, with the MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks on track for its best month ever - up nearly 13%.
Rising COVID-19 cases, historic recessions and expectations for fragile economic recoveries notwithstanding, investors' sentiment was boosted by vaccines making headway, a descending dollar and predictions capital markets would remain flooded with cheap cash. For a graphic on 2020 asset performance: http://tmsnrt.rs/2yaDPgn http://tmsnrt.rs/2yaDPgn)
That buoyancy in stocks and the search for better yields pushed fund managers and chief investment officers in the United States, Europe and Japan in the Nov. 12-30 poll to make a dramatic shift in recommendations - with equity allocations raised at the expense of every other asset.
""We have stayed on the sidelines previously, pointing to the growing disconnect between market moves and economic fundamentals. But it is now clear the global economic recovery will be supported by the vaccine news,"" said a chief investment officer at a large U.S. fund management company.
""It is also clear equity markets will be cheered on further and the October sell-off provided us with the opportune moment.""
Stocks allocations accounted for an average 46.7% in November of their model global portfolio, up over 5 percentage points from 41.4% in October - the highest month-on-month jump since records began over a decade ago.
BULL RUN
Bond holdings accounted for 42.1%, compared with 45.5% last month, the lowest since February. The suggested cash buffer, property investments and alternative assets holdings were also lowered.
That shows a move away from the cautious approach fund managers have maintained this year, with a 3.4 percentage points drop in suggested bond holdings from October's decade-high - the steepest fall since late 2017.
Those recommendations were based on recent progress of COVID-19 vaccines, according to all 19 fund managers who answered an additional question, with nearly 80% of them predicting the stock market rally would run for at least another six months.
""We have increased our overweight in stocks; the progress of various successful vaccines provides light at the end of the tunnel following this period of uncertainty,"" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management.
""The current acceleration of stocks has room to run further, as beaten-up cyclical stocks begin to rally on the expectation of a return to normality next year while policy remains loose. 2021 could be more about rotation than appreciation if bond yields are allowed to rise.""
Expectations for the global stocks bull run to race on lines up with the findings of a Reuters poll of equity strategists published last week. [EPOLL/WRAP] (For a graphic on global stock market outlook: https://tmsnrt.rs/3nT0J5r)
While equity strategists in that survey expected corporate earnings would return to pre-COVID-19 levels within a year, nearly two-thirds of 19 fund managers in the latest poll predicted it would take at least a year.
""Even with a successful vaccine rollout and central banks providing a backstop for markets, a more likely scenario is for the level of earnings to remain below their pre-COVID-19 earnings into 2022,"" said Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""This is especially the case if the new U.S. Democratic administration follows through on its promises to increase tech regulations which puts the S&P 500 mega-caps and their COVID-19 resistant earnings under pressure.""

772,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Abu Dhabi wealth fund in talks with KKR over Italian grid deal - sources,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Elvira Pollina
ROME (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's biggest sovereign fund is in talks with U.S. firm KKR to invest in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT)'s (TIM) last-mile network in a deal that has drawn scrutiny from Italy's government, three sources close to the matter told Reuters.
Rome typically welcomes foreign investments but demands assurances that investors will follow the country's national interests. The government has special vetting powers to block unwanted bids in industries deemed of strategic importance.
TIM agreed in August to sell KKR a 37.5% stake of a newly created company, FiberCop, into which it has transferred its 'last-mile' network connecting street cabinets to people's homes.
KKR now wants to sell up to 30% of the unit that will hold that stake to Infinity Investments, a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), as it looks for co-investors in the Italian deal, the sources said, asking not to be named.
Abu Dhabi would then hold up to 11% of TIM's last-mile grid, provided the government authorised the deal.
""ADIA would be an indirect and passive investor,"" one of the sources said.
The Italian Prime Minister's office, TIM, ADIA and KKR all declined to comment.
Italy's industry ministry has informed the cabinet office of KKR's plans, and a technical body in charge of scrutinising foreign investments in strategic Italian assets plans to hear TIM's views on the matter in early December, the sources added.
Rome this month gave its conditional green light to KKR's acquisition of the last-mile network stake, demanding that the firm commit to a government-sponsored plan to create a unified ultra-fast broadband network. The government wants TIM to merge its landline grid, running from switching centres to households, with rival Open Fiber, which is jointly controlled by utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP).
Infinity Investments and KKR notified the government following the first clearance to the FiberCop deal, the sources said. 
Co-sharing an investment is a normal practice funds use to reduce risks.
Australian fund Macquarie is considering the possibility of syndicating the purchase of a minority stake in Open Fiber from Enel, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.

The move has irked CDP, which does not want potential co-investors to have governance rights, one of the sources said on Monday.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely lower Monday, with investors cashing in at the end of a record-breaking month. Deteriorating relations with China and worries over the Covid-19 pandemic are also weighing.    
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract fell 176 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.4%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 4 points, or 0.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen almost 13% so far this month, on course for its best individual month since January 1987. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both gained over 11% month-to-date, their best months since April.
Positive coronavirus vaccine news, added to earlier Monday by the news  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) has filed for emergency approval for its vaccine in the U.S. and Europe, and emerging political certainty in the U.S. have prompted strong gains on Wall Street in the last month as investors look ahead for a return to something approaching normalcy.
That said, there are plenty of factors to keep investors wary ahead of the end of year, including the relationship between the globe’s two largest economies and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
The Trump administration is poised to add chipmaker SMIC and offshore oil-and-gas explorer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) to a list of firms blocked from American investment due to military ties, Reuters reported, potentially making it harder for President-elect Joe Biden to de-escalate tensions with China.  
At the same time, while New York is set to start opening its public schools for for in-person learning in a week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that the U.S. is heading into a tough period of the pandemic. 
In corporate news, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has agreed to buy IHS Markit (NYSE:INFO) for around $39 billion, creating a heavyweight in the increasingly competitive market for financial information.
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), one of the main beneficiaries of people working from home during the pandemic, is poised to report third-quarter results Monday after the closing bell.
Oil prices slipped lower Monday, with traders cautious ahead of a meeting of the top crude producers to decide the group’s output levels.
OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are expected to maintain the current cap on supply at the formal two-day meeting that starts later Monday, rather than raising it in January by 2 million barrels a day as previously agreed. However, a panel of OPEC+ ministers couldn’t reach agreement in an informal online discussion on Sunday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $44.98 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $47.59. Both benchmarks are still set for a rise of more than 25% in November, boosted by hopes for three promising coronavirus vaccines.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,775/oz, dropping over 5% this month, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1988.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal´s three biggest telecoms companies said they had submitted applications to take part in the country's 5G licence auction amid a legal dispute with the Portuguese telecoms regulator over the rules. 
NOS, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and Altice - which together serve nearly 100% of Portugal's mobile customers - all said they filed their applications for the auction on November 27.
ANACOM has reserved a portion of the spectrum in the 900 MHz and 1,800 Mhz bands for new entrants, as a push to encourage competition and improve services.
Altice, Vodafone and NOS will have to share their infrastructure and offer national roaming to the new entrants' customers.
About 15 days ago, the three established players filed precautionary injunctions in a Lisbon court against the rules, which they claim unfairly favour new entrants. They also sent complaints to the European Commission.
An ANACOM spokeswoman rejected any discrimination and said that the measures ""aim to generate a positive impact on competition and end users, creating conditions so that new and diversified operations can appear in the market."" 
An Altice Portugal spokeswoman said: ""The submission of applications doesn't guarantee, nor require, that the candidates advance in the auction.""
""We reiterate... the 5G auction rules ... represent a huge setback for competitiveness and undermine the sustainability of the sector, reducing and destroying investment and value creation,"" she said.
A NOS spokesman said the company expected the auction rules to be changed.
A Vodafone Portugal spokeswoman said: ""We maintain the hope that some of the lawsuits can still be decided in time."" 
The auction, which the government hopes will raise some 238 million euros ($285.17 million), is expected to last into January. There is no fixed deadline for a judgement on the court cases.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Global investors see China stocks bull run lasting well into 2021,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Global investors are betting Chinese stocks will extend their bull run and that mainland corporate earnings in 2021 will be boosted by a world economic recovery and more predictable Sino-U.S. relationship.
Chinese onshore stocks have already jumped over 20% this year thanks to the economy's early recovery from coronavirus. Another bumper year is ahead, investment banks say.
""China will deliver one of the strongest and fastest macro recoveries in 2021 among major economies globally,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in its China outlook report, forecasting a 20% rebound in Chinese corporate profits, and staying overweight Chinese equities. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also remains overweight China, forecasting ""solid"" earnings growth amid the backdrop of a strong, broad-based global recovery, and a potentially more predictable trade environment once Joe Biden replaces Donald Trump in the White House. 
China's benchmark CSI300 Index is expected to rise to 5,570 points at the end of 2021 in a base case scenario, Morgan Stanley predicts, roughly 12% up from the end-November level of 4960.25. Goldman forecast a 13% gain in the index, while UBS expects an increase of about 10%. 
Chinese regulators have been aggressively wooing foreign investors with accelerated moves to open up China's capital markets. 
Global fund giants including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Vanguard have already boosted their exposure to Chinese equities this year, according to Citic Securities, and foreign inflows will likely accelerate further. 
""International appetite for access to Chinese financial markets is at an all-time high,"" said Justin Chan, Head of Greater China, Global Markets, HSBC.
""A steady stream of developments, from index inclusion to Stock and Bond Connect schemes, is opening this market like never before, and yield hungry investors from across the world are piling in.""
In a survey published last week by HSBC of nearly 1,000 top global institutional investors and large corporations, 62% of them said they plan to increase their China portfolio by an average of 25% over the next 12 months. Among the equity investors, 71% are looking to increase China exposure.
Despite a surge of inflows - foreign holdings in Chinese onshore equities more than doubled over the past two years to exceed $400 billion - China remains under-represented in most global investment portfolios, according to Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW). 
The global advisory suggests investors should now consider Chinese equities as a stand-alone allocation, rather than part of global or emerging market strategies, so that they can enjoy the full benefits of diversification and excess returns the market offers.
China's stock market will not only benefit from foreign inflows, but also from domestic asset rotations out of shadow banking products and properties, according to UBS.
""One major theme for 2021-22 in our view is the likely rise of Chinese household assets in onshore equities,"" said Wendy Liu, head of China Strategy, UBS Global. 
Sector-wise, Morgan Stanley identified several industries that will benefit from China's focus on innovation, technology localization and consumption uprades. They include high-end manufacturing, healthcare, biotech, defense and aerospace. 
But Andrew Gillan, head of Asia ex-Japan Equities at Janus Henderson Investors in Singapore, fears the upward momentum in China stocks could be losing steam. 
""We like some of the A-shares, but generally it's quite expensive.""

777,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",S&P Global to buy IHS Markit in deal valued at $44 billion,"(Reuters) - Data giant S&P Global Inc has agreed to buy IHS Markit Ltd in a deal worth $44 billion that will be 2020's biggest merger, creating a heavyweight in the increasingly competitive market in financial information.
The mega deal, which includes $4.8 billion of debt, is a sign that deal-making activity is accelerating as breakthroughs in developing COVID-19 vaccines improve the economic outlook.
Deals touched a record high in the September quarter, with more than $1 trillion worth of transactions, mostly focused on coronavirus-resilient sectors such as technology and healthcare, according to Refinitiv data.
Under the terms of the deal, each share of IHS Markit will be exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.2838 shares of S&P Global stock, the two companies said in a statement. 
Once the deal is completed, S&P Global shareholders will own roughly 67.75% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, while IHS shareholders will own about 32.25%.
S&P Global is renowned for providing debt ratings to countries and companies, as well as data on capital and commodity markets worldwide. It became a standalone business in 2011 when its then parent McGraw-Hill (NYSE:SPGI) separated S&P from its education business.
IHS Markit was formed in 2016 when IHS, whose businesses range from data on automotive and technology industries to publishing Jane's Defence Weekly, bought Markit Ltd for around $6 billion. 
Markit, founded by former credit trader Lance Uggla, provides a range of pricing and reference data for financial assets and derivatives.
IHS has a market value of around $36.88 billion based on the stock's last close on Friday, a Reuters calculation showed, with its share price up around 22% so far this year.
The transaction is likely to face close scrutiny from competition watchdogs as the market for financial information becomes increasingly concentrated.
The Wall Street Journal reported news of the deal earlier on Monday. (https://on.wsj.com/2VtPXql)
The London Stock Exchange is in the final stage of trying to win clearance for its planned $27 billion acquisition of data provider Refinitiv, which has been through a long review process by the European Union's competition commissioner.
Refinitiv was carved out of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) by private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) in 2018, when it bought a 55% stake in the business in its biggest bet since the 2008 financial crisis. Thomson Reuters, parent of Reuters News, retains a 45% holding in the business.

BAE said the contract would sustain around 4,000 jobs across the UK, and enable it to invest 70 million in upgrading manufacturing lines, with most of the investment due to take place by 2026.
""Defence underpins hundreds of thousands of jobs across all four corners of the nation, and ongoing investment is crucial as we work together to build back better and stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Jeremy Quinn, a junior defence minister, said in a statement. 
Earlier in November, Britain announced its biggest military spending increase since the Cold War, pledging to end the ""era of retreat"" as it seeks a role in the world after Brexit.
At the same time, the government is grappling with the fallout from the pandemic, which has hit its economy harder than most other rich countries, and amid forecasts that unemployment is likely to peak at 7.5%.
Under BAE's new 15-year contract for the supply of munitions to the UK armed forces, BAE will spend 350 million pounds with UK-based companies on raw materials and machine components. The new agreement succeeds the current one which ends in 2022.
BAE directly employs 1,260 people in munitions manufacturing and testing at five UK sites including Glascoed in Wales and Bishopton in Scotland.

""The options will be put on the table,"" one of the sources said, adding that the outcome of the deliberations remains unclear.
Volkswagen declined to comment.
Reuters reported on Friday that Diess had asked the families who control a majority voting stake in Volkswagen to back extending his contract as a vote of confidence in his leadership.
Diess' has encountered opposition from the board to his efforts to reform the multi-brand car and truck maker and he may review his position if his attempts continue to be stifled, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Diess was appointed head of the VW brand in 2015 and group chief executive in April 2018. His contract is due to expire in 2023 and German companies tend to deliberate over contract extensions only a year before they expire.

The company's executive committee is chaired by Hans Dieter Poetsch, and includes Wolfgang Porsche and Hans Michel Piech, as well as VW's labour chief Bernd Osterloh and Lower Saxony premier Stephan Weil.

780,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 06:02AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Frasers, JD Sports, Boohoo Set to Cash in on U.K. Retail Crisis","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The crisis in the U.K. retail sector is coming to a head thanks to Covid-19, and while the identify of the losers has been clear for a while, it's still far from clear who will be the big winners.
No amount of government help, furlough schemes, rent adjustments and other financial wizardry could put off the inevitable for Arcadia, the empire of British retail entrepreneur Philip Green.
The group, which owns the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and Burton chains that epitomize an increasingly dreary and downmarket British high street, is on the verge of collapse. A slew of reports at the weekend indicated that Arcadia will appoint administrators this week, a prelude to what will almost certainly spell thousands of job losses and hundreds of store closures.
The development comes at a time when another slow-moving retail dinosaur, Debenhams, is also facing extinction, unless it accepts the advances of JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion (LON:JD)
The social and political cost could be huge: Arcadia and Debenhams employ around 25,000 people across the U.K. and few can have much hope for their jobs. Arcadia also has 110,000 people enrolled in a corporate pension plan that has, reportedly, a deficit of around 350 million pounds ($470 million). The company is privately-owned and hasn’t disclosed the actual figures.
For stock market investors, the question boils down to two issues: who will grow fat on the carcasses of the two businesses, and whether what is left to decompose on the high street will infect those that are still left.
As regards the first, there are already signs of predators – or rather scavengers – claiming first dibs. Frasers (LON:FRAS), which includes the House of Fraser department store and  Sports Direct  , confirmed on Monday that it had offered Arcadia a 50 million-pound ($65 million) lifeline, but gave no details of the conditions it had attached.
Given the past bad blood between Green and Frasers owner Mike Ashley, it’s quite possible that even a more generous offer would be rejected out of pride (or spite) alone. However, Ashley has a double incentive at work. Not only can he hope to repeat previous successes in turning round distressed assets, but he also has to defend the value of his existing stable of brands. House of Fraser, in particular, needs social cachet to defend its margins. Every boarded-up shop window in the neighborhood robs it of that.
The market has already decided that the collapse of Debenhams and Arcadia is bad news for Frasers: its shares lost over 6% over the last week as this crisis crystallized. At the same time, the collapse of Arcadia has strengthened the hand of JD Sports in its negotiations with Debenhams. Its shares rose 6% on Monday on expectations that it will be able to drive a harder bargain.
Shares in Primark owner ABF (LON:ABF) also rose another 0.9% to be up 6.4% on the week on the prospect of some excess capacity closing. But two other, bigger, gainers were online-only rivals ASOS  (LON:ASOS) and boohoo (LON:BOOH), which rose 3.9% and 4.1% respectively.  For the latter, which raised capital from investors in the summer to prepare for just such bargain-hunting, the intriguing question is whether Arcadia's prime locations in central London will finally tempt it into having a brick-and-mortar presence. If the price is close enough to zero, the answer could well be yes.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",Shares in UniCredit down 4.5% hit by concerns over CEO's future,"MILAN (Reuters) - Shares in Italy's UniCredit fell 4.5% on Monday hit by concerns about the future of Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier, whose mandate ends in the spring.
Directors at Italy's no.2 bank held informal discussions on Sunday ahead of kicking off this week the process to select nominees for the renewal of the board in April 2021.
People familiar with matter have said friction over strategy within the bank has called into question whether Mustier will remain at the helm.
The 59-year-old former investment banker arrived in mid-2016 to fix UniCredit's capital woes. He presided over a turnaround, cleaning up the balance sheet and raising tens of billions of euros from share and asset sales. 
He has failed however to lift the price of the shares, which trade at a 40% discount to UniCredit's book value. A plan to return cash to shareholders has been derailed by the pandemic which triggered a supervisory ban on dividends.
Following fruitless attempts to strike a cross-border merger, Mustier has vowed to stay out of consolidation, even as matchmaking in Italy's fragmented banking sector intensifies.
Government efforts to find a buyer for bailed-out Monte dei Paschi have become the latest flashpoint, sources have said, because UniCredit had been identified as the ideal partner due to its robust balance sheet.
Shares in Monte dei Paschi rose 6% on Monday lifted by expectations that a potential Mustier departure would clear the path to an acquisition.
Mustier's ""no M&A"" stance is out of step with growing merger activity in southern Europe following Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY)'s surprise takeover of UBI this summer.
Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) last week announced a buyout offer for third-tier Italian lender Creval.
Meanwhile Banco BPM, which at the start of summer held contacts with UniCredit over a potential tie-up, has welcomed merger overtures by the top investor in BPER Banca.

""The fund management company has decided to liquidate the Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund Global, partly because of the trading discount that has arisen on the stock market,"" it said.
The properties held by the real estate fund are to be transferred to the Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund International , in the first half of 2021, and the liquidation proceeds will be paid out to the investors, according to the bank.
Trading in the fund units on the SIX Swiss Exchange has been suspended with immediate effect, and the units are being delisted, the statement added.
""The fund's performance is no longer consistent with the fundamentally high location and asset quality of the underlying real estate portfolio"", which consisted of 12 top-end commercial properties in America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, it said.
The Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund International, which is traded over the counter and aimed at institutional investors, will acquire the properties, whose transfer value will be set by valuation experts and confirmed independently, the bank said. The fund has seen a 13% drop in performance in the past year, according to Swiss Fund Data.
Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund Global's biggest assets were office buildings in Japan, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands, according to the fund's web page.
Office and retail property values have fallen this year, according to real estate broker CBRE.
Many unlisted property funds in Britain were suspended in March because surveyors could not be certain of property valuations as a result of the pandemic, though several have started to reopen since September as valuations became clearer.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Equity investors take stock of best month ever,"By Marc Jones and Wayne Cole
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares paused on Monday to assess a record-breaking month as the prospect of a vaccine-driven economic recovery next year and yet more free money from central banks eclipsed immediate concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.
Helping sentiment was a survey showing that factory activity in China handily beat forecasts in November, and the country's central bank surprised with a helping of cheap loans. 
Chinese blue chips ended lower but up nearly 6% for the month and, though Europe's traders were reluctant to add to their bumper November, it was not going to detract from a record-busting 15% month. 
The rush to risk has also benefited oil and industrial commodities while undermining safe-haven dollar and gold.
""It has been a very, very strong month for markets, especially on the equity side but also on the fixed income side too,"" said Rabobank's Head of Macro Strategy Elwin de Groot. 
The positive developments on vaccines and swiftness with which they are likely to be rolled out had been key drivers. 
""And this market still remains very much supported by liquidity from the central banks,"" De Groot added. With the ECB set to provide more stimulus next month ""the market view seems to be, what can possibly go wrong?"" 
Many European bourses are boasting their best month ever with France up 21% and Italy almost 26%. The MSCI measure of world stocks is up nearly 13% for November, while the S&P 500 has climbed 11% to all-time peaks.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended 1.5% lower on the day but was still up almost 10% for the month. 
Japan's Nikkei 225 eased 0.8%, but was still 15% higher on the month for the largest rise since 1994. E-Mini futures for Wall Street's high-flying S&P 500 dipped 0.4%
""Markets are overbought and at risk of a short term pause,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital.
""However, we are now in a seasonally strong time of year and investors are yet to fully discount the potential for a very strong recovery next year in growth and profits as stimulus combines with vaccines.""
Cyclical recovery shares including resources, industrials and financials were likely to be relative outperformers, he added.
The surge in stocks has put competitive pressure on safe-haven bonds but much of that has been cushioned by expectations of more asset buying by central banks. 
Sweden's Riksbank surprised last week by expanding its bond purchase program and the European Central Bank is likely to follow in December. 
German 10-year Bund yield was down 1.1 basis points at -0.598%, its lowest since Nov. 9. The rest of the core market also fell by around 1 bp.

DOLLAR IN DECLINE
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies to Congress on Tuesday amid speculation of further policy action at its next meeting in mid-December.
As a result, U.S. 10-year yields are ending the month almost exactly where they started at 0.84%, a solid performance given the exuberance in equities. 
The U.S. dollar has not been as lucky.
""The idea that a potential Treasury Secretary (Janet) Yellen and Fed chair Powell could work more closely to shape and coordinate super easy monetary policy and massive fiscal stimulus that could drive a rapid post pandemic recovery saw the dollar under pressure,"" said Robert Rennie, head of financial market strategy at Westpac.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was pinned at 91.771 having shed 2.4% for the month to lows last seen in mid-2018.
The euro has caught a tailwind from the relative outperformance of European stocks and climbed 2.7% for the month to reach $1.1967. A break of the September peak at $1.2011 would open the way to a 2018 top at $1.2555.
The dollar has even declined against the Japanese yen, a safe-haven of its own, losing 0.7% in November to reach 103.89 yen, though it remains well above key support at 103.16.
Sterling stood at $1.3334, having climbed steadily this month to its highest since September, as investors wagered a Brexit deal would be brokered even as the deadline for talks loomed ever larger.
One major casualty of the rush to risk has been gold, which was near a five-month trough at $1,771 an ounce having shed 5.6% in November.
Oil, in contrast, has benefited nearly 30% from the prospect of a demand revival should the vaccines allow travel and transport to resume next year. 
Some profit-taking set in early on Monday ahead of an OPEC+ meeting to decide whether the producers' group will extend large output cuts. Brent crude futures fell 52 cents to $47.66, while U.S. crude eased 60 cents to $44.93 a barrel.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",Tokyo Stock Exchange CEO resigns over system failure,"By Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - The head of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) stepped down over a system failure last month, the bourse's operator said on Monday, after the disruption halted trade for an unprecedented full day and drew a rebuke from the regulator.
Akira Kiyota, the head of Japan Exchange Group Inc, which owns the exchange, will take over as head of the TSE, replacing Koichiro Miyahara who stepped down on Monday as president and chief executive.
Miyahara appears to be the first CEO to resign following a run of outages at major exchanges in Australia, Europe and New Zealand this year. Japan's financial regulator ordered the TSE and Japan Exchange Group to improve practices at the bourse. 
The Oct. 1 outage came as Japan has been pushing to boost Tokyo's standing as a global financial centre. The glitch was also an embarrassment for Fujitsu Ltd, which developed the bourse's ""Arrowhead"" trading system.
""It is regrettable that this happened at Japan's main exchange at a time when Japan is aiming to improve its standing as a global financial centre,"" Kiyota told a news conference after apologising and saying he felt responsible.
He said the company was not thinking of seeking damages from Fujitsu, but said the system developer should also feel ""significant responsibility"". 
Kiyota will take a 50% pay cut for four months, while two other executives will take cuts of 20% and 10%, Japan Exchange Group said. The company said it issued ""stern warnings"" to two other executives.
Fujitsu said it was discussing taking internal disciplinary action, but that nothing had been decided.
""The all-day trading halt at the Tokyo bourse significantly undermines investors' trust,"" the Financial Services Agency said in a statement, saying the exchange needed to clarify where responsibility lay.
The full-day trading halt was the worst outage for the world's No. 3 equity market since it switched to all-electronic trading in 1999. The exchange has said the glitch was the result of a hardware problem at the ""Arrowhead"" trading system and a subsequent failure to switch to a back-up.
Through an onsite inspection, the regulator determined that the TSE lacked adequate back-up settings and sufficient rules for trading resumption, Japan Exchange Group said.
The regulator also ordered the TSE to improve and test its back-up measures, the company said.

The TSE has said a committee was due to draw up fresh guidelines by March on how to restart trading following a system failure.

(Reuters) - Europe's benchmark stock index was flat on Monday with focus on Brexit negotiations, but was still on track for its best month on record on the prospect of easing coronavirus restrictions and hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine.
After face-to-face talks restarted on Saturday, investors await news of a call between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, seen as the first sign of movement either towards a trade deal or of talks crumbling five weeks ahead of the deadline.
London's blue-chip stocks outperformed regional peers to trade up 0.2% as healthcare and industrial shares gained.
While upbeat factory activity data from China kept alive hopes of a global economic recovery, it did little to buoy the pan-European STOXX 600 index after its near 15% surge so far in November. 
Gains have been driven by promising trial results for major coronavirus vaccine candidates, and hopes of a more stable U.S. trade policy after Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential elections.
France's CAC 40 has jumped almost 22% this month, while Spain's IBEX and Italy's MIB gained around 25% each. German shares and UK blue-chips have gained more than 14%.
""The markets have moved so aggressively this month, and there isn't anything really there to cause any further significant rally,"" said Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spreadex.
Oil and gas stocks were the biggest decliners in Europe, down 1.7%, with Total SE, BP (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) sliding as crude prices fell ahead of a meeting of producer group OPEC+ to decide whether to extend large output cuts.
At the bottom of the STOXX 600 was Dutch bank ABN Amro, down 4.7% after saying it would cut almost 3,000 jobs by 2024.
The economic outlook brightened as slowing COVID-19 infection rates in many European countries encouraged governments to lift some curbs — Britain is due to return to a regional approach to restrictions from Dec. 2, while Ireland will allow shops, restaurants, gyms and pubs serving food to reopen next week.

However, the number of coronavirus cases in Germany remained high, with economic institute Ifo saying a partial lockdown saw the share of companies using short-time work schemes rising in November from the previous month.

The CGT, CFE-CGC, FCE-CFDT and Forces Ouvrieres (FO) unions already held a first day of strikes last week, hitting EDF's nuclear energy output. In a joint statement on Monday they were envisaging more industrial action on Dec. 10 if they received no proposal to meet Castex.

The French government is working on a plan, called project ""Hercules"", to ringfence EDF's nuclear arm from the rest of the power giant and is in talks with Brussels on the matter. That has raised concerns over jobs among employees, fearful that a strict split between EDF businesses could mean cuts.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed Monday, with investors focusing on virus concerns and ongoing Brexit trade negotiations at the end of a positive month.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded largely flat, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.4%, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index rose 0.3%.
Largely positive news surrounding potential vaccines to treat Covid-19 has resulted in strong recent gains in global stock markets. In Europe, the DAX has gained 15% this month, the FTSE 100 is up 14% and the CAC 40 over 20%.
However, a number of European countries are now facing public disquiet over the restrictions their governments have put in place to try and curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus ahead of the important Christmas period. 
The number of infections is still much too high in most German regions and people must do more to reduce their contacts to slow the spread of the disease, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Monday.
Without the buy-in of the public, containing the spread will be very difficult.
Also of interest is the state of the discussions between Britain and the European Union over a Brexit trade deal. Talks between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and British chief negotiator David Frost continued through Sunday, and this has generated optimism that a deal is close.
""We really are now running out of time, this is the crucial week, we need to get a breakthrough,"" U.K. Environment Secretary George Eustice said Monday. 
In corporate news, HSBC (LON:HSBA) stock fell 1.4% after the Financial Times reported the banking giant is considering a complete exit from retail banking in the United States. HSBC's U.S. arm has struggled for some time.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is due to speak later Monday, while preliminary inflation data, primarily from Germany, are also due.
Oil prices slipped lower Monday, with traders cautious ahead of a meeting of most of the top crude producers to decide output levels in order to balance the market.
OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are expected to maintain the current cap on supply at the formal two-day meeting that starts later Monday, rather than raising it in January by 2 million barrels a day as previously agreed. However, a panel of OPEC+ ministers couldn’t reach agreement in an informal online discussion on Sunday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $44.87 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.7% to $47.42. Both benchmarks are still set for a rise of more than 25% in November, boosted by hopes for three promising coronavirus vaccines.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,779.25/oz, dropping over 5% this month, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1980.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Monday, with investors pausing for breath at the end of a strong month. Virus concerns, ongoing Brexit trade negotiations and potentially deteriorating U.S.-China relations contribute to this selloff.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.8% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.9% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.3%. 
Largely positive news surrounding potential vaccines to treat Covid-19 has resulted in strong recent gains in global stock markets. In Europe, the DAX has gained 15% this month, the FTSE 100 is up 14% and the CAC 40 over 20%.
However, a number of European countries are now facing public disquiet over the restrictions their governments have put in place to try and curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus ahead of the important Christmas period. Without the buy-in of the public, containing the spread will be very difficult.
Britain and the European Union are heading into a ""very significant"" week, British foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday, with serious differences over a trade deal yet to be resolved.
Additionally, Reuters reported that the outgoing Trump administration is set to add China's top chipmaker, SMIC, and its largest offshore oil and gas producer, CNOOC (NYSE:CEO), to a U.S. blacklist, risking a further deterioration in relations between the globe’s two largest economies.
In corporate news, HSBC (LON:HSBA) is considering a complete exit from retail banking in the United States, the Financial Times reported Sunday. HSBC's U.S. arm has struggled for some time.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is due to speak later Monday, while preliminary inflation data, primarily from Germany, are also due.
Oil prices slipped lower Monday, with traders cautious ahead of a meeting of most of the top crude producers to decide output levels in order to balance the market.
OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are expected to maintain the current cap on supply at the formal two-day meeting that starts later Monday, rather than raising it in January by 2 million barrels a day as previously agreed. However, a panel of OPEC+ ministers couldn’t reach agreement in an informal online discussion on Sunday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $44.82 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.8% to $47.37. Both benchmarks are still set for a rise of more than 25% in November, boosted by hopes for three promising coronavirus vaccines.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,778.45/oz, dropping over 5% this month, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1965.

794,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 01:05AM ET</span>",Chinese banks' profit growth seen recovering to 2-3% in 2021: report,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking sector is likely to show annual profit growth of 2-3% in 2021 after an expected 7% fall this year due to hit of the global pandemic, Bank of China, the country's fourth largest lender, said in a report on Monday.
The recovery is likely as banks will have to make fewer sacrifices ""to support the real economy"" next year, with the loan-loss provision boost ""back to normal levels"", the report said, adding that banks had put enough aside to digest this year's bad loans in 2020.
China's largest lenders this year suffered their worst first half profit drop since they listed on the stock market more than a decade ago, and they boosted loan-loss provisions throughout the first third quarters of the year as Beijing urged them to step up and lend to flagging sectors.
The report said banks' credit risks are expected to keep accumulating in 2021, as more soured debts become exposed as support measures introduced because of the pandemic begin to expire.
The sector-wide bad loan ratio is likely to reach 2-2.2% by the end of 2021, and will be higher for banks in small cities and rural areas where economic growth is expected to slow, according to the report. 
The non-performing loan ratio of Chinese commercial banks was 1.96% at the end of September, public data showed.
""The non-credit investment at some banks will also face relatively big risks in 2021,"" according to the report, ""As such investments have mainly flowed into property projects and local government financing vehicles, and such risks are contagious.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning, taking a breather from a record-breaking month as November draws to a close.
“Markets are overbought and at risk of a short-term pause. However, we are now in a seasonally strong time of year and investors are yet to fully discount the potential for a very strong recovery next year in growth and profits as stimulus combines with vaccines,” AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital head of investment strategy Shane Oliver told Reuters.
Positive Chinese manufacturing data and hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine-driven economic recovery, as well as the possibility of more stimulus from central banks, helped calm some COVID-19 worries in the near-term.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.13% by 11:04 PM ET (3:04 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.41%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) grew 52.1% in November, higher than the 51.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 51.4% reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was also better than expected, growing 56.4% in November against the forecast 56% and October’s 56.2% figure.
U.S.-China tensions are again on the rise, as President Donald Trump’s administration will reportedly add Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp and China National Offshore Oil Corp to a list of blacklisted Chinese military companies.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.18%. Schools across the city got an early Christmas break after the government ordered them closed. Hong Kong saw 115 daily COVID-19 cases recorded on Sunday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.01%, with industrial production growing 3.8% month-on-month in October according to data released earlier in the day. The figure was slightly lower than the 3.9% growth seen in September, however.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.29% and in Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.71%. The Reserve Bank of Australia will convene for its policy meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, global shares were up 13% as November draws to a close. Recent positive news on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine boosted hopes of a global economic recovery and boosted investor sentiment, despite the production and delivery challenges that remain. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also expects a large part of the population in major developed economies to be inoculated by mid-2021 and drive a “sharp pickup” in global growth.
“As long as the trajectory in economic data is one for improvement, then there is room for the cyclical areas to outperform … those cyclical, value areas are likely to be beneficiaries of the environment we are going into post vaccine and more normalization,” AMP Capital Investors Ltd. multi-asset fund manager Nader Naeimi told Bloomberg.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",Field narrows for global miner Rio Tinto's top job,"By Melanie Burton and Helen Reid
MELBOURNE/JOHANNESBERG (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) will look to a handful of external candidates in a narrowing field for its new chief executive, as the miner tries to win back investors dismayed by the blasting of an ancient Australian rock shelter, bankers and investors say.
The top priority for a new CEO will be strong stakeholder management skills, as the world's biggest iron ore miner begins to repair its relationships with Aboriginal groups and navigates a host of government issues elsewhere, they said.
Some major mining executives have ruled themselves out, and there is not a long list of acceptable candidates with the skill set and appetite for the top job, according to interviews with a dozen investors and analysts.
Front runners are seen as former BP (NYSE:BP) Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) finance director Stephen Pearce, OZ Minerals CEO Andrew Cole, and former Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) CEO Nev Power. 
""More than anything - it doesn't matter whether they're within or outside the sector - I think they need someone who's a very good manager,"" said George Cheveley, portfolio manager at Ninety One in London.
Stakes are high. The board is under pressure to make a strong pick before current CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques steps down in March, following public ire over the company's initial response to the Australian cave destruction.
As well as navigating Australia's trade tensions with China, potential aluminium plant closures and job losses, a new CEO will have to manage cost overruns in Mongolia, a new iron ore mine in Guinea and legacy issues in Bougainville. 
Some leading mining chief executives such as Newmont Corp's Tom Palmer and Anglo American's Mark Cutifani have publicly ruled themselves out, while Newcrest Mining (OTC:NCMGF)'s Sandeep Biswas has said he is very happy where he is. 
Given community relations issues across the sector, some favour a new CEO from outside mining.
""It appears to me that the mining sector is challenged in finding appropriate and effective executive leadership,"" said Doug McMurdo, chairman of Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) which represents 82 local authority pension funds that have 300 billion pounds under management.
Australian investors, meanwhile, insist that a new CEO must have a depth of local experience and would better be based in the country that provides 85% of the company's profits, if not the actual state itself, Western Australia. 
Some hurdles are of the board's own making, after chairman Simon Thomson's handling of the cave blasts has cast a shadow over his tenure.
That may make a potential CEO think twice before accepting a role where the person with whom he works most closely may abruptly change, said one corporate advisor, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the topic.
Some investors believe a candidate out of left field is also a possibility, and point to precedents.

Iron ore miner Fortescue's Elizabeth Gaines came from the travel industry, although she had spent time on the board, while the former CEO of Denmark's oil and gas giant Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) came from Lego and the financial industry.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>","France's Niel, Pigasse target consumer goods with new acquisition vehicle","PARIS (Reuters) - French telecoms magnate Xavier Niel is teaming up with former Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) banker Matthieu Pigasse and another entrepreneur to raise funds through a new listed vehicle to target acquisitions in the European consumer goods sector. 
The businessmen said in a statement on Sunday that their special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), named 2MX Organic, would initially looked to raise 250 million euros ($299 million) from investors, but this could rise to 300 million euros.
SPACs, which are more common in the United States, are shell companies that use proceeds from going public to buy another firm that has not yet been identified at the time of the listing.
Niel, best known for founding mobile operator Iliad in France, has already used the format alongside Pigasse to create French media group Mediawan, born out of the country's first ever SPAC. 
This time the pair will work alongside Moez-Alexandre Zouari, who controls frozen foods company Picard Surgeles. 
The businessmen said they would focus on environmentally-friendly consumer companies, such as those that source goods like food locally, a sector that is increasingly attracting shoppers across Europe. 
A source close to the matter said the SPAC could target a first purchase as soon as 2021 and worth between 1.5 billion to 2 billion euros. 
After listing on the Paris stock exchange, the SPAC can carry out further rounds of fundraising. The subscription period for the first offering will run between Nov. 30 and Dec. 7, and the SPAC founders said they would also invest in the vehicle, though will own no more than 29.6%. 
The goal of a SPAC is to allow the target to obtain a stock market listing without going through an initial public offering.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) are advising on the deal.

798,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",OPEC+ Fails to Agree on Output-Hike Delay Before Big Meeting,"(Bloomberg) -- A panel of OPEC+ ministers couldn’t reach an agreement on whether to delay January’s oil-output increase, leaving the matter unresolved before a full meeting of the cartel and its allies on Monday.
Most participants in an informal online discussion on Sunday evening supported maintaining the production curbs at current levels into the first quarter, said a delegate. Yet while Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak spoke in favor of postponing the supply hike that’s currently scheduled to happen in the new year, the United Arab Emirates and Kazakhstan were opposed, said the delegate, asking not to be named because the talks were private.
Unless the agreement is revised this week, they will restart about 1.9 million barrels a day of halted output, potentially pushing the global market back into surplus and undermining the recent surge in crude prices.
“Saudi Arabia will have to lean hard to get an agreement,” said Mohammad Darwazah, an analyst at research firm Medley Global Advisors LLC. “There have been particularly acute rumblings of dissatisfaction with the status quo from Abu Dhabi.”
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a 23-nation network that pumps more than half the world’s crude, made vast production cuts during the depths of the pandemic to offset a historic collapse in fuel demand. The alliance had planned to ease some of those curbs at the start of 2021, in anticipation of a global economic recovery.
Last-Minute Talks
Saudi Arabia and Russia summoned a small group of OPEC+ countries for last-minute talks this weekend, in an apparent effort to forge a consensus before making a final decision at a conference scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. Despite the lack of an agreement so far, negotiations in the coming days could still result in a deal, said another delegate.
There have been numerous signals that the cartel was leaning toward a delay. Last week, Algerian Energy Minister Abdelmajid Attar -- who this year holds OPEC’s rotating presidency -- told Bloomberg News that the group must remain cautious because the surge in oil prices to above $45 a barrel in New York this week could prove fragile. OPEC technical experts also considered data that pointed to the risk of a new oil surplus if the production increase goes ahead.
Prior to this weekend, a clear majority of OPEC+ watchers were expecting the group to keep pumping at current levels for a few months longer due to lingering uncertainty about the strength of demand. However, the decision has been clouded by public complaints from Iraq and Nigeria, and private discord with the UAE, all of which have chafed at their output limits this year.
“As usual, it will all be down to the meetings behind closed doors on Monday and Tuesday,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA. “We expect that Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz Bin Salman will be at the forefront of preserving group cohesion, to ultimately deliver the much expected delay to the tapering of supply cuts due next year.”

799,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2020 02:01PM ET</span>",UniCredit board holds governance talks as future of CEO in question,"By Valentina Za, Giuseppe Fonte and Gianluca Semeraro
MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit's board was holding informal discussions over the Italian bank's governance on Sunday, a person familiar with the matter said, amid doubts over whether its chief executive will stay.
Jean Pierre Mustier's mandate comes up for renewal in the spring, and three people familiar with the matter said there was a growing rift with the board over strategy which called into question his future at the bank.
UniCredit declined to comment.
The tensions are focused on a potential bid for bailed-out Monte dei Paschi di Siena and a plan to split UniCredit's domestic and foreign assets, the people said.
Il Sole 24 Ore reported that UniCredit's board was set to discuss conditions set by Mustier to stay on at Italy's only ""global systemically important"" bank for another three years.
But the first source said directors would only have an informal discussion before beginning the process of renewing the board next week. 
UniCredit has already said it will put forward for the role of chairman Pier Carlo Padoan, who was Italy's economy minister at the time of Monte dei Paschi's rescue.
Seen at risk of leaving UniCredit after presiding over its turnaround, Mustier this year turned down the top job at HSBC.
After politics sank his efforts to seek a cross-border tie-up, Mustier has ruled out mergers and acquisitions even as consolidation sweeps Italy's fragmented banking sector.
Although Intesa's surprise takeover of rival UBI this year to create Italy's no.1 bank has piled pressure on Mustier, sources say he is resisting government requests to take on ailing Monte dei Paschi, which the Treasury is working to re-privatise to meet commitments taken with Brussels.
Mustier has set strict conditions on any potential deal, the sources have said, and the Treasury is working on incentives including tax benefits that would provide a significant capital boost to any Monte dei Paschi buyer.
Mustier has worked to cut UniCredit's exposure to debt-laden Italy, but his plan to spin off its foreign assets has met resistance and was put on hold this month. 
The project to separate activities in Germany and Austria from UniCredit's riskier domestic business has become less urgent due to European Central Bank bond buying, which dampens risk premiums across different countries, Mustier has said.
Since his arrival in mid-2016, he has rid UniCredit of most of its problem debts, while raising cash from investors and selling assets for more than 25 billion euros ($30 billion).
After rebuilding UniCredit's capital, Mustier focused on returning cash to investors to lift the share price, a strategy frustrated by a regulatory ban on dividends imposed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
UniCredit will update its business plan in the second quarter, and is working with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on strategy.

A 40-year-old man said in a complaint seen by Reuters that he had suffered serious ""neurological and psychological"" symptoms after receiving the vaccine in a trial being run by the British drugmaker's partner Serum Institute of India (SII).
""There was no immediate cause of concern at this stage,"" Samiran Panda, head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the ICMR, the research body involved in trials, told Reuters. 
""It doesn't mean that long term assessment will not happen, it is still happening. I am aware of the activity,"" Panda said.

Law firm N.G.R. Prasad & R. Rajaram Advocates sent the complaint by the unnamed volunteer, who is seeking 50 million rupees ($676,288) in compensation and a suspension of testing, manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine, to ICMR, SII, AstraZeneca and the Drugs Controller General of India. 
""While the Serum Institute of India is sympathetic with the volunteer's medical condition, there's absolutely no correlation with the vaccine trial,"" SII said.
""(The) volunteer was specifically informed by the medical team that the complications he suffered were independent of the vaccine trial he underwent,"" it added.

802,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Analysis: Investors weigh prospects for U.S. corporate earnings as stocks set records,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. stocks scale fresh record highs, investors are trying to gauge whether next year's projected profit rebound will be strong enough to add fuel to the rally.
Analysts are projecting that earnings for S&P 500 companies will rise 23% next year after falling more than 15% this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Yet stock prices have already staged a massive recovery from the March lows of the pandemic, with the S&P 500 index rising more than 60% from its bottom to its recent record highs amid progress toward a COVID-19 vaccine and hopes for a speedy economic recovery.
The S&P 500 is trading at 23 times expected earnings for the next four quarters, only slightly lower than its June peak of 25 times expected earnings - its highest in roughly two decades. Those multiples are well above the long-term average of about 15, based on Refinitiv's data. The sharp run-up in U.S. shares since March against a backdrop of still-weak earnings has driven up valuations.
Indeed, U.S. stocks have climbed despite another surge in virus cases across the country as well as a slight deterioration in profit projections for next year. S&P 500 earnings growth estimates for 2021 have weakened from 28% on Oct. 1 to 22.5% as of Friday, based on Refinitiv's data.
""A disconnect is starting to occur,"" said Nick Raich, chief executive of The Earnings Scout, an independent research firm.
""So one of two things have to happen. Either estimates have to catch up with price, or price will have to come down if we don't see a compensatory rise in earnings expectations.""
Longer lockdowns because of the virus are among the reasons the near-term risk for stocks is ""skewed to the downside,"" Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy and global head of ESG research for BofA Global Research, wrote in her 2021 outlook report last week.
Some strategists argue that consensus estimates for next year underestimate the rebound that is likely to take place in earnings.
""There was a great sense of just surviving,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, resulting in corporations cutting operations ""down to the nubs.""
""If you bring back growth, we'll have more of that fall to the bottom line than ever before,"" he said.
With results in from 97% of companies, the S&P 500 looks set to post just a 6.5% decline in third-quarter earnings, a vast improvement over the 21% fall that had been projected on Oct. 1, based on Refinitiv's data. Fourth-quarter earnings are projected to decline 11%, versus the 13.6% drop forecast on Oct. 1.
Still, a lot depends on the timing of the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine, analysts said, since that will determine how fast normal business activity can resume.
The most economically-sensitive sectors are expected to see the biggest year-over-year profit growth in 2021. Analysts expect energy earnings to jump nearly 600% in 2021, while they project industrial earnings to climb 79%, based on Refinitiv's data.
Investors are also waiting to see if President-elect Joe Biden's policies will be market-friendly. Biden has floated the possibility of tax hikes, which could restrain earnings growth.

In a Reuters poll published on Wednesday, most strategists said they see earnings returning to pre-pandemic levels within a year, but some said earnings could take longer to rebound if taxes rise.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine producer, sees AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine candidate as a ""very good"" option, giving it a major vote of confidence after some experts raised questions around its trial data.
Serum Institute of India (SII), which has partnered with the British drugmaker to conduct trials on its COVISHIELD vaccine in India and produce the vaccine candidate if it secures approval, plans to apply for an emergency use licence for the vaccine in the next two weeks, said SII's Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla.
""This vaccine is a very good one,"" said Poonawalla, via a virtual press briefing following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to SII's campus on Saturday.
""What we found with COVISHIELD in its global trial is there were zero hospitalisations, which means even if you do get infected you're not going to have a severe attack and secondly even those who got the disease were not infecting others,"" he said.
Poonawalla's comments come as a boost to AstraZeneca after some scientists raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90% effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose. 
He also noted that the AstraZeneca vaccine, along with the vaccine from  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) - the U.S. vaccine developer that SII has also partnered with - offered a significant edge over the vaccine candidates of certain rivals, which need to be stored at much lower temperatures.
""Both our vaccine candidates can be stored in 2 Celsius to 8 Celsius and India has lot of storage and infrastructure for that temperature range. It has slightly less storage capacity for -20 C and almost nothing for -70 C,"" said Poonawalla. 
U.S. vaccine developers  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) recently announced strong efficacy results on their respective vaccine candidates, but both of their vaccines need to be stored at very low temperatures that would present challenges for many developing economies. 

Moderna has said its vaccine can be stored at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20C. Pfizer's experimental vaccine must be stored at -70C over longer durations.

806,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 28, 2020 07:37AM ET</span>",Freedom ETF Bucks Mainstream to Bet on Human Rights & Long-Term Growth,"By Christiana SciaudoneInvesting.com -- What kind of an emerging markets index doesn't include China or Russia? 
Not a mainstream one, that's for sure. The Life + Liberty Freedom 100 Emerging Markets index and ETF (NYSE:FRDM)) are based on metrics like freedom of speech, human trafficking and international trade access. The result is a unique alternative, an ETF with a conscience, created by an American-Chinese, Perth Tolle, who recognized the difference freedom makes on people and markets. 
""It's an alternative way to invest in emerging markets and growth driven by free people,"" Tolle said in a phone interview earlier this month.
It was also the first white-label ETF launched by Alpha Architect, a research-intense asset manager that is proud to go against the grain and bet on long-term investments that may be short-term losers, said Chief Executive Officer Wesley Gray in a video interview. FRDM was a perfect fit for the enterprise.  
""The industry is so focused on the short run and trying to beat the benchmark,"" Gray said. ""As long as Perth builds a brand, builds authenticity, we're not dependent on raising $1 billion to keep the fund alive. We don't really care what the track record is. If she can just stay around, I think she'll win.""
It can be hard to stand out amid the ETF crowd, with 244 opened this year (and granted, more than 200 closed) and traditional asset managers increasingly moving into the segment. Plus, it's easy to find copycat funds, and the competition is fierce as investors dump mutual funds in favor of ETFs. 
The FRDM ETF gives investors a chance to lead with their conscience, and it has outperformed peer emerging market ETFs. The fund is up about 75% since markets dipped in March, compared to Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:EEM), up 59%, 64% and 62%, respectively.
All three rival funds hold Chinese stocks, China being quite the opposite of what FRDM is meant to represent. 
Tolle points to China having pulled out all the stops to prevent markets from crashing in March, including requiring investors to seek out permission in order to sell. That artificial, heavy-handed state interference helped at first.
But where the markets were allowed to take the Covid-19 hit, in places like Taiwan and South Korea, which is where FRDM's biggest holdings are located, markets are recovering faster, Tolle said. 
""Free markets grow more sustainably, they use capital more efficiently,"" Tolle said. ""They recover faster because they are more innovative.""
FRDM uses personal and economic freedom metrics as primary factors in the investment selection process, which is based on data from Fraser Institute, Cato Institute, and Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom. 
Tolle does not choose the companies or countries -- they are automatically chosen based on freedom scores, which Tolle turned into weights. She takes the top 10 largest and most liquid holdings and excludes state-run companies. As a result, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is the number one holding with 13%, followed by Samsung (KS:005930) with 8.9%. Tech, in fact, is the biggest industry represented. 
""I can't game the system or influence the scores in any way,"" said Tolle. 
Tolle grew up in the U.S. and China, which helped open her eyes to life with and without freedom. In particular, Tolle cited a friend, Maggie, who had no official name, no birth certificate, no school records -- she basically didn't exist, except she did. She was the victim of China's long-time one-child policy. 
""She didn't exist on paper because she was born the second child,” Tolle said. ""This really made me realize in China, the one child policy completely changed the culture of my generation."" FRDM, now at about $23 million, won ETF.com's best new international global equity of ETF and index of the year in 2019.    
Gray isn't worried about building the fund up.
""It's the long game,"" Gray said.  
Ideas like environmental, social, and governance investing (ESG) have existed in a bubble in the background for years, possibly decades, until recently, Gray said. ""All of a sudden, it becomes a mainstream idea.""
 ""I don't know when the world will think it's a unique and interesting idea,"" Gray said of FRDM. ""The key thing is staying around for as long as possible. We've covered that."" 
The long game is quite long, like 20 or 30 years. Evidence suggests that there are good ideas that will work well over 20 years, but could underperform the index for five to 10 years. 
""Perth's idea is kind of aligned,"" Gray said. ""She doesn't own China.""
For most emerging markets indexes, China makes up 30% to 40% of the holdings. ""If China outperforms in the short run, people are not going to like this product,"" Gray said, referring to FRDM.
Alpha's bets will inevitably have a bad run, but Gray urges people to ""think beyond your nose"" and says, ""you don't have to do what everyone else is doing."" 
Freedom, for example, isn't quite the trend ESG is. It doesn't matter to Gray or Tolle. FRDM is more than just a fund.
""It is a form of expression, it is a way to stand up for freedom in your portfolio,"" Tolle said.

807,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 28, 2020 07:33AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for AstraZeneca,"By Geoffrey Smith and Peter Nurse
Investing.com-- AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) is in a race to develop an effective Covid-19 vaccine, but that's not it's only goal.
It's really known as a global leader in cancer treatments, winning a number of drug approvals in recent years by regulators around the world. 
Earlier this week, the U.K.-based drug maker said late-stage trials of its Covid-19 vaccine showed 90% efficacy, but it quickly had to acknowledge flaws in the data. 
Investing.com's Geoffrey Smith and explains why this rare misstep won't cause lasting damage, while Peter Nurse says the fall-out has real reputational risks that will weigh on valuation. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
The bull case for AstraZeneca doesn’t need any contribution from the experimental vaccine for Covid-19.
The fact is that the company is a global powerhouse for oncology drugs and others that treat chronic diseases of the lungs and kidneys. It earns gross margins of 80% in a normal year and it expects its underlying earnings per share to grow by between 15% and 20% in 2020, a year when the world’s healthcare systems have had trouble finding resources for anything but treating Covid-19. 
It is, beyond any reasonable doubt, a well-run company, whose shares deserve a management premium. In barely seven years as CEO, Pascal Soriot had raised the market value of an already mature business by 150% when the pandemic erupted.  Soriot has quickly addressed this week’s misstep over communicating stage 2 trial results by ordering a new trial, as any responsible CEO might.
Global regulators have been pleased to approve a string of its drugs in recent years, and suggestions that this vital relationship will be damaged by an imperfect trial conducted under the extraordinary pressures of the current race for a Covid cure are alarmist.  
Barring a fiasco wholly out of character with the rest of Soriot’s career, there is no downside risk for the share price even if the Covid-19 drug falls short. AstraZeneca’s share price is almost exactly where it was at the start of the year, before anyone had even heard the dreaded C-word.  Given that the cost of servicing its sizable debt pile has come down sharply since then (allowing a higher stock valuation, all other things being equal), you can even argue that the market is already applying a discount to the shares for the whole Covid-19 saga.
Either the drug is a write-off, in which case much of the cost remains with the governments that have helped to fund its development, or it actually is effective, allowing worldwide distribution. In the latter case, the fact that it has agreed to provide the drug at no profit should not be seen as the bugbear that many investors consider it. Reports citing confidential contracts with manufacturers suggest that AZ will be able to exercise pricing power from the second half of next year already.
And if it does eschew the short-term profit by keeping the price down, the long-term benefit could still be considerable.  Cancer, its true specialism, is a rich country disease, so the spread of wealth across ever more parts of the world is a secular positive for it. The gain in goodwill from not price-gouging on the drug everyone wants and needs will be intangible, but immeasurable.
The Bear Case
The bear case surrounding AstraZeneca rests largely on valuation and on the reputational damage it may incur from the mess it’s making of getting its coronavirus vaccine candidate approved.
With a P/E ratio of around 55, the company’s stock is priced well above both the industry average and its historical norm, suggesting there is plenty of downside potential.
The pharmaceutical giant released interim analysis of late-stage trials of its vaccine to great fanfare on Monday, stating that its efficacy reached a maximum of 90% depending on the dosage regime.
However, doubts quickly emerged over the reliability of the data provided by AstraZeneca and its partner, the University of Oxford, as regards the drug’s effectiveness.
Importantly, Moncef Slaoui, the head of the U.S. Operation Warp Speed team tasked with funding vaccine development, pointed out a potential flaw, saying the subgroup which reported the highest degree of efficacy had been restricted to people under 55, subjects which are likely to be more resistant to the disease.
Geoffrey Porges, Director of Therapeutics Research at life sciences boutique investment bank SVB Leerink, has been widely reported as predicting that the vaccine will never be licensed in the U.S., particularly as there appear to be viable alternatives in the form of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)’s and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)’s drugs. Promising candidate vaccines from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and others are still in the development pipeline.
AstraZeneca had promised to supply its vaccine at cost price for as long as the pandemic lasts, so not making it into the valuable American market for this product may not necessarily be a big thing. But the botched communication of what was far too small a trial could be far more difficult to ignore, doing lasting damage to its relationship with the all-important Food & Drug Administration. After all, it generated almost $8 billion in revenue in the U.S. last year, its biggest single market by far.
Swiss banking giant UBS earlier this week kept its “sell” rating on AstraZeneca, citing the uncertainty surrounding its vaccine’s results. Earlier this month it had also noted that product sales in emerging markets disappointed in the third quarter results, whereas U.S. business surprised positively. This balance may be about to change."
808,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2020 06:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: VW CEO pushes for contract extension in vote of confidence move - sources,"By Jan Schwartz and Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Herbert Diess has asked the families who control a majority voting stake in the world's largest carmaker to back a contract extension for him in a bid to break a deadlock, two people familiar with the matter said.
The appeal for support from the Piech and Porsche families comes after Diess was forced to relinquish responsibility for the VW brand in June to remain as group CEO.
""He is bringing the issue to a head,"" one of the sources told Reuters on Friday.
Another person familiar with the matter said Diess may review his position as CEO if his continued efforts to reform the multi-brand car and truck maker are stifled. 
Volkswagen Group, which also owns the Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche, Seat, Skoda and Audi brands, declined to comment, as did the families, the works council and the German state of Lower Saxony, another stakeholder.
Diess was appointed head of the VW brand in 2015 and group chief executive in April 2018. His contract is due to expire in 2023.
German companies tend to deliberate over contract extensions only a year before they expire, but the appeal comes after Diess struggled to win backing for key reforms.
These included installing two allies Arno Antlitz as chief financial officer and Thomas Schmall as chief procurement officer on the management board, three sources told Reuters.
Diess has met opposition to these appointments from Volkswagen's powerful labour bosses who control half of the 20 seats on the company's supervisory board, or board of directors. 
If labour leaders team up with Lower Saxony, which controls a 20% stake, they can veto significant decisions. 
Rather than approving each individual appointment, the labour leaders insist on approving a ""package solution"" which is ""harmonious"", two people familiar with the deliberations said. 
Volkswagen's labour chief Bernd Osterloh is also said to oppose a contract extension, one of the three sources said.
In a post on Linkedin this week, Osterloh said there was no fight about management appointments because no committee on the supervisory board had been formally consulted about the issue.
The issue would be decided ""when the time is right"" he said.
Diess, for his part, voiced his frustration in a column in the German daily Handelsblatt published on Friday.
""When I took office in Wolfsburg, I had firmly resolved to change the VW system. This meant breaking up old, encrusted structures and making the company more agile and modern,"" he said. 

""Together with many companions with the same level of motivation, I succeeded in doing this in many places, but not in some, especially not yet at our corporate headquarters in Wolfsburg.""

811,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 09:12PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: COVID-19 vaccine adoption rates are 'wildcard' for U.S. stock rally,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - News this month of three promising coronavirus vaccines has helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average over 30,000, but some investors worry that slow vaccination rates may weaken next year's expected economic recovery. 
Overall, 58% of Americans said in a Gallup poll https://news.gallup.com/poll/325208/americans-willing-covid-vaccine.aspx that ended Nov. 1 that they would get vaccinated, up from 50% who were willing in a September poll. Forty-two percent said they would be unwilling to get a vaccine, citing reasons such as the rushed development timeline and concerns about safety.
Delays in vaccine distribution or widespread refusal to be vaccinated would allow the virus to continue to circulate longer and delay the development of herd immunity, which occurs when enough people in a population have some form of protection that prevents the easy spread of a disease.
""To be certain that the world will be back to normal by mid-next year because a vaccine is available is an aggressive assumption,"" said David Albrycht, chief investment officer at Newfleet Asset Management.
""There's a light at the end of the tunnel but we're not sure how long that the tunnel is going to be,"" he said, citing uncertainties including whether a vaccine will be free or covered by insurance plans, its rollout and its public acceptance rate.
Citi Research wrote in a note on Monday that herd immunity would not form until late 2021, boosting global Gross Domestic Product growth by only 0.7% next year compared with an estimated 3% gain in 2022 as vaccination rates rise. 
""The answer is not the vaccine; it's vaccinations. The vaccine needs to be widely adopted and accepted for it to work,"" said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will likely grant approval in mid-December for distribution of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech and some healthcare workers could start getting shots a day or two later, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed, said on Sunday.
Some 70% of the U.S. population of 330 million would need to be inoculated to achieve herd immunity, which is possible by May, he said.
Ramos said those estimates may be overly optimistic and the economic benefits of vaccinations will not be apparent until the second half of next year, increasing chances that the recent U.S. economic slowdown could worsen.
Investors will get the latest U.S. economic snapshot with data next week, including the monthly employment report. Economists polled by Reuters expect the Dec. 4 jobs report to show unemployment dipped to 6.8% from 6.9%, still well above the 4.5% rate in March, before much of the U.S. economy went into lockdown.
Targeted vaccinations could revive the economy even with delays in widespread adoption, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities.
""The successful vaccination of seniors and front-line workers could expedite the renormalization process well before herd immunity is achieved,"" he said. The S&P 500 may reach 4,050 by the end of 2021, up about 13% from its current level, he estimated.
While vaccine adoption rates are a ""wildcard,"" their availability removes the risk of another widespread economic lockdown, said John Buckingham, portfolio manager at Kovitz Investment Group.
He remains bullish on companies that will benefit from an economic recovery, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) Inc and Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR), even if the U.S. economy remains bumpy over the next few months and coronavirus cases keep rising.
The United States recorded its 12 millionth COVID-19 case on Nov. 21, and health experts have warned that Americans traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday will likely push case counts steeply higher.

""If the situation were reversed and you had good data on cases and hospitalizations for COVID but vaccines were flops, the stock market would be cratering,"" Buckingham said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Masked shoppers turned up in smaller numbers at major U.S. retailers including Macy's Inc (NYSE:M), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) on Black Friday as early online deals and worry about the spike in COVID-19 cases dulled enthusiasm for trips to the mall. 
Retailers overhauled the traditionally busy shopping day that comes the day after Thanksgiving. Walmart opened stores at 5 a.m. on Friday, directing shoppers to turn right upon entering and proceed along main aisles to shop deals before paying at registers surrounded by plastic barriers.
Best Buy opened at 5 a.m., employing workers in can't miss orange vests to serve as traffic cops. Others offered temperature checks and ""grab-and-go"" merchandise, including toys, bikes and kitchen appliances to discourage lingering in store aisles.
Bill Park, a partner at Deloitte & Touche LP, estimated traffic at the King of Prussia mall outside of Philadelphia was down about 20-30% compared to last year. 
“I’m surprised at the traffic. It’s down a little bit but heavier than I thought,” he said but noted shoppers were not loaded down with packages. 
Elsewhere, shoppers with empty carts lined up a socially-distant six feet apart before the Walmart in LaGrange, Kentucky opened, but crowds appeared down overall. Stores selling popular computer game consoles had some of the longest lines as gamers tried to land Sony Corp (T:6758)'s PlayStation 5.
Brothers-in-law Gabriel Rojas, 24 and Juan Cabrera, 24 were waiting in line at GameStop (NYSE:GME) in New York's Bronx borough, since 2 a.m. on Friday, hopeful to snatch up a PS5. They were unsuccessful as there were some 20 people ahead of them and the retailer only had two left in stock, they said.
“We're bummed” said Rojas. “But that’s ok.”
Some had better luck. 
Roger Mustafa, 37, walked out of a Manhattan GameStop with a PS5 in a plastic bag and a huge smile on his face. It cost him $544 and a lot of sleep.
“I’ve been waiting outside of GameStop for two days,” said Bronx resident Mustafa. “Now I’m going to go home and get some sleep.”
At Macy's New York flagship, Asuncion Peralta, 77, said she was not afraid to shop because she had COVID-19 antibodies. 
""I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time to buy towels and sheets, everything else that I need,” said Peralta. “These prices are not Black Friday prices. I came here two days ago and the deals were better.”

Upscale department store operator Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), which has seen its sales tumble in the pandemic, offered customers a $15 gift card if they picked up packages curbside at their stores.
Overall, the National Retail Federation (NRF) forecasts U.S. holiday retail sales will increase between 3.6% and 5.2% over 2019, for a total of $755.3 billion to $766.7 billion. That compares with an average annual increase of 2.5% over the past five years.
On Nov. 19, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) deemed ""going shopping in crowded stores just before, on, or after Thanksgiving"" as a high-risk activity.
Target employee Seth Schaffer, 22, from Lufkin, Texas, said shoppers in his store appeared less concerned about taking precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
“Deep east Texas isn’t the type of place where you’ll see everyone respecting mask policies or avoiding close contact.”
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics expects Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2020 to still become the two largest online sales days in history, with Black Friday online sales between $8.9 billion and $10.6 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors' U.S. units on Friday agreed to a record $210 million civil penalty after U.S. auto safety regulators said they failed to recall 1.6 million vehicles for engine issues in a timely fashion.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the two affiliated Korean automakers agreed to consent orders after it said they had inaccurately reported some information to the agency regarding the recalls.
Hyundai agreed to a total civil penalty of $140 million, including an upfront payment of $54 million, an obligation to spend $40 million on safety performance measures, and an additional $46 million deferred penalty if it does not meet requirements.
Kia's civil penalty totals $70 million, including an upfront payment of $27 million, requirements to spend $16 million on specified safety measures and a potential $27 million deferred penalty.
""It’s critical that manufacturers appropriately recognize the urgency of their safety recall responsibilities and provide timely and candid information to the agency about all safety issues,"" said NHTSA Deputy Administrator James Owens. 
The settlement covers recalls in 2015 and 2017 for manufacturing issues that could lead to bearing wear and engine failure.
As part of the settlement, Hyundai is investing $40 million to build a safety field test and inspection laboratory in the United States and implementing new IT systems to better analyze safety data.
""We are taking immediate action to enhance our response to potential safety concerns,"" said Brian Latouf, chief safety officer, Hyundai Motor North America.
Kia said in statement it ""denied the allegations but agreed to settle the matter to avoid a protracted dispute with the government"". It added it has agreed ""to restructure and transfer the departments responsible for recall determinations to the United States"".
SAFETY-RELATED DEFECTS
In August 2014, Hyundai agreed to pay a $17.35 million fine to settle an NHTSA investigation that it delayed the recall of 43,500 Genesis cars to fix a brake defect linked to two injuries. NHTSA said in 2014 Hyundai ""must change the way they deal with safety-related defects"".
Kia agreed to create a new U.S. safety office headed by a chief safety officer and each automaker will retain an independent, third-party auditor who will directly report to NHTSA and will conduct a comprehensive review of the company’s safety practices.
Hyundai's consent order will last three years, while Kia's is for two years, but both can be extended by one year.
The 2015 and 2017 recalls involved the 2011-2014 Hyundai Sonata and 2013-2014 Santa Fe Sport vehicles, while Kia did not recall the vehicles until 2017, when it called back the 2011-2014 Optima, 2012-2014 Sorento, and 2011-2013 Sportage vehicles.
The settlements are separate from ongoing NHTSA investigations into non-crash fires in certain Hyundai and Kia vehicles, some of which have the recalled engines.

In 2019, Reuters reported a group of U.S. states were investigating Hyundai and Kia for potential unfair and deceptive acts related to reports of hundreds of vehicle fires.
In November 2018, Reuters reported that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects had been conducted properly.
In 2014, Hyundai and Kia agreed to pay $350 million in penalties to the U.S. government for overstating fuel economy ratings, which were billed at the time as the largest ever under the Clean Air Act.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department on Friday said it would add new procedural hurdles before the government could bar most additional unfair or deceptive practices by airlines, in a move sought by the carriers.
The department is codifying a definition of what constitutes unfair or deceptive practices. It will requires a three-pronged analysis before adopting new rules deeming airline practices unfair or deceptive and require evidentiary hearings before most new rules are adopted.
Many Democrats in Congress urged the department to abandon the effort.
Representative Katie Porter said in July that the rule would ""weaken enforcement of airline passenger protections."" Four senators including Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, said ""industry groups could exploit these new procedural hoops — which the airlines themselves appear to be driving — to delay any DOT action to protect consumers.""
The Transportation Department said Friday the new rules that apply to airlines and ticket agents provide ""greater transparency and predictability on how the department conducts its aviation consumer protection rulemaking and enforcement activities.""
The International Air Transport Association and Airlines for America, a trade group that had sought the rules representing major airlines including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines, said earlier the proposed rules would ""benefit the public by further enhancing the transparency, predictability, and consistency of DOT’s rulemaking and enforcement procedures.""
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said DOT previously had ""not adopted clearly articulated standards or policy statements for determining what constitutes unfairness or deception... Too often this has resulted in overbroad interpretations of DOT’s authority.""
The definitions are modeled on the Federal Trade Commision (FTC) standards on unfair or deceptive practices.
FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter had urged the department not to finalize the rule ""because it will seriously hamper the department’s ability to fulfill its statutory mission of protecting aviation consumers.""
The department rejected several additional requests from airlines, declining requests to adopt a ""clear and convincing evidence"" standard for enforcement or a new ""intent to deceive"" requirement.

The new rules become final 30 days after being published in the Federal Register.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has found buyers for six aircraft from the A320neo family rejected by one of its main customers, Malaysia's AirAsia, as it works off a surplus left by the coronavirus crisis, industry sources said.
Unwanted jets have become an emblem of pandemic-induced problems in the aerospace industry that have come on top of a chill in ties between two of its major players.
Tensions became unusually public when Airbus in April invited tenders for six jets that AirAsia had failed to take delivery of. 
It has now found homes for all six, the last of which is being delivered this month, a European industry source told Reuters. Airbus provided no comment.
Airbus has been steadily increasing deliveries as it strikes deals with airlines to reschedule deliveries or store jets.
It said last month it had reduced an overhang that it had been unable to deliver during the crisis by 10 units to 135 jets. The redeployment of AirAsia orders is expected to trim the surplus further as deliveries top output in November.
Airbus is seeing strong demand, relative to the rest of the battered sector, for its A321neo jet, and the aircraft has broadly held its value, the European source said. It is sticking with plans to increase output of the single-aisle jets.
The A321neo competes with the two largest versions of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, which won approval last week to re-enter service after a 20-month grounding in the wake of two crashes.
AIRCRAFT VALUES
Boeing is expected to re-sell dozens of 737 MAX whose buyers cancelled during the grounding, potentially depressing prices.
According to the UK-based consultancy IBA Group, all aircraft have lost some value during the COVID-19 crisis but the A321neo is trading around 5% below its inherent value while the MAX is 10% below - hurt also by the recent grounding.
Doubts remain, however, about demand for a larger Airbus, the A330neo, whose largest customer, AirAsia's long-haul unit Air Asia X, is seeking new funding to survive.
AirAsia said in April it would stop taking deliveries of all Airbus jets this year and review remaining orders.
The move exacerbated concerns about demand in Southeast Asia, which was already struggling with overcapacity before the crisis.
AirAsia's relations with Airbus were further clouded when it was drawn into an Airbus bribery case before being cleared by local investigators, industry sources have said.

AirAsia co-founders denied any wrongdoing in a sports sponsorship deal cited in a wider Airbus bribery settlement with prosecutors in January. The European source said AirAsia remained an important partner for Airbus.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks advanced, with the Nasdaq closing at a record high, on Friday in a holiday-shortened week as retailers kicked off the year-end shopping season amid record COVID-19 hospitalizations.
The Nasdaq outperformed as investors favored tech-related, market-leading stocks that have fared well during the pandemic, while economically sensitive cyclical stocks weighed.
All three indexes rose for the week, in which the S&P 500 reached a new closing high and the blue-chip Dow ended above 30,000 for the first time ever.
""It's an abbreviated session and volume is light, so the only conclusion is that the rally is not faltering for now,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
""It does bode well for next month,"" Cardillo added. ""Will we see a Santa rally? Most likely. Will it be as robust as November? That's a big question mark.""
Retailers opened their doors to Black Friday shoppers, with social distancing practices and other measures put in place to mitigate infection risks, while offering steep discounts.
""Black Friday has been somewhat tarnished - traffic is down due to the pandemic - but the good news is e-commerce sales have reached a new record,"" Cardillo said. ""That's encouraging."" 
In the latest development on the road toward developing a vaccine against COVID-19, Britain gave drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) the green light after experts raised questions about the vaccine's trial data.
As U.S. hospitalizations for coronavirus set a grim record of more than 89,000, the race for a medical solution to the pandemic has led to promising vaccines from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and others, fueling optimism for light at the end of the tunnel.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 37.9 points, or 0.13%, to 29,910.37; the S&P 500 gained 8.7 points, or 0.24%, at 3,638.35; and the Nasdaq Composite added 111.44 points, or 0.92%, at 12,205.85.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, healthcare companies enjoyed the largest percentage gains while energy shares had the biggest percentage loss.
Chipmaker stocks, which have been resilient throughout the global health crisis, once again outperformed the broader market, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index rising 1.2%.
Shares of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co dipped 1.3% after the company said it would lay off about 32,000 workers, up from the 28,000 announced previously. Jobs will be cut mainly at Disney's theme parks.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc built on its recent rally, its shares advancing 2.0% even as U.S. regulators opened an investigation into front suspension issues in about 115,000 Tesla vehicles.
U.S.-listed shares of iQIYI Inc fell 1.7% after Reuters reported  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd had put on hold talks to buy a controlling stake in the video streaming service.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.73-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 154 new highs and nine new lows.

Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday, as tech continued to rack up gains to offset losses in value stocks on fears of further Covid-19 restrictions ahead as Americans travel over the holidays.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.13%, or 38 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.28%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.92%.
Tech was among the biggest gainers of the day, led by the Fab 5 stocks as investor appetite for growth stocks remained intact.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) were higher.
The uptick in tech stocks helped the broader market fend off a weakness in value stocks at a time when some are concerned the uptick in Covid-19 infections is likely to lead to further restrictions in the U.S.
""The number of cases was rising sharply before last week but holiday travel and socialising could see an acceleration that necessitates aggressive action to prevent healthcare systems buckling under the pressure of hospitalisations,"" ING said in a note.
A fall in industrials and energy led the move in lower in value stocks – those linked to the performance of the economy.
Energy fell nearly 1% as investors appeared to take profits, but remains on track for a third-week of gains following strong early-week gains amid rising oil prices ahead of a key OPEC meeting next week.
""Despite some signs of daylight between producers over deviating from the tapering timeline, we believe that OPEC+ will opt for a short extension of the current 7.7 mb/d cut when they meet next week,"" RBC said in a note.
Online retailer platform were also in focus on Friday, with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) up sharply, as online sales racked up gains.  Online sales rose to a rose 22% to a record $5.1 billion on Thanksgiving Day, according to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics. 
Looking to the week ahead, market sentiment in the week ahead will be driven by developments on Covid-19 vaccines, further restrictions to curb the flow of the virus and any progress on US fiscal stimulus, ING said in a note."
822,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>","UniCredit working with GS, JPM as strategic advisers: sources","By Valentina Za, Giuseppe Fonte and Pamela Barbaglia
MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit is working with strategic advisers Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), three people close to the matter said, as it prepares to update its business plan next year and weighs a potential acquisition of state-owned peer Monte dei Paschi.
Italy is seeking a buyer for Monte dei Paschi (MPS) which it rescued in 2017 spending 5.4 billion euros ($6.4 billion) for a 68% stake, which it is now looking to cut with help from advisers Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Orrick.
UniCredit had been identified as the ideal partner given its robust balance-sheet but smaller rival Banco BPM also remains a possibility, people familiar with the matter have said.
UniCredit has ruled out mergers and acquisitions but sources have said it may consider a deal similar to the one struck by Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) in 2017, when it bought the good assets of two failing banks for 1 euro and the state stepped it to neutralise the impact on its balance sheet and protect it from legal risks.
UniCredit is working with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan on a business update it plans to present to the market in the second quarter of 2021, one of the sources said.
JPM declined to comment while GS was not immediately available for a comment.
CEO Jean Pierre Mustier has said UniCredit would focus on the digital acceleration driven by the pandemic in the plan, to illustrate ""the lessons learnt"" in the healthcare emergency.
The other two sources said JPM and GS, two investment banks traditionally close to UniCredit, were also expected to provide advice on MPS if the conditions for a deal came into place.
To re-privatise the loss-making bank as it has agreed to do to win European Union approval for the bailout, the Treasury is considering various options, including a share exchange offer the buyer would launch, one of the sources said.
To lure a buyer, Rome is reading a package of incentives while also attempting to tackle the main hurdle - some 10 billion euros in pending legal claims MPS faces after years of mismanagement.
Rome has also included in the 2021 budget, which is due to be approved by Dec. 31, incentives to spur mergers by allowing banks to use past tax losses to cut their tax burden.
In the case of MPS the scheme, which is being challenged by the co-ruling 5-Star Movement, would entail a 3 billion euro benefit for the buyer, though a fee would be charged.
Italy has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros for MPS which it could use to cover at least part of a capital shortfall which is expected to top 2 billion euros following a bad loan clean-up and provisions against legal risks.
The Treasury is also considering measures to help banks sustain the cost of layoffs in the event of a merger.

823,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>","U.S. agency opens probe into 115,000 Tesla vehicles over suspension issue","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Friday said it had opened an investigation into around 115,0000 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles over a front suspension safety issue.
The auto safety regulator said it was opening a preliminary evaluation into 2015-2017 Model S and 2016-2017 Model X vehicles after receiving 43 complaints alleging failure of the left or right front suspension fore links. 
Tesla in February 2017 issued a service bulletin describing a manufacturing condition that may result in front suspension fore link failures, NHTSA said.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The 2017 service bulletin said some vehicles have ""front fore links that may not meet Tesla strength specifications. In the event of link failure, the driver can still maintain control of the vehicle but the tire may contact the wheel arch liner."" 
NHTSA said 32 complaints involve failures that occurred during low-speed parking maneuvers, while 11 occurred while driving. Another eight complaints may also involve the same issue, NHTSA added.
The agency said ""the complaints appear to indicate an increasing trend, with... three of the incidents at highway speeds reported within the last three months.""
On Nov. 20, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in the U.S. District Court in California over suspension issues in Model S and X vehicles claiming vehicles have defects that can result in the front and rear suspension control arm assembly components prematurely failing.
In a blog post in June 2016 Tesla denied any safety defect in Model X or Model S suspensions, but acknowledged NHTSA had asked the company to informally provide information about suspensions without opening a formal investigation.
Last week, NHTSA said it was expanding a separate probe into nearly 159,000 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles, upgrading it to an engineering analysis, a step required before it can seek to compel recalls.
NHTSA had opened a preliminary evaluation in June over touchscreen failures. The agency said the failure can result in the loss of rear-camera image display when in reverse and reduced rear visibility when backing up, and can impact defogging ability, and audible chimes relating to Autopilot and turn signals.

That probe now covers 2012-2018 model year Tesla Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles. The preliminary investigation covered 63,000 Tesla Model S cars.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets drifted higher early Friday in holiday-thinned trend, continuing to look through the short-term pain of the pandemic a day after the number of people nationwide with the Covid-19 virus topped 90,000 for the first time.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 110 points or 0.4% at 29,982 points. It's on course for its highest-ever weekly close, having given back only a small part of the gains it made at the start of the week. 
The S&P 500 was also up 0.4% while the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.6%.
Among the biggest gainers in early trade were life sciences companies that stand to gain from any complications with the approval of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s candidate vaccine for the coronavirus. The Astra/Oxford University drug has registered more conditional sales than most others as national healthcare systems have scrambled to find vaccines at the lowest possible cost. If it isn't approved, then the market opportunity for rival drugs will expand accordingly. 
On such consideration,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock was up 12% while  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock was up 11.1%. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock extended its latest giddying rally in advance of being admitted to the S&P 500 index, rising another 3.6% after what appeared to be another big squeeze in the options market that forced brokers to buy the underlying stock. It's now added $180 billion in market value in the last 11 days, during which time there has been no major news directly relevant to its fundamental outlook. Its market value now exceeds that of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), a company whose profitability dwarfs that of Elon Musk's electric car empire.
Elsewhere, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock rose 0.7% as the Financial Times reported that it may launch its digital currency Libra in January, albeit in a much more modest form than it first intended. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stocks fell 0.3% after the company said late on Wednesday that it will cut another 4,000 jobs on top of the 28,000 already announced, as it faces a prolonged period of either total shutdown or restricted visitor numbers at everything from its theme parks and cruise liners to the theaters that show its movies. 
Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) stock rose 0.5%, while Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) stock fell 0.7% as Gold Futures continued to tumble. The yellow metal fell to a five-month low of $1,770.65 an ounce earlier before steadying to be down only 1.4% on the day. Alternative assets such as gold and Bitcoin (which lost another 1.9% on Friday to be down nearly 14% over the last three days alone) have suffered as the prospect of widespread vaccine distribution and an end to the pandemic next year have revived interest in equities - especially cyclical and value stocks - this week. "

The UK government, which has secured 100 million doses of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, has targeted a rollout to begin before Christmas.
""We have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards,"" British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.
""This letter is an important step towards deploying a vaccine as quickly as safely possible.""
In the global race to develop vaccines against COVID-19, AstraZeneca's candidate is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures.
The Thai government signed a deal on Friday to procure 26 million doses of the vaccine to fight the pandemic, which has killed more than 1.4 million people globally. Officials in the Philippines said they would secure 2.6 million shots and were negotiating a possible purchase of a further 1 million doses.
The announcements came after some scientists raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90% effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose.
AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said on Thursday that the drugmaker was likely to run an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its vaccine using the lower dosage.
The company had released trial data on Monday that showed its experimental vaccine prevented on average 70% of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil.
While the success rate was 90% in the sub-group, some experts said the relatively small number of participants made it harder to be confident in the findings.
AstraZeneca said the administering of the half dose had been reviewed and approved by independent data safety monitors and the UK regulator, adding the regulator publicly confirmed there was ""no concern"".
CONFUSION 'PROBLEMATIC' 
When the full dose was given twice, as it was for most trial participants, the success rate was 62% - still above the 50% required by U.S. regulators. Europe's drug regulator has said it will not set a minimum level of efficacy.
If a vaccine has an efficacy of 50%, it means that if 100 people who have not been exposed to the virus are immunised with the shot, 50 of them would not get infected, on average.
A spokesperson for Oxford University said additional data from international trials would help researchers assess the vaccine's efficacy among a more diverse population.
EXPLAINER-Trial efficacy numbers: 
But Pauline Londeix, co-founder of French drug transparency group OT-Med, said apparent confusion over the trial results was ""very problematic for public confidence in vaccines"". 
""It has largely to do with the race drugmakers are engaged in currently, which leads them to present vaccine candidates in the best possible way and not release full protocols and results. It is the opposite of what is needed in our view."" 
Nonetheless, Britain's top science adviser said the interim results showed the AstraZeneca vaccine was successful.
""The headline result is the vaccine works and that's very exciting,"" Patrick Vallance said on Thursday during a news conference with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
AstraZeneca expects 4 million doses to be available in Britain by the end of December. Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) started an accelerated ""rolling review"" of the vaccine at the start of this month as data comes in on safety and efficacy.
'A NUMBER OF VARIABLES'
The trial sub-group that gave the 90% efficacy read-out comprised 2,741 volunteers, a fraction of the tens of thousands in trials that resulted in the above-90% efficacy data released earlier this month for Pfizer-BioNTech's and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccines.
""Sub-group analyses in randomised controlled trials are always fraught with difficulties,"" said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia.
""In order to have faith in the results,"" Hunter added, any sub-group analysis have large numbers of volunteers. 
Shares in AstraZeneca were down 0.9% at around 1310 GMT. They have fallen about 7% since it reported the vaccine data on Monday.
Vaccine optimism helped buoy the stock to record peaks this year, making the drugmaker the most valuable listed British company, but its shares have lost over 17% since late July and it has fallen behind Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Shell (LON:RDSa).
Moderna shares have rallied 22% since it released its trial data on Nov. 16, while  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech are up 6% and 14% respectively since announcing data on Nov. 9.
A peer-reviewed analysis of data from the AstraZeneca-Oxford trial will be published in The Lancet in coming weeks.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has not commented on the trial results. The European Medicines Agency said on Thursday it would ""assess data on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine in the coming weeks"".
Moncef Slaoui, scientific adviser for the U.S. government's vaccine programme Operation Warp Speed, has noted that no-one in the sub-group that got the initial half dose was older than 55 - suggesting that regimen's efficacy in older people was unproven.

""There are a number of variables that we need to understand, and what has been the role of each one of them in achieving the difference in efficacy,"" Slaoui told a briefing on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Retail magnate Philip Green's Arcadia, which owns Topshop and many other British fashion brands, said it was working on a number of options to secure its future after the COVID-19 pandemic hammered its business.
Sky News earlier reported on Friday the group risked going into administration within days, threatening 15,000 jobs.
""The forced closure of our stores for sustained periods as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on trading across our businesses,"" the company said in a statement.
""As a result, the Arcadia boards have been working on a number of contingency options to secure the future of the group’s brands.""
In what could be Britain's biggest corporate collapse of the pandemic so far, Sky said Arcadia was preparing to appoint administrators from Deloitte as soon as Monday to handle the process. 
Arcadia, which Green purchased for 850 million pounds in 2002, is a major force on the British high street. In addition to Topshop, it owns Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Miss Selfridge, Evans and Burton brands, trading from over 500 stores.
Arcadia said its brands continued to trade and its stores would reopen next week when the government's latest pandemic restrictions ease.
The company declined to comment beyond its statement. Deloitte was not immediately available to comment.
STRUCTURAL CHALLENGE
Even before the pandemic, bricks and mortar clothing retail in Britain was facing a major structural challenge with the economics of operating stores on traditional leases proving increasingly difficult as more trade migrates online.
Already this year Debenhams, Oasis, Warehouse, Laura Ashley, Peacocks and Jaeger have fallen into administration.
Arcadia's demise would likely bring down the curtain on the 68-year old Green's extraordinary career.
He was once known as the ""king of the high street"" and twice tried and failed to buy Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY). 
In 2005 Arcadia famously took on more debt and paid Green's wife Tina, Arcadia's registered owner, a 1.2 billion pound dividend.
But Green's star has dramatically waned in recent years. 
His reputation was badly damaged by the collapse of department store chain BHS in 2016 and its aftermath. Green had sold BHS to a collection of little-known investors for a nominal sum of a pound the previous year.
Then in 2018, Green was named in Britain's parliament as having taken legal action to try to prevent publication of allegations of sexual harassment against him. He has denied the allegations.

The departure continues a management reshuffle at Germany's No. 2 lender that has swept through the top leadership ranks.
Commerzbank said that Michael Kotzbauer, who joined the bank in 1990, will take over from Roland Boekhout, who joined the bank at the start of 2020 and was previously with the Dutch bank ING.
The decision was taken at an extraordinary meeting of the bank's supervisory board on Friday.
Boekhout ""has decided to leave Commerzbank due to differing views on the future set up of the corporate clients business,"" said the bank's new chairman, Hans-Joerg Vetter.
Both the bank's former chairman and its CEO announced their resignations earlier this year, setting off a series of high-profile exits. 
The bank has been struggling to generate profits and has announced it is reviewing its strategy, with announcements on that expected early in 2021 after the arrival of the new CEO, Manfred Knof, who is joining from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).

Boekhout was passed over for the CEO job.

Novo Banco, which emerged from the collapse of Banco Espirito Santo (BES) in 2014, is 75% owned by U.S. private equity firm Lone Star and 25% by the state-backed Portuguese Resolution Fund. 
Under the contract agreed on its sale to Lone Star in 2017 the Resolution Fund must inject up to 3.9 billion euros if certain losses occurred from the sale of toxic assets inherited from the collapsed BES.
Loss-making Novo Banco has been offloading bad loans, real estate and non-core assets under restructuring commitments agreed with Brussels and the Resolution Fund has already injected almost 3 billion euros into the bank to cover those losses.
In its annual budget for 2021, submitted to parliament on Thursday, the government had proposed that the Resolution Fund inject a further 476 million euros into Novo Banco next year but the proposal was rejected by the centre-right main opposition Social Democrats and hard left lawmakers.
Social Democrat leader Rui Rio, however, told reporters that his party would vote in favour of this new capital injection if a pending audit shows it is fair and correct. 
Finance Minister Joao Leao said the state would meet its obligations to the bank. 
""Portugal will meet, as it has always done, its commitments assumed regarding Novo Banco,"" Leao said in a short statement sent to Reuters without providing further details. 
Prime Minister Antonio Costa tweeted later on Thursday that he had called European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to assure her of Portugal's ""full compliance with the commitments undertaken in the framework of Novo Banco's sale"".
Opposition parties fear Novo Banco could be benefiting Lone Star by selling it discounted non-performing assets, which inflated Novo Banco's losses. The bank and Lone Star have denied this.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>","Analysis: Battle of the billionaires - Bezos, Ambani gun for India retail supremacy","By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos and Mukesh Ambani, two of the world's richest men, face a turning point in a battle for preeminence in India's booming, nearly trillion-dollar retail market.
The outcome of a legal dispute which has embroiled the billionaires' Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Reliance Industries Ltd empires - where a court ruling is imminent - may shape India's retail landscape for years to come.
The winner in the fight for Future Retail Ltd, Amazon's estranged local partner, will get pole position in the race to meet the daily needs of more than a billion people.
Accusations of insider trading and contractual breaches, as well as nationalistic cries to keep the U.S. giant at bay, mark the high-stakes fight, which has snowballed from what began as a dispute between Amazon and Future.
If Amazon succeeds, it may slow Reliance's plans to expand its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar operations. If Amazon loses, its hopes of expanding its interests in India's second-largest retailer and cashing in on its key grocery supply chain will be dashed, industry insiders say.
Amazon is trying to stop Reliance's $3.4 billion purchase of Future Group's retail assets. The U.S. company, which won an injunction from an arbitrator to block the Reliance-Future deal, accuses its partner of breaching some pre-existing agreements, misleading the public and insider trading. Future denies the allegations.
Amazon, Reliance and Future did not respond to requests for comment.
Bezos's behemoth is a formidable foe, but Ambani has a history as a disrupter. He has shaken foreign telecom firms by offering dirt-cheap data. Industry executives see his e-commerce plans as a threat for Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart.
""If Reliance moves faster and faster, obviously it'll become very difficult for anyone else to gain,"" said Himanshu Bajaj, head of consulting firm Kearney's India retail practice.
Reliance, seeking to expand its JioMart e-commerce business, this month completed a $6.4 billion fund-raising by selling a stake in its retail arm to such investors as Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR).
GROCERIES, 'BIG BROTHER' IN AMERICA
India's retail market will grow 46% over the next four years to an annual $1.3 trillion, reckons  Forrester Research  (NASDAQ:FORR). The key battle is over groceries, expected to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024.
Founded by Kishore Biyani, dubbed India's retail king, Future transformed the country's retailing in recent decades, before COVID-19 hit the business so hard this year that Biyani was forced to find a new buyer.
Around 1,300 of Future's more than 1,700 retail outlets in 400 cities sell groceries. Its budget supermarkets cater to middle-class shoppers, while its upmarket stores offer products like imported cheese and fresh guacamole, relatively rare in India's retail landscape.
That makes Future a prized asset for both Reliance and Amazon.
Reliance and Future dominate the market, with the next competitor, Avenue Supermarts Ltd's DMart, having just 220 outlets in around 70 cities.
While Reliance boasts around 11,000 retail stores, just 800 of those offer food and groceries, UBS estimates. Future's retail assets would nearly triple Reliance's footprint in the grocery segment and boost its e-commerce plans, said Forrester analyst Satish Meena.
Amazon sees Future as a long-term play to optimise its supply chain for grocery delivery, an area where it has lagged, Meena said.
""Grocery is the category in which you fight,"" he said, while losing Future to Reliance would ""slow Amazon"".
Amazon, Future and Reliance this month hired some of India's top lawyers, who argued at length before a New Delhi judge. She is expected to decide soon whether to restrain Amazon from approaching regulators to block the Future-Reliance deal.
Amid heated legal arguments and patriotic appeals, Future's lawyer attacked Amazon as ""Big Brother"" in America, arguing Future faces bankruptcy if the Reliance deal fails.

""Please don't allow this American giant to kill Future,"" the lawyer urged the judge.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks remained on course for their best month ever on Friday as recent vaccine progress, Joe Biden's U.S. presidential election win, hopes for further stimulus, a commodity surge and a weak dollar all lifted the spirits.
European markets had a touch of caution ahead of a barrage of economic data and as questions emerged over trial data on AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, but that wasn't going to derail a November to remember. 
Germany's, France's, Italy's and Spain's main bourses all squeezed out gains and government bond yields stayed lows after the European Central Bank reinforced expectations of further stimulus next month. 
London's FTSE was fractionally lower with some last-minute Brexit nerves, but with Wall Street pointing to a post-Thanksgiving rise MSCI's main world index was readying another all-time high.
""Risk sentiment is in reasonable nick because we've got vaccines and easy money,"" said Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Kit Juckes. ""That is the underpinning of optimism.""
It hadn't been all good news overnight. Australian shares ended down 0.5% and Treasury Wine Estates (OTC:TSRYF) was whacked 11.25% as China slapped new tariffs on Australian wine, the latest move in the countries' long-running trade spat.
But shares in China still rose 0.1% after data there showed industrial profits surged at the fastest pace since early 2017. South Korean stocks and Japan's Nikkei both rose 0.3% too, albeit in choppy trade. 
British drugmaker AstraZeneca's coronavirus drug was touted as a ""vaccine for the world"" due to its inexpensive cost, but the efficacy of the vaccine is now facing more intense scrutiny, which experts say could delay its approval.
Several scientists have raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90% effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose.
""With global (coronavirus) case numbers having now topped 60 million... there is certainly some rough terrain ahead for the global recovery, and that can create economic scarring,"" analysts at ANZ Bank wrote in a memo.
VIRUS VS VACCINE
U.S. hospitalizations for COVID-19 are at a record and experts warn that Thanksgiving gatherings could lead to further infections and deaths.
More than 20 million people across England will be forced to live under the toughest restrictions even after a national lockdown ends on Dec. 2. Partial lockdowns in some European countries have also raised concern about economic growth.
The European Central Bank's chief economist highlighted these concerns, saying there were ""some worrying signals"" in financing conditions in Europe for small and medium-sized enterprises, which pushed European bond yields lower.
German 10-year Bund yields traded near two-week lows on Friday, while Portugal's 10-year government bond yields touched zero for the first time.
The euro, which last bought $1.1924, showed little reaction because currency traders have largely priced in expectations for additional ECB easing next month.
The dollar, which has fallen more than 2.2% so far this month as global sentiment has surged, lessening demand for the safe-haven currency, was near its lowest in nearly three months. 
""Surely euro-dollar can't break through $1.20 without good news on the (Brexit) trade deal,"" Societe Generale's Juckes added.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 0.8586% as some investors sought the safety of holding government debt. 
In commodity markets, copper, another key gauge of global economic sentiment due to its use in infrastructure, hit a near 7-1/2 month high. Oil, though up nearly 30% this month, dipped overnight on oversupply concerns, but Brent recovered in London to rise to $48 per barrel. 
Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, edged up to $17,256 on Thursday after tumbling 8.4% in the previous session, having failed to take out its record high of $19,666.
The cryptocurrency showed little reaction to a report in the Financial Times that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will launch its own Libra digital currency in limited format next year. 

Bitcoin has rallied around 140% this year, fuelled by demand for riskier assets.

Both big Swiss banks, Credit Suisse and UBS, decided in April to postpone paying part of their 2019 dividends after mounting pressure from authorities over lenders' payouts during the coronavirus pandemic.
Credit Suisse shareholders approved the bank's final 2019 dividend payout of 0.1388 Swiss francs per share, which followed a payout of the same amount in May, with 99.36% support.
Chairman Urs Rohner in a webcast speech defended full payment of the bank's 2019 dividend, as compared to a steep drop in European banks' payouts, saying Swiss banks were well-capitalised and the Swiss economy had proven more resilient than others.
""As you know, regulators in other jurisdictions, among them the European Union, have thus far taken a different approach to dividends this year,"" Rohner said at the virtual extraordinary general meeting. ""However, this in no way suggests a more lax approach to the distribution of dividends in Switzerland or that Swiss regulations are less stringent.""

Under the project dubbed ""Small BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle)"", engineers are racing to develop a purely-battery powered car around the size of a Polo which will be available for between 20,000 and 25,000 euros ($24,000-30,000).

Earlier this month, it raised its planned investment on digital and electric vehicle technologies to 73 billion euros ($86 billion) over the next five years, of which around 35 billion will be invested in e-mobility.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Chinese online retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD).com are among more than 10 parties to bid for CMC Holdings, the sole distributor of FANCL's skincare products in Asia outside Japan, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Bain Capital, Carlyle, MBK Partners, Sequoia Capital and CITIC Capital are also among the bidders for CMC, valuing the business owned by Hong Kong-based Chris Chan at close to $1 billion, the sources told Reuters.
In August, Chan appointed  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to sell CMC, which operates more than 200 stores in Greater China and Southeast Asia.
Chan, CMC, Bain, Carlyle, MBK and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Blackstone, Sequoia, CITIC and JD.com did not respond to requests for comment.
Some of the private equity firms are looking to team up with a strategic partner, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information is confidential.
China's internet giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) have shown interest and could join a bidding group later in the process, they added. Both declined comment.
The interest in FANCL's business outside Japan indicates investor confidence in a consumer recovery in Asia, particularly in China which accounts for around 80% of FANCL Asia's revenue. 
FANCL, whose products are sold and marketed on Alibaba's TMall, JD.com and Tencent's WeChat, said this year it was in talks with its distributor to launch e-commerce platforms as soon as possible.
Alibaba and JD, respectively, generated gross merchandise volume (GMV) of 498.2 billion yuan ($75.3 billion) and 271.5 billion yuan in this year's Singles' Day sales event, with Japan among the top-selling countries.
CMC is expected to finalise a shortlist for the second round of bidding by the end of next week and binding bids are due by the end of January, the people said. 
Asia accounts for 53% of global skincare sales, Euromonitor data showed, with researchers expecting annual growth above 5% in the next five years.
Chan is exiting CMC after 25 years as FANCL's sole distributor outside Japan. His contract for China expires in six years and that for the rest of Asia in 10, Reuters has reported.
Apart from CMC, FANCL Corp also sells products via its own retail channels outside Japan, sometimes at different prices, people familiar with the situation said.
Some bidders are concerned about this practice, which is known as ""parallel import"", as it could cause confusion and hurt business margins and any buyer will have to negotiate with FANCL for future arrangements, they said.

FANCL and Kirin Holdings, which owns 30% of the Tokyo-listed company, are not involved in the sale process, the sources have said. Both declined comment.

841,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 05:01AM ET</span>",Japan's ANA to raise $3.2 billion in shares to fund 787 jet purchases,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's biggest airline ANA Holdings said on Friday it will issue new shares to raise $3.2 billion, much of which will be used to fund its orders of fuel-efficient Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner jets. 
Like other big global airlines ANA has been making cost cuts, including pay reductions, to cope with a coronavirus-driven travel slump. 
But while many other airlines have been deferring widebodied plane deliveries to safeguard their finances, ANA has opted to stick with its pre-pandemic 787 orders from Boeing.
It says the 787, which is smaller than other widebody models, will be a cost effective alternative to bigger planes that may struggle to make money even after the coronavirus crisis ends. 
""On routes to Europe and the United States we flew the Boeing 777, but after the coronavirus, rather than 777 capacity, the 787 is going to be a better size,"" ANA Senior Vice President Kimihiro Nakahori said at a press briefing. 
In February the airline, which was the launch customer for the carbon-fibre 787, ordered 20 new Dreamliners worth $5 billion at list price, bringing its total orders to 100 planes.
Some of those may be configured with fewer business-class seats, Nakahori said, because ANA expects a quicker rebound in leisure travel. 
ANA does not expect its home market to recover for two years, and has forecast the downturn in international travel to last until 2024. The carrier last month forecast a record operating loss of 505 billion yen for the year to March 31.
Its first share issue since 2012 comes after ANA last month secured $3.8 billion in subordinated loans to replenish its cash reserves.
Of the 14 million shares it plans to issue, ANA said it will offer a quarter to overseas investors. 

ANA picked  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) as two of the global coordinators for its first share offering since 2012, sources earlier told Reuters. ANA declined to identify the coordinators.

A clear majority of OPEC+ watchers expect the group to maintain their supply curbs at current levels for a few months longer due to lingering uncertainty about the strength of demand. However, the decision is by no means certain amid public complaints from Iraq and Nigeria, and private discord with the United Arab Emirates.
The two leading members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak and Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman, requested an informal video conference with their counterparts from the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which includes Algeria, Kazakhstan, Iraq, Nigeria and the UAE, according to a letter seen by Bloomberg.
The unscheduled gathering comes just two days before a full OPEC ministerial meeting on Nov. 30, which will be followed by OPEC+ talks on Dec. 1. The JMMC met online as recently as Nov. 17, but that ended without any kind of recommendation about delaying the January supply increase.
On Thursday, Algerian Energy Minister Abdelmadjid Attar -- who this year holds OPEC’s rotating presidency -- told Bloomberg News that the group must remain cautious because the recent surge in oil to $45 a barrel in New York this week could prove fragile.
A separate meeting of a committee of OPEC technical experts considered data that pointed to the risk of a new oil surplus early next year if the cartel and its allies decide to go ahead with the production increase. The 23-nation OPEC+ coalition is scheduled to ease its 7.7 million barrels a day of production cuts by 1.9 million barrels a day from Jan. 1

843,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 04:31AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Alibaba, Tencent put talks to buy iQIYI stake on hold due to price, regulatory concerns - sources","By Julie Zhu, Yingzhi Yang, Zhang Yan and Yilei Sun
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd have each held separate talks with Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) to acquire a controlling stake in video streaming service iQIYI Inc, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
But the discussions have stalled with little hope of recommencing soon as they balk at a valuation of around $20 billion demanded by Baidu and as both companies, which have their own video streaming services, face heightened scrutiny by China's antitrust regulators, two people said.
Another Chinese tech giant, TikTok owner ByteDance has also internally looked at the possibility of acquiring a controlling stake in iQIYI, three sources said.
Considered China's equivalent to Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Nasdaq-listed iQIYI has a market capitalisation of $16.4 billion, which values Baidu's 56.2% stake at about $9.2 billion.
Tencent, whose interest in iQIYI was first reported by Reuters in June, believes the company is worth about half of what Baidu wants, said two of the people. 
Baidu, iQIYI and Tencent declined to comment on the deal talks. ByteDance declined to comment on the extent of its interest in iQIYI. Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment. 
While it is the No. 2 player in China's video streaming market, cash-burning iQIYI has yet to break even in its 10-year history. Its latest quarterly earnings showed drops in revenue and subscribers, punishing its shares which have lost nearly a fifth of their value in the last two weeks.
It is also being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after a report in April issued by short-seller Wolfpack Research accused iQIYI of inflating numbers. iQIYI, which is cooperating with the probe, has said an internal review has found no proof of Wolfpack's claims.
The video streaming service, whose cash and cash equivalents almost halved in the nine months to end-September to 3.16 billion yuan ($481 million) plans to raise at least $1 billion in the coming months, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter.
That may take the form of a share offering or a convertible bond or both, the person said, adding, however, that the company's recent share slide has clouded its financing prospects.
iQIYI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its fundraising plans. Baidu said in a statement that iQIYI, as an independent publicly listed entity, has smooth financing channels in capital markets and its support of iQIYI has not changed. 
REGULATORY HEADWINDS
Investing in iQIYI now may be politically difficult for Alibaba and Tencent after Beijing this month unveiled draft guidelines aimed at preventing monopolistic behaviour by internet companies. The draft's scope ranges from big data to payment services.
That came on the heels of the shock move by regulators to slam the brakes on Alibaba affiliate Ant Group's $37 billion IPO just days ahead of its debut in a stunning rebuke for Ant and Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
""After regulators published new fintech and anti-trust rules which will hit Alibaba's business, Alibaba's management is currently reluctant to proceed with big deals,"" one person said.
Purchasing iQIYI would give ByteDance, which makes most of its profits from short video app Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, the opportunity to enter the main market for longer length TV shows and movies.
It does have a separate video platform Xigua, which mainly offers videos of 1-30 minutes, an area it has been planning to step up investment in. 
But Baidu, which holds more than 90% of iQIYI's shareholder voting rights, is not likely to consider ByteDance as a buyer given a years-long feud between the two companies in China's digital ad market, said two sources. 
The search engine giant's interest in selling its stake in iQIYI comes on the back of a shift in focus to developing artificial intelligence and autonomous driving - areas which require heavy upfront investment.

Tencent Video was ranked the top player in China's video streaming market with a penetration rate of 45% at the end of 2019, followed by iQIYI with 43% and Alibaba's Youku with 27%, according to research firm BlueCatData.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Friday, as investors weighed up the competing factors of strong Chinese data and concerns over a highly-anticipated coronavirus vaccine.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index underperformed, dropping 0.6%.
Earlier Friday, China’s industrial profits rose at the fastest monthly pace in almost nine years in October, a further sign the economic recovery is gathering pace in the world’s second largest economy and a key trading region for European companies.
While in Europe, French GDP growth was revised upwards to 18.7% in the third quarter, the fastest growth on record, from an earlier estimate of 18.2%. 
However, it’s now all good news. Doubts have emerged about the soundness of the results of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s coronavirus drug. This medication was seen as the best candidate to help the developing world given its inexpensive cost and relative ease of storage and transportation.
These doubts could hinder its chances of getting speedy U.S. and EU regulatory approval, especially with AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot saying Thursday that the company is now likely to run an additional global trial.
Additionally, it was announced Thursday that large parts of England will remain under tough social restrictions even after blanket restrictions on the country's 55 million population end after a month-long lockdown.
Doubts also remain about the U.K.’s trading relationship with the EU, after Reuters reported that negotiator Michel Barnier said Friday that he was uncertain whether a new trade deal would be ready in time.
Wall Street will reopen on Friday for a half session following the Thanksgiving holiday, but trading volumes are likely to remain low.
In corporate news, BBVA (MC:BBVA) stock rose 2.3% after its merger talks with fellow Spanish lender Banco de Sabadell, down 10%, came to an abrupt close, ending a potential union which would have resulted in a bank with a market capitalization of around 27.5 billion euros.
Oil prices weakened Friday, retreating from an eight-month high in thin trading given the U.S. holiday and as traders look ahead to next week’s meeting of the major oil producers.
OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are widely expected to decide to maintain the current cap on supply, rather than raising it in January by 2 million barrels a day as previously agreed, when they get together at the end of the month. However, this isn’t the universal opinion within the group given the recent rise in crude prices.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% lower at $44.97 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $47.76. Both benchmarks have risen by around 6% this week.

846,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>",Steak out: China's coronavirus testing chokes beef trade,"By Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - In a supermarket in downtown Beijing, refrigerator shelves normally filled with steak from around the world sit empty as tougher testing for the novel coronavirus creates supply bottlenecks and raises prices for importers.
Fresh supplies of beef won't arrive for days, a salesman at the Suning.com-owned  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) outlet told Reuters - if then. That's a big setback for the industry at traditionally one of its busiest times of the year. 
""Whether we can get supplies then, and how much, remains a question,"" said the sales person, who declined to be identified as he was not allowed to talk to media.
Suning did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China began testing batches of imported chilled and frozen meat and seafood for the coronavirus in June, but significantly ramped up its inspections early this month after port workers in several cities tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.
The new measures, which include testing much more product than before and additional disinfection, are raising costs for importers while adding time and layers of red-tape in an industry used to working at speed to guarantee freshness.
The move is especially hurting the booming beef trade, worth $8.65 billion last year and growing rapidly, as some importers cut purchases on rising costs and weaker demand caused by consumers' coronavirus worries.
Though China says the risk of shoppers catching the virus from chilled foods is low, officials said this week there is still a risk of infection, particularly for handlers who repeatedly come into contact with the outer packaging of imported cold-chain food.
In Tianjin, northern China's most important port for meat shipments, the trade has come to a virtual halt, after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus earlier this month.
Warehouses were ordered to test all frozen meat before it could be shipped to the market, and no new product can enter, three importers told Reuters.
Three out of five supermarkets in Beijing visited by Reuters this week were short of beef. 
A salesperson at Meat Mate, a restaurant and retailer selling chilled Australian beef, said it now needs to place orders three months in advance, instead of one previously, to deal with the delays. Nobody at Meat Mate's headquarters could be reached for comment.
Now Beijing's Xinfadi wholesale market, linked to a coronavirus outbreak in June, has also suspended sales and storage of cold-chain and aquatic products, state media reported this week. 
DEMAND DIPS
Growing concerns about catching COVID-19 from frozen product has dented demand too. 
""Orders for imported beef have halved for us as our clients have got concerned about COVID recently,"" said a beef trader in Tianjin. 
""They ask us when the products were shipped and whether they have been tested when placing the orders. We have been selling lots of domestic products lately,"" she added. 
Testing and the additional time product sits in warehouses has driven up costs for importers by as much as 200%, traders said.
A beef importer based in southwestern China said he has reduced imports to less than one quarter of the volumes of previous years even as China enters its peak demand season ahead of the New Year and Lunar New Year holidays. 
""What if your cargoes get hit (with the virus)? It will be huge trouble. I'd rather import less,"" said the importer surnamed Fu.
Slower imports come as China's domestic pork production recovers from a severe disease outbreak and prices fall from record highs.
With more domestic meat being produced and the local economy also slowing due to the global coronavirus pandemic, beef demand was already taking a hit, said Grace Gao, manager at Goldrich International, a beef importer in Dalian.
Many beef importers have also had to deal with the impact from souring trade relations with key beef supplier Australia.
After cutting back on Australian purchases, Fu is now reducing imports from other origins too, including Brazil, Argentina, and Belarus.
""This year has been really miserable,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s Dutch shares will trade in Amsterdam for the last time on Friday, before a unification of the group's dual-headed structure that aims to put the consumer goods maker on a better footing to cope with an uncertain future.
The merger over the weekend of Unilever's Dutch and British corporate arms into one legal entity based in London will end 90 years as a hybrid company. It comes as the macroeconomic picture is clouded by a pandemic-fuelled recession and looming Brexit. 
The move is not expected to impact day-to-day operations for the maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream, but will bring greater flexibility in acquiring and exiting businesses, reduced complexity and strengthened corporate governance, Unilever has said. 
""The boards consider that unification is in the best interests of Unilever, its shareholders and other stakeholders taken as a whole,"" the company said last month.
Starting on Monday, Unilever Plc will trade as a single entity on the London Stock Exchange and as an American depositary share in New York. The Plc will also trade on the Euronext in Amsterdam.
""It's a seminal moment in Unilever's history,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Warren Ackerman, noting the last four CEOs tried and failed to ditch ""an outdated 90-year-old legal system that makes them very slow to act on anything"". 
He said it was a key part of his investment case in the company, which is hoping to reduce a valuation gap between itself and its peers. 
The company has said that unification would make it easier to spin off or demerge unwanted units or use equity to make acquisitions. That has sparked speculation about bigger transformational deals. 
Ackerman doesn't expect anything big in the near term, but says the company could expand in areas including plant-based food, nutrition, skin care in Asia and household products. 
Unilever this week announced the acquisition of SmartyPants Vitamins in the United States.
The previous effort to unify Unilever's structure came after it fended off an unsolicited takeover approach by Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) in 2017 that exposed some of its weaknesses. 
The following year the company was forced to abandon its plan to unify in the Netherlands, after a revolt by UK investors concerned about forced selling of their shares.
This time around, there is some Dutch opposition to the move, in the form of an ""exit tax"" proposal by an opposition party in parliament, but it remains under review. Unilever has said the tax would be illegal in its proposed form.

Following the move, Unilever's weight in Britain's FTSE 100 index will more than double, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts, from 1.8% to 3.9%.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>",How parent of BMW's China partner drove to the brink of bankruptcy,"By Yilei Sun and Tony Munroe
BEIJING (Reuters) - In October 2003, the first China-made BMW 325i sedan rolled off a new production line owned by the German luxury brand and its joint venture partner, Brilliance, a subsidiary of provincially owned automaker Huachen Group.
It was a milestone for the iconic Bavarian marque, whose cars proved massively popular in what became the world's largest market. Over the next nearly two decades, the joint venture was a cash cow for both BMW and Huachen, which is run by the government of the northeastern rust-belt province of Liaoning.
But this month, Huachen stands on the brink of bankruptcy, defaulting on 6.5 billion yuan ($987.48 million) in debt obligations. Chinese regulators have launched an investigation into possible violations of disclosure laws by the company.
The defaults by Huachen and two other Chinese state-owned companies have angered investors, who say their faith in the firms' top-notch ratings, seemingly sound finances and implicit state backing has been violated.
An examination of dozens of bond filings as well as interviews with former Huachen employees and experts shows how the carmaker squandered its advantage of having a gold-plated partner and was unable to leverage its know-how to develop competitive cars of its own. Some strategic missteps on the choice of models hurt it badly and an expansion into electric vehicles, funded by debt, came too late.
""Management's key selling point to BMW to win the partnership was simple: as a smaller and weaker Chinese company, Brilliance will follow what BMW says without making trouble,"" said a person close to Brilliance's top management at the time, declining to be named given the sensitivity of the matter.
Bigger state carmakers like SAIC Motor and Guangzhou Automobile Group were actively involved in their joint ventures and used the expertise of foreign partners to build stronger domestic brands.
Huachen and its Hong Kong-listed Brilliance unit, which also has a joint venture with  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY), did not respond to requests for comment. BMW declined to comment for this story.
BMW told Reuters last week that the JV's operations ""are not directly affected by the payment difficulties"" of the Huachen group. The German company has agreed to pay 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in 2022 for a further 25% stake in the venture with Brilliance, a deal brokered in 2018 by China's Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Renault (PA:RENA) said its JV ""is running normally"".
A court has accepted a restructuring application by creditors of Huachen, which employs over 40,000 people and has assets worth 190 billion yuan, including the BMW Brilliance tie-up. Huachen said in a filing that if it is not able to restructure, it will declare bankruptcy.
Lou Weiliang, a Shanghai-based lawyer at Fangda Partners, said it was possible that all or part of Huachen's stake in China Brilliance could be sold to a third-party under a restructuring, with proceeds used to repay creditors. But nothing will be clear until a restructuring plan is announced, he said. 
'DRAGON HEAD'
As recently as May 13, in a call with nearly 90 investors, Huachen executives told creditors that money to repay debt due in the second half of the year had been ""adequately arranged.""
Chief Accountant Gao Xingang said that as a ""dragon head"", or leading, automaker in Liaoning province, Huachen enjoyed strong local government backing, according to meeting minutes seen by Reuters.
But at the end of September, one month before its bond delinquency, Huachen transferred its prize 30% stake in Brilliance to a subsidiary, making it harder for bondholders to access those assets.
Investors cried foul.
""After all, Huachen is a big state-owned company in Liaoning province, and we thought they had core assets including an attractive stake in the BMW joint venture,"" said Shanghai-based hedge fund manager Vincent Jin.
BMW Brilliance sold a record 550,000 vehicles last year and made 7.6 billion yuan in profit, helping generate dividends of HK$1.8 billion ($232.17 million) for Huachen.
In the early days of China's automotive boom, Huachen was a competitive player in its own right, selling more than 200,000 vehicles in 2013 under its Zhonghua, or ""China"" brand. 
""We thought we would be the first domestic carmaker to sell premium cars well in China,"" said a former Huachen executive who now works for another Chinese carmaker.
But its competitors sped ahead while Zhonghua's domestic sales slumped to just 25,270 cars last year and only 5,312 in the first three quarters of 2020, according to consultancy LMC.
Chinese rivals such as Geely and Great Wall developed stronger products and technology, while state-backed SAIC Motor and Guangzhou Automobile grew with the know-how of joint venture partners.
Huachen, by comparison, used a scattershot approach to planning, with vehicles such as a mid-size sedan and compact SUV that were not complementary, said Yale Zhang, head of consultancy AutoForesight.
""Zhonghua did not plan its products systematically,"" he said. ""That made their products fail to meet the fast-changing market demand in China.""
MPV DEBACLE
About a decade ago, consultants hired by Huachen warned it against plans to develop a premium MPV (multi-purpose vehicle), citing competition, an unclear outlook for the segment and Huachen's technology disadvantage compared with the popular Buick GL8 made by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Huachen, led by longtime Chairman Qi Yumin, formerly vice mayor of the port city of Dalian, approved the Huasong project anyway.
""Qi was too confident about his plans. Unlike officials with deep experience in the auto industry who tend to seek opinions from different departments, Qi made decisions on his own,"" one person familiar with Qi and Huachen management said.
Qi, who retired last year, could not be reached for comment.
Last year, Huachen sold just 1,184 Huasong MPVs, while GM sold around 150,000 GL8s in China.
Efforts to freshen Huachen's portfolio helped lead to its current predicament. Fourteen bonds that Huachen has said it is unable to repay were issued between 2017 to 2020 to roll over debt, for working capital and to fund product upgrades and two plant projects.
In one 7.5 billion yuan project, Huachen planned a revamp of a factory to be completed this year to create capacity for 100,000 vehicles, including 30,000 electric ones, based on a new car platform. 
The investment came way too late, as China's saturated electric vehicle market underwent a painful consolidation after Beijing cut generous purchase subsidies. By then, rivals like Geely and BYD had rolled out more sophisticated EV strategies.
""Huachen missed the golden time when Chinese brands rose and all of a sudden it fell behind smaller rivals,"" the former Huachen executive said.
As recently as August, Huachen Vice President Qi Kai, who is not related to Qi Yumin, told an industry conference that the group planned to sell around 1.95 million vehicles annually by the end of 2025, including 1 million from the BMW Brilliance JV.
Analysts call that target unrealistic. The group sold just 800,000 vehicles last year - the majority from the BMW Brilliance joint venture.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",AstraZeneca CEO expects to run new global trial of COVID-19 vaccine: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is likely to run an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine using a lower dosage, its chief executive was quoted as saying on Thursday amid questions over the results of its late-stage study.
Instead of adding the trial to an ongoing U.S. process, AstraZeneca might launch a fresh study to evaluate a lower dosage of its vaccine that performed better than a full dosage, Pascal Soriot told Bloomberg News.
""Now that we've found what looks like a better efficacy we have to validate this, so we need to do an additional study,"" he said, adding that the new, likely global, study could be faster because it would need fewer subjects as the efficacy was already known to be high.
The news comes as AstraZeneca faces questions about its success rate that some experts say could hinder its chances of getting speedy U.S. and EU regulatory approval.
Several scientists have raised doubts about the robustness of results released on Monday showing the experimental vaccine was 90% effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose.
Soriot said he did not expect the additional trial to delay British and European regulatory approvals.
Asked about the Bloomberg report, an AstraZeneca spokesman said there was strong merit in continuing to investigate the half-dose/full dose regimen. Any further insights from the data would be added to those from existing trials that are being prepared for regulatory submission, he said.
Running an additional trial might not be too much of a complication for the British drugmaker in the race to develop a vaccine to help tame the pandemic, which has killed more than a million people and roiled the global economy.
Helen Fletcher, professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said another trial would not necessarily delay getting a green light as efficacy in the higher dose regime still met the World Health Organization's target. It was not unusual to run new studies on approved vaccines, she said.
The vaccine is one of three that could get approved before the end the year. This month,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported that their vaccines were about 95% effective in preventing illness, setting the bar sky-high.
Even so, the AstraZeneca shot developed with Oxford University is cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale up than its rivals.
Britain on Friday asked its medicine regulator to assess if the vaccine candidate met rigorous safety standards with a view for temporary supply, a step towards beginning a roll-out of the vaccine before the end of the year.
AstraZeneca expects 4 million doses to be available in Britain by the end of next month.
OPTIMISM
A peer-reviewed analysis of data from the new trial will be published in a medical journal in coming weeks.
The European Medicines Agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
AstraZeneca told Reuters earlier on Thursday that administering of the half dose had been reviewed and approved by independent data safety monitors and the British regulator, adding that the regulator publicly confirmed there was ""no concern"".
Clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may take longer, though, because the agency is unlikely to approve the vaccine based on studies carried out elsewhere, especially given the questions over the results, Soriot said.
AstraZeneca research chief Mene Pangalos told Reuters on Monday the firm would start discussions with the FDA to change the design of its trial to add the more-effective dosage regime.
Authorisation in some countries is still expected before the end of the year.
 Astrazeneca  (LON:AZN) has struck deals to supply the vaccines in several countries, including 120 million doses to Japan and 85 million doses to Australia.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, talking to media, expressed confidence about the vaccine, which is being manufactured by the country's biomedical giant CSL (OTC:CSLLY) Ltd.
The Serum Institute of India is conducting trials of the vaccine there.

""Even the lowest efficacy results are at 60-70%, making it a viable vaccine against the virus,"" the institute said in a statement, adding that the trials were running smoothly.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei called on employees of its departing Honor subbrand to strive to surpass its parent in a farewell speech as the tech giant sells the budget brand to keep its sanction-hobbled supply chains alive. 
Huawei Technologies said earlier this month it would sell Honor to a new entity called Shenzhen Zhixin New Information Technology, formed of its agents and dealers, so it could resume sourcing components currently restricted by U.S. sanctions. 
The U.S. government says Huawei is a national security threat, a claim the company denies.
""Wave after wave of severe U.S. sanctions against Huawei has led us to finally understand, certain American politicians want to kill us, not just correct us,"" Ren said, according to a speech posted on a Huawei employee forum on Thursday.
While Huawei could overcome the difficulties, ""millions"" of employees at Honor's agents and distributors around the world would lose their jobs as sales channels dried up, Ren's speech said. 
""We don't have to drag innocent people into the water just because we suffer,"" he said.
Honor-brand smartphones made up 26% of the 51.7 million handsets Huawei shipped in July-September, according to consultancy Canalys. The company's products also include laptops, tablet computers, smart TVs and electronic accessories.
Huawei's rivals have been ramping up production orders, anticipating they can gobble up market share while the giant is unable to produce new handsets, several industry sources recently told Reuters.[L1N2I90MQ]
If Honor could resume production, it could retain market share, said Flora Tang, an industry analyst with Counterpoint Research.
Ren called on Honor to become Huawei's biggest competitor after the ""divorce,"" and said toppling Huawei should ""become your slogan for motivation"". 
""We are your competitors in the future,"" he said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, ending the week on a cautious note as investors digested valuations from a record rally in global stocks earlier in the week and a stubborn second wave of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and Europe.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.07% by 10:49 PM ET (2:49 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.06% as the country reported 583 daily cases on Thursday, the first time the number has exceeded 500 since early March.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.63%. China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement released earlier in the day that China will impose temporary anti-dumping measures on wine imported from Australia starting Nov. 28.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.15%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.41% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.38%. Data released earlier in the day showed that Chinese industrial profit (CIP) rose 28.20% year-on-year in October, against September’s 10.10% growth. The CIP rose 0.7% year-to-date during the same month, against 2.4% contraction seen in September.
Global shares continued a pullback from the rally earlier in the week, with AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) likely to put its CVOID-19 vaccine candidate AZD 1222 though an additional global trial in order to clear confusion surrounding the positive results from the current study announced earlier in the week, Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said.
Optimism over positive results from other candidates, including offerings from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) has been dampened by the ever-rising numbers of COVID-19 cases globally, however. Vaccine developers continue to struggle with the logistics of producing and transporting the vaccines, while the number of cases continues to rise and threaten the global economic recovery.
“With global case numbers having now topped 60 million... there is certainly some rough terrain ahead for the global recovery, and that can create economic scarring,” ANZ Bank analysts said in a memo.
Some investors remained optimistic, however.
“Vaccine optimism continues to stir momentum going into December that could confront a slowing economy and liquidity difficulties … yet, the expectation of a full reopening of the global economy remains firmly priced,” Medley Global Advisors managing director for global macro strategy Ben Emon told Bloomberg.
Almost a month after the Nov. 3 presidential election, the uncertainty over the result is finally starting to lift, with incumbent President-elect Joe Biden taking the first steps towards his transition to power earlier in the week. However, incumbent President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would relinquish power only if the Electoral College affirms Biden’s win. Trump also said he may never formally concede defeat and could skip Biden’s inauguration."
854,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Britain to curb Google and Facebook with tougher competition rules,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will impose a new competition regime next year to prevent Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) using their dominance to push out smaller firms and disadvantage consumers.
The code will be enforced by a dedicated unit within the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which this year said it needed new laws to keep the tech giants in check.
Google and Facebook dominate digital advertising, accounting for around 80% of 14 billion pounds ($18.7 billion) spent in 2019, Britain's competition regulator the CMA said.
The two U.S. companies have said they are committed to working with the British government and regulator on digital advertising, including giving users greater control over their data and the ads they are served.
While ""unashamedly pro-tech"", Britain's Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was a growing consensus that the concentration of power in a small number of companies was curtailing growth, reducing innovation and having negative impacts on the people and businesses that rely on them. 
""It's time to address that and unleash a new age of tech growth,"" Dowden said on Friday.
The newly-created Digital Markets Unit, which will begin work in April, could be given powers to suspend, block and reverse decisions made by technology firms and to impose financial penalties for non-compliance.
Companies will have to be more transparent about how they use consumer data and restrictions that make it hard to use rival platforms will be banned, the government said, adding that the rules will also support the news industry, rebalancing the relationship between publishers and platforms.
The CMA said on Monday it was assessing whether a complaint about Google technology warranted a formal investigation.
Marketers for an Open Web (MOW), a coalition of technology and publishing companies, said Google was modifying its Chrome browser and Chromium developer tools to give it greater control over publishers and advertisers.
Google said advertising practices needed to adapt to changing expectations around how data was collected and used.

The layoffs will be in the first half of 2021, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
A spokesman for Disney confirmed that the latest figures include the 28,000 layoffs announced earlier. 
Earlier this month, Disney said it was furloughing additional workers from its theme park in Southern California due to uncertainty over when the state would allow parks to reopen.
Disney's theme parks in Florida and those outside the United States reopened earlier this year without seeing new major coronavirus outbreaks but with strict social distancing, testing and mask use.
Disneyland Paris was forced to close again late last month when France imposed a new lockdown to fight a second wave of the coronavirus cases.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Analysis: Questions over AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine data risk delaying approval,"By Kate Kelland
LONDON (Reuters) - Days after grabbing headlines with its COVID-19 ""vaccine for the world"", AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is facing tricky questions about its success rate that some experts say could hinder its chances of getting speedy U.S. and EU regulatory approval.
Several scientists have raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90% effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose.
""All we have to go on is a limited data release,"" said Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London. ""We have to wait for the full data and to see how the regulators view the results,"" he said, adding that U.S. and European regulators ""might possibly take a different view"" from each other. 
British drugmaker AstraZeneca said on Monday that its experimental vaccine, developed with Oxford University, prevented on average 70% of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil.
While the success rate was 90% in the sub-group of volunteers, the efficacy was 62% if the full dose was given twice, as it was for most participants.
That is well above the 50% efficacy required by U.S. regulators. Europe's drug regulator has said it will not set a minimum level of efficacy for potential vaccines.
At the heart of concerns, however, is that the trial's most promising result of 90% comes from a sub-group analysis - a technique many scientists say can produce spurious readings.
""Sub-group analyses in randomised controlled trials are always fraught with difficulties,"" said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia.
He said, in particular, such analyses increase the risk of ""type 1 errors"" - in other words, where an intervention is considered to be effective when it is not.
This is in part because the number of participants is greatly reduced in a sub-group - making it harder to be confident that a finding is not just down to chance differences or similarities among participants.
""In order to have faith in the results,"" Hunter said, any sub-group analysis ""should be sufficiently powered"" with large numbers of volunteers to take readings from.
Only 2,741 volunteers were in the sub-group that gave the 90% efficacy read-out, a fraction of the tens of thousands in trials that resulted in the above 90% efficacy data released earlier this month for Pfizer-BioNTech's and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccines.
'DEVIL IN THE DETAIL'
AstraZeneca said the administering of the half dose was reviewed and approved by independent data safety monitors and the UK regulator, adding that the regulator publicly confirmed there was ""no concern"".
""We are in discussions with regulators around the world to evaluate these findings and we look forward to the publication of the peer-reviewed results, which has now been submitted to the journal,"" a spokesperson added.
Oxford University did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The U.S. regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has not commented on AstraZeneca's vaccine trial results. The European Medicines Agency said on Thursday it would ""assess data on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine in the coming weeks once they have been received from the company"".
The regulatory process has nonetheless been clouded, according to experts, who note crucial gaps in the data AstraZeneca has made public so far.
""The devil is in the detail,"" said Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. ""We're trying to assess really quite complex trial designs on the basis of little press releases.""
Beyond headline efficacy rates, AstraZeneca's data release gave little for scientists to work on. It did not say how many infections occurred in the sub-group, for example, or in the group that got two full doses, or in the placebo group.
""A lot of questions are left unanswered,"" said Morgane Bomsel, an expert at the French National Centre of Scientific Research, adding: ""We are under the impression they (AstraZeneca) are selectively picking out the data.""
'A NUMBER OF VARIABLES'
Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for the U.S. government's vaccine programme Operation Warp Speed, also highlighted gaps.
He said no-one in the subgroup that got the initial half dose was older than 55 - suggesting the regimen's efficacy in crucial older age groups is unproven in this interim data.
In the group that received a correct full dose followed by a full dose, he noted, older people were included.
Such concerns, and the possible consequences for the speed of regulatory approval, helped AstraZeneca shares hit their lowest level since April on Thursday, having fallen 7% since the company released the data on Monday.
By contrast, Moderna has rallied 22% since releasing its vaccine trial data on Nov. 16 and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech are up 6% and 14% respectively since announcing their successful data on Nov. 9.
""There are a number of variables that we need to understand, and what has been the role of each one of them in achieving the difference in efficacy,"" Slaoui told a briefing on Tuesday.

""It is still possible that the difference (in efficacy) is a random difference,"" he added. ""It's unlikely, but it's still possible.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European dividend futures are stirring from their months-long slumber, reflecting investor expectations that positive COVID-19 vaccine updates on top of trillions of dollars in stimulus will fast-track an anticipated recovery in company profits.
On Wednesday, 2021 dividend futures for European banks jumped 11% after European Central Bank official Yves Mersch said lenders may be allowed to resume payouts next year if they show their balance sheets are strong enough. The contract remains well below 2019 levels.
Graphic: Bank dividend futures - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplazeyvb/futures.PNG
More broadly, euro STOXX dividend futures contracts for 2023 and beyond have surged around 20% in November on expectations vaccinations could start next month. The derivatives, measuring future dividend payouts, have rallied alongside so-called value stocks, companies which are more sensitive to economic cycles. 
""Financials will hopefully be a key source of dividend growth next year,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts told clients. 
That's by no means certain -- the EU insurance watchdog said it was too early to lift dividend bans. European regulators recommended the suspension of dividends earlier this year in an attempt to preserve banks' capital amid rising loan losses and demand for credit. 
Futures suggest that even in 2026-2028, euroSTOXX 50 dividends will remain 20% below pre-pandemic levels.
Graphic: Divi futures wake up after vaccine update - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/xlbvgzdywpq/Pasted%20image%201606377846485.png
Less gloomy data from IHS Markit still shows euro STOXX and FTSE dividends 15% and 25% below pre-pandemic levels respectively in 2022. U.S. payouts, however, are seen rebounding to pre-pandemic levels by end-2020.
Many analysts point out dividends did take four years to fully recover from the 2008-09 financial crisis. 
""I think some of the value rotation moves are a bit overdone,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said, referring to the rush into banks, travel and industrial shares.
""I wouldn't bet that some of these companies will be able to increase dividends from here. It should take three years or so for dividends to normalise.""
Globally, dividends could fall $263 billion this year, a Janus Henderson report said this week, while analysts tracked by Refinitiv I/B/E/S predict that payouts by STOXX 600 index constituents may drop nearly $60 billion.

Despite the optimism, dividend recovery will lag earnings, Morgan Stanley said, adding that while ""European profitability will surpass 2019 levels by 2022, we think dividends are less likely to achieve this feat"".

From December, passengers flying between Rome and some U.S. destinations can be tested for the coronavirus 48 hours before departure and on arrival at the airport, to avoid the mandatory 14-day quarantine Italy imposes on incoming travellers.
Aeroporti di Roma (ADR), the unit of Italian infrastructure group Atlantia that runs Fiumicino airport, said the new protocol will be valid for those flying from New York JFK, Newark and Atlanta.
In a separate statement, Delta Air Lines said it would reopen its routes between Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, in Georgia, and Rome on Dec. 19 to those travelling for work, health or study reasons.
""Carefully designed COVID-19 testing protocols are the best path for resuming international travel safely and without quarantine until vaccinations are widely in place,"" said Steve Sear, Delta President – International and Executive Vice President - Global Sales.
Fiumicino saw its passenger traffic plummet this year due to the coronavirus crisis and early in March it was forced to announce a partial closure.
In September, in an effort to resume domestic travel after the first wave of the epidemic, Italian carrier Alitalia experimented with COVID testing on some flights between Rome Fiumicino and Milan city airport Linate, Italy's biggest hubs.
However, the government progressively restricted movement between regions to tackle a second wave of infections and Milan is currently under a partial lockdown.

The Italian government is expected to give the go-ahead to COVID-tested U.S. flights in the coming days, ADR said, adding that the government's official backing will also allow them to offer such flights between Rome and Munich, and Rome and Frankfurt in Germany.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks held near record highs on Thursday, while the rally in European stocks paused, as recent vaccine progress, Joe Biden's U.S. presidential election win and hopes for further stimulus kept markets bullish.
World equities are having their best month on record in November, boosted by a slew of positive vaccine announcements and hopes that Biden's administration will deliver more economic stimulus and political stability. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose to a record high on Wednesday and held close to it on Thursday, up 0.1% on the day at 1142 GMT, as markets shrugged off the latest rise in U.S. jobless claims.
Europe's STOXX 600, which is also having its best month on record, up 14.4% in November, was down 0.1% on the day .
""The market’s very much looking forward to 2021 and the time when vaccines will be rolled out and economic activity can get back to normal,"" said Kiran Ganesh, a multi-asset strategist at UBS.
Ganesh said that the equities rally is ""particularly driven by the rotation trade away from large caps and towards small caps, away from the U.S. and towards Europe, and away from technology and towards some of the cyclicals.""
Markets also took a boost from minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's Nov. 4-5 meeting, which showed that officials discussed how the central bank's asset purchases could be adjusted to provide additional support to the economy. 
The minutes said policymakers may give new guidance about its bond-buying ""fairly soon"".

""2021 is going to be a year of economic catch-up,"" said Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier. ""When you keep the pandemic contained and under control, economic activity catches up very quick.""
The U.S. dollar slipped overnight, then recovered during the European session. Versus a basket of currencies, it was flat on the day at 92.056 at 1153 GMT, having touched its lowest in nearly three months in early London trading .
It also lost out versus the safe-haven Japanese yen, down 0.2% on the day at 104.24 at 1154 GMT.
U.S. markets were closed for Thanksgiving on Thursday. Biden urged Americans to avoid big family gatherings and to wear protective masks and maintain social distancing as COVID-19 cases soar.
In France and Germany, consumer confidence plunged in November under new lockdown restrictions, challenging the idea of a quick return to normal in the euro zone's two biggest economies.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel told parliament that lockdown measures will be in place until at least the end of December and possibly longer.
The euro was down 0.1% against the dollar, at $1.1902 at 1159 GMT. Euro-sterling was up 0.2% at 89.12.
UK investors were watching trade talks between Britain and the European Union, with little more than a month until the status-quo transition period ends on Dec. 31.
Britain's finance minister said on Thursday that ""it's clear what the shape of the deal looks like"" but that the United Kingdom would not sign a deal at any cost. 
The UK announced this week new restrictions on activity that will apply after the month-long lockdown ends on Dec. 2. London's FTSE 100 was down 0.5%.
Euro zone government bonds were little changed, with Germany's benchmark Bund yield at -0.576%.
Oil prices slipped, stalling a rally which saw futures hit their highest in nearly eight months on Wednesday.
Gold prices picked up as investors bet that the grim U.S. economic data would lead to further stimulus.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>",Tesla plans to produce electric car chargers in China,"By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Thursday it planned to start making electric vehicle (EV) chargers in China in 2021, part of the U.S. carmaker's push to boost sales in the world's biggest car market.
Tesla, which now sells its Model 3 electric cars in China and plans to deliver its Model Y sport utility vehicles in 2021, plans to invest 42 million yuan ($6.4 million) in a new factory to make its third generation of quick chargers, known as the Supercharger V3, it said in a statement.
The factory will be near its car plant in Shanghai.
China, which offers hefty subsidies for electric vehicles as it seeks to cut down on pollution from petrol or diesel cars, has been expanding its nationwide network of charging points, one of the biggest challenges to encouraging adoption of EVs.
The factory, which Tesla expects to complete in the first quarter next year, will have capacity to make 10,000 chargers a year, Tesla said.
Tesla, which sold more than 13,000 vehicles in China in October, said it would expand research capabilities in Shanghai.
China now imports EV chargers, usually installed in charging stations or car parks, from the United States.
The Shanghai car factory, central to Tesla's global growth strategy, aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans this year and has started exporting some vehicles to Europe.
Executives at Tesla said this year that the firm would expand its charging network to provide better service.

Investing.com -- Europcar (PA:EUCAR) looks like surviving the pandemic by the skin of its teeth.
The French car rental company – sorry, mobility group – said on Thursday it had agreed in principle to be recapitalized by its creditors, all but wiping out its existing shareholders.
It’s a limp conclusion to an ambitious but ultimately misguided acquisition by French investment firm Eurazeo (PA:EURA), which bought the company off Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) 14 year ago before floating it on the Paris stock exchange a few years later.
However, it does avoid the worst-case scenario of a messy bankruptcy, and the company’s new generation of reluctant shareholders will have the chance to make back some of the money they’ve sunk into the company next year, when – fingers crossed – the growing availability of vaccines allows the travel industry to recover.
Europcar’s shares had been priced for bankruptcy since September when the company acknowledged it would need to negotiate a debt restructuring.  They rose 4.5% by mid-morning in Paris and have now more than doubled from their lows. They are still down over 75% year-to-date, however, and down over 90% from their 2017 high.
Europcar had gone into the pandemic in weak shape and was always likely to be one of the first victims of the pandemic. Its third-quarter results published last month showed revenue down 46% in constant currencies for the first nine months of the year, and a loss of nearly 300 million euros.
Under the terms of the agreement, the holders of the 2024 and 2026 bond issues and of loans under 50 million euro loan facility arranged by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) will convert their claims into equity, with the further option of deeply discounted warrants. That will cut the company’s financial debt, which stood at 2.95 billion euros at the end of September, by 1.1 billion euros.
The creditors have also agreed in principle to a fresh 225 million credit facility for investing in the company’s fleet of vehicles.
The experience of the pandemic so far shows that companies that can convincingly banish the tail risk of bankruptcy can enjoy some handsome short-term bounces. However, there are also companies like Norwegian Air Shuttle that have been unable to recover, due to high ongoing debt levels and fears that the business model just wasn’t right anyway. Europcar’s new owners can hope for the best, but the company’s problems predated the pandemic, and will still be there after the injections of both equity and vaccine."

869,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Foxconn to shift some Apple production to Vietnam to minimise China risk,"By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Foxconn is moving some iPad and MacBook assembly to Vietnam from China at the request of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), said a person with knowledge of the plan, as the U.S. firm diversifies production to minimise the impact of a Sino-U.S. trade war.
The development comes as the outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump encourages U.S. firms to shift production out of China. During Trump's tenure, the United States has targeted made-in-China electronics for higher import tariffs, and restricted supplies of components produced using U.S. technology to Chinese firms it deems a national security risk.
Taiwanese manufacturers, wary of being caught up in the tit-for-tat trade war, have moved or are considering moving some production from China to countries such as Vietnam, Mexico and India.
Foxconn is building assembly lines for Apple's iPad tablet and MacBook laptop at its plant in Vietnam's northeastern Bac Giang province, to come online in the first half of 2021, the person said, declining to be identified as the plan was private.
The lines will also take some production from China, the person said, without elaborating how much production would shift.
""The move was requested by Apple,"" the person said. ""It wants to diversify production following the trade war.""
Foxconn said in statement: ""As a matter of company policy, and for reasons of commercial sensitivity, we do not comment on any aspect of our work for any customer or their products"".
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Taiwan's Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, on Tuesday announced a $270 million investment to set up a new subsidiary called FuKang Technology Co Ltd - a move the person said was aimed at supporting the Vietnam expansion.
The contract manufacturer also plans to make television sets at the Vietnam plant for clients including Japan's  Sony  Corp (T:6758), with the beginning of such production slated for late 2020 to early 2021, the person said. Sony (NYSE:SNE) declined to comment.
The factory will also make other electronic products such as computer keyboards, the person said.
According to Taipei-based research group TrendForce, all iPads are assembled in China and so Foxconn's move would mark the first time that the iPad has been made outside China.
Foxconn already plans to spend up to $1 billion expanding an iPhone assembly plant in India as ""strongly requested"" by Apple to diversify production beyond China, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in July.
It and peers such as Pegatron Corp are also considering building plants in Mexico, people with knowledge of the matter said, as Washington promotes near-shoring production.
Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way in August told investors the Sino-U.S. trade war had split the world into two, saying his firm aimed to provide ""two sets of supply chains"".

Other iPad assemblers include Taiwan's Compal Electronics Inc and China's BYD Electronic International Co Ltd.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>","Philippines, private firms to sign vaccine supply deal with AstraZeneca","MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines is set to sign a supply agreement for AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s potential COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, the first such deal in a country aiming to further reopen its economy that has been ravaged by the pandemic. 
Carlito Galvez, a top coronavirus task force official, told a media briefing the deal would be for two million doses. However, Joey Concepcion, a government business adviser, told Reuters the private sector was aiming to procure more than that. 
The deal will augment government efforts to lock in supplies to inoculate around two-thirds of its 108 million population, and is another boost for AstraZeneca, which has already signed supply deals for more than three billion doses of its experimental vaccine developed with the University of Oxford. 
The private firms will pay for the vaccine and donate half of the supply to the government, with the other half to be used to cover employees in the private sector, Concepcion said, without identifying the private companies. 
Galvez, the former general in charge of strategy to fight the coronavirus, said the government had separate negotiations with AstraZeneca, which said on Monday its COVID-19 shot could be up to 90% effective and cheaper to make than some rivals. The vaccine still has to be approved by regulators. 
The government is also in talks with China's Sinovac over a 20-50 million vaccine supply deal, as well as U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Galvez said earlier. 
The Philippines, which has the second largest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Southeast Asia after Indonesia, has gradually lifted coronavirus curbs since May after imposing one of the strictest lockdowns globally. 

The $370 billion economy, among the fastest growing in Asia before the pandemic, fell deeper into recession in the third quarter as curbs continued to limit economic activity.

DUESSELDORF/BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court on Thursday referred a patent licensing dispute between Finnish telecoms equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and German carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) to the European Court of Justice to clarify the law as it applies to supply chains.
The Duesseldorf Regional Court said it would suspend proceedings in Nokia's fight against Daimler over royalties for technology used in navigation systems, vehicle communications and self-driving cars.
The long-running row revolves around standard technologies used in 4G mobile networks that support features in so-called connected cars, and whether Nokia is licensing them on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
The dispute has made waves in Brussels, where the European Commission has stepped in with a proposal to establish whether certain patents are essential to a technology standard and reduce ""friction"" over their use.
Nokia has argued that it has discretion to determine the point in the supply chain at which it issues licences, the Duesseldorf court said in a statement explaining Thursday's ruling. 
Daimler has countered that, under European Union single market rules, Nokia is obliged to offer unlimited licences for all uses relating to standard patents.
In its ruling, the court found Nokia had the right to seek an injunction against Daimler for patent violation. But it also raised the question over whether doing so would represent an abuse of Nokia's dominant market position.
It suspended proceedings pending clarification of a list of related questions it put to the European Court.
The referral of the case to Luxembourg effectively freezes the status quo in which Daimler uses Nokia's patents for free - a blow to the Finnish firm that earns 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) a year from licences.
The Duesseldorf case is one of several between Nokia and Daimler that are working their way through German courts - a typical feature of patent litigation as parties seek a ruling that can establish a favourable precedent.
Thursday's judgment can be appealed.

Investing.com - European stock markets stagnated Thursday, settling into narrow ranges in anticipation of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday after a volatile few days.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded flat, the CAC 40 in France was up less than 0.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.3%, still pressured by Wednesday's dramatic public spending statement by the U.K. government. 
U.K. Finance Minister Rishi Sunak warned on Wednesday that the British economy was on course to shrink by 11% this year, while unveiling plans to borrow around 400 billion pounds this year, amounts not seen before in Britain's peacetime.
There was a muted reaction to news out of Germany late on Wednesday that shied away from tightening restrictions on businesses but which ensured that the country's hospitality industry will remain effectively closed over the holiday period.  Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff Helge Braun said on Thursday some restrictions may have to stay in place until March.  
Earlier Thursday the Robert Koch Institute announced over 32,000 new cases of the coronavirus in Germany, and a third straight day of over 300 deaths.
The slowdown in the German economy was evident earlier in the monthly GfK German Consumer Climate index survey, where the main index fell by more than expected to -6.7 in December, from a revised -3.2 in November. 
The European Central Bank is scheduled to release the minutes of its last policy meeting later in the session.
In corporate news, STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) stock rose 2.7% and Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) stock climbed 0.6%, both to all-time highs, with chipmaker stocks remaining in demand with the work-for-home trend still firmly in vogue.
Elsewhere, Europcar (PA:EUCAR) stock climbed 3.8%, with the car rental company appearing to have avoided bankruptcy.  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) stock fell 1.4% after the French drinks company reported first-half results and consumer goods group Unilever (NYSE:UL) stock rose 1.7% on agreeing to buy U.S.-based vitamin company SmartyPants Vitamins.
Oil prices eased Thursday, after gains overnight on the back of a surprise fall in U.S. crude inventories. The market has risen around 9% this week as traders hope for a prompt rebound in demand next year as vaccines bring the pandemic under control.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration recorded a draw of 754,000 barrels for the week to Nov. 20, compared with forecasts for a 614,000-barrel rise, a report released Wednesday showed.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $45.02 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.5% to $47.80.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Thursday, after the region's biggest economy Germany shied away from a significant tightening of restrictions on business despite posting a new record high for Covid-19 infections.
A meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional governors on Wednesday led to only modest tightenings of rules around gatherings and left all shops open, albeit with a further reduction in customer numbers in some cases. That came as the Robert Koch Institute announced over 32,000 new cases of the coronavirus on Tuesday and a third straight day of over 300 deaths.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
The slowdown in the German economy was evident earlier in the monthly GfK German Consumer Climate index survey, where the main index fell by more than expected to -6.7 in December, from a revised -3.2 in November. 
The European Central Bank is scheduled to release the minutes of its last policy meeting later in the session.
Volumes are expected to be limited as U.S. financial markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Positive news surrounding vaccines to treat Covid-19 has powered the move higher in global stock markets, with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) reporting encouraging results for its candidate on Monday.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech have already filed for emergency use authorization for their drug, which could be granted in a couple of weeks, while  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) expects to submit its filing in the coming weeks after establishing its drug's effectiveness.  
In corporate news, earnings are due from the likes of  Britvic  (LON:BVIC),  Mulberry Group  (LON:MUL) and  Aviva  (LON:AV). In France,  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) reported first-half results while struggling car rental firm Europcar  (PA:EUCAR) said it had reached an agreement with its creditors on a debt restructuring and recapitalization plan that will help it avert bankruptcy.
Oil prices eased slightly Thursday, after gains overnight on the back of a surprise fall in U.S. crude inventories. The market has risen around 9% this week as traders hope for a prompt rebound in demand next year as vaccines bring the pandemic under control.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration recorded a draw of 754,000 barrels for the week to Nov. 20, compared with forecasts for a 614,000-barrel rise, a report released Wednesday showed.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $45.66 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $48.50. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,809.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1933.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",Business rights or human rights? Swiss vote shines spotlight on companies,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - A billboard of a runny-nosed, dour-faced girl framed by Glencore (OTC:GLNCY)'s sprawling zinc mine in Peru greets commuters at Zurich's main train station with an ominous slogan: ""Water contaminated. Child poisoned. Commodities firm liable.""
As the only large mining firm based in Switzerland, Glencore has become the unwilling poster child of a campaign to change the constitution so Swiss companies are liable at home for human rights abuses or environmental harm they cause abroad.
Voters will now choose in a referendum on Sunday between the new proposals and a milder government version that would force firms to step up checks on their overseas operations and supply chains but stops short of extending liability to Swiss courts.
In a campaign that has polarized the nation, the government and multinationals say the Responsible Business Initiative goes too far, while activists, religious groups and various political factions say Switzerland risks falling behind other countries in tackling progressive social and economic issues without it.
Glencore for one says the accusations levelled against it by the campaign are misplaced, and wrong.
Since taking a majority stake in 2017 in the Cerro de Pasco mine pictured in the billboard, Glencore said it had done much to address concerns about pollution from the site which occurred before it took over. 
""It hurts us to see these accusations,"" Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg told Swiss newspaper NZZ.
SwissHoldings, which represents Swiss multinationals such as pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Roche, food company Nestle, and Glencore, says it is self-evident the issues raised by the initiative need to be addressed.
But it says the proposed measures could push up compliance costs and legal risks for companies to the point where they shun some parts of the world, potentially leaving businesses in the hands of firms that may not take the same precautions.
""The worst that could happen would be that people like us who are at the forefront of sustainability ... are forced to move out of certain geographies because of a law that has a good purpose but is poorly executed,"" said Antoine de Saint-Affrique, chief executive of Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut.
""You wouldn't solve the issue, you would make the issue bigger,"" he told reporters.
'BOTTOM OF THE PACK'
Home to some of the world's biggest companies and a major hub for finance and commodities trading, Switzerland has become one of the world's leading commercial centres thanks to its business-friendly laws, regulations and low taxes as well as its history of political neutrality and economic stability.
Yet with three days to go, polls suggest the companies and the government are losing the argument. A survey by Swiss broadcaster SRF showed 57% of those polled backed the responsible business initiative over the government proposal.
The government says it supports the ethos of the initiative but that its version is in line with international standards as it leaves foreign subsidiaries and suppliers economically controlled by multinationals liable for their own damage, usually in foreign courts.
But for Florian Wettstein, a business ethics professor at the University of St. Gallen and co-organiser of the Responsible Business Initiative, it's also about Switzerland keeping up with global progress on sustainable business practices.
""Switzerland tends to fall more towards the bottom of the pack, not just in terms of human rights but also on socially economically progressive issues. The train is going very fast and, without the initiative, we risk missing it once again,"" Wettstein told Reuters.
A European Union proposal could bring in even more stringent liability laws for companies in the bloc while countries such as France, Britain and Canada have already enacted laws targeting liability on all or some human rights in business concerns. 
In Switzerland, the initiative could lead to sharper scrutiny of the country's commodities hub and the institutions that finance it, investors and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Switzerland and abroad told Reuters.
Besides Glencore, rival commodities traders Vitol, Gunvor and Mercuria all have head offices in Switzerland and Trafigura has a major trading operation there.
Anneke Van Woudenberg, executive director of RAID, an NGO in London which exposes corporate wrongdoing, said the Swiss initiative could also have a preventive effect, by giving companies incentives to take more care.
RAID submitted a complaint to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in September against Glencore. 
The complaint says a spill at an oilfield in Chad owned by PetroChad Mangara Ltd, a Glencore subsidiary, caused injuries and environmental damage. Glencore denies wrongdoing.
Under the Swiss initiative, Glencore would have to show that it took all necessary measures to alleviate the spill and any harm caused, if a lawsuit were filed in Switzerland.
""That would be critical to any defence if Chadian citizens came forward claiming human rights harms,"" Van Woudenberg said.
WRONG INSTRUMENTS?
Both sides have poured money into the campaign and leading Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger has estimated it will be the most expensive voting campaign of all time in a country that holds more referendums than any other nation.
If the initiative is passed, large companies and those in high-risk businesses would have to check that activities throughout their supply chains complied with internationally recognised human rights and environmental standards. 
More critically, they would also be liable in Swiss courts if victims can show damage was caused by firms they control.
The initiative would be more progressive than similar rules in France as it places more burden on companies to show they took steps through their due diligence to avoid harm - rather than victims having to prove they didn't.
Denise Laufer, head of economics at SwissHoldings, said its members work with up to 400,000 direct suppliers and a million downstream suppliers globally, and the initiative could increase compliance costs and legal risks by 20% and 25% respectively.
""We clearly support the commitment to protect and strengthen human rights and the environment along the supply chain of our companies,"" she said. ""But these instruments are the wrong ones.""
It's not just the commodities sector that is paying heed.
This month, the chairmen of 16 of Switzerland's biggest industrial, financial and consumer goods companies signed a full-page letter in one of the country's leading dailies, expressing concerns about the initiative. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), the country's second-biggest bank, then took out several more advertisements against the proposal.

""It will be touching on supplier (obligations) which will be impossible or very difficult to fulfil,"" the bank's chief executive, Thomas Gottstein, told reporters. ""It's a proposal which, in my view, is very bad for Switzerland.""

The money is part of a $4.1 billion credit agreement for Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, a unit of Nissan North America, Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) said in a press release on Wednesday.
The money should help the Japanese company sell cars in the world's second-biggest automarket after China by allowing it to provide customers with loans that they can repay in monthly instalments, the export credit agency added in the statement.
The United States ""is an important market for Japanese automobile manufacturers. Sales finance has become an important tool in business strategy"", JBIC said.
""This case provides financial support for Nissan's overseas business development,"" it added.
JBIC has provided loans for overseas sales financing to other automakers, including a $78 million October agreement with Honda Motor Co in Brazil, and one in September for  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp in South Africa. JBIC did not disclose the amount for that deal.
The latest agreement with Nissan is more than three times as much as a $582 million loan extended by JBIC in July to help it finance car sales in Mexico.
A JBIC spokesman said the government export credit agency applied the same lending standards as private banks.
Nissan, Japan's third-largest automaker, is focusing on key markets as it pulls back from the rapid expansion led by ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn. 
It is looking to raise market share with new models in the United States, China and Japan as they rebound from a demand slump triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We have financing from a variety of different ways and JBIC is one of them,"" a Nissan spokeswoman said.
This month, Nissan cut its operating loss forecast for the year to March 2021 by 28%, albeit still to a record of about 340 billion yen ($3.2 billion), helped by a rebound in demand, particularly in China.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 11:00PM ET</span>",Canada police supervisor denies effort to deceive Huawei CFO about indictment,"By Sarah Berman
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The Canadian police supervisor in Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's arrest two years ago denied on Wednesday that police directed border authorities to hide from Meng that she was the target of an arrest warrant while they questioned her. 
Defense lawyer Scott Fenton accused Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sergeant Janice Vander Graaf of telling border officials to hide a sealed indictment and arrest warrant from Meng when she was interrogated on the day of her arrest. 
The documents would have made her aware she was entitled to a lawyer.
""I have no recollection of that happening and I don’t believe that happened,"" Vander Graaf told the court.
Meng, 48, was arrested on Dec. 1, 2018, at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States. She is facing charges of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Her lawyers have argued that U.S. and Canadian authorities coordinated ahead of her arrest, using the extended investigative powers of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to interrogate her without a lawyer present before her arrest and passing the details of her electronic devices to U.S. officials. 
Meng was interviewed for three hours by Canadian border officials before being arrested by the RCMP. Border agents wrote down serial numbers and passcodes for her devices.
Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting the extradition, arguing the abuses of process that her lawyers say occurred violated her civil rights and should invalidate it.
Vander Graaf pushed back against Fenton's claim that she told border officials what to ask Meng, or how to conduct their examination. ""I don’t know what they told Ms. Meng...We didn't tell them what to tell her, or what not to tell her,"" she said. 
SHARING PASSCODES
Previously, CBSA and RCMP officers have been called to testify specifically on the alleged illegal coordination between the forces and whether identifying details about Meng's devices were purposely shared with police and U.S. authorities. 
CBSA officers previously testified in court that they noted Meng's passcodes as part of due diligence while interviewing her then gave them to the RCMP by mistake.
Vander Graaf testified on Wednesday that neither she nor any fellow officers requested the passcodes from the CBSA.
Witness testimony is set to last until Friday, with the potential for two to three more days scheduled in December.
Diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing have deteriorated since Meng's arrest. China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges days later.

Meng's extradition hearing is expected to wrap up in April 2021.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, with investors digesting weak U.S. economic data and an uptick in COVID-19 assets. Stocks took a breather from the massive rally that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise above 30,000 for the first time and all-time highs for global equities.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.47% by 11:13 PM ET (3:13 AM GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.29%, with the Bank of Korea keeping its key interest rate unchanged at 0.50, as expected. The country is battling a surge of COVID-19 cases, with 583 daily cases reported as of Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.36%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.21%. Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s policy address, her longest so far, failed to impress over the lack of eye-catching measures.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.06% while the Shenzhen Component slid 1.10%.
Data released on Wednesday showed that the U.S.’s GDP grew 33.1% quarter-on-quarter during the third quarter, missing the 33.2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com by a sliver. Growth remained unchanged from the second quarter, however.
The same data also showed 778,000 jobless claims for the past week, higher than the forecast 730,000 claims and the 748,000 claims submitted during the previous week.
Some investors suggested that this was a much-needed, short-term correction.
“In the very short-term, there’s a strong argument that we’re due for a pullback in risk assets: market internals are looking overstretched, the technicals suggest slightly overbought conditions and expectations of some pretty heavy end of month portfolio rebalancing looks likely to curtail upside momentum in stocks,” IG Australia markets analyst Kyle Rodda told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting did not foresee any immediate adjustments to current policy. However, the minutes did indicate discussion during the Nov. 4-5 meeting about providing more guidance on its bond-buying strategy “fairly soon”.
Progress towards a COVID-19 vaccine and a peaceful transition to the incoming President Joe Biden’s administration in the U.S. continue to boost investor sentiment for the long term, however.
“We believe the market rally can continue from here powered by all the positive vaccine news, more political clarity with a peaceful White House transition and with more stimulus to come … we are already seeing a strong rotation into cyclical and reopening trades with the vaccine news and we expect this trend to continue,” UBS Global Wealth Management managing director Xi Qiao told Bloomberg.
“Sentiment overall remains very bullish … the hope for a return to normal economic activity in 2021 is giving the markets all it needs to continue take on risk, with only a completely unforeseen event likely to kill that trend from here,” IG Australia ‘s Rodda added.
However, other investors were more cautious.
“I think a lot of people got ahead of themselves imagining that the recovery was taking shape. To me the recovery isn’t taking shape until we have a viable vaccine,” Cantor Fitzgerald Treasury analyst and trader Justin Lederer told Reuters.
On the COVID-19 front, the number of global COVID-19 cases surpassed 60 million as of Nov. 26, with over 12.7 million cases in the U.S. alone, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

TORONTO/ANCHORAGE (Reuters) - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday issued its final decision denying a key water permit for the contentious Pebble Mine in Alaska, putting the project's future in doubt even as the company behind it plans to appeal the decision.
The mine, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits, has been through a roller coaster of regulation over the past 13 years. Republican President Donald Trump revived the project early in his term after the Obama administration had blocked it, but opposition from prominent politicians saying it would harm the state's billion dollar salmon industry prompted the about-face of the outgoing Trump administration.
The Army Corps denied the Clean Water Act permit because the plan submitted by the Pebble Limited Partnership detailing how it would handle the project's waste in the ecologically sensitive area did not comply with Clean Water Act guidelines.
Colonel Damon Delarosa, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Alaska, said in a statement the agency had concluded that the proposed project was ""contrary to the public interest.""
The Pebble Mine Partnership said it was ""dismayed"" by the decision and its Canadian parent company, Northern Dynasty Minerals (NYSE:NAK), vowed to lodge an appeal within 60 days.
If built, the mine would produce 70 million tons of gold, molybdenum and copper ore a year and create a pit 1,970 feet (600 meters) deep in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. Opponents said the project threatened a world-class sockeye salmon fishery, putting more than $1 billion of revenue and over 10,000 jobs at risk.
The Trump administration had moved closer in July to approving the mine's permit, reversing a decision by Democratic then-President Barack Obama.
But a prominent group of Republicans, including Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., have publicly voiced opposition, saying the mine would destroy areas of good fishing and hunting.
Pebble Mine Partnership Chief Executive John Shively said in a statement the company worked closely with the Corps of Engineers to ensure the project included necessary safeguards and slammed the decision as political.
""It is very disconcerting to see political influence in this process at the eleventh hour,"" he said.
In August, the U.S. government had given developers 90 days to explain how they would offset damage to wetlands and popular fishing sites amid rising opposition to the project by prominent Republicans.
West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, the top Democrat on the Senate natural resources committee, praised the decision, saying he was not convinced the company could protect the surrounding fisheries.
""I understand the important role mining plays in our economy, but the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the project did not come near close enough to assuring me this world-class sockeye salmon fishery, which generates $1.5 billion each year and supports 14,000 jobs, would be protected,” he said.
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) also welcomed the announcement but warned that permit denial was not the last word.
""A permit denial leaves the door open for future mining in Bristol Bay under more politically favorable circumstances,"" the group said in a statement. It added that President-elect Joe Biden opposes the project.
The United Tribes of Bristol Bay, which represents 15 area tribal governments, and other mine opponents said they would seek permanent protections for the region.
NRDC senior advocate Taryn Kiekow Heimer said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has authority under a rarely used section of the Clean Water Act to block development.
President-elect Joe Biden said in August he opposes the mine and as president would ""protect Bristol Bay."" Transition team spokesman Jamal Brown said his position remains the same.
Northern Dynasty said the Pebble project would provide a secure supply of strategic minerals, in line with the Biden campaign's goal to boost domestic production of metals used to make electric vehicles, solar panels and other products crucial to his climate plan.

Shares of the Vancouver-based miner fell about 50% in trading after news of the permit denial.

Scheduled to begin with Wednesday's night shift, Verdi is demanding better pay and working conditions. Verdi has been organising strikes at Amazon in Germany - the company's biggest market after the United States - since 2013, most recently last month during its ""Prime Day"" promotional event.
An Amazon spokesman said at the time that the company offered ""excellent"" salaries, with benefits and working conditions comparable with other important employers.
The U.S. retail giant has seen sales soar globally as restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus sent consumers online, making it difficult for some bricks-and-mortar shops to compete.
Verdi argues this has strengthened the case for higher wages, adding workers were not sufficiently protected against the spread of the coronavirus.

Last week, Amazon bowed to government pressure in France to postpone its local Black Friday event by a week to help local shopkeepers struggling with a nationwide lockdown.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian aviation regulator ANAC on Wednesday lifted the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, following U.S. clearance of the jets for flight, after a redesign prompted by two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
On Tuesday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) set out conditions for putting the grounded jets back into service, including new training and updating MCAS software implicated in the crashes.
Brazil's top regulator said Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, the only airline to operate the model in Brazil, is implementing the required measures to resume flights.
Gol said last week it could resume flying Boeing 737 MAX jets by year-end.
Some regulators have been waiting for EASA’s decision before lifting their own measures as the 20-month Boeing safety crisis tested confidence in U.S. aviation leadership.
ANAC superintendent of airworthiness José Roberto Honorato said the Brazilian regulator would apply the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) conditions for bringing the MAX back to service and downplayed differences between regulators.
EASA differed from the FAA in saying pilots could stop a “stick shaker” alarm from vibrating if it went off accidentally, halting a distraction thought to have added to the problems of the two crews in handling the fatal flights.
It also issued one temporary restriction on autopilot use, unlike the United States. 
""Those differences are not unusual, especially in a complex aircraft project like the 737 MAX,"" he told Reuters. ""We are not going to have differences to the FAA.”
EASA represents the 27 European Union countries plus four other nations including Norway, which has 92 of the aircraft on order. Until Dec. 31, EASA also represents Britain, which left the EU bloc in January.
Canada is expected to lift the ban as well, but uncertainty remains about China, the largest market for the jet and the first to ban it in March 2019.

U.S. flights are due to resume on Dec. 29, while in Europe the formal ungrounding will take place from mid-January.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index closed lower on Wednesday as mounting U.S. layoffs in the wake of new mandated lockdowns to contain surging COVID-19 infections dampened investor risk appetite.
The index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated from record closing highs, pulled lower by cyclicals and small caps that drove the rally earlier in the week.
Pandemic-resilient tech and tech-adjacent market leaders helped keep the Nasdaq afloat.
""It's a growth day, flipping back the other way away from value,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""It's this ongoing struggle between the virus and the vaccine.""
""There's a reality setting in that while the vaccine will start being distributed fairly quickly, the virus isn't go away quickly and therefore the timeline for economic improvement is getting pushed out.""
A wide range of data released in advance of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday was dominated by a second consecutive week of unexpected jobless claims increases, suggesting that new restrictions to combat spiking coronavirus cases could hobble the struggling labor market's recovery.
""The economic data is not good, and we know it won't be good for some time given this new wave of the virus,"" Ghriskey added.
The market appeared to be replaying the previous two weeks, which began with rallies driven by promising vaccine news but pivoted back to stay-at-home plays on near-term pandemic realities and lack of new fiscal stimulus.
Still, the vaccine developments and removal of uncertainties surrounding the U.S. presidential election have driven Wall Street indexes to record closing highs, and put the S&P 500 on course for its best November ever.
Market participants believe U.S. stocks have more room to climb. A recent Reuters poll showed analysts believe the S&P 500 will gain 9% between now and the end of 2021. The index has surged about 66% since the coronavirus-led crash in March and is up about 12% so far this year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 173.77 points, or 0.58%, to 29,872.47; the S&P 500 lost 5.76 points, or 0.16%, to 3,629.65; and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.08 points, or 0.47%, at 12,094.40.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 seven ended the session in the red, with energy suffering the largest percentage loss.
The economically sensitive banking sector lost ground, with the S&P 500 Banks index shedding 0.7%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which surpassed $500 billion in market capitalization on Tuesday, extended its gain by 3.4% even after the electric-car maker recalled about 9,500 vehicles.
The company also plans to start manufacturing electric vehicle chargers in China starting next year, according to documents it submitted to Shanghai authorities.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and eight new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.76 billion shares, compared with the 11.17 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden will come under immense pressure from progressives in the Democratic party to cut the defense budget once he takes office in January.
But defense spending is unlikely to be cut since it supports countless U.S. jobs during the coronavirus recession. 
In three years, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has increased defense spending 19% from $619.5 billion to $740 billion.
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats in U.S. House of Representatives have called for a reduction in military spending to combat the coronavirus.
""Even if Democrats end up taking the Senate, I don't think they'll want to start putting in cuts for defense right away,"" said Todd Harrison the director of Defense Budget Analysis at Center for Strategic and International Studies adding, ""because we'll still be in, or slowly emerging from, this recession.""
Harrison said sudden changes could mean job losses in the lead up to mid-term elections. The possibility of cutting defense jobs could hurt vulnerable Democrats seeking reelection at a time when their majority in the House is already razor thin.
For that reason deep defense cuts may not be popular with many moderate Democrats either, a former Pentagon official added. The economic impacts of a weapons order are far-flung. Experts say https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arms-jobs-exclusive/exclusive-defense-firms-see-only-hundreds-of-new-u-s-jobs-from-saudi-mega-deal-idUSKCN1N40DM each defense job often indirectly contributes to three or four additional jobs in a community, making them the type of jobs politicians will go out of their way to protect.
The defense industry also does not see lower budgets any time soon. Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Chief Financial Officer Toby O'Brien told Reuters following their recent earnings announcement, ""You are kind of looking at 2022-ish time frame if there were to be a downward adjustment.""
The Pentagon's own budget projections ""would be relatively flat through 2025, averaging about $707 billion per year in 2021 dollars,"" the Congressional Budget Office said in a September analysis.
The deep ties to the defense industry of current candidates to become Secretary of Defense also suggests radical cuts are unlikely. 
Michele Flournoy, a former top U.S. Department of Defense official has a deep history inside the Beltway working with defense contractors, including a current stint on the board of Booz Allen (NYSE:BAH) Hamilton. 
Another contender, former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, sits on the board of defense contractor  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co.
If a smaller budget were adopted, the first items any administration would put on the chopping block include Army troop levels and the number of multi-billion dollar Navy aircraft carrier groups deployed.

That assessment came out of a mid-October, Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments/Ronald Reagan Institute exercise where a bipartisan group including staff from Capitol Hill and former Pentagon officials who will influence a Biden administration envisioned those cuts if smaller budgets came to pass, people familiar with the exercises said.

The investigators were undertaking a broad review of the senator's trading around the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic for possible evidence of insider trading, the NYT said, citing four people with knowledge of the case. 
Perdue, who is seeking reelection in one of two U.S. Senate races in Georgia, sold more than $1 million worth of stock in Cardlytics earlier this year, where he once served on the board, according to the report.
Six weeks later, its share price tumbled when the company's founder announced he would step down as chief executive and the firm said its future sales would be worse than expected, the NYT reported.
According to the NYT report, Perdue had bought back a substantial portion of the shares that he sold after the company's stock price bottomed out in March at $29.
""The New York Times report of the exonerating evidence reconfirms that the baseless accusations leveled against Senator Perdue were nothing more than lies to push a categorically false narrative for political gain,"" said John Burke, communications director of the senator's campaign.
Cardlytics did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. banks on Wednesday pushed back on a proposal to bar them from snubbing controversial business sectors, such as oil and gas giants, in an unlikely turn of events that has pitched Wall Street against one of the Trump administration's industry-friendly regulators. 
In a letter to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) asked for more time to assess the ""unprecedented"" proposal and requested to see data the agency used to assess its economic impact. 
The letter was signed by three other major Washington bank groups, which combined represent dozens of major lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Last week, the Comptroller proposed a rule ensuring “fair access” to bank services for all types of legal businesses, based on a specific customer risk-assessment rather than broad client categories. It applies to the largest banks that may wield pricing power over sectors of the economy. 
The proposal aims to address concerns among Republicans and business groups that oil and gas majors are being deprived of funding as banks come under increasing investor pressure to curb lending to controversial sectors. 
""It’s a completely unworkable government mandate designed to address a particular political problem but would by its terms require every covered bank to offer every financial product to every business and consumer in the country,"" John Court, general counsel at BPI said. He said the agency doesn't appear to have the legal authority to propose such a sweeping rule.

Banks have a relatively short 45-day period to review the proposal if Brooks, who is seen by Democrats and consumer groups as too industry-friendly, doesn't permit more time. 
Two industry executives said they believed Brooks, who is expected to be nominated of for the permanent Comptroller role shortly, is trying to fast-track the rule before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January. 
""Given that this rule formalizes guidance that has been issued and reinforced by the OCC since at least 2014, we are surprised that the banks are surprised,"" said a spokesman for Brooks, adding the agency looked forward to reviewing all comments.

Investing.com - The Dow slipped Wednesday, after a record surge a day earlier, as a wobble in the jobs market in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases prompted investors to hit pause on value stocks. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.58%, or  173 points, after closing above the 30,000 level on Tuesday. The S&P 500 was down 0.14%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.47%.
The U.S Labor Department reported that 778,00 people filed for unemployment insurance, up 30,000 from the prior week's 748,000, and well above expectations for 730,000 claims.
That was the second-consecutive week of rising claims for the first time since July 25, suggesting the impact of new restrictions in the parts of the U.S. and a lack of stimulus are taking a toll on the labor market.
""Stay-at-home measures, school closures, and limitations for businesses to operate are going to lead to more layoffs over the winter. It is going to get worse before it gets better,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The weaker jobs data arrived on the heels of data showing personal spending and durable goods orders increased more than expected, but some warn the impact of rising infections will likely keep a lid on the pace of the recovery.
""Cooler temperatures, which shuttered outdoor venues, a drop in unemployment benefits and a jump in COVID cases put a damper on spending and confidence,"" said. Diane Swonk, Senior Economist at Grant Thornton. 
The slew of data prompted investors to hit pause on value stocks, which tend to move in tandem with the pace of the economy.

Oil price rose more than 1% on data showing an unexpected draw in U.S. weekly inventories.

“Many participants judged that the Committee might want to enhance its guidance for asset purchases fairly soon,” the minutes said.

890,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon and Total in talks over Mozambique LNG resource-sharing deal - sources,"By Helen Reid, Emma Rumney and Stephen Jewkes
JOHANNESBURG/MILAN (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Total are in negotiations over their massive LNG projects in Mozambique, with each seeking to extract more gas from a shared field that straddles the two developments and cut costs, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement. 
The field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects. 
The volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 ""unitisation"" - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and France's Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said. 
The companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.
Across the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last year's record level of approvals for plants.
Success in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now don't expect until early 2022. 
The FID on Total's $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.
The current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year. 
It allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the ""straddling"" reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development. 
Now Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projects' annual LNG production, according to the sources. 
""They want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,"" said one of the sources. 
Asked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: ""As a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.""
""ExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,"" he added.
Total said the operators of the two projects ""continue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of development"".
Mozambique's state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reuters' questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nation's energy development.
The INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions. 
BOOSTING PRODUCTION
A Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxon's Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.
Instead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.
This would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovuma's phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years. 
Mozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase. 
Reuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to. 
A fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output. 
In April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.
The Mozambique government has said it expects Exxon's FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023. 
In response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: ""We continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.""
Area 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNG's licence area. 
SHADOW OF INSURGENCY
While Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.
It would mean the company wouldn't produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic. 
However the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projects' doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments. 
Analysts warn the group's capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.
One of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.

""The investment will not be viable without security,"" the official said.

(Reuters) - If you traded a stock in the past week, there's a fair chance it was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
Shares in the electric car maker led by CEO Elon Musk rose almost 3% on Wednesday and have now surged 40% since Nov. 16, when it was announced Tesla would join the S&P 500 in December. Investors rushed to buy shares ahead of index funds that will be forced to acquire over $50 billion of its shares.
One of Wall Street's most loved - and hated - stocks, Tesla was already the U.S. stock market's most traded companies by average daily value, but trading has surged in recent sessions, along with Tesla's stock price. 
""It's been crazy. Since Tesla's (announced) inclusion in the S&P, you've had a lot of managers out there that didn't own enough of it having to buy more,"" said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of trading at Wedbush Securities, in Los Angeles. 
Retail investors using apps like Robinhood are also responsible for much of the recent volume spike, Manuelian added.

Traders bought and sold an average of nearly $26 billion of Tesla shares per session over the five days ending on Tuesday, accounting for almost 8% of all stock traded on U.S. exchanges, according to Refinitiv data. That is more than the combined value of trades in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the same period.
At about halfway through Wednesday's session, traders had exchanged $20 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to Refinitiv.
Up over 400% in 2020, Tesla has become by far the world's most valuable automaker, despite production that is a fraction of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) or General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Over the past year, Tesla has averaged over $16 billion a day in trades, followed by Apple, at about $14 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Trading in Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO Inc has also surged in recent weeks, with its shares nearly doubling in November. 

Including NIO, trading of stocks in the nascent electric vehicle industry reached an average of $38 billion a day in the past five sessions, accounting for 12% of all trading on U.S. exchanges.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cloud-based software company Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) is in talks to acquire workplace messaging app Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc as it seeks to expand its offerings to businesses, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Salesforce's bid comes as Slack struggles to fully capitalize on the switch to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic in the face of fierce competition from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Teams and other workplace apps 
Slack shares ended trading on Tuesday at $29.57, well below the $42 high they reached on their first day of trading last year.
Salesforce sees the potential acquisition as a logical extension of its enterprise offerings, the sources said. The price it was offering for Slack could not be learned, though one of the sources said Salesforce would pay cash for the deal, rather than use its stock as currency. 
If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced before Slack reports quarterly earnings on Dec. 9, one of the sources added. 
Neither Slack nor Salesforce responded to requests for comment.
Slack Technologies shares jumped 24% to $36.58, giving the company a market capitalization of $21 billion, while Salesforce fell 2.7% after the Wall Street Journal first reported that the two companies had held deal talks. 
Slack has benefited from companies relying more on information technology systems to keep their workers connected during the pandemic. 
Its app has been installed about 12.6 million times so far this year, up approximately 50% from the same period in 2019, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.
But the economic fallout of the virus outbreak has forced Slack to give discount and payment concessions to many of its customers who have had to make cost cuts. 
Seeking to save money, some companies have also been switching to Teams, which comes with many of Microsoft's office software packages.
""I think Microsoft Teams has been able to capitalize on the opportunity better than Slack, partly because they give it away for free as a bundle,"" said Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at research firm DA Davidson and Co.
""Now Slack realizes that they might be able to get greater penetration as part of a larger company.""
Slack's billing growth, a key indicator of future revenue, slowed in the three months to the end of July.
Salesforce meanwhile has been thriving financially during the pandemic. It raised its annual revenue forecast in August as the pandemic spurred demand for its online business software that supports remote work and commerce.

Salesforce has been beefing up its cloud business through acquisitions and had spent more than $16 billion last year to fend off competition from rivals such as  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and German competitor SAP.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Record hospitalizations and a surging death toll failed to keep Americans from traveling a day before the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, raising fears that the unchecked spread under way is a prelude to further contagion at Christmastime.
Daily U.S. deaths from COVID-19 surpassed 2,000 for the first time since May on Tuesday and hospitalizations reached a record 88,000 on Wednesday as the country recorded 2.3 million new infections in the past two weeks alone.
Steep surges in cases typically result in a rising death toll weeks later. Coronavirus deaths reached 2,157 on Tuesday - one person every 40 seconds - with another 170,000 people infected, as millions of Americans disregarded official warnings and traveled for Thanksgiving.
Daliza Rodriguez, a 33-year-old childhood educator, was traveling to Texas from New York's LaGuardia Airport on Wednesday.
""We know we're taking a risk but we want to see the family and it has been a long time...so we want to see them and have fun,"" she said.
Nearly 1 million passengers a day have been screened at airport security checkpoints for the past week, with Sunday's total of 1.047 million being the highest number since the early days of the pandemic in mid-March. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged people to keep Thanksgiving gatherings as small as possible and stressed the need to ""hang in there a bit longer"" on wearing masks, maintaining distance and avoiding crowds, especially indoors.
""If we do those things, we're going to get through it. So that's my final plea before the holiday,"" Fauci told the ABC News program ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday.
Families with university students have been forced to evaluate the risk of reuniting for Thanksgiving.
Francesca Wimer, a student at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University in Illinois, flew home to Washington wearing an N95 mask and a face shield and checked into a hotel for 14 days, quarantining to protect her parents and grandparents.
""She was returning to a vulnerable set of people. We didn't trust that a test was enough,"" said her mother, Cynthia Wimer.
Others are just staying put.
Luke Burke, studying at Syracuse University in upstate New York, was planning to spend Thanksgiving with his family in New Jersey until his roommate tested positive last week.
""I'm sorry I can't be there with my parents, but it's the right thing to do,"" Burke said.
Across New York City, lines at COVID-19 testing sites wrapped around the block on Wednesday, video on Twitter showed. Bundled New Yorkers queued up outside clinics in Astoria, Queens, and Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, starting early as 8 a.m. 
MG Robinson, a contract analyst at the Office of New York City Comptroller, waited in line for seven hours outside a CityMD clinic in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn on Wednesday. 
""I woke up at 6 (a.m.) and I got here at 6:30...I couldn't even see the front of the line,"" said 30-year-old Robinson who is planning to gather with a small group of family members on Thanksgiving. 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who said his own daughter will not be joining him from out-of-state for Thanksgiving, urged families to follow suit.
""This is not a normal Thanksgiving, and to act like it's a normal Thanksgiving is to deny the reality of every health expert in the nation,"" Cuomo told reporters on Wednesday.
Cuomo warned people not to disregard social distancing measures on account of recent vaccine development progress, noting that it would take a long time before the vaccine is distributed widely.
The first vaccines could be weeks away with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration due to rule Dec. 10 on whether to approve  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine for emergency use.
The U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed program plans to release 6.4 million COVID-19 vaccine doses nationwide in an initial distribution as soon as one is approved.

If all goes well, 40 million doses will be distributed by the end of the year, they said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - SpaceX will continue beta testing its satellite-based broadband service Starlink into next year, the company said late Tuesday, indicating commercial service would not likely be offered in 2020 as previously planned.
Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX, Elon Musk's private space exploration company, has launched nearly 900 Starlink satellites to orbit since 2019 with the goal of offering high-speed Internet to rural locations globally.
Musk has said the Starlink service will be a crucial source of funding for his broader plans, like developing the super heavy-lift Starship rocket to fly paying customers to the moon and eventually trying to colonize Mars.
""At our current pace, we expect to expand our beta in a notable way very early next year, in the late January - February timeframe,"" SpaceX engineer Kate Tice said during a livestream on Tuesday, before launching the company's 16th batch of Starlink satellites.
A SpaceX spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
SpaceX in October invited hundreds of people in rural states like Washington, Wisconsin and Idaho to partake in its ""Better Than Nothing Beta"" trial, opening the door to those who signed up to buy and test the company's $499 setup kit and pay $99 per-month for internet service.
In filings with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the company had anticipated offering commercial service by the end of 2020, then ""rapidly expand to near global coverage of the populated world in 2021."" 
In November, SpaceX got approval from Canadian authorities to start beta testing Starlink in the country, enabling a ""fairly wide public beta"" in southern Canada.

“Powell and I speak multiple times a week. We would both characterize that we have an excellent relationship,” Mnuchin said in an interview Wednesday. Treasury and the Fed have been “incredibly coordinated on the execution of the Cares Act facilities,” he said, referring to the federal stimulus law.
Mnuchin’s comments come after the top two U.S. economic policy makers appeared to clash last week over whether to preserve emergency lending programs designed to shore up the economy.
Mnuchin released a letter to Powell last week demanding the return of money the government provided the central bank so it could lend to certain markets in times of stress. Minutes later, the Fed issued a statement urging that “the full suite” of emergency measures be maintained into 2021.
But Mnuchin insisted Wednesday there is no rift, and that he is merely following the law.
“Powell and I had been speaking for weeks on this, it wasn’t a new or sudden issue,” he said. “I spent two weeks in the Senate and sat with Senate staff and drafted word by word by word. There is a clear date that is the expiration.”
The Cares Act states that “on December 31, 2020, the authority provided” to the Fed to “make new loans, loan guarantees, or other investments shall terminate.”
The Fed did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Lawmakers’ reaction to Mnuchin’s announcement last week was split along party lines. Republican senators including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Pat Toomey supported the move, reiterating that Mnuchin was ending what were meant to be temporary initiatives.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has accused the Treasury chief of undermining the incoming Biden administration.
President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Treasury, former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, is seen remaining flexible with her former colleagues at the Fed in restarting those facilities. But to do so in the wake of Mnuchin’s move, she would need authorization from Congress.
With corporate bond markets functioning well, that may not be a high priority, and fighting Senate Republicans on the programs could burn up both time and political capital.
Mnuchin worked across party lines in March to help swiftly pass the $2.2 trillion Cares Act in March as the government-induced economic shutdown was crumbling the U.S. economy.
The legislation authorized $500 billion for the Treasury Department for direct loans to companies in the airline sector, and to use as backstops for emergency lending facilities at the Fed. At the time, the coronavirus pandemic was expected to cause roughly two to three months of economic disruption, with its full impact unforeseen.
Mnuchin worked to quickly shovel hundreds of billions of dollars through loans to mom-and-pop companies, unemployment insurance and aid to state and local governments.
Here’s Where $881 Billion in U.S. Aid Went in Month of Spending
However Democrats said at the time they were worried that Mnuchin would use what they dubbed a “slush fund” with little oversight.
Now, Mnuchin noted, he is facing criticism for returning the unspent funds to Congress.
“The irony of this is, you have Democrats who couldn’t believe I was given what they said was a $500 billion blank check. It obviously wasn’t. But now that I’m being a good steward of the capital and following both the literal reading and the spirit of the law, I’m being criticized for being political,” Mnuchin said.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>","Reduced to meeting online, airlines vow to keep fighting","By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - For an industry that prides itself on bringing people together, it was a particular humiliation for airlines to have to resort to video conferencing for their annual industry meeting this week - and not one they are ready to repeat.
Brought to their knees by the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling to convince governments to replace quarantines with testing, airlines turned to veteran IAG (LON:ICAG) boss Willie Walsh to lead industry association IATA from next April. 
""My style will be different from what has gone before me,"" said Walsh, known to British Airways unions as something of a bruiser, as he thanked outgoing IATA chief Alexandre de Juniac.
""I too am a businessman and I too understand how governments operate, but I'm even more unhappy and more critical of how they get things done (and) how they've failed to get things done.""
Without a doubt, this will be Walsh's biggest challenge yet.
In three days of media briefings around the meeting, IATA further downgraded its financial outlook for the sector as a second wave of coronavirus cases in Europe and the United States points to more heavy losses and bankruptcies.
That may test Walsh's aversion to bailouts and subsidies. Little was said about further aid at the meeting, which ended on Wednesday, though de Juniac called days earlier for $80 billion in support on top of the $160 billion received.
Despite vaccines promising eventual relief, executives worry they might reduce the immediate pressure on policymakers to reopen travel safely.
In the short term, meanwhile, they are having to roll out apps designed to manage health certificates and the broader chaos.
Governments may also use air travel to encourage vaccine uptake - drawing airlines into a political minefield. Australia's Qantas said it expected to require all passengers to show vaccination certificates.
""We know in some countries we have some difficulties to convince the population to be vaccinated,"" de Juniac told Reuters before the meeting - warning that any general requirement could effectively bar people from travel.
For airlines that survive COVID-19, intense environmental pressures still lie in wait, as several executives observed; ""flight-shaming"" has not gone away.
In Europe, the industry is battling new green taxes and regulation while facing higher investment demands for cleaner aircraft and fuel technology development.
Bailouts and borrowing have swollen global airlines' debt by more than half to $651 billion, IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said - a mountain that will undermine their ability to fund more efficient new aircraft, let alone green innovation. 
Underlining the financial strain, Norwegian Air became the latest crisis casualty when it filed for Irish bankruptcy protection days before the meeting.
""Airlines are setting themselves up for horrendous balance sheet structures,"" said James Halstead, managing partner at consulting firm Aviation Strategy, who believes airlines will continue to struggle to influence policy.

""The people in the driving seat are health authorities - it's a massive health crisis, so they don't want people moving around,"" Haltead said. ""The feeling is that aviation can be tackled later.""

The blue chip index and the S&P 500 got off to a negative start after an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims signaled the labor market recovery was stalling amid a rise in COVID-19 infections. Investors also brushed off the report showing a half-percent rise in consumer spending last month. 
Tech was about the only bright spot, nudging the Nasdaq higher in early trading. But energy, financials and industrials dragged the Dow and S&P 500 lower. 
Multivariate economist Max Wolff has been skeptical of the market’s recent surge. 
 “I think we’re partying for something that hasn’t quite arrived with a tough intermediate period. And I don’t think the market has the earnings or the earnings growth to justify this.” 
The biggest decliner on the broader index: Gap. Shares plunged by nearly a fifth after the apparel retailer’s quarterly profit fell short of analysts estimates. A pivot to online sales drove up marketing and shipping costs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, the billionaire chief executive of DoubleLine investment firm, said in a pre-election webcast on Monday that he is bearish on long-dated bonds like the 30-year Treasury.
The 30-year yield (US30YT=RR) has risen about 214 basis points since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced in late August that the central bank would allow inflation to run higher for a period in order to average the central bank's target rate of 2%. 
On Monday's webcast alongside David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research, Gundlach said he was skeptical of the value of long-dated bonds, but that investors were still expected to hold them to hedge against the risk of deflation. 
Longer-dated bonds are sensitive to inflation expectations as rising consumer prices can erode their value.
In a tweet on Friday https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1322288407293366276, Gundlach noted that since August the 30-year bond has been rising at an annual rate of 200 basis points. If that trend persists, he said, the bonds' year-over-year return in August 2021 will be approximately minus 35%.
Gundlach is not alone in his skepticism. Speculative short positions in the 30-year bond have in October twice hit record highs, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
Investors should however be protecting against inflation in their portfolios, said Gundlach, and said that Bitcoin and gold were good hedges against that risk. 

Gundlach, who predicted Donald Trump's victory in 2016, believes the president will be re-elected on Nov. 3, though he has less conviction this time than previously.

903,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 12:16PM ET</span>",Vaccine is no shot in the arm yet for emerging markets,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging markets have surged on the prospect that coronavirus vaccines will become widely available soon, but analysts think the rally is overplayed given the risks from slower rollouts for some economies that could delay their recoveries.
Several vaccines are now close to fruition, including at least two produced in emerging markets Russia and China, but budgetary constraints in paying for them and challenges in storage and distribution cloud the outlook for many economies.
Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, India and Russia are tipped to be among the first to receive a boost from the arrival of vaccines, but in most emerging markets demand may outstrip supply, analysts say. 
The logistical headache of transporting supplies to some of the more rural parts of large economies like India and poorer countries may also present obstacles.
""I do think the vaccine 'relief rally' for EM is overdone and is more sentiment than reality driven,"" said Beth Morrissey, managing partner of emerging markets-focused Kleiman International Consultants.
""While I believe an array of possible vaccines will be approved for global use within months, the logistical challenges seem even more difficult than vaccine production to stop the spread.""
Emerging markets had a rough ride early on in the pandemic in February and March but investors have regained some confidence. Flows into emerging debt surged to their fourth highest in a single week in the week to Nov. 18. MSCI's EM equity and currency indexes are close to 34 and 30 month highs, respectively.
But the markets may not have fully accounted for the problems some countries face in getting populations vaccinated.
""Clearly, if emerging economies cannot manage to have a majority of the population receive vaccinations, the impact on consumer spending because of continued need for partial lockdowns and subdued travel activities will be more severe than so far priced in,"" said Tatjana Puhan, managing director at asset manager TOBAM.
Emerging markets need more good news on vaccines in the coming months, especially before the southern hemisphere winter, said Simon Quijano-Evans, Gemcorp Capital's chief economist. For the whole world to achieve herd immunity, there was still a deficit of at least 1.6 billion vaccines in 2021, he said.
FRIDGE FIX
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has said it will have as many as 200 million doses of its vaccine by the end of 2020. The vaccine is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures. 
Brazil, Mexico, India and Indonesia are likely to be the big beneficiaries of the AstraZeneca vaccine among emerging markets,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a research note.
But keeping any of the vaccines at stable temperatures may prove challenging.
India is looking to five locally-tested vaccine candidates as well as Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and AstraZeneca's offering.. Investment research group TS Lombard said the country is also trying to increase its roughly 28,000 refrigeration units and 700 refrigerated trucks. 
""Even if you look at India, which in recent years has made vast strides in healthcare and pharma, how can they possibly transport a vaccine that needs refrigeration, not even considering the ones that need to be stored at 94 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, across 3.28 million square kilometres quickly enough to inoculate enough of the 1.38 billion population?"" said Morrissey. 
Peru may also face difficulties, analysts say, as it has so far only secured the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine, which needs to be shipped and stored at -70C, although the government said earlier this month that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and AstraZeneca laboratories would begin trials of coronavirus vaccines.
""With the world's third-highest rate of death from Covid-19, Peruvians will be hoping that the cold chain requirements of the vaccine they have bought are able to be relaxed,"" Paul Domjan, senior contributing analyst at investment research group Tellimer, wrote in a note this week.
Russia, along with China, appear well placed with the only major home-grown vaccine research programmes in emerging markets, Domjan wrote. 
Both these countries will also ship some of their supplies overseas.
The poorest parts of emerging markets should be covered by the COVAX global distribution scheme, co-led by the World Health Organization.
Even so, the positive boost for emerging markets in general from the vaccine may be more than a year away. 
Citi analysts said vaccine supply may fall short of demand in most EM countries in 2021, with vaccines starting to lift most economies in the first half of 2022, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 in developed countries.
""It may not be until the end of 2022 or even later that sufficient vaccines are available to lower-income EM economies with strained fiscal resources and limited capacity for domestic production,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note this week.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has a base case scenario for herd immunity to be reached in most emerging markets between late 2021 and mid-2022, with richer economies and those with greater vaccine supply reaching it sooner.

904,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",Tech giants face fines or even break-up if they breach new rules: EU's Breton,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Tech giants that break new EU rules aimed at curbing their powers could face fines, be ordered to change their practices or even be forced to break up their European businesses, the bloc's digital chief Thierry Breton said on Wednesday.
Breton's comments come two weeks before he is due to present draft rules known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA), which are likely to affect big U.S. players Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The DSA will force tech companies to explain how their algorithms work, open up their advertising archives to regulators and researchers, and do more to tackle hate speech, harmful content and counterfeit products on their platforms.
The DMA takes aim at online gatekeepers with a list of requirements, such as sharing certain kinds of data with rivals and regulators; and outlawed practices, such as favouring their own services. It will also include a range of sanctions.
""We start with a fine, then you have a bigger fine, then you may have a temporary remedy, specific remedies, then you may have at the end of the day, what we have also in the competition rules, structural separation,"" Breton told reporters during an online briefing.
""So from fines to separations, but of course only on the European market,"" he said. 
Forcing companies to break up would be a last resort, said Breton, the EU's internal market commissioner.
""Structural separation is not an objective, not my objective, it is just again to make sure we have also means to act if necessary,"" he added.
Big technology companies seeking acquisitions may also be required to inform the European Commission - the EU executive body - of their intentions, Breton said.
""They may have an obligation to just inform us what they want to do, and then we will see if it fulfils all their obligations,"" he said. 

The planned laws are still some way from taking effect, though. The European Commission will have to negotiate with EU countries and the European Parliament to agree on the final legislation, a process which could take a year or two.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said on Monday it has begun investing in the stocks of four large drugmakers, betting on an industry that could benefit when the world begins emerging from the coronavirus pandemic.
In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of Sept. 30, Berkshire disclosed $5.7 billion of new healthcare stakes, including more than $1.8 billion each in Abbvie Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co, Merck & Co and $136 million in  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)
Shares of the drugmakers rose in after-hours trading.
The filing signals where Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler see value. Buffett normally handles large investments for Berkshire's $245.3 billion stock portfolio himself.
""COVID-19 has made us think differently about healthcare,"" said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong & Associates in Pittsburgh, which owns Berkshire stock.
""The sector has become more efficient as big drug companies partner with smaller, inventive rivals,"" Armstrong added. ""But you will always need companies with scale for manufacturing and distribution, including vaccines with global application.""
Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
During the third quarter, Berkshire also took a $276 million stake in wireless phone company T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc.
It sold a $1.3 billion stake in Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), which benefited as people stocked up on groceries and home supplies during the pandemic, and pared holdings in four banks: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), PNC and M&T.
The stake in JPMorgan, where Combs is a director, fell by 96%.
Berkshire also bought more stock in the grocer Kroger (NYSE:KR), sold some stock in mining company Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), and confirmed it bought more Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock while trimming its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stake.
The healthcare bet is structured similarly to the more than $6 billion wager that Buffett made on the four largest U.S. airlines.
Buffett sold Berkshire's airline holdings in April, saying the pandemic had changed the industry and made its outlook uncertain.
Other new investments in the quarter included a $6 billion stake in five Japanese trading houses and a $1.5 billion wager on newly public data storage company Snowflake Inc.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>","As Ackman hunts blockbuster deal, he counts on big backers","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Hedge fund veteran William Ackman has the support of some of Wall Street's top investors as he tries to pull off the biggest-ever deal carried out by a blank-check acquisition company, according to regulatory filings published in the last few days.
Among the heavy hitters rounded up by Ackman for his Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd investment vehicle, according to the filings, are mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price Group Inc, investment firm Guggenheim Partners, hedge fund Baupost Group, Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers and private equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc.
Tontine raised $4 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) in July. It is the largest-ever special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and will use the IPO proceeds, as well as debt and new equity it can raise, to acquire a minority stake in a company valued at tens of billions of dollars. 
As is typical with SPACs, Tontine has not told its investors what specific company or type of company will be acquired. As possible targets, Ackman is eyeing family-owned businesses, public companies that want to spin off big divisions and ""mature unicorns,"" developed and privately financed companies worth more than $1 billion, a person familiar with the process said.
This is where deep-pocketed SPAC shareholders come in handy. Were Ackman to seek an investment that exceeded his SPAC's resources, the investors could boost its firepower by providing additional equity financing. Ackman's hedge fund has also committed to investing between $1 billion and $3 billion to any deal.
Tontine's IPO was heavily oversubscribed, allowing Ackman to hand-pick the investors and what stakes to allocate to them, according to people familiar with the process, who requested anonymity.
Tontine brings a ""curated list of shareholders who are expected to be invested for many years,"" Ackman told bankers working on the SPAC, according to one of the sources.
A spokesman for Ackman declined to comment.
HIGH PROFILE 
Tontine is the highest-profile SPAC in a year in which blank-check companies raised $65.7 billion to date, smashing the previous record of $13.6 billion, according to SPAC Research. Lucrative SPAC deals, such as those for electric truck maker Nikola Corp, space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and fantasy sports and gambling company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc, prompted many others to follow suit.
Many institutional investors have stayed away from SPACs, however, concerned that they pose too high a risk. Blue-chip investors' endorsement of Tontine indicates Wall Street is confident of Ackman's ability to find a successful deal. 
Guggenheim Partners owns 22 million Tontine shares worth roughly $507 million, while Seth Klarman's Baupost owns 17.5 million shares or roughly $400 million, the filings show.
Ontario Teachers owns a stake worth $257 million while the T. Rowe Price stake is valued at $174 million. 
Hedge funds Soroban Capital, Millennium Management, Fir Tree Capital Management, Citadel Advisors, Mason Capital Management, Moore Capital Management and Scoggin Management also have stakes in Tontine, according to the filings.
Most Tontine investors are based in North America, but the SPAC also counts sovereign wealth funds in Asia, the Middle East and Europe as shareholders, sources familiar with the matter said. 
NO FOUNDER SHARES
While many SPACs give their managers so-called founder shares that can result in them owning 20% of the merged company, Ackman opted out of that compensation structure. He is also set to receive warrants that require him to invest more money to own less of the target company than managers of other SPACs. 
Tontine shareholders also receive warrants, but unlike with other SPACs they forfeit two-thirds of their value if they cash out when a merger is announced. Ackman did this to discourage investors with a short-term horizon from participating in Tontine's IPO.
Tontine is not Ackman's first SPAC. He co-sponsored Justice Holdings in 2011, which raised $1.5 billion and merged with Burger King Worldwide a year later. The company is now called Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), and remains one of Ackman's biggest investments.

Ackman is best known for his big wins as an activist shareholder in railroad operator  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) and Botox maker Allergan (NYSE:AGN), though he also suffered deep losses at pharmaceutical company Valeant and nutritional supplements manufacturer  Herbalife  (NYSE:HLF). Since his $12.5 billion firm's launch in 2004, Ackman has returned an average 16% annually, compared with the Standard & Poor's 9.3% gain. This year, his Pershing Square Holdings fund is up 55%.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) will stop assembling new cars at its Flins factory outside Paris and turn the site into a research, recycling and repair centre by 2024 in a move set to save full-time jobs at the plant, the company said on Wednesday.
The loss-making carmaker said it aimed to employ 3,000 people at the revamped site by 2030, and billed the makeover as a way of saving a site that might otherwise be threatened as the group narrows its focus on profitable car models and cuts costs. 
""The status quo was no longer possible, we had to be lucid about this,"" Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard told an online news conference after meeting with unions at Flins, flanked by new Chief Executive Luca De Meo. 
Renault, which had been struggling with waning profitability and sales before the coronavirus pandemic hit, has this year announced 4,600 job cuts in France as part of a 2 billion euro ($2.4 billion) cost savings plan.
Unions said their proposals to keep on some car assembly activities in the longer run had been turned down. 
The company will continue to make its electric Zoe models at Flins until 2024, and will roll out its new activities in the meantime. These include refitting cars, such as those used for long-term leases, creating a group to work on electric battery innovations and recycling car parts.
Staff would be retrained, De Meo said, without giving details of the budget. 
The 3,000 jobs will include staff from the nearby Choisy-le-Roi plant, which has a workforce of 260 but is earmarked for closure, while Flins currently employs 2,400 permanent workers.
But it also regularly works with many temporary staff, some 1,400, and it is unclear what would happen to these workers. De Meo said Flins could be opened up to other companies, which could create more jobs for the plant. 

Renault said the plant would be equipped to turn out 130,000 refitted cars a year by 2030.

911,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>","Hedge funds sold Moderna, BioNtech shares before vaccine news","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - A number of hedge funds sold positions in two drug companies leading the race to a coronavirus vaccine in the quarter before both announced breakthroughs that lifted their stock prices, while a few took stakes in the companies during that time.
Regulatory filings show that hedge funds sold millions of shares in drugmakers  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNtech during the third quarter, missing out on big gains this month when each announced their vaccines are more than 94% effective.
Since the end of the third quarter BioNtech's stock has jumped another 26% and Moderna's stock has climbed 28%, adding to triple-digit percentage gains and putting them among the biggest winners this year, during which the S&P 500 has rebounded 60% from its March lows. 
By the end of September, Balyasny Asset Management, Adage Capital Partners and Verition Fund Management had liquidated their positions in Moderna while Healthcor Management, Logos Global Management and Duquesne Family Office exited positions in BioNtech, according to regulatory filings and data from research firm Symmetric.io.
Redmile Group, BioNtech's largest hedge fund investor, slashed its holdings by 59% during the quarter and Theleme Partners, Moderna's largest hedge fund investor, cut its exposure by 11%, regulatory filings show.
Additionally, Millennium Management, Myriad Asset Management and Citadel cut holdings in Moderna while Citadel, Balyasny and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors cut holdings in BioNtech, the filings show.
Symmetric.io data show that hedge funds owned 3.4 million shares of BioNtech, a German company which partnered with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) to bring its vaccine to market, at the end of the quarter, 1.9 million shares less than at the start of the quarter. At Moderna, hedge funds owned 11.7 million shares at the end of the quarter, down 2.2 million shares from the start.
Moderna's stock price surged 376% since January while BioNtech's rose 157%, handily beating the S&P 500 index which is up 12%, having bounced back from deep losses earlier in 2020.
Representatives for the funds either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on what prompted their sales. Investors who put money into hedge funds, including some of those mentioned in the article, said some fund managers had started locking in profits ahead of U.S. elections on worries over potential market volatility stemming from the Nov. 3 vote.
The average hedge fund gained 1.2% through October, while healthcare focused funds, on average, rose 13%, Hedge Fund Research data show.
Even as certain hedge funds took money away from Moderna and BioNtech the two companies did attract new hedge fund investors during the quarter, the data show.

Voloridge Investment Management and LMR Partners initiated new positions in Moderna while Armistice Capital and Adage Capital put on new positions in BioNtech. And Millennium boosted its investment in BioNtech while D.E.Shaw increased its holding in Moderna, the filings show.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",IKEA investment arm in talks to buy city-centre retail property in big European cities,"By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA's Ingka Investments is in talks to buy commercial property in prime locations in several big European cities after it finalised its first-ever such acquisition last month, its managing director said. 
The investment arm of Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores, is pushing into the real estate market as part of IKEA's shift towards big city-centres from out-of-town. So far, such locations are leased.
Scouting for city-centre retail property more or less ready to house IKEA stores across Europe's main cities, Ingka Investments' first deal was in Paris' Rue de Rivoli. 
""We have ongoing discussions in big European cities,"" Ingka Investments Managing Director Krister Mattsson said in an interview. ""It takes time to buy properties, but there is a lot in the pipeline,"" he told Reuters.
Inkga Investments is pushing ahead with the new strategy despite the wider retail market uncertainty caused by the pandemic.
Despite the exodus from high streets prompted by the coronavirus, price tags for the kind of properties that Ingka Investments is hunting for have not tumbled, Mattsson said. 
""For good locations in big cities, which is what we are looking at to meet our customers, there is always demand,"" he said. ""We haven't seen any big impact yet on prices for such properties - which one may have expected when the crisis came."" 
Besides good space for the IKEA store, buildings could also include other retail, office and even residential space, and Ingka Group would take over as landlord. 
The decision to build up a real estate portfolio stems from privately held IKEA's long-standing strategy not to rent. Acquisitions, as IKEA's other investments, are self financed.
Separately, Ingka Group's malls arm Ingka Centres is also shopping for inner-city property, albeit targeting bigger developments aimed at housing IKEA-store anchored malls. Scouting Europe, Asia and the United States, it has so far made two such acquisitions.
Ingka Investments' portfolios also include renewable energy and forests. 
Starting in 2017 with the purchase of handyman services platform TaskRabbit, Ingka Investments also buys into startups that may help IKEA speed up its digital transformation, improve its services, and become more sustainable. The latest addition is a stake in logistics solutions and delivery platform Mover Systems.
Ingka Investments has to date made 23 such minority stake investments totalling more than 200 million euros ($238 million), it said. It has not disclosed the price tag for TaskRabbit and two more full acquisitions. 
Ingka Group is a franchisee to brand owner Inter IKEA.

915,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",A Stock Trader’s Guide to Black Friday in the Covid-19 Era,"(Bloomberg) -- Pandemic-driven lockdowns, shuttered malls and stuck-at-home consumers have hurt retailers in 2020 as Covid-19 ravaged the economy. With Black Friday around the corner, equity traders are bracing for a holiday season where brick-and-mortar businesses that lack strong digital platforms could suffer.
For the first time ever, more consumers intend to shop online than in stores, a Deloitte survey shows. U.S. online holiday sales will total $189 billion, shattering all previous records with a 33% boost from last year, according to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics. That’s equal to two years’ growth in one season.
“This year is unlike anything else,” said Ken Perkins, president and founder of Retail Metrics. “People are going to be really adverse to come into stores on Black Friday, so traffic will be relatively more modest. Curbside pick will be extremely important this holiday season. Impulse buying will also fall off as online shopping tends to be very targeted.”
Mall-based retailers have been among the most battered stocks of 2020 amid rapid changes in consumer behavior as lockdowns resulted in less need for some items and accelerated the shift toward e-commerce and away from physical stores.
But with promising vaccine trial results coming through, signaling consumers might be ready to go back to the mall, retail stocks have been soaring. The S&P 1500 Apparel Retail Index erased its pandemic-spurred losses earlier this month, while the S&P 1500 Retailing Index hit a record high in October.
Here’s a look at some potential stock winners and losers in an unprecedented holiday shopping season. Year-to-date stock performance follows each name.
Electronics
With the release of new Xbox and PlayStation devices, gaming consoles are coveted and will be “almost impossible to get your hands on,” Perkins said. In addition, home-related electronics will be extremely popular.
Electronics like personal computers, televisions, tablets and virtual-reality accessories have also been in high demand, according to a recent data analysis from NPD Group/Retail Tracking Service.
Key stocks:  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY). (+29%), Rent-a Center Inc. (+26%), Aaron’s Holdings Co. (+16%), Conn’s Inc. (-6.3%) and Acco Brands Corp. (-11%).
Toys
Pandemic spending earlier this year, won’t hold parents back from holiday shopping. They are likely to spend “the same or more” on toys this season, according to DA Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser, who cited research done by  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT).‘s executives.
“The pandemic did not represent a pull-forward of holiday demand,” Weiser said. Furthermore, Mattel’s core brands probably added shelf space as retailers are “filling their aisles with traditional evergreen brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels” because there are fewer toys this year that are based on entertainment properties.
Key stocks: Mattel (+14%),  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS). (-13%), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). (+69%), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. (+27%) and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) (+39%).
Home Goods
The boom in suburban living has resulted in strong sales at home furnishing companies. “Even with the vaccine coming, people are moving out of the city, into the burbs, and they need to fill their homes,” Perkins at Retail Metrics said.
Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) Inc. said on a recent call that demand for its products had continued into November, while TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos. executives said on its third-quarter call that HomeGoods will be “one of the healthiest divisions” moving into the new year.
Key stocks: Williams-Sonoma (+54%) and TJX (+5.4%).
E-commerce & Fintech
Online transactions are likely to continue to surge as Covid-19 cases rise globally, and with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calling shopping in crowded stores during the holiday period a “higher risk” activity.

Internet retail names that target a more affluent consumer also stand to gain, KeyBanc said in its holiday outlook report. In addition, companies that have added customers during the pandemic could convert them into holiday shoppers, while others are well positioned to steal market share from struggling retailers if lockdowns continue.
Key stocks:  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ). (+224%) and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL). (+90%), Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) Ltd. (+407%),  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN). (-40%), Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc. (+271%), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc. (+211%), Amazon, Walmart and Target.
Lockdown Hurdles
Department store retailers will face hurdles this holiday season, according to several Wall Street analysts. All department stores saw “steep” drops in online traffic ahead of Thanksgiving, said CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky, while Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal said early Black Friday sales and holiday shopping would give department stores “a much-needed boost.”
Cleveland Research was turning cautious on the holiday outlook for department stores, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) analyst Matthew Boss recently cut fourth-quarter same-store sales estimates to below-consensus levels. Meanwhile, Marshal Cohen, NPD’s chief industry adviser for retail expects fashion and beauty categories to be “faced with the challenge of making up lost ground in hopes of a healthy finish to 2020.”
Key stocks: Macy’s Inc. (-36%) and Nordstrom.

916,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 09:39AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens Lower, Consolidating After Weak Jobless Data; Dow Down 110 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday, consolidating after a wild rally on Tuesday in volumes that were extraordinarily high for a holiday week. 
A market that's in a hurry to have the 2021 recovery begin earlier received a reality check that 2020 still has a ways to run, as initial jobless claims rose for a second straight week to 778,000. Analysts had expected a decline to 730,000.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 109 points, or 0.4% at 29,937 points. The S&P 500, which like the Dow had closed at a record high on Tuesday, was down 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, left its estimate for third-quarter GDP growth unchanged at an annualized 33.1%. That vigorous summer rebound now seems some time ago, with states and municipalities again slapping restrictions on social and business life to stop the Covid-19 virus from overwhelming their healthcare systems. The U.S. set a new record of 86,000 hospitalized on Monday, while an average 1,500 Americans died of the disease every day for the last week. 
Layoffs are likelier now to feed through faster into high-frequency data, given that Congress has allowed the pandemic-related enhancement of unemployment benefits to expire. That was evident in a 0.7% decline in personal income in October, considerably worse than the 0.1% rise expected.
Among early movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock gave back a small fraction of its recent gains on the back of reports saying that it had issued a recall for over 9,000 vehicles in the U.S. Other electric vehicle stocks were down by much more in response to reports that Chinese authorities are investigating the sector, amid rumored suspicions that government subsidies may have been abused. Tesla has soared this week in anticipation of its inclusion in the S&P 500 which, along with the prospects of an EV-friendly administration, has prompted a suite of bullish brokerage reports.
Elsewhere, Gap (NYSE:GPS) stock underperformed after the company reported disappointing figures for the third quarter: As with many old-economy stocks that have had to scale up their online presence in a hurry because of the pandemic, the company's operating costs - notably shipping costs - rose sharply. Gap was down 18.2% in early trading, losing all its gains of the last two weeks. It has quadrupled from the low it hit during the March panic, but is still below its pre-pandemic level.
Electric truckmaker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) also stumbled, losing 17.5% after the company's CEO apparently failed to convince investors that General Motors (NYSE:GM) won't pull out of its deal to buy a stake in it for $2 billion. GM stock, which has been supported in recent weeks by the prospect of gaining exposure to what's likely to be a high-growth sector in futures, fell 3.9%. "
917,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Thyssenkrupp could open books to Liberty Steel in early December: sources,"By Arno Schuetze, Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) could give Britain's Liberty Steel access to the books of its steel unit as soon as next week, three people familiar with the matter said.
Liberty Steel, headed by metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, last month unveiled a non-binding indicative offer for Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, which the embattled conglomerate has put up for sale to cut losses and stop cash outflow.
His hand was strengthened due to consolidation talks between Sweden's SSAB and Tata Steel that could result in a deal and potentially leave Liberty Steel as the sole bidder for Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.
The company said last week it aims to make a decision on whether to sell or keep its steel unit by March.
A successful bid would cut Liberty Steel's reliance on up to 3 million tonnes of slab and hot rolled coil it needs to buy each year to feed its manufacturing lines. Thyssenkrupp's Duisburg plant, in turn, would be better utilised.
A takeover is also expected to raise less antitrust scrutiny than a previously failed tie-up between Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts, as both groups have limited overlap in their product portfolio and geographies.
""For steel makers looking to consolidate it may be easier to do deals if two companies have complementary portfolios rather than overlapping products,"" said Andrew Zoryk, metals leader at Deloitte.
While Thyssenkrupp is strong in automotive and packaging steel - two major concerns when Brussels vetoed the Thyssenkrupp-Tata Steel deal - Liberty Steel is mostly active in construction and industrial manufacturing.

Gupta's bid has drawn resistance from members of the IG Metall labour union. He has said transformation processes would always happen ""with the full engagement of our employees and their representatives, never against them"".

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co on Wednesday reported a rise in quarterly earnings, defying Wall Street estimates, as higher crop prices, government subsidy payments and replacement demand lifted sales of farm machines.
The maker of John Deere and world's largest farm equipment producer forecast net income of $3.6 billion-$4.0 billion for fiscal 2021 as it expects to benefit from improving conditions in the farm economy and stabilization in the construction and forestry markets. 
The forecast is higher than a $3.3 billion estimate from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv and the $2.75 billion reported for 2020.
""Higher crop prices and improved fundamentals are leading to renewed optimism in the agricultural sector and improving demand for farm equipment,"" said CEO John May.
Deere's shares have outperformed the S&P 500 and gained 31% since its last earnings report in late August buoyed by a turnaround in the farm economy. They were up 2.4% at $267.90 in pre-market trade.
Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada - Deere's biggest combined market - are forecast to grow by 5% to 10% next year. Sales are also projected to increase in Europe and South America.
Tightening grain supplies and strong demand from China have increased prices for soybeans and corn in the United States by a third since early August. Wheat prices are up by 22% on the back of an increase in baking.
The rally marks a sharp reversal in fortunes for the U.S. agricultural economy after four years of global surplus grain stocks that have kept prices low.
Meanwhile, federal payments to farmers are projected to hit a record $51.2 billion this year, contributing to the fastest growth in U.S. farm income in at least nine years. Improving financial conditions have lifted farmer sentiment to a record high.
A growing need for farmers to replace aging tractors and combines is also helping demand.

Deere's fourth-quarter profit came in at $2.39 per share, up 5% year on year. Analysts had expected a fall of 36%, a survey of analysts by Refinitiv showed.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",EU seeks to bypass patents in emergency measures to boost drugs access,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is planning tough measures to boost its access to drugs, from sidestepping patents rights in emergencies to taking production to Europe, according to EU documents published on Wednesday.
The possible moves are meant to tackle the chronic shortages of medicines that have dogged the bloc for years and have become more serious since the COVID-19 pandemic and associated trade disruption and drug export bans.
The European Union Commission wants faster procedures during crises to produce generic versions of drugs in EU states without the consent of patent holders, an EU document says.
So-called compulsory licensing is allowed under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules in emergencies as a waiver of normal regulations and could be applied during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The Commission sees the need to ensure that effective systems for issuing compulsory licences are in place, to be used as a means of last resort and a safety net, when all other efforts to make IP (intellectual property) available have failed,"" the document published on Wednesday said.
Ironically, the proposal is part of an EU action plan on intellectual property that is mostly aimed at strengthening the protection of EU companies' patents against foreign actors.
In the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers and activists had urged the EU to use the WTO waiver to gain access to potential vaccines and drugs against the new coronavirus, which have mostly been developed outside the 27-nation bloc.
The EU executive has so far refused to invoke the waiver and has struck multibillion-euro deals with drugmakers to secure COVID-19 shots and therapeutics.
However, the COVID-19 emergency has led to a reconsideration of existing procedures, which largely fall under the remit of national governments in the EU.
'FAST-TRACK PROCEDURES'
""The Commission calls on member states to ensure that the tools they have are as effective as possible; for instance, by putting in place fast-track procedures for issuing compulsory licences in emergency situations,"" the document says.
To avoid distortions to trade and innovation, the Commission is also considering creating an emergency co-ordination mechanism that would be triggered at short notice when an EU government wants to issue a compulsory licence.
The Commission also said on Wednesday that, after a consultation process with pharmaceuticals companies next year, it will make proposals aimed at identifying vulnerabilities in global supply chains.
That could lead to incentives for manufacturers to move production of medicines to Europe.
The Commission said it was important ""to assess whether manufacturing capacity for certain critical medicines may be required in the EU"", adding that any action would be in line with WTO rules.

The possible measures are part of a wider EU strategy published on Wednesday. The plans aim to increase access to cheap medicines and boost competition, including through broader use of generics that could hit revenues of large drugmakers, in line with a Reuters report earlier this week.

The regulator, in a letter https:// to PG&E dated Tuesday, said it will require remediation on specific issues identified in the San Francisco-based utility's wildfire mitigation plan progress reports.
PG&E emerged from bankruptcy in July, marking an end to a long-drawn restructuring process which began after its equipment sparked some of the deadliest wildfires in California.
CPUC said its concerns arose from what appeared to be a pattern of vegetation and asset management deficiencies.
The regulator said its staff had ""identified a volume and rate of defects in PG&E's vegetation management that is notably higher than those observed for the other utilities.""

CPUC said a fact-finding initiative is underway to determine if the regulator needed to place PG&E into the ""enhanced oversight and enforcement process.""

923,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>","Tesla issues two recalls covering 9,500 U.S. vehicles: NHTSA","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is issuing two recalls covering about 9,500 vehicles for roof trim that may separate and bolts that may not have been properly tightened.
The larger recall covers 9,136 Model X cars from the 2016 model year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V710-9316.PDF on Wednesday.
NHTSA said the front and spine cosmetic roof trim may have been adhered without first using primer, and one or both pieces of trim may separate from the vehicle while it is being driven.
Tesla said in documents filed with the agency it learned in September of an event involving a 2016 Model X that prompted a company investigation into the root cause and frequency of the condition that could create a road hazard for motorists behind the vehicle.
Tesla will inspect the recalled vehicles and apply a retention test. If they fail, Tesla will apply primer to remedy the condition.
The other recall covers 401 2020 model year Tesla Model Y vehicles with bolts connecting the front upper control arm and steering knuckle that may not have been properly tightened. Due to the inadequate tightening, NHTSA said the upper control arm could detach from the steering knuckle.
Tesla said it recently learned of three vehicle repairs where the upper control arm had separated.
It said vehicles would be inspected for proper torque and if necessary, would be adjusted.

Tesla said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries tied to either recall.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: COVID-19 vaccine adoption rates are 'wildcard' for U.S. stock rally,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - News this month of three promising coronavirus vaccines has helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average over 30,000, but some investors worry that slow vaccination rates may weaken next year's expected economic recovery. 
Overall, 58% of Americans said in a Gallup poll https://news.gallup.com/poll/325208/americans-willing-covid-vaccine.aspx that ended Nov. 1 that they would get vaccinated, up from 50% who were willing in a September poll. Forty-two percent said they would be unwilling to get a vaccine, citing reasons such as the rushed development timeline and concerns about safety.
Delays in vaccine distribution or widespread refusal to be vaccinated would allow the virus to continue to circulate longer and delay the development of herd immunity, which occurs when enough people in a population have some form of protection that prevents the easy spread of a disease.
""To be certain that the world will be back to normal by mid-next year because a vaccine is available is an aggressive assumption,"" said David Albrycht, chief investment officer at Newfleet Asset Management.
""There's a light at the end of the tunnel but we're not sure how long that the tunnel is going to be,"" he said, citing uncertainties including whether a vaccine will be free or covered by insurance plans, its rollout and its public acceptance rate.
Citi Research wrote in a note on Monday that herd immunity would not form until late 2021, boosting global Gross Domestic Product growth by only 0.7% next year compared with an estimated 3% gain in 2022 as vaccination rates rise. 
""The answer is not the vaccine; it's vaccinations. The vaccine needs to be widely adopted and accepted for it to work,"" said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will likely grant approval in mid-December for distribution of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech and some healthcare workers could start getting shots a day or two later, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed, said on Sunday.
Some 70% of the U.S. population of 330 million would need to be inoculated to achieve herd immunity, which is possible by May, he said.
Ramos said those estimates may be overly optimistic and the economic benefits of vaccinations will not be apparent until the second half of next year, increasing chances that the recent U.S. economic slowdown could worsen.
Investors will get the latest U.S. economic snapshot with data next week, including the monthly employment report. Economists polled by Reuters expect the Dec. 4 jobs report to show unemployment dipped to 6.8% from 6.9%, still well above the 4.5% rate in March, before much of the U.S. economy went into lockdown.
Targeted vaccinations could revive the economy even with delays in widespread adoption, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities.
""The successful vaccination of seniors and front-line workers could expedite the renormalization process well before herd immunity is achieved,"" he said. The S&P 500 may reach 4,050 by the end of 2021, up about 13% from its current level, he estimated.
While vaccine adoption rates are a ""wildcard,"" their availability removes the risk of another widespread economic lockdown, said John Buckingham, portfolio manager at Kovitz Investment Group.
He remains bullish on companies that will benefit from an economic recovery, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) Inc and Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR), even if the U.S. economy remains bumpy over the next few months and coronavirus cases keep rising.
The United States recorded its 12 millionth COVID-19 case on Nov. 21, and health experts have warned that Americans traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday will likely push case counts steeply higher.

""If the situation were reversed and you had good data on cases and hospitalizations for COVID but vaccines were flops, the stock market would be cratering,"" Buckingham said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Wednesday, consolidating after a record-breaking session on the back of increasing political clarity and vaccine optimism. There are a number of important data points to digest ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract fell 31 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded largely flat and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 43 points, or 0.4%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5% to close above the 30,000 level for the first time on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 gained 1.6%, to 3,635.41, also a record high. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.3%.
Positive coronavirus vaccine news and emerging political certainty in the U.S., with President-elect Joe Biden Tuesday commending the ‘sincere’ cooperation from the White House in helping his transition to power, have prompted strong gains on Wall Street.
Influential investment banks JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) see further hefty gains ahead, with both now forecasting the benchmark S&P 500 gaining a further 25% at least over the next two years.  
This is despite many U.S. states instigating new restrictions to try and slow the recent swell in infections ahead of Thanksgiving, with millions traveling to gather with family and friends. 
This travel raises the possibility of a “surge superimposed on a surge,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert on Tuesday.
There is a vast data dump scheduled for later Wednesday, with the highlights being the second print of third-quarter GDP, the weekly initial jobless claims, durable goods, new home sales and both income and spending numbers for October.
Deere (NYSE:DE) is the highlight of the earnings calendar, but Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPE), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and Gap (NYSE:GPS) will also be in focus after they released quarterly figures after the close Tuesday.
Oil prices continued to push higher Wednesday, despite data pointing to a build in U.S. crude supplies, as traders look for a recovery in global demand.
U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.8 million barrels last week, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute, with the official government report due out later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $45.12 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $48.02, with both benchmarks above the $45 mark for the first time since March.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,810.55/oz, earlier dropping through the $1,800 level for the first time since July, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1883.

LONDON (Reuters) - London’s dominance of the multi-billion dollar derivatives market is at risk after a European regulator said on Wednesday banks in the European Union will have to use trading platforms within the bloc once Britain fully leaves the EU on Dec. 31.
The City of London's unfettered access to the European Union, its biggest customer, ends when Brexit transition arrangements expire and Brussels wants trading in euro-denominated derivatives to remain within its jurisdiction or in a country with ""equivalent"" standards to the bloc.
The Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on Wednesday confirmed that EU investors would have to use a swaps platform inside the bloc, or based in a non-EU country that has already been granted ""equivalence"" or permission, such as the United States from Jan 1.
This will mean that branches of EU banks in London face conflicting EU and British requirements on where to trade derivatives.
The City of London touts itself as the go-to location globally for trading derivatives - the life blood of financial markets, allowing investors to bet on a swathe of assets and hedge risk.
While the rules would not create the sort of systemic disruption of areas such as clearing the contracts, which has already been smoothed over with temporary equivalence, it does signal the EU is prepared to play hardball as Brexit injects a sense of urgency into reducing its reliance on the City of London for core financial services for its economy.
""ESMA acknowledges that this approach creates challenges for some EU counterparties, particularly UK branches of EU investment firms,"" the watchdog said.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said it will not be adjusting its approach to derivatives trading at this time.
""Mutual equivalence would be the best way to avoid market disruption and meet international G20 commitments. We continue to monitor market developments,"" the FCA said.
The derivatives industry has urged Brussels to avoid a clash in rules through a ""quick fix"" legal workaround, but it now appears this was not possible.
The rules mean British counterparties will have to use a UK authorised platform, while EU counterparties have to use an EU authorised platform, making a trade between the two sides impossible. ""You can't tick both boxes,"" a derivatives sector official said.
The ESMA said it did not see room for providing different guidance ""based on the current legal framework, and in the absence of an equivalence decision by the European Commission"".
The ongoing trade talks between the EU and Britain do not cover financial services, though a deal could help the mood music towards financial services access. 
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) said no equivalence would mean fragmenting liquidity, raising costs and probably a negative effect on pricing of contracts for end users.
""It means EU and UK firms would not be able to trade derivatives that are subject to both EU and UK trading obligations unless they trade on a US swap execution facility, but that may not be practical or even possible for some,"" said Roger Cogan, ISDA's head of European public policy.
""Given the rules on trading venues in the EU and UK are virtually identical, we think equivalence is justified and necessary,"" Cogan said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s female employees in Britain earned 18% less on average than their male colleagues in 2020, with the pay gap slightly narrowing from the previous year.
In its annual UK diversity pay gap report, Shell also published for the first time data on ethnicity which revealed that the average pay and bonuses for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) employees was 8.5% lower than non-BAME staff.
Women represented 34% of the energy company's 6,000-strong British workforce in 2020, mostly due to the prevalence of men on offshore oil and gas facilities. BAME employees made up 21% of the workforce.
The gender pay gap stood at 18.7% in 2019, 18.6% in 2018 and 22.2% in 2017. Shell said it had achieved its ambition to have women in 30% of senior positions in the country.
Gender gap pay is defined as the difference in the average pay and bonuses of all men and women across an organisation.
""While we are making progress in building an inclusive workplace for all, we are not yet where we need to be,"" Shell UK country chair Sinead Lynch said in a statement.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: White House considers lifting European travel restrictions - sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is considering rescinding entry bans for most non-U.S. citizens who recently were in Brazil, Britain, Ireland and 26 other European countries, five U.S. and airline officials told Reuters.
The Trump administration imposed the bans in a bid to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic. It is not considering lifting separate entry bans on most non-U.S. citizens who have recently been in China or Iran, the officials said.
The plan has won the backing of White House coronavirus task-force members, public health and other federal agencies, the people briefed on the matter said, but President Donald Trump has not made a final decision and the timing remains uncertain.
The White House, Department of Homeland Security and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not comment.
Many administration officials argue the restrictions no longer make sense given that most countries around the world are not subject to the entry ban. They contend lifting the restrictions would be a boost to struggling U.S. airlines, which have seen international travel fall by 70%, according to airline industry data.
Trump may still opt not to lift the restrictions, given the high number of coronavirus infections in Europe. One potential hurdle is the fact that European countries are not likely to immediately allow most Americans to resume visits, officials said.
The European countries that are subject to the U.S. entry restrictions include the 26 members of the Schengen area that allow travel across open borders.
The U.S. restrictions barring most visitors from Europe have been in place since mid-March, while the Brazilian entry ban was imposed in May. Trump implemented the first ban on most non-U.S. visitors from China on Jan. 31 and then added Iran in February.
The restrictions bar entry of most non-U.S. residents who have been in those countries in the previous 14 days, but the U.S. State Department has been granting some ""national interest exceptions"" to allow travelers from Europe related to ""humanitarian travel, public health response, and national security.""
The United States has also approved exceptions for some European business travelers, investors, academics, students and journalists.
Nearly all of Europe still bans most U.S. travelers from visiting, while Britain and Ireland allow American visits but require two-weeks quarantine upon arrival. Brazil allows U.S. travelers.
On Saturday, the CDC issued new travel and testing recommendations for international air travelers recommending they ""get tested with a viral test 1-3 days before their flight to reduce spread during travel. Travelers (NYSE:TRV) should get tested 3-5 days after travel and stay home for 7 days.""
Airlines for America, a group representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and others, on Tuesday noted it has ""been advocating for the federal government to set a national standard on testing in order to lift travel restrictions.""
In a statement to Reuters, the group called the CDC guidance a step in the right direction, adding that they hoped it would be ""followed by a recognition that testing can be used to safely reopen borders without quarantines.""
Some airlines and officials think testing could be the key to widely resuming international travel. The United States has held talks with several countries about the possibility of passenger testing programs between pairs of major cities.
Asked about the prospects of travel restrictions being lifted, a U.S. Transportation Department spokesman said ""the department stands ready to support the safe resumption of international flights to and from the U.S."" 
""Conversations are ongoing between the federal government, international partners, and industry stakeholders on these matters."" 

In September, the CDC ended enhanced screening of some international passengers for the coronavirus and dropped requirements that travelers coming from those countries arrive at 15 designated U.S. airports that had been imposed at the start of the beginning of the outbreak.

SCOR, one of the world's largest reinsurers, has faced large claims due to the coronavirus pandemic as well as losses from hurricanes in the United States. That is expected to allow reinsurers to charge their customers more.
Kessler, speaking at the Reuters Events Future of Insurance Europe conference, said that the pandemic, a series of mid-sized storms during 2020, consecutive years of high losses, and low interest rates all speak in favor of higher prices.
""All conditions are met today for rate increases,"" he said.

Kessler said the cost of the pandemic was mostly already accounted for in the reinsurer's previously published loss estimates. If there was a third wave the company would revise its assumptions, he added.

931,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 05:53AM ET</span>",StockBeat: ECB Throws Cold Water on Bank Stock Rally,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The European Central Bank poured some cold water on the violent rally in Eurozone banking stocks, warning that loan losses from the pandemic could be larger than the banks expect and voicing skepticism about plans for an early resumption of dividend payments.
The Stoxx 600 Banks index reacted by falling 1.5% by mid-morning in Frankfurt, a move that, while big in normal times, has to be viewed against a rally of 33% in the last month.
Those gains have been largely due to reports from three pharmaceutical companies that their experimental vaccines for treating Covid-19 are safe and effective, fostering hopes that their distribution next year will allow the world economy to bounce back strongly from its worst year since the Great Depression.
For long-suffering investors in European banks, such an outlook means an early lifting of the ban on dividends and buybacks that regulators announced in the spring to ensure that bank balance sheets are strong enough to survive the crisis. In their recent third-quarter updates, Unicredit (MI:CRDI), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and others (notably UBS Group (SIX:UBSG), which is not ECB-supervised) all stressed that they had more than enough capital to absorb all the loan losses they expect and still pay something out to shareholders.
However, in its semi-annual Financial Stability Review, the ECB took a markedly more skeptical view, noting that the banks have only avoided booking bigger provisions by making use of the government-backed debt moratoria and guarantees and the regulatory loopholes granted them earlier in the year.
“Provisions have increased but look optimistic in some cases,” ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said in the review. “Guarantees and moratoria may have lengthened the time it takes for weak economic performance to translate into loan losses.”
In addition, the ECB warned in its review that the risk of a sharp asset price correction had risen, while weak underlying profitability remained a concern, especially in view of elevated levels of debt at the sovereign, corporate and household level.
Loan guarantees, debt-repayment holidays and tax deferrals have all helped banks to report surprisingly low levels of provisions, creating an appearance of profitability at a time when many businesses are on the verge of disappearing.
Importantly, since the end of the third quarter, when the banks were able to present relatively tidy books, the economy has turned south again: IHSMarkit’s flash PMIs for November showed the Eurozone clearly in recessionary territory, and with Germany, the region’s biggest economy, set to tighten its restrictions on economic and social life at a meeting Thursday, the risk is that December will go the same way.
“Overall, it would not be surprising if after a very bad month of November we had zero or even negative growth” for the current quarter, outgoing ECB board member Yves Mersch told the Financial Times in an interview published on Wednesday, although he added it would be “premature” to predict another quarter of negative growth at the start of next year.
“We have relaxed some of our standards, creating additional capital available for the banking system to an amount about three to four times the intended distribution of dividends,” Mersch said, adding that it would be “spurious or surprising if the banks were to use the public subsidies to enrich the shareholders.”"

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's tight control of quality clearances for electronic goods from China slowed the import of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new iPhone model last month and held up other products made by companies like Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), according to two industry sources. 
Applications to the quality control agency, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), typically used to be processed within 15 days, but some are now taking up to two months or longer. 
BIS started delaying approvals in August for China-made imports of devices like smartphones, smartwatches and laptops, part of the fallout from deteriorating ties with China after a border clash in June that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. 
Since the clash India has tightened rules for investments from China and banned hundreds of Chinese mobile apps, including from tech giants Tencent,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and ByteDance. It banned 43 more apps on Tuesday. 
When Apple's new iPhone 12 was caught in the delays, Apple India executives called on BIS to speed its approval up, giving assurances that the company would continue to expand its assembly operations in India, the two sources said. 
It was not clear how long the iPhone 12 application was delayed, and Apple did not respond to a request for comment. 
The company has assembly operations in India, but newer models and the iPhone 12 are imported from China, where contract manufacturers make the bulk of Apple's devices. 
As of Wednesday, 1,080 applications to BIS for laptops, tablets and other devices were pending, with 669 of those waiting more than 20 days, according to the agency's website. 
These included applications for devices from China-based factories of Wistron and Compal Electronics, and from Hangzhou Hikvision, the data showed. 
Some of the applications for approval have been pending since September. 
CALLS FOR BOYCOTTS
Indian traders and Hindu nationalist groups have for months called for boycotting imported products from China because of the border clash, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to promote self-reliance and local production. 
""While the BIS is delaying approvals for products like smartwatches, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is pushing companies to make these devices in India,"" said one of the sources. 
Under BIS's registration scheme, certain electronic goods - whether imported or locally made - need to meet certain standards. After companies get their products tested in a certified laboratory, BIS approves the applications. 
Wistron and Compal did not respond to requests for comment. Hikvision declined to comment. 
BIS Director General Pramod Kumar Tiwari and India's tech ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
The clearance delays are the latest headache for technology companies whose supply chains were hit by the COVID-19 curbs, pushing some smartphone makers to resort to imports of even models made in India. The delays also come during India's festive season when customers make big ticket purchases of everything from mobile phones to gold and cars.
The BIS delays have also hit smartwatch imports for companies including Xiaomi and Oppo, the two sources said. 
Xiaomi and Oppo did not respond to requests for comment.
In July, India's trade ministry also restricted inbound shipments of TVs by requiring importers to get a special licence, a move that one of the sources said continues to hurt companies such as Xiaomi and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF).
Xiaomi was denied the special licence to import roughly 30,000 units of TVs, while Samsung (KS:005930) has faced similar import hurdles, the source said.

Samsung did not respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - European shares eased slightly, while staying near nine-month highs on Wednesday as a relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in the region and growing hopes that a vaccine would soon be ready kept sentiment afloat.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index inched lower by 0.1% at 0925 GMT as gains in the utility and telecom sector were outweighed by losses in automobile stocks.
Promising results from three major pharmaceutical companies on their COVID-19 vaccine trials and improving prospects for a smooth White House transition have sent U.S. stocks surging to record highs and put European equities on track for their best month ever.
A Reuters poll expects the STOXX 600 to climb to 430 points by the end of 2021, just a whisker below February's record highs, as economic activity returns to normal following the coronavirus-induced downturn.
""The overall feeling is that things are heading in the right direction,"" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets.
""A mixture of vaccine optimism and the fact that the decline in economic output, because of most recent lockdowns, hasn't been as bad as initially thought is going to continue to push the index higher.""
Germany and the United Kingdom unveiled plans to allow gatherings with limitations for Christmas, while France will start easing its lockdown this weekend after a sharp drop in new infections and hospitalizations.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday a vaccine could start being administered as soon as the end of the year if approved by regulators.
German stocks dropped 0.1% by 0920 GMT and Italian shares slipped 0.2%, while France's CAC 40 traded flat.
UK's domestically focused mid-cap FTSE 250, however, underperformed after the EU's chief executive said the European Commission cannot guarantee there will be a trade pact with Britain after its departure from the EU, and the coming days will be crucial.
Investors will turn to a spending review due to be delivered by British finance minister Rishi Sunak later in the day, where he will likely announce extra investment to ease a backlog in the health system, counter a surge in unemployment and build new infrastructure.
Virgin Money (LON:VM) UK dropped 5.5% after the lender reported a slump in annual profit as it took an impairment charge against an expected surge in bad loans.
United Utilities (OTC:UUGRY), one of the largest listed water companies in UK, jumped 4.3% as it proposed a higher interim dividend.

935,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",ECB Warns European Banks May Need More Bad-Loan Provisions,"(Bloomberg) -- Euro-area banks will probably have to set aside more money to soak up losses when government pandemic support ends and the economy grapples with massively increased debt, the European Central Bank said.
Provisions for losses on loans to companies are lower than in previous crises and below those seen in the U.S., the ECB said in its Financial Stability Review. That’s partly because measures by European governments and the central bank have reduced default risks, and partly because of weak profitability at banks.
The worry is that once emergency aid is pulled, some companies won’t be able to cover repayments, putting lenders under renewed stress.
“Provisions have increased but look optimistic in some cases,” ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said in the review. “Guarantees and moratoria may have lengthened the time it takes for weak economic performance to translate into loan losses.”
Euro-area financial stocks declined on Wednesday, with the Euro Stoxx 600 Banks Index dropping 1.5% as of 10:40 am. Frankfurt time, underperforming the broader market.
The ECB also highlighted “stretched” valuations in some asset prices that raises the risk of a sudden drop hitting the financial system. That echoes warnings by the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund this month of the risk to markets if the economic impact of the coronavirus worsens.
Government loan guarantees, debt-repayment holidays and tax deferrals have been key to weathering the biggest peacetime recession in almost a century, allowing companies to keep paying wages and maintain cashflows during enforced lockdowns.
The ECB has enabled that fiscal aid by keeping interest rates low with exceptional monetary stimulus, and plans to step up its actions again in December. It has also given banks regulatory relief, in return telling them to halt dividend payouts at least through the end of this year.
Executive Board member Yves Mersch, the vice-chair of the ECB’s bank-supervision arm, said in an interview with the Financial Times published Wednesday that ending the de facto dividend ban will depend on the “conservatism” of banks’ internal models and capital plans.
With vaccines closer to rollout and an end to the pandemic in sight, the ECB says public authorities face a delicate balance. They’ll shock the economy if they end pandemic support too suddenly, but undermine a necessary restructuring if they keep measures in place too long.
“There is a long road ahead,” Guindos said. “Government support schemes are essential currently but should remain targeted towards pandemic-related economic support and avoid giving rise to debt sustainability concerns in the medium term.”
Another immediate risk, the U.K.’s departure from the European Union’s single market on Dec. 31, is “mostly contained” after the European Commission allowed temporary access to critical derivatives clearinghouses in the U.K., the ECB said. The central bank also expects market participants in the EU to reduce their reliance on these firms, it said.
Longer-term, it said problems stemming from climate change shouldn’t be forgotten. Bank lending to carbon-intensive sectors -- a signal of exposure to such risks -- shows few signs of declining.

DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Leading shareholders of German retail group Metro are in talks on a joint proposal for a future chairman in a sign that they are working to put a long-lasting spat behind them, three people close to the matter said. 
Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky secured more than 40% of Metro's voting rights after an unsolicited voluntary offer of his vehicle EPGC expired last week. He has been at loggerheads with the Beisheim and Meridian foundations, which own a joint 23%.
Kretinsky failed in several attempts to buy the stakes of the foundations, which said his offer price was two low. Metro's management has also opposed Kretinsky's offers.
Beisheim and Meridian in September pooled their voting rights in 2019 and have said they could increase their stakes to bolster their blocking minority.
Kretinsky and the foundations have begun talks on a joint strategy for Metro, joint candidates for a total of three supervisory board members including the chairman role, which comes up for replacement at the next shareholder meeting, as well as on a new Chief Executive. 
Current CEO Olaf Koch is stepping down at the end of the year with CFO Christian Baier and COO Rafael Gasset to run the company as co-CEOs on an interim basis as of January 2021.
Metro has been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as restaurants and hotels are a major customer group. Its shareholders are pressing for a new strategy, including a new digital strategy and a focus on certain customer groups.
Metro has been selling off assets in recent years to focus on its European cash-and-carry business supplying hotels, restaurants and independent traders, but it is battling sluggish growth in its home market Germany and a decline in Russia.

Kretinsky and the foundations declined to comment.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global shares reached record highs on Wednesday after the Dow Jones broke 30,000, with investors relieved at the prospect of a smooth handover of power after the U.S. presidential election and confident a COVID-19 vaccine would soon be ready.
President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday introduced his foreign policy and national security team after President Donald Trump cleared the way to prepare for the start of his administration. 
Reports that Biden planned to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary, potentially easing the passage of a fiscal stimulus package to counter COVID-19 damage, also cheered markets.
The renewed demand for shares pushed MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks to a record high of 622.12. It was last up 0.1%
European shares Euro STOXX 600 followed suit, gaining 0.1% in early trading to hold near nine-month highs, with banking stocks gaining ground, then falling back. 
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei earlier rose to a 29-year high. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan traded down 0.2% as Chinese shares were capped by worries about rising debt defaults.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday crossed 30,000 for the first time on Tuesday Futures for the S&P 500 added 0.2%.
""The world is going to look a lot better this time next year than it does now, and that's what equity markets are reflecting,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""The fact is the outlook has dramatically changed in the last month."" 
EASING THE PAIN
Amid the improved outlook, investors bet that forthcoming virus vaccines would ease the pain of industries hit hardest by the pandemic, from tourism to energy. 
Global energy shares have risen almost 34% so far this month, on track for their best month on record as crude prices rally.
Oil prices held near their highest levels since March on the improved global economic outlook. Brent futures were up 1.3% to $48.48 per barrel, touching a high last seen in March.
Those risk-on moves played out in bond markets, too. Yields on benchmark euro zone debt rose from record lows. German Bund yields traded near their highest levels in almost a week. Yields rise when bonds fall. 
U.S. Treasuries were pressured, too, as investors bet any fiscal stimulus package in Washington would bring more debt. 
Riskier currencies gained against safe havens, including the U.S. dollar. Against a basket of six currencies, the dollar was down 0.1% at 92.048 after falling 0.4% on Tuesday.
The Australian dollar moved to its highest since early September, already helped by investors unwinding bets on additional monetary easing. 
The yen, a safe haven in times of political and economic stress, was little changed at 104.38 per dollar.

Still, even amid the risk-on mood, bitcoin was flat at $19,179, staying within sight of its record peak of $19,666 after November gains of nearly 40%.

LONDON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - The blistering rally in global stock markets is set to continue for at least six months, albeit at a shallower pace, amid hopes more cheap cash and a COVID-19 vaccine allow economies to heal and corporate earnings to recover, a Reuters poll found.
With the coronavirus pandemic sweeping across the globe, economic activity ground to a halt as governments forced citizens to stay home and businesses to close, disrupting supply chains.
That collapse led to unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus and with that cheap money supply set to continue, around 75% of respondents to an additional question said the bull run would last at least six months.
Over half of those respondents in the Nov. 12-24 poll said at least a year.
""The rebound in equities from March to October was the initial 'hope'-driven phase of a new bull market, led mainly by valuation expansion as profits collapsed, while we are now moving into the longer 'growth' phase as profits start to recover,"" noted analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
""Negative real interest rates should continue to support the bull market in 2021.""
For a graphic on Reuters Poll - Global stock market outlook - November 2020: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/nmopadokyva/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20Global%20stock%20market%20outlook%20-%20November%20(1).png
While around 1.4 million people have died globally from COVID-19 and the Northern hemisphere is experiencing a second wave, expectations were pinned on effective vaccine developments, and around 80% of respondents said their forecasts were based on the progress.
The tough lockdowns imposed by governments put a big dent in company profits but hopes a vaccine will allow some return to normality led around two-thirds of respondents to say corporate earnings would return to pre-COVID-19 levels within a year.
So while nine of the 17 indexes Reuters polled around 170 strategists on were expected to end this year down from 2019 closes, most were predicted to end 2021 above pre-pandemic levels - with some significantly higher.
The range of forecasts suggests a higher proportion of strategists expect the indexes polled to rise from here by mid and end-2021.
""Equities are set to rise further. They increased already appreciably since March notwithstanding the second wave of new COVID-10 cases thanks to huge policy support, both fiscal and monetary,"" said Michele Morganti at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments.

U.S. stocks were nervous ahead of the presidential election this month but investors were upbeat about Democrat Joe Biden's win, a feeling likely to linger if a divided Congress means limited regulatory changes and Biden's Cabinet picks are market-friendly.

What has also helped stocks outside of the U.S. is the fading of the dollar's dominance this year.
""We forecast strong returns across all equity markets, and the prospect of a weaker U.S. dollar and fading global risks points to a narrowing of the performance gap relative to the U.S. and a recovery in laggard regions like Europe and EM (emerging markets),"" added Goldman Sachs' analysts.

""This feels odd to write, as the global pandemic rages and many lives remain disrupted. But we think that it will be true. The year ahead should see economic growth recover, control of the virus improve and uncertainty decline.""

939,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>","EU fell short in vetting BlackRock for green banking rules, watchdog says","By Kate Abnett and Simon Jessop
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission failed to properly consider conflicts of interest when it appointed a division of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, to help develop green banking rules, the European Union watchdog said on Wednesday.
European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) launched an inquiry after the EU executive in March appointed BlackRock, through the company's Financial Markets Advisory unit (FMA), to produce a study that would inform EU plans to integrate sustainability into banking prudential rules.
EU lawmakers and NGO Change Finance questioned BlackRock's ability to provide impartial advice as its $7.8 trillion in assets under management includes large stakes in fossil fuel industries and in banks affected by the regulations.
In a decision on Wednesday, O'Reilly stopped short of calling for the Commission to cancel the contract, but said it should have exercised ""significantly more critical scrutiny"" of BlackRock's application.
""Questions should have been asked about motivation, pricing strategy and whether internal measures taken by the company to prevent conflicts of interest were really adequate,"" she said.
CANCELLATION CALL
Change Finance on Wednesday called for the contract to be cancelled, and published a report with NGO Corporate Europe Observatory, which said BlackRock and industry groups it is a member of have lobbied to weaken planned EU green finance rules.
A BlackRock spokesman said the Commission had already publicly stated that the technical quality of FMA’s proposal underpinned the contract win. 
""FMA has taken a wide-ranging and inclusive approach, including academia, civil society, banks, supervisors and market practitioners, and looks forward to completing its work and delivering its final report to the Commission,"" he said.
The European Commission said it welcomed the Ombudsman's findings, which did not find evidence of maladministration, and would study its recommendations in detail.
""It confirms what we have said throughout this process: we applied the rules fully and fairly,"" a spokesman said.
BlackRock beat eight other bidders with its offer of 280,000 euros ($334,000) - roughly half the contract's estimated value. This ""exceptionally low financial offer"" could be seen as an attempt to secure influence over policies, the Ombudsman said.
BlackRock said it would ensure ""physical segregation"" of FMA to ensure information did not flow to other parts of its business.
Brussels is undergoing a mammoth policy overhaul, revising energy, farming and finance regulations to better support EU plans to rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Amid increased scrutiny of existing EU rules, the Ombudsman criticised the Commission last week for granting priority status to gas projects without properly assessing their climate impact.

The authority added that it had carried out, with Italy's finance police, inspections in some Benetton offices on Tuesday.
The regulator is looking into the possible use of contractual clauses by Benetton to heavily condition the resellers' strategic choices, for example in terms of timing and quantity of purchase orders. 
It said the use of such a contractual framework by a company ""managing a significant franchise network ... could have a significant impact on all the entrepreneurs making up the network, thus penalising the competitiveness of the market"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean agency for protecting personal information on Wednesday fined  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) 6.7 billion won ($6.06 million) and sought a criminal investigation for providing users' personal information to other operators without consent. 
The country's Personal Information Protection Commission, launched in August this year, said in a statement it fined Facebook after a probe found that the personal information of least 3.3 million of the 18 million Facebook users in Korea were provided to operators other than Facebook without their knowledge, from May 2012 to June 2018.
When someone uses another operator's service through Facebook's log-in, the personal information of the user's Facebook friends were provided to other operators without their consent, the commission said. 
The commission said it will refer Facebook Ireland Ltd, the recipient of the fine, to the country's prosecution for a criminal investigation.
""We have cooperating as much as possible throughout the investigation process, we regret that the Personal Information Protection Commission has sought a criminal investigation,"" a Seoul-based Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement, declining further comment as Facebook hasn't yet fully reviewed the details of the decision.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, albeit with less dynamism than on Tuesday, helped by rising optimism over potential coronavirus vaccines.
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.5%.
Increased certainty in the U.S. political process, with President-elect Joe Biden finally formally beginning the transition to the White House, has helped market confidence. 
But the major factor has been growing optimism that vaccines to treat Covid-19 will be available soon, with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) reporting positive results for its candidate on Monday.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech have already filed for emergency use authorization for their drug, while  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said last week it expects to submit its filing in the coming weeks after establishing its drug's effectiveness.  
Workable vaccines are desperately needed, with the latest European PMI data pointing to a double-dip recession on the back of the recent government-mandated restrictions.
Some governments have started scaling back these lockdowns ahead of the important Christmas shopping period, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to propose a further tightening of the country’s coronavirus restrictions until at least Dec. 20 after her country reported a record number of deaths in the last 24 hours.
In corporate news,  Babcock International  (LON:BAB) stock slumped 8.4% after the U.K. engineering group posted a drop in pretax profit for the first half of fiscal 2021 after the pandemic caused higher costs than expected.
Virgin Money (LON:VM) stock fell almost 10% after the U.K. financial services group took a 501 million pound ($669.54 million) impairment charge against an expected surge in bad loans.
The European data slate is largely empty Wednesday, but there are a lot of important numbers due out of the U.S. ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, including jobless claims and the latest GDP release.
Oil prices continued to push higher Wednesday, despite data pointing to a build in U.S. crude supplies, as traders look to future increases in demand on the back of expectations of a prompt rollout of Covid-19 vaccines. 
U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.8 million barrels last week, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute, with the official government report due out later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $45.56 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.6% to $48.52, with both benchmarks above the $45 mark for the first time since March.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,810.30/oz, earlier dropping through the $1,800 level for the first time since July, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1919.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 03:31AM ET</span>",Column: Risk pricing needs rethink into 2021,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Risk gauges in financial markets may be askew as they struggle to price a potentially messy end to a truly shocking 2020 while simultaneously assuming clear blue sky on the horizon.
As 2021's big market calls stream in with some eye-popping forecasts circulating, there's a sense investors remain too cautious on record high stocks and perhaps too sanguine on government bonds with yields cosseted at less than 1% out to 10 years. 
Despite expectations of further Wall St stock gains of 20% or more over the next year or two, equity volatility measures are still much higher relative to the past couple of decades than historically subdued bond market equivalents. 
Wall St's ""fear gauge"", the VIX index of 30-day implied volatility in the S&P500, has ebbed from pre-U.S. election highs and is less than a quarter of the raging March peak as the virus exploded. But it's still some 20% above its mean since 2005 - a period that takes in whirlwinds surrounding this pandemic and the Great Financial Crisis of 2007/08.
The U.S. Treasury bond market's equivalent index, the MOVE, is by contrast now almost 50% below its mean over the same 15-year period. 
The Federal Reserve's expected suppression of borrowing rates close to likely floor near zero largely explains the bond side of that picture, with post-election government gridlock expected to rein in more extreme fiscal spending speculation.
That said, the confidence is impressive given the Federal Reserve has so far eschewed any formal government yield cap and has stopped short to date of extending the maturity of its bond buying programmes to longer-dated issues.
But if bond markets' assumption of subdued Treasury volatility going forward proves true, then implied equity caution is even more puzzling - not least given the outsize forecasts being clocked for the S&P500 over the coming year.
Both banking giants JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now forecast the S&P500 to gain a further 25% at least over the next two years - with JPM seeing that possible by the end of this year.
While a gain of 25% would still be less that 2019's full-year surge, there have only been 10 other years since 1970 that have managed gains of more than 25%. And next year it will most likely be starting close to record highs.
""AWFULLY MISPRICED""
Citi analysts describe the behaviour of equity and bond market volatility as an ""interesting medium-term dynamic"" that should rectify gradually as the recovery kicks in next year.
""We view next year as being a positive backdrop for equities with potential for further curve steepening,"" they wrote. ""Historically, such an environment sees fixed income volatility rise while equity volatility is flat or falls.""
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) concurs on the Treasury side at least and their rationale perhaps squares the circle to some degree.
Forecasting a boom in nominal U.S. gross domestic product growth next year of 7.5% as vaccines kick in, they claim that 10-year Treasury yield of 1% for next 12 months looks ""awfully mispriced"".
What's more, even many of the economists who do expect the Fed to conduct either an explicit or implicit yield cap policy don't expect it to draw the line until 10-year rates hit 1.50% at least - almost twice where they are at the moment.
Morgan Stanley reckons this bond risk has significant implications for the valuation of ""long duration"" sectors such as technology stocks so beloved during the pandemic lockdowns. And this is hurrying the sharp rotation we've seen this month out of these stocks and into cyclicals and small cap firms.
As vaccine breakthroughs hit the headlines this month, the Russell 2000 capturing the wider universe of smaller U.S. equities has gained almost 20% - twice the rise in the S&P500, far ahead of the 8% gain in the Nasdaq100 and almost four times the narrow grouping of tech leaders of the FANG+TM index.
""The real opportunity next year for investors is likely to take place below the surface in smaller-cap stocks that have greater sensitivity to what is likely to be a very strong economic recovery,"" Morgan Stanley conclude.
While the overall equity bull market can continue, it can also contain some violent switches that can make for quite volatile gains. What's more, expected vaccine rollouts early next year will take time and, until then, there's still a pandemic, periodic lockdowns and economic damage to negotiate.
That's also true for bonds and may be keeping some investors in those bunkers for longer, while the assumption of Fed policy support has rarely been disappointed in the past. 
But the historically skewed pricing of risk may have to shift once a truer, post-pandemic rebound finally gets underway.

944,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>","Wall Street's rise from pandemic lows has further to go, say strategists: Reuters poll","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 is poised to climb 9% between now and the end of 2021 as the anticipated widespread release of a COVID-19 vaccine drives an economic and corporate earnings recovery from the pandemic, according to a Reuters poll of strategists.
After a more than 60% recovery from the March lows of the outbreak to a record high on Nov. 16, the benchmark index is now up about 10% in the year to date.
The benchmark S&P 500 will finish 2021 at 3,900, a 9% gain from its close Monday of 3,577.59, according to the median forecast of 40 strategists polled by Reuters over the last two weeks.
The index is expected to end 2020 at 3,600, close to its current level, according to the poll median.
Recent evidence of high efficacy rates in experimental COVID-19 vaccines has driven an advance in equities this month, and strategists in the poll cited progress in the vaccine as the main factor behind their forecasts.
""They assume a vaccine is widely available starting some time in the second half of 2021,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, which has a 2021 year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 3,900.
With a big pickup in the economy expected to follow, Wall Street is likely ""grossly underestimating"" next year's rebound in earnings, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who sees the S&P 500 ending next year at 4,100.
""That's one thing I think could be a huge driving force,"" for stocks, he said.
Wall Street analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to jump 23% in 2021 after falling more than 15% in 2020, according on I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Asked when earnings will return to pre-COVID-19 levels, most respondents said it would happen within a year.
Graphic: When will corporate earnings return to pre-COVID-19 levels in the U.S. stock market?, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/POLL/jbyprebdzve/chart.png
Recent hopes related to the vaccine have breathed new life into cyclical stocks, such as industrials and energy shares, which investors dumped earlier during the pandemic.
Based on the poll, the Dow Jones industrial average, which was near 30,000 through Monday, will finish next year at 32,500, up around 10% from Monday's close.
Some strategists predict the gains in cyclicals will extend far into 2021, but others say the rotation may not be long-lived.
Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities, is neutral on cyclicals heading into 2021. In his outlook for next year, he wrote that, ""the fundamental case for TECH+ remains compelling"" based on expected growth in sales and margins, among other factors. He forecasts the S&P 500 will end next year at 4,050.
The S&P 500 technology sector, which includes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., is up roughly 30% for the year so far and leading gains among sectors, followed by the consumer discretionary sector, which includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Investors were upbeat after Democrat Joe Biden's win in the U.S. presidential election without a ""Blue Wave"" sweep by Democrats earlier this month, a feeling that's likely to linger if a divided Congress means limited regulatory changes and Biden's Cabinet picks are market-friendly.
On Monday, investors cheered reports that Biden had picked former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to be the next Treasury secretary.
Strategists in the poll said expectations the Fed will remain accommodative help to bolster the case for equities next year.
""The Fed has said they intend to keep short rates grounded at zero through at least 2023. With ultra low rates, stocks have little competition,"" said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Radnor, Pennsylvania.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main share index is set to extend its rally over the coming year as the likely rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine bolsters prospects for the economically sensitive financial and resource stocks that dominate the index, a Reuters poll found.
The median forecast in a survey of more than 20 portfolio managers and strategists was for the S&P/TSX Composite index to rise nearly 8% to 18,400 by the end of 2021. That was higher than the 18,000 forecast in August's poll, and would surpass February's record high of 17,970.51.
The index has rebounded from an eight-year low in March at 11,172.73. 
""The run-up in stocks will likely not end in 2021 as (U.S.) stimulus likely comes early in the new year, vaccines start to get distributed in the second half of the year and most companies go back to normal in the latter part of 2021,"" said Sadiq Adatia, chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments.
Investors are hoping for progress in Washington in talks to craft a new fiscal relief package, while the recent surge in global coronavirus cases has been offset by encouraging news from a number of major drugmakers on the effectiveness of their candidate vaccines.
When asked if their forecasts were based on recent vaccine progress, three quarters of the poll's respondents said they were.
A vaccine rollout would ""benefit Canada more than most countries because of the large proportion of value and cyclical stocks on the TSX,"" said Matt Skipp, president of SW8 Asset Management.
Cyclical stocks tend to be sensitive to the economic cycle. They include financial and resource stocks, which account for more than 50% of the TSX's valuation.
Pent-up demand should result in a surge in economic activity in the second half of 2021, according to Mike Archibald, a portfolio manager at AGF Investments. 
""Energy demand should return to more normal levels, helping the Canadian energy sector, and improving activity should result in better conditions for the Canadian banks,"" he said.
The TSX is expected to end 2020 at 17,100, barely changed from its current level.
The index is less expensive than some others, with a higher weighting in technology or other sectors more favored by investors during the pandemic. Its price-to-earnings ratio is about 13, using forward-looking earnings estimates, compared to 22.4 for the S&P 500, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv showed. 
A slight majority of contributors forecast earnings would return roughly to pre-COVID-19 levels within a year or earlier. 
""Rebounding corporate earnings, along with ongoing monetary policy stimulus and fiscal stimulus, will continue to provide broad support,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategy analyst at Edward Jones.

""The rightsizing programme foresees a reduction of approximately 1,000 positions in service and regional structures.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mostly higher Wednesday, taking their lead from a record-breaking session on Wall Street, as the global economic outlook improves based on optimism over potential coronavirus vaccines.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, but CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%. 
Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5% to close above 30,000 for the first time, while the S&P 500 gained 1.6%, to 3,635.41, also a record high. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.3%.
Increased certainty in the U.S. political process, with President-elect Joe Biden finally formally beginning the transition to the White House, has helped market confidence. 
But the major factor has been growing optimism that vaccines to treat Covid-19 will be available soon, with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) reporting positive results for its candidate on Monday.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech have already filed for emergency use authorization for their drug, while  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)  said last week it expects to submit its filing in the coming weeks after establishing its drug's effectiveness.  
Workable vaccines are desperately needed, with the latest European PMI data pointing to a double-dip recession on the back of the recent government-mandated restrictions.
Some governments have started scaling back these lockdowns ahead of the important Christmas shopping period, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to propose a further tightening of the country’s coronavirus restrictions until at least Dec. 20. 
The European data slate is largely empty Wednesday, but there are a lot of important numbers due out of the U.S. ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, including jobless claims and the latest GDP release.
In corporate news, Swiss-based chemicals business  Clariant  (SIX:CLN) plans to cut around 1,000 jobs amid a series of divestments.
Oil prices continued to push higher Wednesday, despite data pointing to a build in U.S. crude supplies, as traders look to future increases in demand on the back of expectations of a prompt rollout of Covid-19 vaccines. 
U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.8 million barrels last week, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute, with the official government report due out later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $45.12 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.8% to $48.14, with both benchmarks above the $45 mark for the first time since March.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,802.75/oz, earlier dropping through the $1,800 level for the first time since July, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1896.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's strong construction machinery sales are expected to continue until at least early next year but could be hobbled by any slowdown in Beijing's recent infrastructure investment drive, industry executives said. 
Construction equipment makers have experienced unexpectedly robust sales in China this year, especially for excavators, after the country embarked on a fresh building spree to bolster the economy following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
XCMG Construction Machinery told Reuters its sales in China had jumped by over 20% this year versus 2019, although overseas sales have been hit by the global spread of the virus. 
Rivals such as Japan's Komatsu (OTC:KMTUY) have similarly said they have seen a recovery in demand from China.
""Our original forecasts were not for such high-speed growth especially since it's the last year of China's 13th five year plan,"" said XCMG's Chairman Wang Min in an interview on the sidelines of the biennial Bauma China fair. The industry traditionally sees fewer new construction projects starting in such a year.
China's 14th five-year economic plan will be revealed at the annual parliament meeting in early 2021, with a focus on technology and domestic demand.
Overall, the industry is expected to see a 15% or more year-on-year jump in China sales this year, according to consultancy Off-Highway Research, which had previously forecast sales to fall 8% prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. 
""We will definitely see growth in the first half of next year, but the second half, whether expectations will change, we have to see what policy decisions the National People's Congress make,"" Off-Highway's Director of Research Shi Yang, referring to the country's parliament. The consultancy is currently forecasting a 10% sales decline for 2021.
Rosy sales in China have not necessarily translated to profit jumps for equipment manufacturers, as a more players join a lingering price war, he added.
U.S.-based  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), the world's largest equipment maker, unveiled a new range of cheaper, 20-ton ""GX"" hydraulic excavators for the Chinese market at the fair, which attendees said were being advertised by dealers for as low as 666,000 yuan ($101,000). Generally, Caterpillar's excavators sell for about 1 million yuan, they said. 
A Caterpillar spokeswoman said the new series enabled it to offer equipment at a lower low price point and cost per hour. 
""Competition in China is very fierce, the prices for some standard products have fallen to levels where they can't really go any lower anymore,"" XCMG's Wang said.

(Reuters) - U.S. websites have seen a surge in travelers seeking expensive ironclad insurance this Thanksgiving, as Americans desperate to break the monotony of a year spent at home look to cover themselves against coronavirus-related risks.
Data from insurance comparison website Squaremouth on Tuesday showed the number of insurance policies purchased for U.S. domestic trips over the upcoming holiday was up 170%, compared to the same period of 2019.
Some 40% of all Thanksgiving travelers specifically searched for coronavirus cover, replacing top concerns from previous years, such as weather and financial defaults, and spurring a rise in the overall cost of cover. 
""Cancel-for-any-reason"" policies, which typically allow cancellations up until two days before departure and a 75% reimbursement, cost up to 40% more than a regular policy.
""It's just gotten to a point I think people are tired of being stuck at home and they're looking to get away and go somewhere,"" said Jeremy Murchland, president of U.S. travel insurer Seven Corners.
More than 3 million passengers passed through U.S. airports over the weekend, discarding advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stay at home as coronavirus infections reached daily records.
Overall traveler numbers are still down 60% from a year ago, but Squaremouth, one of the country's main insurance price aggregators, said its data suggested that the total number of travelers seeking cover was up 26% year-on-year. 
The data from Squaremouth is based on all travel insurance policies purchased on its website between March 12 and Nov. 9 for travel over the week of Thanksgiving.
With trips to popular European destinations effectively banned, and the risks of quarantine and other curbs weighing on travelers' decision making, overall requests for cover to foreign locales were lower than those for domestic trips.
Those for the Bahamas and Costa Rica were down by just over half. Requests for insurance for trips to Mexico, however, were down just 23% year-on-year, and for the Turks and Caicos islands, just off Haiti, where luxury hotels are guaranteeing COVID-19-secure bubbles, they are up more than 500%. 
For those traveling outside the United States, a travel insurance policy that also has medical cover for COVID-19 will cover medical treatment that a normal healthcare policy would not, as well as potentially medical evacuation.
Courtney Glass, a California-based stage actress, is insuring a trip with her parents to Guatemala to rendezvous with her sister and newborn niece Madi. 
""Madi arrived right as the virus did. She's crawling and trying to talk now and we just don't want to miss any more of this time,"" she said. 

""If we don't go now, we probably won't go until after the holidays. And potentially, not until after the vaccine that everybody's talking about is distributed.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, taking their cues from U.S. shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 30,000 for the first time during the previous session as optimism over a possible COVID-19 vaccine and clarity over the U.S. presidential transition boosted risk appetite.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.60% by 10:29 PM ET (2:29 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.55%, with the Bank of Korea to hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.84%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.51%. Chief Executive Carrie Lam is due to deliver her annual policy address later in the day, with the city facing tightened social distancing measures as it battles a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases. 80 new daily infections were recorded on Tuesday.
In China, the Shanghai Composite inched up 0.07%, while the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.46%.
Confidence that a COVID-19 vaccine will be available soon is growing, with AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) reporting positive results for its candidate AZD 1222 on Monday. Offerings from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) have also reported positive results over the past two weeks.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has formally begun the transition to the White House, ending almost a month of post-election uncertainty as incumbent President Donald Trump challenged the results in court. Trump’s apparent willingness to comply, despite threats to continue with the legal challenges, allowed General Services Administration head Emily Murphy to green-light the start of the formal handover process.
News that former Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen could be tapped as the next Secretary of the Treasury also cheered markets. If nominated, Yellen is likely to focus on tackling growing economic inequality.
With a little over the month left until the end of 2020, vaccine optimism has some investors hopeful that the economic recovery will happen quickly once they become available.
“Looking three to six months out, we do think the recovery will maintain its momentum … when you see that reflation trade coming back, it’s telling you that investors are gaining confidence in growth prospects looking forward,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities LLC equity strategist Anna Han told Bloomberg.
However, ever-rising number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. prompted some states to re-introduce restrictions ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday. There are also fears that the large number of Americans expected to travel over Thanksgiving will lead to a spike in cases.
“Sentiment is running very hot as we come to the end of a cracker month for risk assets, so it does make you wonder whether the market is starting to exhibit signs of euphoria and is due for a bit of a retracement in the short-term,” IG Australia markets analyst Kyle Rodda told Reuters.
“But for all the risks the pandemic poses over the next few months ... market participants appear happy to look through it all, and position for a post-pandemic world,” Rodda added.
A slew of data is due out of the U.S. ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in the day, with U.S. jobless claims and GDP data also due to be released on the same day."

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Optimism around vaccine developments and expectations of a strong bounce in corporate confidence and profitability will push European stocks to near record highs next year, as policymakers look set to keep stimulus flowing.
A Reuters poll of 26 fund managers, strategists and brokers surveyed over the past two weeks expects the STOXX 600 to climb to 430 points by the end of 2021, just a whisker below February's record highs, as economic activity returns to normal following the COVID-19 downturn.
That is a 10.6% rise from Monday's closing price. It also represents a 60% jump from the 268 points low hit in March when lockdowns imposed across the world to limit the pandemic's spread triggered a rush to safety across global markets.
Promising results from three major pharmaceutical companies on their vaccine trials encouraged a wave of optimism across global stock markets, with the latest poll signalling a dramatic change in expectation for the STOXX 600.
In the previous quarterly poll, the index was seen reaching only 375 points in December and 410 points a year later.
""European economies and markets have a lot to gain as the global outlook improves,"" said Tomas Hildebrandt, senior portfolio manager and strategist at Evli Bank in Helsinki.
""We expect the pandemic will be suppressed, that the relations between the U.S. and China will ameliorate, boosting global trade and the global economic recovery will continue,"" he added, cautioning however that uncertainties remain significant.
BREXIT DEAL
Analysts said possible risks for European equities could arise from new lockdowns, a failure to reach a Brexit deal and delays in the European Union's policy response to ease the pandemic's economic damage.
Still the mood remains upbeat after promising trial results from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) this month raised the prospect of vaccine shots becoming available to large portion of Europe by early next year.
""Whist there are risks associated with the delivery of vaccination programmes globally, overall it looks like countries will be able to support a return to near-normal,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com in London.
Since Pfizer's announcement on Nov. 9, the global economic outlook has continued to improve, with IHS Markit's euro zone composite PMI future output index jumping to 60.1 in November from 56.5 in October, its highest since February.
European shares have risen 14% so far in November and are on track for the best month ever, even though the current quarter will be tough for companies due to the resurgence of the pandemic.
The stocks most battered by COVID-19, from oil, banks to travel and leisure, have led the charge and are expected to remain favoured as investors shift away from the so-called pandemic darlings of large-cap tech shares.
Germany's industrials-heavy DAX index will gain over 10% from current levels by the end of next year, touching 14,500 points, not far from the record high it reached in February, according to the Reuters poll.
But there is more to it than vaccine only.
Expectations of more stimulus from the European Central Bank and the bloc's 1.8 trillion euro plan to recover from the recession will also offer support, along with expectations London and Brussels will clinch a last-minute Brexit trade deal.
Stimulus and Brexit will encourage ""global investors to rebuild investments across Europe from more than just pandemic progress perspective"", said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James in London.
According to the poll, the UK's top FTSE 100 share index is expected to reach 6,900 points by end 2021, up 8.9% from Monday's close. France's CAC 40 is seen at 6,172 points, up 12.4%, Italy's FTSE MIB at 24,000 points, up 10.6%, and Spain's IBEX at 9,000 points, up 12.8%.

That is slightly below the index's close on Tuesday of 26,165.59, but nearly 12% higher than the previous Reuters poll in August that forecast the index at 23,300 at year's end.
The median forecast in the poll expects the Nikkei to remain at 26,000 by next June before rising to 27,350 at the end of 2021, which would be its highest level since August 1990. 
On Tuesday the Nikkei marked its highest close since May 1991, joining a global equity rally boosted by a wave of promising developments on coronavirus vaccines.
""Stock prices have been overheated, globally. Considering the recent novel coronavirus infections, some upcoming economic indicators will be inevitably worse,"" said Hiroshi Namioka, strategist and fund manager at T&D Asset Management. 
""As a result, we predict there will be a revision of forward EPS estimates and a correction in overvalued stocks,"" he said.
Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank, also warned the overheated market is ""overly pricing in hopes that are far from the real economy.""
The Nikkei has surged to levels unseen since the collapse of the bubble economy and is up more than 13.8% this month, even though the world is seeing another wave of infections.
Rising coronavirus cases in several parts of Japan prompted the Japanese government to pause its domestic travel campaign in the cities of Osaka and Sapporo on Tuesday.
Still, some analysts are optimistic stocks will continue to trade near three-decade highs until the end of 2021, on expectations central banks will continue to pursue their easing monetary policy to support pandemic-battered economies.
""The U.S. Federal Reserve is currently speculated to further loosen its monetary policy amid another coronavirus wave. This could result in a 'money glut' market and push Japanese stocks higher from year-end to spring next year,"" said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) Financial.

The company also forecast fourth-quarter sales to be flat or slightly higher than last year, and warned of pressure on margins from elevated shipping costs, including air freight, as retailers rush to move merchandise ahead of the holiday season. 
Online sales surged 61% in the third quarter as stuck-at-home customers shopped for comfortable joggers, yoga pants and tops from its Old Navy and Athleta brands, helping Gap report a surprise rise in comparable sales.

957,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>","Analysis: Shocked by sacred sites blast, investors press mining firms to revamp heritage oversight","By Melanie Burton and Clara Denina 
MELBOURNE/LONDON (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s destruction of sacred Indigenous rock shelters in Australia this year has dismayed and galvanised a swathe of investors who want big changes in how mining firms manage heritage issues and have begun to tell them so.
They have stepped up communication with mining companies both in volume and frequency, putting them on notice to improve accountability and risk management, according to Reuters interviews with two dozen major investors and corporate governance advisers.
Such engagement is nothing to be sneezed at, they add.
""(For) many of the most influential investors, a quiet conversation with the chair to make their expectations clear is enough. More transactional approaches are often unnecessary,"" said Susheela Peres da Costa, head of advisory at Regnan, an adviser on environment, social and governance (ESG) issues.
Regnan is part of the Pendal Group which has some A$94.8 billion ($70 billion) under management.
However, failure by miners to adequately address concerns could at some point lead to more direct shareholder actions, as has been seen with other ESG issues such as climate change and the use of coal, advisers said.
Those actions would generally come in three forms: efforts to influence the makeup of company boards, resolutions put forward at annual general meetings on cultural heritage issues and walking away from a firm by divesting.
""I think we will see that investors are going to be much more proactive in how they vote on directors and how they influence the shape of the boards,"" said Simon O’Connor, chief executive of the Responsible Investment Association Australasia, whose members manage more than A$9 trillion.
That influence was on display when Rio Tinto parted ways with its CEO and two deputies in September, bowing to a shareholder outcry over the blasting of the Juukan Gorge sites - which had been legal but ignored the wishes of Aboriginal owners - as well Rio's initial board-led review which found no one person was accountable.
In the wake of the blasts, Rio and fellow top iron ore miners BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) have all reviewed their heritage management processes.
Rio, in particular, has increased its oversight and accountability to include reviews of its heritage management by board sustainability and audit committees and has said it will benchmark its progress.
BHP has said it has since introduced a requirement for more senior level approval before any site is harmed and has also stepped up its discussions with Indigenous groups. 
Fortescue CEO Elizabeth Gaines told Reuters in a statement the company works on a ""cultural heritage avoidance basis"" and has avoided nearly 6,000 sites. Its audit committee, which reports to its board, is responsible for Aboriginal heritage matters.
STARTING WITH LETTERS
Institutional investors are increasingly focusing on ESG issues to mitigate risk for the long-term investments they hold.
Shareholder campaigns against the use of thermal coal for example, have led to more than 120 financial institutions restricting related financing, insurance or investment, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
The first salvo by investors has often been the humble letter, and investors in miners are now seeking more information about their dealings with Indigenous peoples and the standards they employ.
Last month, the boards of 78 global mining companies received one such letter from a large group of institutional investors worth $10.2 trillion that includes the likes of the Church of England Pensions board and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors.
Many are taking action on their own. HESTA, an Australian superannuation fund with A$2 billion invested in the mining industry, has written to 14 miners in which it has holdings. Details it is seeking include how management communicates with Indigenous peoples and how they practice obtaining consent.
While HESTA's head of impact, Mary Delahunty, told a parliamentary inquiry that divesting was a last resort, at least one prominent fund manager has already gone there.
Ausbil, which had A$11.1 billion under management as of June, cut its Rio holdings to zero in August, its head of ESG research Mans Carlsson-Sweeny has said, citing failed internal governance procedures. Rio had featured in the fund's top 10 holdings just a month earlier.
Corporate advisers say one area of focus in heritage issues is likely to be how boards get independent information. 
Boards will need access to information that bypasses management, said Daniel Smith, a governance advisor with CGI Glass Lewis. To that end, a specialist heritage advisor reporting directly to the board could be appointed, or a board could have an ESG subcommittee responsible for stakeholder management including of traditional owners, he said.
Many mining companies have yet to appoint chief sustainability officers to manage ESG exposure, said Henning Gloystein at risk consultancy Eurasia Group.
He added that companies which have executive bonuses directly tied to clear, measurable ESG outcomes also assess better on ESG metrics.

The 30-year-old hails from the southwestern province of Guizhou, home of Moutai, and was raised to know the drink's value: her parents sold 12 bottles to raise 250,000 yuan ($38,000) for a downpayment for her apartment in the capital.
A special 'Year of the Rat' bottle that Yang purchased for 1,699 yuan at the start of 2019 is now worth almost double, about 3,000 yuan, according to e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Taobao marketplace - typical for the general growth in prices that are now their highest on record, drinks specialists say.
Kweichow Moutai tightly controls the supply of its drinks, with retail prices starting around 1,500 yuan for bottles that have for years been the tipple of choice for China's elite government and business circles. It nurtures a luxury image in the country's giant baijiu sector, with a market value of more than $300 billion - the most valuable listed company in China. 
But demand for vintage bottles beyond the company's retail reach has reached dizzy heights this year, analysts and shopkeepers say, thanks to a flood of new buyers seeking safe-haven investments during pandemic uncertainty. 
""Recently the overall economic environment was bad, anything that has a potential to increase in value is popular,"" said independent liquor industry analyst Cai Xuefei. Fine international wines and spirits have long been a target for wealthier Chinese.
""Moutai is not only for drinking, it is a social tool, an identity indicator. As people believe older Moutai will be only more valuable, there is little risk in hoarding (bottles).""
The rampant prices have also now lured many liquor stores into trading collector bottles. Cai estimates as many as 20% of shops in China that were not previously in the market piled in during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Bricks-and-mortar stores are also trusted more by some customers as less likely to sell fake Moutai, on which police have cracked down in recent years.
Kweichow Moutai did not respond to repeated phone calls from Reuters. 
'MAKES ME COUGH'
Investment options available to the Chinese public are limited due to stringent controls on outbound money transfers. Valuations on alternatives like property or the stock market have been curbed by government controls or previous burst bubbles. 
""The financial feature of Moutai as an investment became obvious to many during the pandemic, and the price of old Moutai moved up stably and now stands at a historical high,"" said Guangzhou-based independent analyst Zhu Danpeng.
Moutai's drinks, consumed neat, often downed in shots, firstly sell fast in the primary market, even at already hefty prices. 
Its signature Feitian 53 range - known as 'Flying Fairy', with 53% alcohol by volume - starts at 1,499 yuan is heavily traded by speculators. Last year, U.S. retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) sold out a stock of 10,000 bottles in just two days, at the opening of its first China outlet in Shanghai. 
But Moutai also makes special edition, colourful bottles, like the annual Chinese zodiac range, and even a memorial bottle named after Hong Kong action movie star Jackie Chan that it rolled out in 2012.
The company lost some of its lustre during a high-profile anti-corruption drive by President Xi Jinping launched in 2012 that reined in lavish entertainment spending by businesses and government officials.
But Moutai bounced back after an internal clean-up that saw some top executives arrested and a revamp of its distribution network. 
For some consumers and collectors, the high-alcohol liquor has always been difficult to drink - and the increasing prices only add to their reluctance to do so. 
""I don't like the strong taste. It makes me cough,"" said Beijing buyer Yang, adding that she tended to prefer champagne or wine.
""It's more and more difficult to afford but the good thing is the value of my collection is rising.""

959,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>",Retailers already fear U.S. holiday 'shipageddon'; now here come vaccines,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Deliveries of holiday gifts purchased online at major retailers could get delayed by something far more critical - COVID-19 vaccines. 
Pharmaceutical companies including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) as early as mid-December could begin sending inoculations to U.S. healthcare workers and nursing home residents.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) could make space for those shipments on cargo planes by bumping off packages from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and other retailers. 
""FedEx is prioritizing vaccines,"" company spokeswoman Bonny Harrison told Reuters. 
While vaccines could displace some FedEx Express air shipments, they will not affect the separate FedEx Ground network that depends on trucks and delivers the majority the company's holiday volume, Harrison said. 
UPS, without elaborating, said it is prepared for holiday and vaccine shipments. UPS and FedEx are transportation providers to the federal government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine project. 
The additional cargo could cause problems for retailers who were already worried about a year-end ""shipageddon"" in the United States, where peak holiday demand and a pandemic-fueled surge in online orders of everything from food to furniture risk overwhelming delivery networks. 
During the peak holiday season, many more products use air versus ground transportation, said Alan Amling, distinguished fellow at the University of Tennessee's Global Supply Chain Institute. 
The vaccine is ""going to strain the industry, but when it comes to the trade-offs, I'll take the vaccine,"" said Amling, a former UPS executive. 
""It could not start at any worse time,"" said Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix, a delivery tracking and management firm. He does not expect impatient shoppers to give the carriers a blanket pass for putting the nation's health before their last-minute holiday gifts. 
""Seeing how American consumers are handling the recommendations for safety during the pandemic, they will be more upset about their Christmas online orders being delayed,"" Jindel said. 
Retailers like Target and Best Buy launched Christmas promotions before Halloween, the earliest ever, to spread deliveries of online orders across a longer time frame. Those and other projects are designed to prevent networks from buckling when demand spikes. 
""This would include vaccines that may be approved for distribution during the holiday peak season,"" said Mike Parra, chief executive for DHL Express Americas, a UPS and FedEx rival. Melissa Dorko, 41, and her husband are ordering holiday gifts weeks earlier than usual this year. 

""We are never this buttoned up,"" said Dorko, a mother of three who used to be a last-minute Christmas shopper on Amazon.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Auto service company Monro pushed by activist Ides to make changes,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Monro Inc, an operator of U.S. car service and tire centers, is under pressure from an activist investor to improve returns and change operations, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Hedge fund Ides Capital has reached out to Monro's board and followed up with letters, urging the company to make changes that also include environmental, social and governance (ESG) improvements like diversifying its workforce and boardroom, according to the sources. 
Monro's lack of diversity, especially in the boardroom, and broader ESG issues have held back the company, the hedge fund argued, according to the sources.
As recently as last month the hedge fund again expressed its concerns to Monro's board about performance. Monro is valued at $1.5 billion.
Monro's stock climbed 7.83% on Tuesday to close at $48.35.
Ides declined to comment.
Monro said it interacts regularly with shareholders and appreciates their input. ""Promoting a diverse organization is a key pillar of our company and a priority for our Board of Directors. Our diversity and inclusion efforts are ongoing and will be an important factor as we formalize our environmental, social and governance program to better inform our shareholders of our initiatives,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement.
Monro's eight-member board had been largely male and white and had served an average of 17 years, far longer than the Standard & Poor's 500 companies' average of 11 years. In August it added its first-ever racially diverse director, which changed that average. The board now has two female directors.
The hedge fund has asked that Monro report its diversity statistics and ESG metrics publicly, according to the sources.
Since January, the company's stock price has tumbled 43% and in August its chief executive officer, Brett Ponton, left, creating fresh worries for investors.
Monro's board has been looking for a new CEO since Ponton resigned to join $6.7 billion ServiceMaster Company as CEO.
Dianne McKeever co-founded Ides in 2015 with Rob Longnecker, and won success when companies like AstroNova and  Boingo Wireless  (NASDAQ:WIFI) diversified their boards. Earlier this year, Chuck Royce, a pioneer in small-cap investing, and Stride Capital Group, a seed investor, made strategic investments in Ides. 
Ides' campaign at Monro coincides with a wave of consolidation in the auto parts and repair business. Meritage (NYSE:MTH) acquired Les Schwab Tire Centers earlier this year, while Golden Gate Capital bought Express Oil in 2017 and Mavis in 2018. Last week Mavis said it would buy Town Fair Tire Centers.
Monro is one of the last sizable targets in the industry and the sources said Ides has encouraged Monro to explore all alternatives to maximize shareholder value as it also searches for a new CEO.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.54%, or 454 points, and is up more than 60% since its March lows. The S&P 500 was up 1.62%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.31%.
Investor hopes for an orderly transition of power were given a boost after the General Services Administration informed President-elect Joe Biden that federal resources will be made available for his transition into the Oval Office.

Investing.com -- Happy 30k Day! The Dow jumped to above the level for the first time ever.  
The presidential transition from Donald Trump to Joe Biden has begun as the President-elect announces key positions, including the possibility of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen becoming his Treasury Secretary nominee. 
Value stocks rose on the backs of three possible vaccines and a reopening of the world -- even as Los Angeles cracked down on outdoor dining and New York set up travel checkpoints to curb the spread of Covid-19. Oil prices were also higher, alongside airlines.
Housing prices also continuing to trend higher as demand stays strong. Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. The state of the economy 
The second print of third-quarter GDP will likely continue to show a major rebound in economic activity from the second quarter. Economists are not expecting any major revisions from the prior 33.1% reading. The number comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
On jobs, analysts are looking to see whether last week's number was a one-off, or the beginning of a trend. Initial jobless claims spiked last week amid the jump in Covid-19 cases, but consensus is for a drop to 730,000 from the prior 742,000. This number also comes out at 8:30 AM ET.
Look for a decline in both income and spending for October with the end of stimulus and unemployment benefits. Economists expect income to dip to 0.1% from 0.9% and spending to fall to 0.4% from 1.4%. These numbers are due out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
There's also durable goods orders, new home sales and the University of Michigan Sentiment reading.
2. Earnings from a big industrial component
Deere (NYSE:DE) is the highlight of the earnings calendar, with earnings per share of $1.38 on sales of $7.57 billion. The company's initial 2021 outlook -- assuming one is provided -- will be keenly watched.
3. Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee
If all that economic data doesn't do it for you, we'll also get a look at the FOMC meeting minutes from earlier this month. The minutes are released at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT). Fed watchers will parse the text for clues on possible changes to asset purchases, with some economists expecting a bump in December.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with the Dow piercing the 30,000 level for the first time, as investors anticipated a 2021 economic recovery on progress on coronavirus vaccines and the formal clearance for President-elect Joe Biden's transition to the White House.
Each of the 11 major S&P sectors was higher, led by economically sensitive stocks such as industrials, which climbed to a record, along with the financials, up 2.8% and energy, up 4.2%.
President Donald Trump finally gave the green light for the formal transfer of power to begin on Monday, a process that was delayed for weeks despite Democrat Joe Biden emerging as the clear winner in the elections. The General Services Administration told Biden he could formally begin the hand-over process.
""You had the GSA transitioning and Trump saying he is going to cooperate. That is a positive,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.
""Nobody was worried about it, but just the fact you're greasing the wheels for the transition instead of trying to throw a monkey wrench in them is decent news.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 395.22 points, or 1.34%, to 29,986.49; the S&P 500 gained 51.48 points, or 1.44%, at 3,629.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 140.41 points, or 1.18%, at 12,021.05.
Recent data suggesting a COVID-19 vaccine could be available before the end of the year has put the S&P 500 on course for its best November ever and sparked demand for value-linked stocks that were hammered following the coronavirus-driven crash earlier this year.
U.S. officials said on Tuesday they plan to release 6.4 million COVID-19 vaccine doses nationwide in an initial distribution after the first one is cleared by regulators for emergency use.
Sentiment this week was also boosted by reports that Biden planned to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary, which could shift the focus heavily toward efforts to tackle growing economic inequality.
Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc jumped 6.7%, boosting its market value to over $500 billion, as investors lapped up its shares in the run-up to its addition to the S&P 500 index.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co gained 2.8% after European regulators gave draft approval to its 737 MAX jets, paving the way for a formal flight clearance in January.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, on Monday upgraded U.S. equities to ""overweight,"" turning bullish on quality large-cap technology companies and small cap firms that tend to perform well during a cyclical upswing.
Still, with coronavirus cases surging by the day and millions of Americans still unemployed, some analysts suggested the U.S. stock market could be prone to a pullback from record levels in the next few weeks.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 03:01PM ET</span>",OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma pleads guilty to criminal charges,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Purdue Pharma LP pleaded guilty to criminal charges over the handling of its addictive prescription painkiller OxyContin, capping a deal with federal prosecutors to resolve an investigation into the drugmaker's role in the U.S. opioid crisis. 
During a court hearing conducted remotely on Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Madeline Cox Arleo in New Jersey, Purdue pleaded guilty to three felonies covering widespread misconduct.
The criminal violations included conspiring to defraud U.S. officials and pay illegal kickbacks to both doctors and an electronic healthcare records vendor called Practice Fusion https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-investigation-opioids-e/exclusive-oxycontin-maker-purdue-is-pharma-co-x-in-u-s-opioid-kickback-probe-sources-idUSKBN1ZR2RY, all to help keep opioid prescriptions flowing.
Members of the billionaire Sackler family who own Purdue and previously sat on the company's board were not part of Tuesday's court proceedings and have not been criminally charged. They agreed in October to pay a separate $225 million civil penalty for allegedly causing false claims for OxyContin to be made to government healthcare programs such as Medicare. They have denied the allegations.
Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Stephen Ferketic said officials reserved the right to prosecute individuals associated with Purdue, including owners, officers and directors. Sackler family members have said they acted ethically and responsibly while serving on Purdue's board and were assured the company's sales and marketing practices complied with legal and regulatory requirements.
Purdue Chairman Steve Miller entered the guilty plea on the company's behalf and admitted to its criminal conduct under questioning from Ferketic. Of the three criminal counts against Purdue, two were for violations of a federal anti-kickback law while another charged the Stamford, Connecticut-based company with defrauding the United States and violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 
Purdue's plea deal carries more than $5.5 billion in penalties, most of which will go unpaid. A $3.54 billion criminal fine is set to be considered alongside trillions of dollars in unsecured claims as part of Purdue's bankruptcy proceedings. 
Purdue agreed to pay $225 million toward a $2 billion criminal forfeiture, with the Justice Department foregoing the rest if the company completes a bankruptcy reorganization dissolving itself and shifting assets to a ""public benefit company"" or similar entity that steers the $1.775 billion unpaid portion to thousands of U.S. communities suing it over the opioid crisis.
A sentencing imposing those penalties is set to come around the time Purdue receives court approval for a bankruptcy reorganization.
Purdue earlier settled separate Justice Department civil claims, agreeing to a $2.8 billion penalty also expected to receive little financial recovery in the drugmaker's bankruptcy case.
The plea deal and other related settlements have come under fire from Democrats on Capitol Hill calling for Purdue and its owners to face more severe consequences for their alleged roles in the opioid crisis.
The company reaped more than $30 billion from sales of OxyContin over the years, enriching Sackler family members, according to U.S. and state officials. Since 1999, roughly 450,000 people have died in the United States from opioid-related overdoses, according to U.S. data.
Some two dozen state attorneys general have oppose https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-opioids-investigations/u-s-states-oppose-settlement-being-negotiated-by-oxycontin-maker-purdue-and-justice-department-letter-idUSKBN26Z2WJd the plea deal on the grounds that it effectively endorses a bankruptcy plan they contend would entangle local governments with a public benefit company that continues to sell OxyContin.
Purdue, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1W1058 under an onslaught of litigation, has proposed settling thousands of lawsuits in a deal it values at more than $10 billion. That is contingent on donations of opioid reversal and addiction treatment medications it has under development and a $3 billion cash contribution from the Sacklers, who would cede control of Purdue.
In addition to the kickbacks and vendor scheme, between 2007 and 2017, Purdue ignored doctors suspected of improperly prescribing opioids that were flagged by its internal controls, and failed to report OxyContin prescriptions from these physicians to the Drug Enforcement Administration as legally required, according to prosecutors.

A Purdue affiliate in 2007 agreed to plead guilty to misbranding OxyContin in a deal with prosecutors that resulted in about $600 million of penalties.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",U.S. tech firms can compensate gig-workers with equity under SEC proposal,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Tuesday proposed a pilot program to allow tech companies like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) to pay gig workers up to 15% of their annual compensation in equity rather than cash, a move it said was designed to reflect changes in the workforce.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said internet-based companies may have the same incentives to offer equity compensation to gig-workers as they do to employees. Until now, though, SEC rules have not allowed companies to pay gig workers in equity. 
The proposal would not require an increase in pay, just create flexibility on whether to pay using cash or equity. It comes amid a fierce debate over the fast-growing gig economy, which labor activists complain exploits workers, depriving them of job security and traditional benefits like healthcare and paid vacations. The SEC's Democratic commissioners said giving tech giants such flexibility would create an uneven playing field for other types of companies.
""Work relationships have evolved along with technology, and workers who participate in the gig economy have become increasingly important to the continued growth of the broader U.S. economy,"" said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in a statement. 
The proposed temporary rules would allow gig workers to participate in the growth of the companies their efforts support, he added, capped at 15% of annual compensation or $75,000 in three years.
Democratic SEC commissioners Allison Lee and Caroline Crenshaw opposed the move, saying alternative work arrangements, including independent contractors and freelancers, have existed for decades across a range of industries and it was not clear why tech companies should be singled out for special treatment.

""Whatever the potential merits of equity compensation for alternative workers, the proposal does not establish a basis for selectively conferring a benefit on this particular business model,"" they wrote in a statement.

970,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 02:47PM ET</span>","Dow Hits Historic 30,000 as Bulls Ride Value Stocks Higher","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com - The Dow jumped above a key milestone Tuesday, as easing uncertainty over the U.S. presidential transition paved the way for investors to get even more bullish on value stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.37 %, or 405 points, and had traded as high as 30,117 intraday. The S&P 500 was up 1.55%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.22%.
Investor hopes for an orderly transition of power were given a boost after The General Services Administration informed President-elect Biden that federal resources will be made available for his transition into the Oval Office.
The news comes as market participants appear to approve of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Biden's Treasury Secretary nominee.
""Yellen is seen as a very credible choice for the position overall and specifically, well equipped to drive the recovery from the destruction caused by the pandemic as she helped navigate the country in the aftermath of the Great Recession,"" Stifel said in a note.
Value stocks – those hitched to the performance of the economy – continued to rack up gains as investor bets on a quick roll out of the vaccine, speeding up the reopening of the economy.
Financials, industrials, and energy paved the way for the broader market rally, with the latter up more than 4% on rising oil prices.
Oil prices jumped 4% to their highest since the pandemic begun, on optimism over the demand outlook for 2021.
Industrials, meanwhile, were pushed higher by an ongoing rally in the airlines, with  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) up more than 8%.
The backdrop of mixed economic data and further signs the U.S. consumer, the backbone of the economy, is in trouble did little to thwart the rally on Wall Street.
The consumer confidence index fell to 96.1 in November from an upwardly revised 106.2 in October and came in below the consensus of 98.0. Pantheon Macroeconomics warned that this was ""likely not the bottom,"" though forecast a rebound to take hold in spring.
Housing activity, however, continues to strengthen as home prices rose at the fastest pace in six years.
Tech also powered the broader market higher as the Fab 5 bounced back from weakness seen in a day earlier.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) were higher.
In other news, Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) reported third quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, sending its shares up 13%."
971,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 02:41PM ET</span>","Analysis: Dow cracks 30,000, a psychological boost during a pandemic","By Alden Bentley
(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average clocked its fastest 10,000 point run up to cross 30,000 for the first time on Tuesday, giving the stock market a psychological boost at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has damaged the economy and left millions unemployed. 
Investor sentiment has been lifted by encouraging news about coming coronavirus vaccines and improving prospects for a smooth White House transition. But the milestone is less significant to professional investors. 
At 30,000 points the Dow could lure in small investors still on the sidelines who are now eager to share in the market exuberance. But market watchers say they are less impressed than they were with the 20,000 mark reached in January 2017, and technically speaking it means little beyond making a headline that can turn heads. 
Brian Levitt, Global Market Strategist at Invesco, advised clients in a blog not to be overly impressed or concerned by new records that offer very little information by themselves.
Dow 20,000 was met with much less fanfare than Dow 10,000 almost 18 years earlier, he noted.
""Many pundits coined it 'the least loved bull market in history.' Perhaps, after the tech wreck and the financial crisis, we were too world-weary to celebrate. And yet maybe the missing jubilation was as good a sign as any that the advance would continue."" 
The DJIA on Tuesday rose 1.46%, or 432 points, and traded at a record high 30,116 points, not quite four years after reaching the 20,000 mark on Jan 25, 2017. Catalysts included recent signs that a working COVID-19 vaccine could be available before the end of the year, based on promising trial results released by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN). 
The index eclipsed last Monday's high just under the threshold reached after Moderna said its COVID-19 vaccine had a 94.5% effective rate. 
Graphic: Dow Jones Industrial Average hits 30,000 points, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvklykdpm/Pasted%20image%201606235707755.png
Lubricating Tuesday's rally, President Donald Trump gave the go ahead to start helping the transition of President-elect Joe Biden, easing political uncertainty that has hung over markets since the Nov 3 election. A day earlier, the U.S. federal agency that must sign off on the transition gave Biden approval to begin the process.
As the 124-year old DJIA advances, each 10,000 milestone represents a smaller proportional gain. The index, which dates to 1896, first touched 10,000 in March 1999.
""Percentage wise, 20 to 30 is only 50%. It's a nice number to look at, and certainly will attract some retail folks, to say 'hey, the market's moving',"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""With that said I think this rally should be exhausting itself."" 
U.S. economic activity is reeling from the damage inflicted by lockdowns, although it has recovered some in recent months, and employment is at levels last seen in 2015. Trillions of dollars of U.S. central bank and government stimulus has helped power Wall Street's main indexes back to record highs.
Two weeks ago the Dow spiked 1,600 points, ending up more than 800 points, when Pfizer first revealed the high effectiveness and near readiness of its vaccine, which launched the benchmark S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small cap index to their own records. The Russell hit another record on Tuesday and the S&P is just short of its Nov 9 peak.
For the average person, the Dow is a well recognized proxy for the overall U.S. stock market. But to most investors its relevance, with only 30 large cap stocks, is not what it was.
The total Dow market capitalization is $9.2 trillion and a piffling $28.2 billion is indexed to it, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
The S&P, with 505 constituents, has a market cap of almost $32 trillion. It is far more important as a barometer of the overall market, with $4.6 trillion indexed to it. 
JJ Kinehan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Chicago, said the 30,000 level has psychological importance, but should be seen in the context of Wall Street's overall rally, led by mega cap tech stocks and companies that benefited from people shopping, ordering in, video chatting and exercising at home since the pandemic started.

""The big deal that's happening now is the fact that the stocks that have been so loved since March, the Zooms and Peletons of world, and so on, that they're looking for new areas to put their money and they are putting it in some of the stocks that have been unloved over the past few months,"" he said, pointing to the recent rally in beaten down energy stocks and financials.

(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), the largest U.S. home improvement retailer, on Tuesday reached a $17.5 million settlement to resolve a multistate probe into a 2014 data breach where hackers accessed payment card data belonging to 40 million customers.
The settlement with 46 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., stemmed from a breach between April 10, 2014, and Sept. 13, 2014, affecting customers who used self-checkout terminals at its U.S. and Canadian stores.
Hackers used a vendor's user name and password to infiltrate Home Depot's network, and deployed custom-built malware to access customers' payment card information.
The Atlanta-based retailer previously said at least 52 million people also had their email addresses exposed, partially overlapping those whose payment card data was compromised.
Home Depot did not admit liability in agreeing to the settlement, which requires that it hire a chief information security officer, and upgrade its security procedures and training. The probe was led by Connecticut, Illinois and Texas.
Companies that collect sensitive personal information from customers ""have an obligation to protect that information from unlawful use or disclosure,"" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. ""Home Depot failed to take those precautions.""
In a statement, Home Depot said security is a top priority, and that it has since 2014 ""invested heavily to further secure our systems. We’re glad to put this matter behind us.""

Home Depot had previously recorded $198 million of pretax expenses for the breach, and resolved litigation by customers, card issuers and banks that claimed they were harmed.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc blew past $500 billion in market value on Tuesday as investors snapped up its shares in the run-up to its debut in the S&P 500, extending a meteoric rally that has seen it surge over 500% this year.
The California electric carmaker's stock rose nearly 5%, putting its market capitalization at $519 billion. 
Tesla is Wall Street's seventh most valuable company, just behind Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) , and its shares have rallied over 30% since Nov. 16, when it was announced Tesla would join the S&P 500 benchmark.
Index funds that replicate the S&P 500 will have to buy more than $50 billion worth of Tesla's stock ahead of its inclusion to the index on Dec. 21. Additionally, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated last week that actively managed mutual funds could buy another $8 billion of Tesla shares after it is added.
Tesla has become by far the world's most valuable automaker, despite production that is a fraction of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) or General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Shares of other electric vehicle (EV) makers have also rallied in recent months as President-elect Joe Biden made boosting EVs a top priority during his campaign. 
Chinese electric carmaker Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc fell 4.9% on Tuesday, trimming its gain in November to 72%. 

""One of the core underpinnings of the Biden platform will be around pushing clean energy and zero-emissions vehicles with hopes of accelerating the deployment of electric vehicles and public charging outlets by 2030,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) has agreed to pay $250 million for risk management and other control failings in its asset and wealth management business, a U.S. regulator said on Tuesday, in the second chunky penalty for the bank in less than two months.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said it found that JPMorgan's risk management practices were ""deficient and it lacked sufficient controls to avoid conflicts of interest.""
The bank has since remediated the deficiencies that led to this action, it said. 
""We are committed to delivering best-in-class controls across our business, and we have invested significantly in and enhanced our controls platform over the last several years to address the issues identified,"" a spokesman for the bank said in a statement.
JPMorgan boasts one of the world’s largest and most complex asset and wealth management businesses, with $1.3 trillion in fiduciary assets and $27.8 trillion of non-fiduciary custody assets, the OCC said. The bank also provides a broad range of investment strategies to its fiduciary clients through a variety of investment vehicles.
For several years, however, JPMorgan operated a weak management and control framework for its fiduciary activities and had an insufficient audit program for, and inadequate internal controls over, those activities, the OCC said.
In its consent order with the bank, the OCC did not require changes to the way the bank manages client assets.

Tuesday's OCC penalty comes after the U.S. derivatives regulator fined https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty/jpmorgan-to-pay-920-million-for-manipulating-precious-metals-treasury-market-idUSKBN26K325 JPMorgan $920 million in September to settle federal U.S. market manipulation probes into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities, in a landmark case for the agency.

Global stock markets sank in February and March as the novel coronavirus spread across Europe and the United States, abruptly halting a bull run that dates back to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
While U.S. economic activity is reeling from the damage inflicted by lockdowns and employment is at levels last seen in 2015, a raft of monetary and fiscal stimulus has powered Wall Street's main indexes back to record highs.

For the blue-chip Dow, the journey to 30,000 from the 20,000-mark took less than four years, a much faster climb than the previous 10,000-point clamber, which took nearly two decades. The rise from 29,000 to 30,000 took the Dow about 10 months.

Shares are down about 3%.
Americans are hunkering down at home again after Covid-19 numbers surge, with more than 12.5 million people infected and almost 259,000 dead. Cities and states around the country have mandated shutdowns, once again. New York will implement vehicle checkpoints at key bridges and crossings, and will strictly enforce a travel quarantine, Bloomberg reported.

Urban Outfitters is shilling the party garb as daily evening wear, encouraging wearers to ""make every night feel like a party."" I think we'll stick with our PJs. 
The company reported third quarter earnings per share of 78 cents that beat the expected 44-cent profit on sales of $969 million, higher than the estimated $930 million.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Tuesday it has ordered a dozen ultra-cold freezers that can safely store  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine, a move aimed at ensuring the U.S. automaker's workers have access to vaccines when they are rolled out nationally.
Ford's purchase mirrors efforts by U.S. states and cities to buy equipment to store millions of doses of Pfizer's vaccine at temperatures of minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 C (36-46 F).
Health care providers and states are preparing for a new type of vaccines by Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc that require lower temperatures for storage.
""We're doing this so that we can make the vaccine available to our employees on a voluntary basis,"" Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said.
Details of how Ford will use the freezers, which are expected to be delivered by year end, are still being worked out, she said. 
Assembly workers are considered essential in most states, but not at the top of the list for vaccines, which are expected to be distributed first to healthcare workers and nursing home residents. 
Automakers have been largely able to avoid spread of the virus among hourly workers in their assembly plants after a two-month shutdown earlier in the year, but COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are spiking in the United States, especially in the Midwest.
Felker did not know which company is supplying Ford with the freezers. Major manufacturers include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (NYSE:TMO), PHC Corp of North America, Luxembourg's B Medical Systems, Stirling Ultracold and Helmer Scientific.
Some specialty freezer makers have warned of months-long waits for units.
Ford, which decided to buy the freezers on its own and is not working with other companies or states, did not disclose how much it spent, but the specialized freezers required by Pfizer's vaccine can cost $5,000 to $15,000 apiece, according to industry officials.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it had not purchased freezers at this time. ""We are taking steps to be prepared to make vaccines available to our employees when the time is right and vaccines are available to us,"" GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said.

Officials at  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the United Auto Workers union, which represents most U.S. hourly workers at the Detroit automakers, did not have an immediate comment. Michigan state health officials could not immediately be reached to comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airlines are on course to lose a total $157 billion this year and next, their main global body warned on Tuesday, further downgrading its industry outlook in response to a second wave of coronavirus infections and shutdowns afflicting major markets.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which in June had forecast $100 billion in losses for the two-year period, said it now projects a $118.5 billion deficit this year alone, and a further $38.7 billion for 2021.
The bleak outlook underscores challenges still facing the sector despite upbeat news on development of COVID-19 vaccines, whose global deployment will continue throughout next year.
""The positive impact it will have on the economy and air traffic will not happen massively before mid-2021,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters.
Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion this year from 4.5 billion in 2019, IATA estimates, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion next year. Passenger revenue for 2020 is expected to have plunged 69% to $191 billion.
""That's by far the biggest shock the industry has experienced in the post-World War Two years,"" IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said.
The forecasts assume significant re-opening of borders by the middle of next year, helped by some combination of COVID-19 testing and vaccine deployment.
IATA reiterated its call for governments to replace travel-stifling quarantine regimes with widespread testing programmes.
""We are seeing states progressively coming to listen to us,"" de Juniac said, citing testing initiatives underway in France, Germany, Italy, Britain, the United States and Singapore.
While some governments and airlines such as Australia's Qantas say passengers are likely to require vaccination for long-haul travel, the approach is unlikely to work everywhere, de Juniac said.
""It would prevent people who are refusing (the vaccine) from travelling,"" the IATA chief said. ""Systematic testing is even more critical to reopen borders than the vaccine.""
Air cargo, a rare bright spot for the industry as the grounding of flights pushes freight prices higher, will likely see global revenue rise 15% to $117.7 billion this year despite an 11.6% decline in volume to 54.2 million tonnes, IATA said.
Some $173 billion in government aid has left recipients with debts that threaten to hobble future investment, it warned, and more bankruptcies are likely. Norwegian Air became the latest casualty on Nov. 18, when it filed for bankruptcy protection in Ireland. 
The average airline now has enough liquidity to survive another 8.5 months, while some have just weeks, Pearce said. ""I think we will get consolidation through some airline failures.""

Peloton has been one of the biggest winners of the pandemic, with subscriptions for its classes almost doubling since March. Bikes cost close to $2,000, aside from a $39-a-month subscription fee. Delays are due to shipping problems, the Journal reported. That's been good for rivals like Nautilus and NordicTrack, with customers turning to those companies for faster delivery after whining in complaints on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) about the long waits.
It probably doesn't help Peloton that we've had news of three pretty effective vaccines over the past three weeks, which will likely prompt at least some portion of the population to return to gyms and group cycling classes. Not that things are looking down. 
Profit for the past two quarters has been at least double estimates, with sales also beating on both occasions. Revenue should cross the $1 billion mark for the current quarter, analysts estimate.

984,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",GE warns of more job cuts at aviation business amid sluggish recovery,"By Rachit Vats and Rajesh Kumar Singh
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Tuesday warned of more job cuts at its aviation unit, citing a lengthy recovery for the airline industry from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
The job cuts are the latest setback for the aviation sector, with the industry's woes expected to last into 2021 even as U.S. regulators ended a 20-month grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's MAX 737 jets and COVID-19 vaccine developers reported positive data.
""As we continue to closely monitor market conditions, we are examining a range of options to appropriately scale our business to match the realities of the global airline industry recovery from the severe impacts of COVID-19,"" the company said in a statement.
In an internal video message delivered on Friday, GE's aviation unit head John Slattery said additional job cuts would be a component of those options, a company official said.
The company's shares were up about 5% at $10.58.
The Boston-based conglomerate in May announced plans to cut the global workforce at its aviation unit by as much as 25% in 2020, or up to 13,000 jobs, citing prolonged aircraft reduction schedules caused by the pandemic.
Through the quarter to end-September, GE had reduced about 20% of its aviation workforce and realized close to $1 billion in cost savings.
Last month, the company said it was ""actively monitoring"" the pace of demand recovery to ensure the business was ""appropriately sized"" for the future.
Revenue at GE's aviation unit, its largest, fell 39% in the third quarter while aviation orders more than halved during the period, with a 60% decline in both commercial engines and commercial services.
This has compounded the troubles at GE's aviation unit, which makes engines for Boeing and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and had already been reeling from the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX planes.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the development.

Investing.com --  Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) rose 12% as we spend, spend, spend.
Earnings per share of $1.39 compared to the estimated $1.15 on sales of $6.18 billion, higher than the expected $6.12 billion. Fourth quarter sales are already ahead of the previous quarter.
“Dollar Tree delivered its strongest same-store sales performance in the past ten quarters,"" said Chief Executive Officer Mike Witynski in a statement. “We are just over three weeks into our important fourth quarter and we are off to a very good start, with same-store sales at both banners currently tracking above reported third quarter levels,"" Witynski said. 
Consolidated net sales increased 7.5% to $6.18 billion from $5.75 billion from a year earlier, with gross profit up 13% to $1.92 billion. Shares are trading close to a one-year high.
We also spent at Best Buy, but investors don't seem to be nearly as excited. Shares are down 6% despite an easy beat, with earnings per share of $2.06 versus $1.70 on sales of $11.85 billion compared to $10.97 billion.
“Today, we are once again reporting strong quarterly results in the midst of unprecedented times,” said Corie Barry, Best Buy CEO.
“Our comparable sales grew a remarkable 23%,"" Barry said in a statement. “From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth.""Investors may not like that Best Buy said it raised its starting wage to $15 an hour, paid out bonuses and reinstated short-term incentive compensation. Also, as with all things these days, Best Buy admitted uncertainty ahead and declined to provide guidance.
""While the demand for the products and services we sell remains at elevated levels as we start the fourth quarter, it is very difficult for us to predict how sustainable these trends will be due to the significant uncertainty related to the various impacts of the pandemic,"" said Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas.

986,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>",No Rest for Weary Traders Who Made It Home Long Before Holidays,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkeys are being deep fried and Christmas trees going up -- and so are stocks. Wall Street pros, for whom the holiday season usually bequeaths a breather, are expecting no such thing in 2020’s version of Thanksgiving.
“Yeah, it’s business as usual,” Jonathan Boyar, managing director at Boyar Value Group, said from his set-up in the suburbs of New York. “I am home the same way as I have been home since March,” he added, noting that he’s only “taking off Thursday and back to work on Friday.”
Historically, volume thins out around the November holiday. On Monday, a cool 12 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges -- up more than 10% from last week’s average -- as news broke of President-elect Joe Biden picking a Treasury secretary while investors coped with another fierce rotation into cruise lines and energy producers.
Thanksgiving week was one of Scott Bauer’s favorite times when he was a rookie at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Fewer of his co-workers tended to be in, and low volume often created opportunities for the nimble. Not this year.
Bauer, a 30-year veteran of the trading floor who is now chief executive officer at Prosper Trading Academy, will be working from his home office near Chicago, where he has six monitors arranged in a miniature makeshift trading pit. Like so many others, he’s been working from home since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted, blurring the distinction between this and any other week.
“It’s going to be markets as usual, and I think we’re going to see a very, very busy week. Just because it’s Thanksgiving week doesn’t mean that any of the risk headlines have gone away,” Bauer said from his home trading floor. “There’s a ton of opportunity in this market, so why miss out on it?”
Joseph Saluzzi, partner and co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading LLC in Chatham, New Jersey, noted that too much is going on to expect a peaceful break.
“All of a sudden something breaks, you’re like, ‘OK, change of plans, I’m back on my computer,’” Saluzzi said. “There will be more on-call types of trading situations, where they could be there if they need to be there. But there’s probably still people planning on taking a couple of days just to relax and stay with family a little bit more -- if they haven’t had enough of that already.”
Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management, thought he’d get a breather by now.
“It hasn’t really slowed down at all,” Snyder said. “And part of it is that everyone has kind of different lifestyles and when you don’t have the structure of the work office, it stretches from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.”

The electronic retailer, whose third-quarter sales and profit beat market expectations, said it does not expect quarterly revenue growth of more than 20% to continue into the holiday season, sending its shares down 6% in early trading.
""It continues to be difficult to predict how sustainable these trends will be. We are seeing COVID cases surge throughout the U.S. and Canada at a time of significant holiday volume through our stores,"" Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said, pointing to high unemployment.
At least 20 million Americans were on unemployment benefits at the end of October and about 12 million of them will lose benefits when two government-funded programs expire a day after Christmas. Another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed is unlikely before then. 
CFO Bilunas said fourth-quarter sales for one of the few retail winners in the health crisis have been strong so far, but that was due to new game consoles from Sony Corp (T:6758) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) as well as an earlier than ever start to holiday promotions. 
""We don't expect sales trends to remain at the levels we experienced during Q3,"" he said on a call with analysts.

989,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 09:59AM ET</span>",Ford’s new CEO tackles warranty costs in bid to boost profit,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Quality is once again Job One at Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
Taking a page from the automaker's ad slogan of the 1980s and '90s, Ford's new chief executive, Jim Farley, is aiming to rein in rising warranty repair costs that are a key reason why the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker's financial performance in North America has lagged that of its archrival, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
As part of its new effort to cut warranty costs, Ford has told suppliers it will charge them upfront for half the cost of a warranty problem. Suppliers might get some of the money back if they resolve problems more quickly. 
""What we are striving for is to fix the issues as fast as possible so that those adjustments are as small as possible,"" Kumar Galhotra, president of the automaker's Americas and International Markets group, told Reuters. ""They're more incentivized to work with us.""
Ford North America's chief operating officer, Lisa Drake, who is responsible for quality and vehicle launches, said in the same interview supplier contracts have always allowed such debits. 
""We were never doing it and frankly, it was probably one of the reasons that we became a bit more uncompetitive,"" she said.
The move to charge parts makers upfront has some supplier executives worried. 
    ""They push their suppliers so, so hard that it causes the supply base to be weak in the knees,"" said one executive, who asked not to be identified.
But for Ford investors, action to shrink the U.S. automaker's outlays for vehicle defects is overdue. Ford's warranty costs for the first nine months of 2020 were more than $2 billion higher than those of GM. 
Industry officials blame the automaker's higher costs on the introduction of several major vehicle platforms and powertrains, as well as the fallout from the Takata airbag recall that has now also hit GM. 
Bad parts from suppliers account for about one-third of Ford's warranty costs, Drake said. The rest stem from design and manufacturing issues, Galhotra said.    
""Warranty recovery is increasingly seen as a revenue source"" by the automakers, said Ann Marie Uetz, a Foley & Lardner attorney who works with auto suppliers. ""Often times, it can feel like a bit of a grab.""
To attack internal quality problems, Ford has reconstituted teams that track the quality of inbound parts at its plants. These teams were previously disbanded as cost-cutting moves. Farley is pushing executives to resolve quality issues that linger beyond 30 days.
WIDENING GAP 
Ford's quality gap compared with GM has worsened during the past three years. Warranty claims have ballooned almost $2 billion since 2017,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Daniel Levy said. 
    In 2012 and 2013, Ford's warranty claims as a share of sales were below 2% every quarter, according to industry publication Warranty Week. But at the end of 2018, warranty costs topped 3% and hit 4.3% in the second quarter of this year as overall sales slid due to the coronavirus shutdown.
For a graphic on Ford's warranty costs, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2UiI9XP
For the first nine months of 2020, Ford's warranty costs totaled $3.87 billion, while GM's were $1.68 billion, according to regulatory filings.
""It can be fixed,"" Warranty Week editor Eric Arnum said of Ford. ""They just have to make the effort.""
Ford investors are focused on the launches of the redesigned and lucrative F-150 pickup truck, and the new and highly anticipated Bronco SUV, but reducing what it spends on repairing vehicles at dealers could provide a big boost to the bottom line.
""We're targeting a fully competitive level of warranty spend on coverages and that's got lots of zeroes next to it,"" Farley said on an Oct. 28 earnings conference call, citing a need to be ""punitive"" with suppliers who ship faulty parts.
Galhotra said Ford is applying lessons it learned from the mistakes made in last year's costly introduction of the redesigned Ford Explorer SUV to keep its current launches on track.
Part of the quality push involves reducing the complexity of the automaker's vehicles, Farley said. 
For example, the proximity key for the F-150 truck unlocks all four doors, but Farley said consumers only use it for the front doors, meaning Ford can eliminate two sensors - a manufacturing cost savings and a potential reduction in warranty risk. 
Ford also plans to use data gathered from vehicles to catch problems faster - in minutes rather than months in some cases - and fix them with over-the-air software updates, Farley has said.
Credit Suisse analyst Levy said investors are hopeful Farley can change things, but he will have to prove it.

""There was a track record already of Ford underperforming and I think this is a frustration for investors,"" he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher again on Tuesday as faith in an economic recovery next year gained traction, spurring fresh interest in beaten down cyclical stocks.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 318 points, or 1.1%, at 29,909 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.6% and the NASDAQ Composite was again - relatively speaking - a laggard, flat on the day.
Stocks across the board reacted positively to the nomination of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary by President-elect Joe Biden. Yellen is synonymous with the largely successful reflation of the U.S. economy after the Great Recession and investors expect her to commit again to an expansionary fiscal policy to overcome the current crisis, having argued for just that recently in a conference speech.
There was also some uplift from the latest sign that President Donald Trump is abandoning his efforts to cling on to the White House, despite his ongoing tweets to the contrary. In the wake of Michigan's decision to certify its election results on Monday, the president is now allowing Biden and his team access to the resources necessary for a smooth handover of power.
That all came against the backdrop of fresh evidence of the economy slowing down as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to notch new records for cases and hospital admissions on the eve of a Thanksgiving holiday that risks becoming a nationwide 'superspreader' event akin to the Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends earlier this year.
""We are almost to a vaccine (sic),"" Surgeon General Jerome Adams told Fox News earlier. ""We've got new remedies out there. We just need you, the American people, to hold on a little bit longer."" 
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index for November fell by more than expected, while the Richmond Federal Reserve's business survey also painted a picture of slowing output and demand. 
Among the early movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock roared another 3.2% higher on a wave of upgrades from brokers who now appear to feel compelled to put out multiple ""cases"" for the stock that indulge the aggressive bullishness of the retail investors who have driven its rally this year. More fundamentally, Tesla is likely to be a net beneficiary of General Motors (NYSE:GM) signaling on Monday on that it will end its support for efforts to take away California's powers to 'gold plate' its emissions regulations. California's standards, tighter than the national average, have had the effect of creating a national standard all by themselves, at greater short-term cost to traditional carmakers. 
Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rose 4.4% after EU regulators moved closer to allowing the 737 MAX back into the skies after an absence of 20 months.

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Tuesday it will launch a share trading hub in Paris, in the sector's latest move to avoid disruption to customers after Britain's full departure from the European Union next month.
London has long been Europe's share trading centre, but the EU has yet to say if it will allow full cross-border share trading to continue after December 31, when Britain's unfettered access to the bloc ends.
Goldman said it plans to launch a SIGMA X Europe platform in Paris prior to January 4, 2021, subject to regulatory approvals.
""We want to ensure that our clients continue to have access to all of our key liquidity sources post-Brexit,"" said Liz Martin, Goldman's global co-head of futures and equities electronic trading.
SIGMA X Europe will trade shares listed across 15 European markets, while its existing UK hub will continue to trade UK and European listings.
Britain has said it will allow UK investors to continue using share trading platforms based in the bloc from January.
Brussels has said that EU investors should use a platform inside the bloc to trade shares denominated in euros, thereby splitting markets and forcing major players like Goldman to have a foot in both camps.
Three pan-European share trading platforms in London - CBOE, London Stock Exchange's Turquoise, and Aquis Exchange - have already obtained regulatory approvals for EU hubs.
Turquoise has said that without the EU agreeing to full two-way market access by Nov. 30, it will start up its new Dutch hub. 

Also on Tuesday, British real estate investment trust Segro listed its shares in Paris as UK companies look to move assets and operations over to mainland Europe as Brexit looms.

(Reuters) -  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF), which is being bought by French luxury giant LVMH, beat Wall Street expectations for quarterly profit on Tuesday as the U.S. jeweler benefited from an over 70% rise in sales in China and a recovery in demand at home.
The results bode well for the upcoming holiday season for the jeweler and other luxury retailers in general, which have been hit hard by the pandemic. They also underscore the growing importance of sales within mainland China to offset dependence on tourism, especially on Chinese tourists visiting fashion hubs like Milan and Paris.
""We had a strong third quarter .... which speaks volumes about the enduring strength of the Tiffany brand and gives us confidence as we enter the important holiday season,"" Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Bogliolo said, nodding to ""the successful completion of the merger transaction with LVMH in early 2021.""
Tiffany and LVMH ended a bitter legal battle last month and agreed to a new deal that would see the French firm buy out the U.S. jeweler at a slightly lower price of $15.8 billion, or at a discount of $425 million.
Tiffany said sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 30%, while sales in the Americas region declined 16% - much smaller than the 46% drop seen in the preceding quarter.
Tiffany forecast a mid-single-digit percentage decline in holiday quarter sales, while analyst had predicted a 3% drop. It also expects a high-single-digit percentage increase in earnings for the current quarter.
The health crisis also forced the New York-based retailer to invest in its online business and to introduce curbside pick-up at certain stores. This helped e-commerce sales surge 92% in the quarter.
Best known for its diamond engagement rings, Tiffany could face more challenges ahead as COVID-19 cases are surging in much of the U.S. and across the world, spurring Britain and other countries in Europe, and many American states, to go into another lockdown.
As of Oct. 31, most of Tiffany's 320 retail stores worldwide were fully or partially opened, in accordance with local government guidelines, it said. As of Nov. 20 though, approximately 60% of Tiffany's retail stores in Europe were temporarily closed.
But analysts remain optimistic. 
""Q3 results also reiterate our confidence that the Tiffany brand will continue to shine through the holidays,"" said CFRA analyst Camilla Yanushevsky.
According to a CFRA site traffic analysis of Alexa Internet's data, there is ""growing traffic momentum"" to tiffany.com entering the all-important holiday season, Yanushevsky added.
Shares of the company were up marginally on low volumes in premarket trading.
Excluding certain item, Tiffany earned $1.11 per share, surging past the average expectation of 66 cents.

Tiffany's net sales fell about 1% to $1.01 billion in the third quarter ended Oct.31, but beat expectations of $980.71 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Shares of Dollar Tree gained 6.3% in premarket trading as the company also said it would expand its higher-priced offering, Dollar Tree Plus, into about 500 stores starting in the spring of 2021, after an initial test in more than 100 stores. 
The announcement comes after rival Dollar General (NYSE:DG) unveiled the launch of Popshelf stores, which are aimed at consumers spending more on non-essential items priced at $5 or less.
Sales at dollar stores, which typically sell products at $1, have remained strong even after the initial panic-buying at the start of lockdowns, with high U.S. unemployment and falling household income boosting demand for affordable cereals and vegetables.
Dollar Tree Chief Executive Officer Mike Witynski said the chain was off to a good start to its holiday quarter, with same-store sales at both its labels tracking above their third-quarter levels.
Same-store sales at the company's eponymous business increased 4% in the quarter ended Oct. 31, while they rose 6.4% at Family Dollar stores.
Net income rose to $330 million, or $1.39 per share, from $255.8 million, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.15 per share, Refinitiv IBES data showed.

998,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",Foreign Tourists Return to Thailand for First Time Since March,"(Bloomberg) -- Thailand received more than 1,000 foreign tourists in October, the first set of visitors to the Southeast Asian nation in six months.
Tourists began returning in small numbers under a special long-stay tourist visa unveiled by the government last month, according to data released by Thailand’s tourism ministry Tuesday. The October arrivals compared with 3.07 million foreign visitors during the same month a year ago, and were the first since March, data showed.
While Thailand has relaxed most of its coronavirus measures to allow businesses to fully reopen and some visitors to return, it has retained a nationwide state of emergency to prevent a resurgence in the pandemic. The nation’s ailing tourism industry is struggling to draw visitors as authorities have retained a mandatory 14-day quarantine on arrival amid a surge in confirmed infections worldwide.
The tourism ministry didn’t detail revenue generated from the foreign visitors and said some of the information may be subject to revisions. Thailand netted more than $60 billion in revenue from about 40 million visitors in 2019, official data show.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) outlined steps needed to put the grounded jets back into service, including updating software implicated in the crashes that killed a total of 346 people in 2018 and 2019.
It also opened a 28-day comment period, which it said would lead to a formal ungrounding from mid-January, once public and industry feedback has been digested.

How long it takes for flights to resume in Europe depends on pilot training and the amount of time airlines need to upgrade software and carry out other actions mandated by EASA.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Super-cold container firm va-Q-tec expands to meet COVID-19 vaccine demand,"By Ilona Wissenbach
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Cold-storage specialist va-Q-tec is significantly expanding its fleet of 2,500 rental containers to meet growing demand to transport COVID-19 vaccines that need to be kept as low as -70 degrees Celsius (-94°F), its chief executive said.
The German company is in talks with all the major pharmaceutical manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines, CEO Joachim Kuhn told Reuters in an interview. 
Kuhn said the company would ""significantly expand"" its fleet of rental containers in the coming year. He did not specify how many extra containers were planned, though said it would not be to the extent of doubling the fleet.
Va-Q-tec is among a handful of high-end packaging providers who have found themselves in high demand as drugmakers and logistics firms prepares to transport such shots around the world. Its shares have risen by 230% this year, valuing the company at around $690 million. 
The company's turnover has increased by 30% annually over the past 10 years. ""We expect this growth to continue in a similar form,"" said the CEO, adding that global vaccine distribution might take several years. 
""We are carefully increasing the number. With the market growing by more than 10% per year, we are not afraid that we will be left sitting on empty containers after corona."" 
The Würzburg-based company completed a 25 million Swiss franc ($27.4 million) bond issue on Monday to help fund its expansion plans.
It manufactures ""passive"" containers, which use dry ice to keep the contents at ultra-cold temperatures for up to five or six days, as opposed to ""active"" containers that also use electric motors for cooling. 
The vaccine candidate developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech, which uses mRNA technology, needs to be kept at about -70 degrees Celsius, colder than the offerings from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC.
Kuhn said va-Q-tec had contracts with the world's 20 largest airlines and major freight-forwarders. He said intercontinental transport with cargo flights was expected to be less of a problem than last-mile distribution on the road, given there was experience in transporting super-cold goods by air. 

""To meet the demand for dry ice is not a big problem in our latitudes with sufficient regional production,"" Kuhn said. ""It will be a challenge in countries that do not have this infrastructure in Africa, Latin America or Russia.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening firmly higher Tuesday, continuing the recent positive tone as investors cheer the greater clarity of political transition in Washington, the nomination of Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary as well as the continuing progress of Covid-19 vaccines through the development process.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract rose 284 points, or 1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 25 points, or 0.7%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 36 points, or 0.3%. 
Helping the tone Tuesday was the announcement Monday that General Services Administration chief Emily Murphy informed President-elect Joe Biden that federal resources would be available for his transition into office, three weeks after the actual election.
President Trump backed the decision, and while he didn’t go as far as to concede the election, this move has removed a lot of the uncertainty over whether there would be an orderly transfer of power in the world's biggest economy.
Wall Street has also cheered the news Biden is to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as his Treasury Secretary, seeing her as willing to complement the current Fed policy of very low interest rates with extended, expansionary government spending to support the economy through the pandemic.
At least 150,000 Covid-19 cases are being confirmed each day in the U.S., with many states instigating new restrictions to try and slow down this new surge in infections.
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 327 points, or 1.1%, higher, while the S&P 500 gained 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.2%. The DJIA is on track to have its best month since January of 1987, as the idea of Covid-19 vaccines in the near future has tempted investors back into pro-growth cyclical stocks.
There are a few more retailers due to report earnings Tuesday as the sector heads into its critical holiday shopping season, including  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY), Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF).
On the economic data slate, September data from the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price index is due later in the session, followed by November figures from the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence survey.
Oil prices continued to post gains Tuesday, climbing to levels not seen since March. Traders will look to the release of the crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $43.40 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $46.31.  Both oil benchmarks settled up about 2% on Monday after gaining about 5% last week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,809.75/oz, dropping to its lowest level in four months, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1869."

The Irish airline said earlier this month it expected to fly 38 million passengers in its financial year to March 31. That is now likely to fall to ""the mid-30s"", Group CEO Michael O'Leary said in an interview. 
In the following year, Ryanair could fly anywhere between 80 million and 130 million passengers, depending on how the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines progress, he said.
O'Leary said the group expected to fly between 60% and 80% of last year's capacity for much of next year, falling to 60-70% during the peak summer period. 

""But I think by the time we get to the end of the summer into winter 2021 we expect to be back to pretty much close to all of our 2019 schedules,"" he said.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A police officer who denied asking Canadian border agents for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's phone and laptop passcodes on the day of her arrest two years ago will continue to face cross-examination on how he obtained them Tuesday.
The witness testimony is part of Meng's U.S. extradition hearing taking place in the British Columbia Supreme Court.
Meng, 48, was arrested while on a layover at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018. U.S. prosecutors charged her with bank fraud, accusing her of misleading HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, allegedly causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Meng has said she is innocent of all charges against her and has mounted a defense seeking to prove that Canadian and U.S. authorities illegally directed the Canada Border Services Agency's (CBSA) examination. Her lawyers assert police used the border agency's additional investigative powers to gather information from her without a lawyer present.
Officers from the CBSA and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have been called to the witness stand to testify on the events surrounding Meng's investigation and subsequent arrest, focusing specifically on alleged illegal coordination between the forces and whether identifying details about Meng's devices were purposely shared with police.
On Monday RCMP constable Gurvinder Dhaliwal recounted how he secured Meng's devices from a border agent immediately after she was arrested. When asked if he requested passcodes, Dhaliwal replied, ""Absolutely not.""
Defense lawyer Scott Fenton questioned Dhaliwal about his memory of meetings and documents on Monday. Dhaliwal said he did not pay close attention during a briefing with the Department of Justice on the eve of Meng's arrest, nor did he spend much time reading the provisional warrant before the arrest.
Diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing have degraded in the wake of Meng's arrest. China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges days later.

Witness testimony is set to last until Friday, with the potential for two to three more days scheduled in December. Meng's extradition hearing is expected to wrap up in April 2021.

1007,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 06:03AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Compass, AO World Make a Picture of the Great Rotation","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It looks like it’s ‘third time lucky’ for those willing to bet on an end to the pandemic.
The rallies that followed announcements of vaccine breakthroughs by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) in the last couple of weeks both reversed to a large extent almost immediately as investors were shaken by the spread of the virus in the here and now.
However, the third such announcement, by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and the University of Oxford, on Monday appears to have tipped more people into believing that the end of the tunnel is not only in sight but getting significantly closer.
Concerns about the difficulty of storage and distribution had undermined the Pfizer rally, while Moderna appears to have prioritized price over mass distribution, something that limits its effectiveness on a global scale. But the AstraZeneca/Oxford drug is both cheaper and easily stored. It’s set to reach more countries, faster, as a result, once it is fully approved.
The effect was clearly visible in Europe’s stock markets on Tuesday, with cyclical stocks sharply outperforming at the expense of stay-at-home stocks and other tech winners. The contrast was illustrated beautifully in the fortunes of two London-listed stocks, catering group Compass and electronics retailer AO World.
Compass, the world’s biggest contract caterer with a business spanning not just hospitality and events but university, defense and oil rig canteens, has had a miserable year. The shares lost 40% between the eve of the crisis and the low point that was made when it had to raise capital through a share offering.  There’ll be no dividend for the year that ended in September and the road back to its pre-pandemic state of health is a long one. CEO Dominic Blakemore said the group’s operating margin will be only 2.5% in the current quarter, although he noted that the reset of its costs will allow a margin of 7% even without the full return of pre-Covid business volumes.
Compass shares rose 5.0% to their highest since March as the group released its results for the year.  Some fortuitous timing may have helped: Prime Minister Boris Johnson late on Monday confirmed the lifting of the national lockdown in England from December 2, although graded restrictions are likely to remain in place until March.
Compass’ performance found its mirror image in that of AO World. The retailer of computers and related equipment has had a fantastic eight months, as workers sent home have found the perfect excuse to upgrade their laptops and PCs, as well as buying more accessories for gaming. Revenue rose 53% in the six months through September and the group returned to an EBITDA profit of 16 million pounds, having largely fixed problems with its German stores.
The market, however, reckoned that this may be as good as it gets for AO. The shares fell 6.2% to a two-week low. The stock’s daily chart now has an ugly-looking double-top pattern to it.  "

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) expects to take a roughly $450 million impairment on alternative investment firm York Capital Management's retreat from its core hedge funds business, the Swiss bank said.
The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported the New York-based firm had informed employees and investors about plans to leave its original line of business, wind down its European hedge funds business and convert its U.S. hedge fund into one primarily managing internal money.
Credit Suisse, which has been an investor in York Capital since 2010, said on Tuesday it expected to take an impairment on its stake in billionaire hedge-fund manager Jamie Dinan's firm in the fourth quarter, which would hit its main capital metric - or common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio - by roughly 7 basis points.
""The amount of the impairment taken will be assessed as part of our year-end process, but is currently expected to be approximately $450 million,"" the bank said.
The impairment would not change its existing guidance for dividends and capital distributions in 2020 and 2021, Switzerland's second-biggest bank said.
The Swiss bank, which placed an initial $425 million investment into York a decade ago, said it intended to maintain an interest in York's Asia-Pacific business, which it expects to be spun out as a new and separate hedge fund next year.
York Capital, founded in 1991 with a focus on U.S. hedge funds, represented roughly 1% of the 438 billion Swiss francs ($481.00 billion) managed by Credit Suisse's asset management business at the end of 2019.
Credit Suisse is scrutinising its overall strategy for asset management, part of its international wealth management division, after weak earnings within the business, which dropped 26% year-on-year through September.
Asset management is spinning out a 3 billion franc Swiss energy infrastructure investment entity, and Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein has signalled further strategic revisions over the coming year.
Swiss banks have grappled in recent years with the need to scale up asset management to make the business more profitable, but hefty write-offs over larger acquisitions have proved costly for several.
""Experience has shown that it's almost always the selling hedge fund manager that profits from such transactions, and very seldom the buyer,"" Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts said in a note. ""Even if the extent of the write-off doesn't shake Credit Suisse to its core, it does show that big banks need to be prepared for major disruption.""
Shares in Credit Suisse were up 2.2% by 1025 GMT despite the potential impairment, amid a wider market ally.
York's new strategy will focus on longer-term assets such as private equity, private debt and collateralised loan obligations, Credit Suisse said.

Britain published this month a bill giving ministers far-reaching power to intervene in corporate deals which could threaten national security, the culmination of years of growing concern about Chinese and other foreign investment in key industries.
Launched with the slogan ""China. See the Potential. Know the Challenge"" the government website is designed as a guide for digital and tech firms, encouraging good practice and raising awareness of potential issues.
""The UK is determined to support our businesses to engage with China in a way that reflects the UK’s values and takes account of national security concerns,"" digital and culture minister Caroline Dinenage said in a statement.
Alongside case studies, guides on how to conduct due diligence and links to specialist consultancies, the site contains some stark warnings.
""There is a risk that your company’s technology could be used to violate human rights,"" said a section on ethical risks, highlighting concerns about facial recognition software censorship, and mass surveillance among other concerns.
Another section warns: ""Taking legal steps to protect your IP (Intellectual Property) in China is important, but you should also consider your cybersecurity.""
Earlier this year, ministers blocked Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from parts of the UK's telecoms network over concerns about spying. Huawei has said the concerns are groundless.

Under a new law put forward on Tuesday telecoms companies could be fined up to 10% of turnover or 100,000 pounds ($133,140) a day if they contravene a ban on using equipment made by Huawei.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Stocks, oil and risk currencies gained on Tuesday as the formal go-ahead for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to begin his transition burnished a November already boosted by COVID-19 vaccines.
European markets tracked gains in Asian and U.S. equities, with the broad-based STOXX 600 index opening 0.8% higher and Brent crude climbing to its highest level since March at $46.38 a barrel. Safe haven assets such as gold fell.
After weeks of legal challenges to the election results, U.S. General Services Administration chief Emily Murphy wrote to Biden on Monday informing him the formal hand-over process could begin.
President Donald Trump tweeted that he had told his team ""do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols"", an indication he was moving toward a transition.
""Markets have been constrained by very high levels of uncertainty on the U.S. political front and around vaccines for weeks, so with those two going away investors are considering the prospect of a return to normality in 2021,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Reports that Biden plans to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to become the next Treasury Secretary further boosted U.S. stocks on expectations she would pursue more conventional policies than the outgoing Steven Mnuchin. 
Futures for the S&P 500 rose 1.2% in early European trading hours and putting the 49-country MSCI world stocks index on course to set a new record high later.
Japan's Nikkei jumped 2.5% to its highest level since May 1991 overnight, with energy, real estate and financial shares leading the advance. 
Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ticked up 0.4%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was 1.26% stronger, touching its highest level in almost nine months, with energy stocks leading the pack there.
Seoul's Kospi was 0.6% higher as was Hong Kong's Hang Seng which rose 0.4%. China blue-chips were an outlier however, edging down 0.6%, as investors booked profits following recent strong gains.

Some analysts say a Biden presidency, which could mean more negotiation room for Washington and Beijing, would not make a big difference for China's equities market, as they expected little change in broad U.S. policy toward China.
The progress made on COVID-19 vaccines, which had underpinned Wall Street overnight, helped keep risk appetite elevated as it boosted optimism about a quicker revival for the global economy. 
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University had said on Monday that their COVID-19 vaccine, which is cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale-up than its rivals, could be as much as 90% effective.
RISK ON 
The New Zealand dollar was among the currency gainers, rising as much as 0.9% to a two-year high of $0.6985 as its central bank said house prices, which have been storming higher this year, could be included in its inflation basket. 
The euro was gaining towards $1.19 again and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, nudged down to 92.235. 
Also spurred on by the vaccine hopes, oil reached levels not seen since before the coronavirus began to spread rapidly in March and decimated demand.

1013,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 03:42AM ET</span>",European Stocks Higher; German GDP Rebounded Strongly,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday amid continued enthusiasm over the progress towards a coronavirus vaccine and greater clarity over the transition of power in the U.S. A strong rebound in the German economy has also helped.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.6%.
Emily Murphy, the General Services Administration head, on Monday effectively acknowledged Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election, three weeks after the event, saying he could have briefings and funding to ease his transition into the role.
Uncertainty over whether there would be an orderly transfer of power in the largest economy in the world had weighed on the markets to a certain extent since the Nov. 3 election.
However, the dominant driver of late has been the progress in the search for a vaccine for the Covid-19 vaccine. On Monday, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) announced its candidate had an efficacy of up to 90% in certain doses, the third potential vaccine after similarly positive news from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
Germany’s third-quarter GDP rose 8.5% on the quarter according, a recovery from the historic 9.7% fall in the previous quarte. The numbers were revised upward from an initial estimate of 8.2%, with the stronger-than expected rebound mainly driven by higher household spending and soaring exports.
More timely data reflected the recent slowdown in the economy better. The November Ifo business climate index fell to a four-month low, while Insee's estimate of French business confidence fell to a five-month low. However, neither index fell as much as expected.
In corporate news,  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) stock rose 5% after the catering giant was able to return to profit in its fiscal fourth quarter after a difficult year, hit hard by the pandemic.
Also climbing Tuesday were oil and gas stocks, as crude prices continued to post gains, with the Brent contract climbing to levels not seen since March, as further positive Covid-19 vaccine news pointed to a reasonably prompt recovery in oil demand. 
Crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute are due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $43.38 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $46.28.  Both oil benchmarks settled up about 2% on Monday after gaining about 5% last week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,824.15/oz, dropping to its lowest level in four months, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1877.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",Germany: Europe should extend industrial cooperation to hydrogen,"BERLIN (Reuters) - European Union member states are intensifying cooperation on the production of battery cells for electric cars and they should extend this approach into new industrial areas such as hydrogen technology, the German economy minister said on Tuesday.
""We want to support the creation of a complete value chain for battery cells in Europe: from the processing of raw materials to battery cell production to recycling,"" Peter Altmaier told an economic conference in Berlin.
The German government is supporting the local production of battery cells with 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) to become less dependent on suppliers from Asia.
German carmakers already face tough competition from Chinese and U.S. rivals in electric mobility. The European Union has greenlighted state support for battery cells as part of its Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) scheme.
Among the companies benefiting from the support are German battery maker Varta, luxury car maker BMW, chemical group BASF as well as French automaker Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) with its German Opel subsidiary.
The economy ministry expects the battery cell initiative to create more than 20,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. This is likely to cushion the impact of job losses caused by weaker demand for combustion engines.
Altmaier said that, in future, the most innovative and environmentally friendly battery cells should come from Europe.
The increased cooperation on battery cells, enabled by the European Commission's IPCEI scheme, should become a blueprint for other European industrial projects, for example for hydrogen technologies, Altmaier added.
The German government has passed a 9-billion-euro hydrogen investment plan as part of a stimulus package to help Europe's largest economy recover from the coronavirus shock and accelerate a shift towards green technology.
Hydrogen fuel is produced via electrolysis in a process that passes electricity from sources such as wind and sunshine through water, to extract carbon-free hydrogen.

1015,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",Analysis: Carbon pricing rises as world's weapon of choice in climate fight,"By Susanna Twidale and Kate Abnett
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Can you put a price on pollution? Some of the world's biggest economies are doing just that as they wrestle with how to make good on grand pledges to tame planet-warming emissions.
Matters are coming to a head. 
China, Japan and South Korea have all followed the European Union in pledging to cut emissions to ""net zero"" in recent weeks, where they release only as much as they remove from the air. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden made the same promise in his election campaign.
Next year they are set to lay out the first practical measures to meet these targets, as part of commitments under the Paris climate accord, and putting a price on carbon will be front and centre, experts told Reuters.
""Each country will have to come up with its own path to reaching net zero, but the expectation is carbon pricing is going to be a very important part,"" said Wendy Hughes, Carbon Markets and Innovation Manager at the World Bank.
The principle is simple: a carbon price establishes how much companies need to pay for their emissions. The higher the price, the greater the incentive to pollute less and invest in low-carbon technology. 
Governments can force these payments through a carbon tax - a levy companies must pay when they pollute - or through an emissions-trading system (ETS).
An ETS sets a maximum cap on the amount of emissions that a sector, or group of sectors, can produce. It creates ""carbon permits"" for those emissions, which companies can buy for each tonne of CO2 they emit. 
Many countries, from Europe and South Korea, to China and Kazakhstan have already launched schemes, of various scope. 
More than fifth of global emissions are covered by 46 national carbon-pricing schemes operating today or in the planning stage, as well as 32 regional systems within countries, according to the World Bank. 
The biggest of those - the EU carbon market - is preparing for a major overhaul. 
Since the European system was launched in 2005, emissions from participating power plants and factories have dropped by 35% – a sharper drop than seen in sectors not covered by the scheme. 
""The ETS has proven its efficiency,"" said Frans Timmermans, head of EU climate policy. ""The ETS shows how carbon pricing is a strong driver for immediate change in energy consumption."" 
(Graphic: Verified emissions under the EU ETS excluding aviation: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yzdvxkkkopx/Pasted%20image%201605865949677.png)
PRICE BALANCING ACT
In the power sector, the scheme helped make coal plants uneconomic, compared with less-polluting gas plants or renewables.
But the trick for these markets is to get the carbon price right. If it's too low, there's little incentive for companies to rein in emissions; too high, and risk knee-capping industry. 
The EU, seeking steeper emissions reductions to meet its new 2030 climate targets, will propose to expand and reform its ETS from next year. 
The changes would involve including more sectors, such as shipping, and curbing the free permits given to EU industry to help it compete with overseas companies that don't pay carbon costs. 
The carbon price – currently at around 27 euros price per tonne of CO2 - needs to hit levels that push industry toward investing in emissions-cutting technologies like hydrogen, analysts say. 
""The carbon price has to reach high enough to enable the European Union to reach net zero by 2050,"" said Mark Lewis, Chief Sustainability Strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
""On this basis, I think around 90 euros a tonne is a reasonable expectation by 2030,"" he said.
GUARDING AGAINST SHOCKS
Other major economies are catching on. China, now the world's top greenhouse gas emitter, plans to launch its own national ETS, possibly as early as next year. That system would become the world's largest, and is expected to cover several billion tonnes of CO2 from power plants each year.
Experts say China's preparations for launching its ETS have sped up since President Xi Jinping's announcement in September that China would become carbon neutral by 2060.
""There is a sense of urgency that hasn't been seen for quite a long time,"" said Beijing-based lawyer Shawn He, who assists companies with carbon compliance.
The EU has worked with the country on developing carbon-pricing policies for more than a decade, both on the pilot regional markets China is now running and on a national scheme.
Jos Delbeke, a former senior EU climate policymaker who led the development of the bloc's trading scheme, said his advice to China had been to build a system that could gradually be reformed over time and could withstand economic shocks.
The EU learned that lesson after the 2008 financial crisis, when factors including a lack of flexible rules meant the market could not respond to a recession-induced drop in emissions, and became plagued by an oversupply of cheap permits.
The price of carbon permits didn't recover until 2018, when the EU said it would introduce a ""market-stability reserve"" from 2019 which removed excess permits from the system.
China's pilot schemes have already looked at using a similar reserve system, according to Huw Slater, senior carbon consultant with consultancy firm ICF in Beijing. 
""It is a little early at the national stage to know whether they will do a similar thing, but it is quite possible.""
CARBON ACROSS BORDERS
Establishing a single, global price on carbon remains a distant prospect, however.
""The idea of a global carbon price was built on the assumption there would be dozens of linked trading systems. That hasn't happened,"" said David Hone, chief climate adviser at oil major Shell (LON:RDSa), which uses an internal carbon price to help meet its own sustainability goals. 
Internal carbon prices also help to protect investments from any future carbon-pricing policies.
Talks at the U.N. have failed for two years to agree a common set of rules for international carbon markets.
The lack of global coordination has led the EU to start drafting a carbon border-tax policy - a levy on imports into Europe of polluting goods like steel and cement. The aim is to protect European industry from cheaper imports from regions with lax climate policies.
In the United States, Biden has pledged to do the same, with a $2 trillion plan to cut emissions.
Making access to some of the world's biggest markets conditional on paying a CO2 price should prod countries with weak climate policies ""to begin figuring out how they are going to move in a low-carbon direction to remain competitive"", said the World Bank's Hughes. 

""It is possible to create linkages across domestic trading systems,"" she added. ""In the longer term, a global carbon price is desirable ... the fact we don't see one immediately doesn't mean it's not moving in the right direction.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Full Truck Alliance has reached a valuation of nearly $12 billion after the Chinese truck services startup raised $1.7 billion in a new funding round, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
The fundraising comes as the truck-hailing platform is planning an offshore initial public offering (IPO) as early as next year, the sources said, with one of them adding that the venue is likely to be New York.
The Chinese company on Tuesday announced the completion of the fundraising, which was led by SoftBank's Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital, Permira and Fidelity. 
Full Truck Alliance, the result of a 2017 merger between truck service platforms Yunmanman and Huochebang, connects drivers with truck owners and their mutual client base. 
Existing investors, including All-Stars Investment, GGV Capital, Hillhouse Capital Group, Tencent Holding and Yunfeng Capital also joined the funding round, the company said. 
Full Truck Alliance, often described as China's ""Uber (NYSE:UBER) for trucks"", did not immediately respond to Reuters queries on its valuation and IPO plans. 
The sources declined to be identified as the information is confidential. 
The company, which has over 10 million registered truck drivers and over 5 million truck owners on its platform, plans to use the funds for technology, service and business model innovations.
On-demand logistics service in China is crowded, with Manbang, Huolala and Kuaigou as market leaders. Didi is also hiring van drivers for logistics service.
Bloomberg News had earlier reported that the funding round at the Chinese company valued it at about $12 billion after investment.

The overhaul comes in the wake of the Wirecard accounting scandal and marks the biggest shake-up in the index's history. 
Since its founding in 1988, the DAX has been Germany's answer to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York and the FTSE in London, with 30 members forming the corporate elite in one of the world’s'largest economies.
Most of the index's founding members have since dropped out.
The most recent departure was payments company Wirecard, which in a blow to Germany's capital markets, filed for insolvency just two years after its promotion to the index. The payments company owed creditors billions in what auditor EY described as a sophisticated global fraud.
The expansion diversifies the index. The proposal to expand was pushed by Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Theodor Weimer and had faced opposition by some investors.

The expansion will take place during the third quarter of 2021, Deutsche Boerse said.

U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to roll back some sanctions on remittances. But any lifting of the suspension could take time and until then, Cuban Americans are expected to resort to alternatives that are more costly, less secure and less rapid.
Remittances to Cuba are believed to be around $2 billion to $3 billion annually, representing its third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism. 
Money transfers from the United States via Western Union were estimated at more than $1 billion last year, the majority of which was sent from Florida, according to John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.
Current options for remittances include agencies that hire ""mules"" to fly out to Cuba with cash and which predate Western Union's start in Cuba 20 years ago, as well as companies that transfer dollars to Cuban accounts - though that money can only be used at state stores.
Cryptocurrency exchanges are also promoting themselves as an alternative. Cuban Americans can transfer digital currencies to middle men on the island who then give money to the Cuban Americans' relatives.
But such platforms lack oversight, cryptocurrencies can fluctuate rapidly and unexpectedly in value and internet access is still not a given in Cuba, Kavulich said.
""We've looked but there are no safe services,"" said local resident Arturo Labaut.
The closures of Western Union's 407 offices in Cuba came into effect after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration banned U.S. firms sending remittances via military-controlled companies that include Western Union’s main Cuban partner.
His administration has also previously capped the amount Cuban Americans can send family members at $1,000 per quarter, and transfers of money to non-family members are no longer allowed.
The new ban comes just as Cuba has started enacting structural reforms to revive its state-run economy which have been long called for but which will spell pain for its residents in the meantime.
""It's a bad time to be doing this because of the suffering it will cause,"" said Florida International University professor Guillermo Grenier.

ANA will hold its first share sale since 2012, Reuters reported on Saturday, citing two sources who declined to be identified as the information was not public.
The issuance is expected to raise around 200 billion yen ($1.9 billion), one of the sources said.
In a statement on Tuesday, the airline said nothing had been decided on a new share sale. 
Airlines worldwide are struggling to survive the COVID-19 pandemic that has brought the travel industry to a halt. Although Japan has not been hit as hard as the United States and Europe, its travel industry is suffering.
ANA has forecast a record operating loss of $4.82 billion for the year to end-March and is temporarily transferring more than 400 workers to other companies. Other staff are being asked to take pay cuts or go on unpaid leave.
ANA's stock was down 1.9% by 0336 GMT, compared to a 2.8% rise in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average, as trading resumed after a long weekend.

Scania acquired Nantong Gaokai based in China's eastern city of Rugao, showed an official filing. The acquisition allows it to obtain a truck manufacturing licence in China.The move comes after Scania said it would invest in a battery assembly plant in Sweden as it explores future technologies.
Scania's spokesman declined to comment on the time it will take to complete the manufacturing set-up, the planned capacity, or the models it plans to produce. 
Nantong Gaokai was previously a unit under state-owned Jiangsu Gaokai Investment Development Group.
Jiangsu Gaokai did not respond to a request for comment.
Overall truck sales in China jumped 24% from January through October to 3.87 million vehicles, driven by government investment in infrastructure and as buyers upgraded to comply with tougher emissions rules.
Meanwhile, Chinese officials have been drafting new rules to make trucks cleaner, smarter and safer.
The market is largely dominated by local automakers including FAW Jiefang Group Co Ltd, Dongfeng Motor Group Co (OTC:DNFGF) Ltd and Sinotruk Hong Kong Ltd, which offer more price-competitive vehicles. 
All Scania trucks sold in China are imported and priced significantly higher than those of domestic rivals.
International truck makers including MAN SE and Volvo trucks have engine partnerships with Chinese companies.

In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.15% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.12%. Chief Executive Carrie Lam is due to deliver her annual policy address on Wednesday, as the city battles a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.07% and the SZSE Component fell 0.36%. U.S.-China tensions are up over reports that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is pushing for fresh, hardline measures against China.
Joe Biden was acknowledged as the apparent winner of the election via a letter from General Services Administration head Emily Murphy on Monday. The letter also said that Biden could formally begin the transition process, which includes access to current agency officials, briefing books, and funding as well as other government resources totaling around $6 million.
Trump also made the first steps towards conceding to the election results, tweeting that his team have been informed to “do what needs to be done with regards to initial protocols.’ However, he is still looking to pursue legal action over the results.
Biden has also started hinting at his cabinet appointments and is likely to tap former Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen as Secretary of the Treasury.
Adding to the positivity was the latest positive news on the COVID-19 vaccine front, after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced positive news about their respective candidates during the previous week.
AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN), alongside the University of Oxford, reported on Monday that its candidate, AZD122, met its primary endpoint in clinical trials that took place in the U.K and Brazil. The data will now be submitted to authorities globally for conditional or early approvals.
“Traders are still buying into vaccine news clearance, as the end of the pandemic becomes imaginable. Recent U.S. data restored a bit of confidence that the economy is holding up, despite surging COVID-19 infections and a painful lack of fresh fiscal stimulus,” IG Australia market analyst Kyle Rodda told Reuters.
“And the news of Yellen’s possible nomination to the role of U.S. Treasury Secretary potentially puts a very Fed-friendly uber-dove at the reins of fiscal policy,” Rodda added.
Investors are also rekindling hope that Congress will reach a consensus over the latest stimulus measures as the number of global COVID-19 cases continues to rise.
“Having that end date on the calendar, with what looks like possibly three effective vaccines defines the bottom,” Brent Schutte, Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) Mutual Wealth Management Chief Investment Strategist, said on Bloomberg TV. “I think investors will come in and buy the dip, and I do think you will continue to have the rotation to those value names, small-cap names, things that are leveraged to the economic cycle.”
The U.S. is due to release a slew of data, including for jobless claims and GDP, on Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Fed will release the minutes from its most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on the same day. Data released on Monday showed that the U.S.  manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 56.7 in November, above the 53 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October's 53.4 reading.

The Note's first full model change in eight years is part of a plan by the carmaker to revamp an aging vehicle line up and return to profitability as it pulls back from the expansion pursued by former Chairman Carlos Ghosn to focus on sales in Japan, China and the United States. 
The Note will feature ""e-Power"" hybrid technology, which uses a gasoline engine to charge a battery that powers the vehicle. New autonomous drive functions will help drivers slow down on curves using data from the car's navigation system.
Nissan, which expects to post a record operating loss of 340 billion yen ($3.25 billion) in the year to March 31, is cutting production capacity and model numbers by a fifth and aims to slash operating expenses by 300 billion yen over three years.
At the same time, it has promised to launch a slew of vehicles in Japan, China and the United States, including new electric vehicles to lure increasingly environment-conscious drivers.
In Japan, the Note, which uses a platform designed with French alliance partner Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY), will compete With Toyota's Yaris and Honda's Fit. A Nissan spokeswoman said the automaker has not made any decision on selling the redesigned vehicle in other markets.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 08:31PM ET</span>",Canadian officer in Huawei CFO's arrest says he did not ask for phone passcodes,"By Sarah Berman
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Canadian police officer involved in the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou two years ago in a U.S. extradition case testified on Monday he did not plan to obtain her mobile phone passcodes or search her electronic devices.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Constable Gurvinder Dhaliwal told a Canadian court that he and his partner were ""discreet"" about their contact with Canadian border officials on the eve of Meng's arrest on Dec. 1, 2018.
He said they discussed collecting Meng's phone and other electronic devices and putting them in protective bags, but that he did not ask the border agents to get passcodes.
Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) superintendent Sowmith Katragadda had previously testified that he requested Meng's phone and laptop passcodes and she provided them voluntarily.
Meng, 48, is accused of misleading the bank HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business affairs in Iran, allegedly causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions. If extradited, Meng will face trial for fraud in the Eastern District of New York.
She denies the charges and is fighting them from under house arrest in Vancouver, arguing the arrest itself was the product of political interference.
Huawei lawyers are seeking evidence to support their case that Meng's rights were violated before her arrest. In a document submitted to the court last year, CBSA admitted making an ""error"" in sharing the passcodes with RCMP.
Dhaliwal said it was his job to secure the devices after the CBSA examination was complete and Meng was in custody. He said he retrieved the devices along with a piece of paper with passcodes on it.
A border agent handed him the paper, but they did not discuss how the device passcodes were collected.
When asked if he requested the passcodes, Dhaliwal replied, ""Absolutely not,"" adding that he was not concerned about the presence of the piece of paper stating the passcodes. ""I didn’t even think about it. I just put it with the phones.""
Dhaliwal told the court that days after the arrest he received an email from RCMP staff sergeant Ben Chang requesting the make, model, and serial numbers, as well as photos of the devices, which Dhaliwal gave to him. Chang has declined to appear for testimony. Court documents showed that the government initially declined to release notes relating to him to Huawei lawyers, citing witness safety.
Dhaliwal testified that he was never asked for passcodes, and did not look at the contents of the devices.
In the afternoon defense lawyer Scott Fenton pressed Dhaliwal about his travel to the airport on the eve of Meng's arrival at Vancouver International Airport.
Dhaliwal said the main purpose of his trip was to find out whether Meng was on the flight. Fenton countered by telling Dhaliwal he could have learned whether Meng's plane took off with a ""simple Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search.""
Meng's lawyers are fighting to get her extradition dismissed on the basis of alleged abuses of process, arguing they constitute violations of her civil rights and that U.S. and Canadian officials coordinated before her arrest.
Officers with the CBSA testified last week that their questioning of Meng, daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, followed standard procedures and was separate from any action by law enforcement.
This week's witness testimony is expected to last until Friday, when a series of police witnesses will speak of their role in Meng's arrest.
Diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing have degraded in the wake of Meng's arrest. China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges days later.

Meng's extradition hearing is set to wrap up in April 2021.

Walmart de Mexico, or Walmex, said it has always acted in accordance with applicable law and that its participation in the Mexican market has resulted in lower prices for consumers, benefiting poor families especially.
The federal competition authority Cofece said it could not comment on Walmart's statement.
In a Nov. 4 study, Cofece said there was a need to facilitate the entry of more competitors to the retail market.
""High market concentration favors the purchasing power of large self-service chains compared to their smaller suppliers, which could distort competition in supplier markets,"" the Cofece study said.

In the study, Cofece identified Walmart and Soriana, and to a lesser degree Chedraui, as the main players with a national presence.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>","Britain's telcos face fines if they use suppliers deemed high-risk, like Huawei","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's telecoms companies could be fined up to 10% of turnover or 100,000 pounds ($133,140) a day if they contravene a ban on using equipment made by China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd under a new law put forward on Tuesday.
The Telecommunications (Security) Bill will boost the security standards of the UK's telecoms networks and remove the threat of high-risk vendors, the government said.
Britain in July decided to ban the use of Huawei in 5G networks from the end of 2027 because of concerns that U.S. sanctions on chip technology meant the Chinese company would not be a reliable supplier.
The bill aims to enshrine that decision in law and manage any risks from other high-risk vendors in the future, with tough penalties for telecom companies that break the rules.
Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the benefits of 5G and fibre networks could only be realised if they were secure and resilient.
""This groundbreaking bill will give the UK one of the toughest telecoms security regimes in the world and allow us to take the action necessary to protect our networks,"" he said.
Huawei said it was disappointed that the government was looking to exclude it from the roll-out of 5G.
""This decision is politically motivated and not based on a fair evaluation of the risks,"" said Vice President Victor Zhang.
""It does not serve anyone's best interests as it would move Britain into the digital slow lane and put at risk the Government's levelling up agenda.""
The government said the tougher security standards in the bill would also help protect Britain from potential cyber attacks from countries and criminals.
Regulator Ofcom will be given the duty of monitoring and assessing the security of telecoms providers.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sixty-year-old Yashiro Haga is folding his Tokyo noodle ramen shop after 15 years in December, unable to overcome the prospect of a lasting customer slump due to the coronavirus crisis.
    ""The flow of people has changed due to the coronavirus,"" Haga said, standing behind the counter of his ground-floor shop, Shirohachi. ""Customers aren't coming in and queuing up outside shops any longer.""
    The pandemic is damaging Japan's ""mom-and-pop"" restaurants - including noodle shops like Haga's - at a growing rate, despite evidence the government's massive effort to stave off bankruptcies is working in other sectors of the economy.
Hurt by deflationary pressures and growing competition in the run-up to the now-delayed Tokyo Olympics, noodle bars are particularly prone to the economic malaise the pandemic triggered in the service sector.
Small and mid-sized businesses like Haga's noodle bar employ about 70% of Japan's workers and account for 99.7% of the total number of enterprises, according to government data, leading some to worry that a COVID-19 resurgence could trigger an increasing number of layoffs among small firms.
    While overall bankruptcies among firms with at least 10 million yen ($96,228) in liabilities in the six months to October fell 5.2% from a year earlier, those among restaurants rose 4.5%, data from private credit company Teikoku Databank showed.
    Bankruptcies among restaurants with less than 10 million yen in liabilities were up by 137% for the same period, Tokyo Shoko Research, a firm that monitors similar data, said, while the total for the service-sector, including restaurants, rose 64.4%.
    But industry insiders expect that is just the tip of the iceberg, as local shops often close up with no official filing.
    ""Many ramen shops won't appear in any figures when they're closing down because they're small, privately owned businesses,"" said Haga, who has gone without salary since April.
Hiroaki Nakazawa, a 42-year-old pharmacist who has frequented Shirohachi for about a decade, said he felt sad about its closure. ""There's only one place like this.""
At least seven other noodle stalls in the central Tokyo area popular with tourists where Haga has his table-less shop, which seats nine people at the counter, have already closed since March this year.
    Nationwide, 34 ramen businesses with at least 10 million yen in liabilities went bankrupt during the first nine months of 2020, also a record high for the period, Teikoku Databank said.
Graphic: Japan's ramen shop bankruptcies are rising, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/JAPAN-BANKRUPTCY/ygdvzbbkwvw/chart.png
    LACK OF FUNDS
    Another reason why experts say statistics underestimate the true impact of the pandemic on ramen shops is that winding down is expensive due to requirements from landlords to leave the stores stripped down after a six-month notice period.
    ""There are many firms with a lack of cash flow,"" said Manabu Shintani, CEO of Actpro Co, a property intermediation services provider.
    Among noodle shops, the first to fold this year were those whose businesses were already on knife-edge before COVID-19, often run by elderly owners, said Takeshi Yamamoto, an independent ramen critic who tracks shop closures.
    Those were followed by a wave of noodle chains closing outlets, and now some places with younger owners are shutting down, said Yamamoto, who has eaten at more than 10,000 noodle shops.
    He estimated that the real number of ramen shops shutting down nationwide was about 290 in October and November alone.
The spate of closures has helped some. Actpro's platform for matching businesses looking to shut down with firms hoping to move into the location being vacated has been a hit.
Once a match is made, a restaurant owner and the incoming owner negotiate with the landlord, cutting costs.
    The company has seen the matchings quadruple to about 70 to 80 a month after the crisis started taking its toll, Shintani said.
    Shirohachi's Haga used about $29,000 in government subsidies to get through until his closure.
He tried offering his noodles through takeout but was unable to make up for the income he lost after office workers' visits fell due to work-from-home restrictions.
    ""Even among the most popular places, sales from takeout aren't exceeding"" the sales drop from the crisis, ramen critic Yamamoto said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher in a choppy session on Monday as hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine lifted economically sensitive sectors such as energy and industrials, but a pullback in megacap shares curbed gains on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
Cyclicals led gains, with energy ahead by 7.09% while industrials and financials each rose more than 1%, as data showed monthly business activity expanded at the fastest rate in more than five years.
Energy shares got a boost from another gain in oil prices, which have risen on anticipation a vaccine will help demand recover.
""It's Monday vaccine trade day,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Jupiter, Florida. 
""As they move out of those growth names, it's still this continued move into larger cyclical, value names which is why you see the Dow performing so well and the Nasdaq under some pressure.""
Declines in technology and tech-related heavyweight names such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) muted gains as investors rotated out of stocks seen as safe bets following a coronavirus-led crash earlier this year.
Major averages got a late boost after the Wall Street Journal reported U.S. President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to be the next Treasury secretary. 
""A known commodity in a uncertain situation is a potential boon for the market,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
""The Treasury is probably more important than congress in getting the next stimulus package through. This removes a huge roadblock.""

Evidence of high efficacy rates in experimental COVID-19 vaccines had lifted the S&P 500 to a record high this month and brought the blue-chip Dow close to breaching 30,000 points for the first time, breathing new life into cyclical stocks that were beaten down during the recession. 
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc on Monday became the latest major drugmaker to say its vaccine could be around 90% effective, while the U.S. health regulator is likely to approve in mid-December the distribution of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine.
Volume is expected to be on the lighter side moving closer to the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. 
Sentiment was dented by new lockdowns to contain a surge in coronavirus infections. Nevada on Sunday tightened curbs on casinos, restaurants and bars, while imposing a broader mandate for face-coverings over the next three weeks.
Hopes of more monetary stimulus were dampened after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week pulled the plug on some of the Fed's pandemic emergency lending programs.
Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Barkin said on Monday that households could struggle over the next several months without more government aid to provide support until a vaccine becomes widely available.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares surged 6.58% to move closer toward hitting $500 billion in market capitalization ahead of its inclusion in the S&P 500 next month.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.93-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 177 new highs and 11 new lows.

More retail earnings are due out on Tuesday, as well as reports from the tech world. A bunch of Fed officials are also scheduled to speak.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. There are still retailer profit reports to come
There are some retail earnings report stragglers due out.  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) is seen reporting earnings per share of $1.70 on revenue of $10.9 billion. Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE:DKS) is seen reporting EPS of $1.04 on revenue of $2.2 billion.  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) is expected to report profit of $1.15 a share on sales of $6.1 billion, and  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF) is expected to report EPS of 65 cents on revenue of $972 million.

2. These tech companies probably benefited from work-from-homeHP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) and VMware Inc (NYSE:VMW) report their earnings after the closing bell. The two are likely beneficiaries of the work-from-home trend as people bought new laptops and software to spruce up their home offices.
HP is seen reporting EPS of 52 cents on sales of $14.6 billion, while VMware is expected to report profit of $1.44 a share on revenue of $2.8 billion. 
3. Fed officials slated to speak as one of their alumnae heads to Treasury
On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was President-elect Joe Biden’s choice for Treasury Secretary. That is seen as a bullish sign for the markets, as Yellen is considered to be pro-stimulus to help boost the economic recovery.

1034,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Biden Plans to Nominate Janet Yellen for Treasury Secretary,"(Bloomberg) -- President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to serve as his Treasury secretary, a move that would put the first woman and a seasoned central banker into the nation’s top economic policy job as the coronavirus pandemic threatens another U.S. downturn, people familiar with the matter said.
In Yellen, Biden is likely to find support from both Wall Street, which feared a more provocative pick such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, and progressives, who were concerned he might choose someone too friendly to big banks and the wealthy.
If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen, 74, would be tasked with helping steer the U.S. economy through a resurgent pandemic that is already causing parts of the nation to resume painful lockdowns. The most immediate challenge would be breaking a logjam on Capitol Hill to deliver economic relief to long and growing unemployment lines.
Biden’s transition team declined to comment.
Nine months into the pandemic, more than six million people still claim extended unemployment assistance and joblessness is again on the rise as U.S. coronavirus infections spiked to well more than 100,000 per day.
Investors, though, are likely to welcome Yellen. During her time as Fed chair, tech stocks doubled even as she presided over the first interest rate increases in 11 years.
At the same time, investors may be wary of recent comments she made on the need to take greater regulatory action after financial market mayhem when the economy was locked down in March to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
Still, investors are likely to take comfort in her stance in favor of additional emergency government spending.
“While the pandemic is still seriously affecting the economy we need to continue extraordinary fiscal support, but even beyond that I think it will be necessary,” Yellen said Oct. 19 on Bloomberg Television.
But delivering will be tough. Talks between Republicans and Democrats on stimulus have been stalled for months over widely different views on the amount of fresh appropriations needed for Covid-19 relief. The Trump administration, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, has been unable to find common ground since May.
Yellen’s selection was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.

Up about 500% in 2020, Tesla has become by far the world's most valuable automaker, despite production that is a fraction of Toyota, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) or General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Graphic: Tesla in the S&P 500: small profits in a big pond, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/TESLA/xlbpgzznyvq/chart.png
Tesla is now five times more valuable than GM and Ford combined and the latest rise in the Silicon Valley automaker's shares came after Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives bumped his price target to $560 from $500. 
While he maintained his neutral rating, Ives also said the stock could hit $1,000 in a ""Bull Case"", reflecting steeper demand for electric vehicles in coming years.
However, the median price target of analysts covering the stock is $385, about 26% below the $519 it hit on Monday, reflecting a belief among many on Wall Street that Tesla's shares have become overvalued.
Index funds trying to match the S&P 500's performance will have to buy more than $50 billion of Tesla's stock ahead of its inclusion on Dec. 21, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated last week that actively managed mutual funds could buy another $8 billion.

Now worth $491 billion, Tesla is Wall Street's seventh most valuable company, just behind Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and just ahead of Visa (NYSE:V), Refinitiv data shows.

(Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine shows up to 90% efficacy
An interim analysis of late-stage trials of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine finds it prevented 70% of COVID-19 cases with no confirmed serious adverse effects, the company announced on Monday. In 8,895 participants who got two full doses, the efficacy was 62%. But due to a dosing error that proved to be a happy accident, among 2,741 volunteers who got a half dose followed by a full dose, efficacy rose to 90%.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported that their vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing illness. But AstraZeneca's vaccine is cheaper, easier to make, and can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures. Investment analysts at SVB Leerink said Astra's vaccine was unlikely to gain U.S. approval because safety data so far are inadequate and the trial design did not meet U.S. requirements for representation of high-risk groups such as the elderly and minorities. AstraZeneca said it plans to seek approval to modify its U.S. study to get more data on the smaller initial dose. Eventually, all three vaccines could prove comparable. ""My suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we'll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection,"" said immunologist Danny Altmann of Imperial College London. (https://reut.rs/2J5n4Oi; https:// COVID-19 reinfection appears unlikely for at least 6 months People who have had COVID-19 are unlikely to contract it again for at least six months, British researchers said on Thursday in a report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Between April and November, they tracked more than 12,000 frontline healthcare workers at high risk for infection with the new coronavirus. COVID-19 with symptoms occurred in 89 of 11,052 workers who did not already have antibodies showing exposure to the virus, whereas none of the 1,246 staff with antibodies developed a recurrent infection. Staff with antibodies were also less likely to test positive for COVID-19 without symptoms, the researchers said. ""This is really good news because we can be confident that, at least in the short term, most people who get COVID-19 won't get it again,"" said coauthor David Eyre of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Population Health. Maria van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization added, ""We still need to follow these individuals for a longer period of time to see how long immunity lasts."" (https:// https://reut.rs/3pUOyXO) Delirium may signal COVID-19 in elderly Delirium is common among older patients with COVID-19 and may be their only symptom, U.S. researchers warned on Thursday in JAMA Network Open. Among more than 800 COVID-19 patients over age 65 who showed up at emergency departments around the country, nearly 30% had delirium, they found. Overall, delirium was the sixth most common of all the symptoms and signs in these older patients. Those most at risk for delirium included elders with vision or hearing impairment, stroke, Parkinson's disease and residents of assisted living or skilled nursing facilities. Delirium is not on any official list of COVID-19 signs and symptoms, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should add it, said coauthor Dr. Maura Kennedy of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ""Sometimes delirium is the chief complaint when these patients arrive at the emergency department,"" Kennedy said. ""But there can be a number of reasons they come, including falls that occurred because of the delirium. They may present without what we consider typical COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, shortness of breath and cough."" (https:// New data help distinguish COVID-19 from flu Certain findings can help distinguish COVID-19 from influenza or other respiratory illnesses, a new study suggests. Israeli doctors studied 693 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, plus more than 8,000 adults who had been hospitalized in previous years for the flu or severe respiratory infections. Compared to the other patients, those with COVID-19 were on average younger, more overweight, and had fewer preexisting conditions other than dementia, which was more prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Upon hospital admission, COVID-19 patients had overall lower levels of infection-fighting white blood cells and neutrophils, but their hearts were beating faster, they had less oxygen in their blood, and they had higher percentages of immune-system B cells, which produce antibodies to attack invading germs, and T cells, which destroy cells that have become infected. During the first two days of hospitalization, white blood cell and neutrophil levels rose in COVID-19 patients but fell in the other groups, the researchers said in a paper posted on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. ""At the dawn of winter, recognizing the characteristics discriminating COVID-19 from influenza, will be critical to support the management of the current pandemic,"" they conclude. (https://

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 02:16PM ET</span>",EU plans easier access to generics in potential blow to big drugmakers,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission wants to make it easier for patients to access cheaper, generic medicines, a draft EU document seen by Reuters shows, in a move that could cut the revenues of big pharmaceutical firms.
The EU executive outlines its strategy for the sector in a document due to be published on Wednesday, with the goal of making drugs more affordable and preventing the dramatic shortages seen in the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring.
""The Commission will consider targeted policies that support greater generic and biosimilar competition,"" the document says.
Generic versions of medicines are effectively cheaper copies of patented drugs and are based on the same active substances. They can only be marketed by manufacturers after intellectual property rights to the original drug expire.
The proposal says EU antitrust rules will be applied more strictly to stop patent-holding pharmaceutical companies that ""hinder the entry or expansion of the more affordable medicines of their generic and biosimilar competitors"".
Among the EU's possible actions, expected in 2022, are the removal of barriers that delay the entry of generics to market, increased uptake by health systems and clearer provisions for the conduct of trials on patented products to support generic marketing authorisation applications.
The Commission also says that incentives and obligations for pharma firms may be reviewed by 2022 to link them more closely to requirements for wider distribution and greater competition. 
This could require drugmakers to make their patented drugs available in all EU 27 states or risk shorter period of intellectual property rights. Smaller countries are often not on the radar of big drugmakers because they are less profitable. 
Amid medicines in short or no supply in the bloc are antibiotics and drugs for children and rare diseases. The Commission estimates that 95% of the more than 7,000 known rare illnesses have no treatment to date.
Shortages in the bloc were made worse in the first phase of the pandemic, amid export bans and other trade restrictions and when India curbed the export of paracetamol, the painkiller temporarily disappeared from shelves in many EU countries.

The document says measures will be introduced in 2022 to boost the EU's ""strategic autonomy"", including earlier notification of shortages and enhanced transparency of stocks.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","Decades of work, and half a dose of fortune, drove Oxford vaccine success","By Alistair Smout, Kate Kelland and Ludwig Burger
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - It took Oxford University's brightest minds decades of work to give them the expertise to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. In the end, it was a momentary error - and a dose of good fortune - that carried them over the line.
The Oxford vaccinologists were exhilarated on Monday when drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), with whom they developed the shot, announced that it could be around 90% effective, citing data from late-stage trials.
""It can only happen if extraordinary support is provided,"" Adrian Hill, director of Oxford University's Jenner Institute which developed the shot, told Reuters. ""We had pretty well the whole institute in Oxford working on this vaccine.""
While skill and hard work drove development, AstraZeneca said it was a minor mistake that made the team realise how they could significantly boost the shot's success rate, to as much as 90% from around 60%: by administering a half dose, followed by a full dose a month later.
""The reason we had the half dose is serendipity,"" Mene Pangalos, head of AstraZeneca's non-oncology research and development, told Reuters.
The plan was for trial participants in Britain to receive two full doses, but researchers were perplexed when they noticed that side effects, such as fatigue, headaches or arm aches were milder than expected, Pangalos said.
""So we went back and checked ... and we found out that they had underpredicted the dose of the vaccine by half.""
He said the team nonetheless decided to press ahead with that half dose group, and to administer the second, full dose booster shot at the scheduled time. 
The results showed the vaccine was 90% effective among this group, while a larger group who had received two full doses produced an efficacy read-out of 62%, leading to an overall efficacy of 70% across both dosing patterns, Pangalos said.
""That, in essence, is how we stumbled upon doing half dose-full dose (group),"" he told Reuters. ""Yes, it was a mistake.""
The vaccine uses a harmless adenovirus to deliver genetic material that tricks the human body to produce proteins known as antigens that are normally found on the coronavirus surface, helping the immune system develop an arsenal against infection.
Pangalos said more analysis was needed to explain why an initial lower dose bolstered protection. One possible explanation was that lower antigen levels to begin with triggered an overall better immune system build-up, he added.
1991 TO TODAY
Even though good fortune played its part, the development of what Oxford scientists hailed as ""a vaccine for the world"" was built upon 30 years of testing and tweaking of methods.
The adenovirus ""viral vector"" platform that their candidate uses has been around since 1991, said Hill of the university's Jenner Institute. 
He had been working with Sarah Gilbert, another vaccinologist, to fine-tune the technology. This has involved using a chimpanzee cold virus as the vector to deliver the instructions, in trials with diseases such as flu, MERS and Ebola over the last decade. The hope was that it would one day prove its potential against one or more such deadly diseases.
They turned their attention to the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in January. Oxford Vice-Chancellor Louise Richardson said she was told of Gilbert's work and that it looked promising for the new coronavirus, but was operating on a shoestring.
The university then offered a million pounds to underwrite the research until more funding came on board, Richardson told reporters, which duly arrived when the government and AstraZeneca became involved in May.
The unprecedented urgency and resources given to Oxford to prove the platform's effectiveness against COVID-19 meant it leap-frogged the vaccines against those other pathogens, which are still in early-stage trials.
Gilbert said the experience with MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which is caused by a different type of coronavirus, was especially instructive.
""It showed us that we could make a vaccine with this technology that would induce good immune responses against the coronavirus spike protein,"" she told reporters.
""We'd also been thinking about how to go really quickly when a new pathogen arises and we need to make a new vaccine. We'd done some work preparing for that.""
2020: 'A VERY LONG YEAR'
Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group and a professor who has spent two decades running clinical trials, said this experience gave him confidence in the prospects for Oxford's new vaccine, known initially as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. 
""I think we knew right from the beginning of the year that if we could go through this development, we may well have something which can make a difference,"" Pollard told Reuters.
But there was an issue. Limited interest in Oxford's vaccines for other pathogens before this year meant they didn't have the funding to prove the platform's efficacy: until now.
""You either need a massive amount of money, or a pandemic to bring in that resource, and it's tremendous that we've had this opportunity to validate that chimpanzee adenovirus technology for this coronavirus,"" Hill said.
""If you'd said to me a year ago that in 2020 anybody would make a vaccine for a global pandemic - and in months rather than years - I would have thought that was hugely challenging.""
Pollard said that while speed of the COVID-19 vaccine's development was in some ways extraordinary, 2020 had ""been a very long year"" since the team started work on the vaccine in January.
That culminated this past weekend, Pollard said, in having ""an enormous mountain to climb to pull all of the information together"" to be able to issue Monday's data release showing the vaccine can be up to 90% effective. 
""The last few weeks have been pretty exhausting. The feeling is absolutely one of extreme fatigue and tiredness at this point,"" he told Reuters, speaking before he briefed the office of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the findings. 

""If the results have not met those regulatory requirements, they would have told us just to carry on with the trial. So it was a great relief.""

(Reuters) - The top U.S. infectious disease medical association said on Monday that  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD)'s antiviral drug remdesivir should be used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients despite a World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation last week against its use.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in updated guidelines said its experts back the drug for use in severe COVID-19 patients based on a clinical trial showing it reduced hospital stays. The WHO study that led to its recommendation against the drug suggested it had no benefit in saving lives or reducing the need for mechanical breathing assistance. 
""As hospitals around the United States fill up, the IDSA panel views the effect of remdesivir speeding up time to recovery to be an important benefit,"" Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, co-chair of the society's COVID-19 treatment and management guidelines expert panel, said on a call with reporters. ""Better medicines that improve survival are clearly needed."" 
Unlike the trial that led to its U.S. regulatory approval, the WHO's study was not placebo-controlled. Studies with a placebo comparison are generally considered more scientifically rigorous than those without a control group.
The IDSA also has advised against the routine use of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co's COVID-19 antibody treatment bamlanivimab, which received U.S. emergency use authorization. The IDSA panel said it recommended against its routine use for ambulatory patients, but that it may still be appropriate for patients with increased risks after a discussion with their doctor. 

""Antibodies may end up having a role. I think we just need more definitive data,"" Dr. Gandhi said. ""I want to keep our eye on what benefit they may end up having as well as which patients are most likely to benefit."" 
It said Roche Holdings Ag's rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra, known chemically as tocilizumab, is not recommended for routine use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, saying there was still not enough evidence supporting its benefits.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",AstraZeneca says COVID-19 'vaccine for the world' can be 90% effective,"By Kate Holton, Josephine Mason and Kate Kelland
LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said on Monday its COVID-19 vaccine could be as much as 90% effective, giving the world's fight against the global pandemic a new weapon, cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale-up than rivals.
The British drugmaker said it will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, around four times as many as U.S. competitor  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE). Seven hundred million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021.
""This means we have a vaccine for the world,"" said Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford University vaccine group that developed the drug.
The vaccine on average prevented 70% of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil but the success rate rose to 90% if the vaccine was administered as a half dose followed by a full dose. The efficacy was 62% if the full dose was given twice, as it was for most study participants.
No serious safety events were confirmed, the company said.
AstraZeneca's shares fell 4%, on track for their worst daily performance in six-months, as investors perceived the efficacy data as disappointing compared with rivals. Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which reported that their vaccines prevented around 95% of cases, had set the bar for success sky-high.
The AstraZeneca shot does, however, have some advantages over offerings from U.S. rivals.
The drug's cost to governments works out at just a few dollars a shot, a fraction of the price of shots from Pfizer and Moderna, which use a more unconventional technology.
It can also be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute, especially in poor countries, than Pfizer's, which needs to be shipped and stored at -70C.
The faster roll-out means both rich and poor countries that had been drawing up plans to ration vaccines can distribute them more widely, helping to eventually halt the social and economic disruption of a pandemic that has killed 1.4 million people.
""The bulk of the vaccine rollout programme will be in January, February, March. And we hope that sometime after Easter things will be able to start to get back to normal,"" said Matt Hancock, health secretary of Britain which has pre-ordered 100 million doses for its 67 million people.
In poor countries, where the logistics of distributing rival vaccines posed a bigger challenge, the effect of a cheaper and easier alternative could be even more pronounced. Zahid Maleque, health minister of Bangladesh, which is buying in 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine made in India, called the findings ""really good news"".
""The big advantage of having the vaccine is that it can be stored, transported and handled at 2-8 degrees Celsius, and we have that storage facility,"" he said.
The World Health Organization's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan called the results ""encouraging"" and said the health body looked forward to seeing the data.
""We welcome the efforts of Oxford/AZ to make the vaccine affordable and easy to store, which will be good for countries and people everywhere.""
""WE'LL BE A LOT HAPPIER""
Nevertheless, there was criticism of AstraZeneca's findings. 
Analysts from SVB Leerink, a healthcare-focused investment bank, said AstraZeneca had not yet disclosed enough information about safety events that had forced it to temporarily put a study on hold in the United States.
Leerink noted that only a small number of people had received the smaller first dose. Of 131 cases of COVID-19 in the study, researchers did not say how many had received the smaller initial dose to form the basis for their 90% efficacy finding.
Leerink said it was unlikely the vaccine would be approved for use in the United States, because the data so far did not match requirements set by regulators there. AstraZeneca said it plans to seek approval to modify its U.S. study to get more data on the smaller initial dose.
Some scientists said all three vaccines could prove comparable in the end.
""I think it is a real fool's errand to start trying to pick these three (Pfizer/Moderna/Astra) apart on the basis of snippets of phase 3 data from press releases,"" said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London. 
""For the bigger picture, my suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we'll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we'll be a lot happier.""
Pascal Soriot, Astra's chief executive, said the smaller initial dose was good news, as it meant limited supplies could stretch further to vaccinate more people. 
The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus, a different approach from Pfizer and Moderna, which rely on new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA).

AstraZeneca will now prepare regulatory submission of the data to authorities around the world that have a framework for conditional or early approval. It will also seek an emergency use listing from the WHO to speed up availability in poor countries.

LONDON (Reuters) - Plug-in hybrid cars emit far more CO2 than advertised, according to tests commissioned by European campaign group Transport and Environment (T&E), which on Monday called on governments to end subsidies and tax breaks for such models.
The tests were conducted by Emissions Analytics on three plug-in hybrid SUV models - BMW's X5, Volvo's XC60 and Mitsubishi Motor Corp's Outlander - and found that even under optimal conditions they emitted far more CO2 than advertised.
""Plug-in hybrids are fake electric cars, built for lab tests and tax breaks, not real driving,"" Julia Poliscanova, T&E's senior director for clean vehicles said in a statement. ""Governments should stop subsidising these cars with billions in taxpayers' money."" 
In response to requests for comment, a Volvo spokesperson in an email said all Volvo cars are certified and fully comply with existing emissions legislation.
Mitsubishi spokeswoman Amanda Gibson said, also by email, that independent tests can produce unreliable or variable figures depending on conditions and ""we naturally contest any findings where we have no oversight of the testing or methodology"".
BMW did not immediately reply.
T&E's announcement came just days after proposed European Union rules were released laying out tight emissions limits for carmakers to hit for their activities to be classed as a sustainable investment.
Under those rules, hybrid vehicles would lose their ""green"" label from 2026 onward.
Plug-in hybrids are a halfway house between conventional combustion engines and electric vehicles, combining a smaller engine with an electric motor and battery.
These hybrids have frequently been referred to as a ""gateway technology"" designed to get consumers comfortable with electric vehicle (EV) technology, especially as nervousness about the driving range of fully-electric vehicles has been an obstacle to mass adoption. 
It has also helped carmakers stretch returns on their investments in combustion engine technologies.
In the first three quarters of 2020, sales of plug-in hybrids accounted for close to half of all electric or partially-electric vehicles in the European Union, as a growing number of consumers took advantage of government subsidies or tax breaks to buy them. 
But climate groups like T&E have been critical of plug-in hybrids as unlike fully-electric models they emit CO2 when relying on their fossil-fuel engine instead of the battery.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: JPMorgan dominates gold market with record $1 billion precious metals revenue,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has earned record revenue of around $1 billion so far this year from trading, storing and financing precious metals, vastly outperforming rival banks, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The coronavirus has created a bonanza for investment banks dealing in gold, silver and other precious metals by triggering massive investor purchases and rupturing the normal workings of the market.
But JPMorgan has dominated, growing its share of the market. 
The U.S. bank's revenue by mid-November accounts for at least half of the $1.7 billion to $2 billion that consultancy McKinsey CIB Insights estimates the top 10 investment banks combined will make this year from precious metals, mostly gold.
Its commodities division is on track to bring in more than $1.5 billion this year and could challenge Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) for the title of top earner, the sources said.
JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
Individual investment banks have rarely made more than $1 billion in commodities in recent years, and none has ever before earned more than around $600 million in precious metals in a single year, said George Kuznetsov at McKinsey CIB Insights. 
(For a graphic on Commodities bonanza, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xklvybeqqpg/COMMODITIES%20BONANZA%20Q3.JPG)
JPMorgan is the largest bank in the United States and one of the biggest in the world. 
It sits at the heart of the global bullion market, and its activities span trading physical bars to derivatives, running vaults and clearing trades in London, the biggest trade hub. 
REVENUE WINDFALL
Driving profit has been the clamour for gold and silver from investors, mainly in Europe and North America, worried the coronavirus pandemic and money-printing by central banks could devalue other assets. 
These investors pushed gold prices to record highs above $2,000 an ounce earlier this year.
Added to that are profits earned on the Comex futures exchange in New York, where supply issues earlier this year made it more lucrative for those with access to physical gold to trade precious metals.
Banks such as JPMorgan took advantage of opportunities on Comex and helped clients do the same. 
JPMorgan's client business dwarfs that of others. 
Data from CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), which runs Comex, show JPMorgan's clients accounted for one-third of all trade in gold bars registered with the exchange in October, and more than two fifths in June. 
Like other big banks, JPMorgan was able to get and ship metal cheaply and in large quantities when other, smaller traders could not, sources said. 
The revenue windfall will likely fade as trading on Comex reverts to normal patterns, but high gold prices and interest from investors mean this business will remain profitable. 

""2020 is going to be an outlier year,"" said Kuznetsov at McKinsey.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",GM will recall 5.9 million vehicles for air bag issue: safety agency,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will recall 5.9 million vehicles with potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators after a U.S. safety agency said Monday it had rejected the Detroit automaker's petition to avoid the callback.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said GM must recall the 2007-2014 model year trucks and SUVs because the inflators ""are at risk of the same type of explosion after long-term exposure to high heat and humidity as other recalled Takata inflators.""
GM has estimated in securities filings it would cost $1.2 billion if it were required to replace air bag inflators it had sought to avoid fixing.
The company had argued the recalls were unnecessary because they did not pose a safety risk.
GM said on Monday it still believed ""a recall of these vehicles is not warranted based on the factual and scientific record."" The company said it ""will abide by NHTSA’s decision and begin taking the necessary steps.""
The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of about 63 million inflators. Worldwide, about 100 million inflators by 19 major automakers were recalled.
The recall includes some Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra and GMC Yukon vehicles built over an eight-year period.
In total, 18 U.S. deaths have been reported tied to Takata air bag inflators -- though none in GM vehicles.

To date, 15 U.S. deaths have been reported in Honda vehicles, two in Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co vehicles and one in a BMW since 2009.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week higher, on news that a third experimental vaccine to treat the Covid-19 vaccine had registered an effectiveness rate of 90% or more. That helped to mitigate concerns that the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday will only propel the current wave of the pandemic even more violently through the U.S.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 215 points, or 0.7% at 29,478 points. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite were both up 0.6%.
On a light day for data, sentiment was mainly informed by the news that AstraZeneca's experimental drug had proven effective in up to 90% of cases, according to preliminary data from a late-stage trial. The message was slightly blunted by the company also saying that a parallel regimen in the test had shown a lower success rate of 62%. As the less effective regiment requires more vaccine resources of the two, it's not clear why the less effective regimen will be relevant going forward.  AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) ADRs were down 2.6% in early trade.
As with most releases on the progress of vaccine development, the news helped the stocks worst hit by this year's lockdowns and consumer fear of infection. The Dow Jones Airlines index rose 2.0%. while department store stock also leaped: Macy’s (NYSE:M) stock and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock both hit five-month highs, rising 6.7% and 5.2% respectively. Kohls (NYSE:KSS) stock rose 2.4% but failed to post a new high.
By the same token, stay-at-home stock suffered: Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock fell 4.2% while Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock fell 3.2%. Big Tech names such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) all edged down slightly, as money that had sought safety in such names earlier in the year ventured out in search of more attractively-valued ones.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a strategy note that they expect the rotation into cyclical and value stocks to continue broadly, if not smoothly, as hopes for a global economic rebound in 2021 solidify.
""We would use any volatility to re-risk as markets are likely to focus increasingly on the recovery next year,"" global equity strategy chief Christian Mueller-Glissmanm wrote.

1056,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Rally 2.0 Is On for Emerging Markets as Stocks Add $8 Trillion,"(Bloomberg) -- The much-awaited rally 2.0 in emerging-market stocks may already be under way.
Investors’ risk appetite got a boost after Joe Biden’s U.S. presidential win and successes in vaccine development, pushing the benchmark MSCI gauge toward its best month since March 2016. The emerging-market equity rebound since the coronavirus rout in March is now worth $8.3 trillion, meaning more shareholder wealth has been added in the past eight months than in the two-year rally beginning 2016.
When the earlier advance was halted by U.S.-China trade tensions in January 2018, most money managers called it an interruption rather than the end of the rotation into emerging markets. They predicted the second leg of that rally would start once trade tensions subsided. Now, signs are that’s exactly what’s happening, albeit after a few months’ delay because of the pandemic.
Investors from BofA Securities to Renaissance Capital echo that view. A BofA survey this month among money managers overseeing $526 billion found that emerging markets were their most preferred destination. Investors should “buy anything and everything” in emerging and frontier markets next year as the most beaten-down asset classes may bounce back the quickest, RenCap’s London-based Chief Economist Charles Robertson and Analyst Vikram Lopez wrote.
The Rally in Four Charts
Developing-nation equities have added $8.32 trillion since a low in March, compared with $8.27 trillion between January 2016 and January 2018.
The MSCI Emerging Markets has risen to the highest level since March relative to the S&P 500, cementing its outpeformance over U.S. stocks.
Analysts have upgraded their consensus earnings estimate for the MSCI gauge for an 11th successive week, the most sustained increases since February 2018.
Despite their third successive quarter of gains, emerging-market stocks remain cheap in relative terms. The MSCI gauge trades at a valuation discount of 31% to the S&P 500, compared with its lifetime average of 25%.
Similarly, the relative strength index on the MSCI gauge’s monthly chart is under 64, far below the 70 level that would mark its “overbought” level. In the meltdowns that coincided with the global financial crisis and the start of the U.S.-China trade war, the stocks index didn’t enter a declining phase until the monthly RSI overshot 70 by a wide margin.
Both those factors suggest there’s enough momentum and value in emerging-market stocks to carry the current risk-on move well into 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Security Administration said it screened 1.047 million passengers on Sunday, the highest number since mid-March.
The number of U.S. air travelers is still nearly 60% lower than the same date last year but Sunday was the second time in three days that passengers screened topped 1 million. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday urged Americans not to travel during this week’s Thanksgiving holiday to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus as cases of COVID-19 spike around the United States.
There have been just three days since March 16 that the number of U.S. airline passengers screened topped 1 million, with the first being Oct. 18 when it was 1.031 million.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) have cautioned that the recent surge in COVID-19 cases may have a negative impact on travel over the winter holidays, a period the sector had hoped would see improved bookings.
U.S. airlines say travel demand remains down 62%, while international travel demand remains down more than 70%. Some officials think U.S. restrictions barring many non-U.S. citizens from arrival could be eliminated or reduced with new testing.
The CDC on Saturday said COVID-19 testing before and after international travel can reduce risk and ""make travel safer by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations.""
On Wednesday, the chief executives of the seven largest U.S. airlines made a fresh plea for more payroll relief in a letter to congressional leaders.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines last month furloughed 32,000 workers.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought travel to a near halt earlier in the year, forcing airlines to scale back operations and seek government bailouts.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) have been awarded a federal contract worth up to $810 million to offer their ride-hail services to public agencies and their more than 4 million employees and contractors across the country.
The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages services for federal agencies, issued its final five-year award on Monday, said Veronica Juarez, Lyft's vice president of social enterprise and government.
While individual federal employees have previously been able to use ride-hail services for travel, the new contract allows the companies to formally launch their services within agencies and directly work with officials to promote the service.
Juarez said the award capped a nearly four-year negotiation process. She declined to say how much revenue Lyft expected from the contract, but said the U.S. government spends around $200 million on ground transportation each year.
Lyft also hopes the government contract will open doors to further collaboration on public health and equity projects that require transportation. 
The GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the agency in April announced the award to Uber and Lyft tentatively. 
At the time, the agency said in a blog post that it had negotiated discounts with the companies of 2%-4% compared with large commercial customers and that Uber and Lyft had agreed to waive some additional fees.
Uber in a statement said working with the federal government was part of its Uber for Business program that serves large companies and organizations.
""The expansion of our customer base to include government is a natural next step for us, and we're proud to help federal agencies tackle some of the biggest administrative challenges they face,"" Ronnie Gurion, global head of Uber for Business, said in a statement.

(Reuters) - Cineworld, owner of the U.S. Regal cinema chain, secured an additional $750 million in funding on Monday to cushion itself against the impact of the coronavirus as it aims to reopen next year.
The deal, the latest in several rounds of debt reordering and restructuring which the company has been forced into since March, involved the issue of equity warrants which could hand around 10% of company shares to its creditors.
""We look forward to resuming our operations and welcoming movie fans around the world back to the big screen for an exciting and full slate of films in 2021,"" Chief Executive Officer Mooky Greidinger said.
Cineworld, which has shut 536 Regal theatres in the U.S. and its 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theatres in the UK, has cut costs to $60 million a month with theatres closed.
The company, which has placed all capital expenditure on hold, said it has agreed long-term rent deferrals with key landlords, along with new lease agreements in some cases, while talks with other landlords are also ongoing.
Along with the issue of new warrants, it said it has secured $450 million in new loans, debt waivers until June 2022, extended its revolving credit line and expects a tax refund of over $200 million brought forward to 2021. 
Cineworld has been carrying heavy debt due in part to its $3.6 billion acquisition of Regal in 2018.
While U.S. rival AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has kept its doors open with enough cash until early 2021, Cineworld's base case scenario assumes it has enough money if it reopens its venues by next May.
Shares in Cineworld, which have lost three quarters of their value since the start of this year, jumped 20% in response to the deal, as stock market investors globally also welcomed more positive results from coronavirus vaccine trials.

""With vaccines on the horizon and liquidity secured, we think that (Cineworld) is now well-placed in a re-opening scenario,"" analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulator on Monday fined currency options broker TFS-ICAP 3.44 million pounds ($4.6 million) for routinely reporting fake trades to customers for over seven years.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that between 2008 and 2015, brokers at the firm were telling customers that a trade had occurred at a particular price or quantity, when no such trade had actually taken place, a practice known as ""printing"". 
""Brokers saw printing as being part of the role and one that 'everyone was doing',"" the FCA said.
""It took place openly on desks, with the motivation of generating business for the firm.""
Printing trades could generate additional revenue and in turn boost pay of brokers, the regulator said.
TFS-ICAP was not able to comment immediately.
The fine, following an investigation that also involved regulators from the United States, would have been five million pounds had TFS-ICAP not agreed to resolve the case, the FCA said.
""The FCA is grateful for the assistance provided by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the United States in this investigation,"" the watchdog said in a statement.
Since 2018, a senior manager and desk head have left TFS-ICAP, and the composition of its board has changed, the FCA said.
An independent monitor appointed in 2018 has reported no instances of printing.
""This market should take notice that printing, or providing information to clients where the basis for the information is not true, is not in keeping with appropriate standards of market conduct,"" said Mark Steward, the FCA's executive director of enforcement and market oversight.

Under the plan, the government would receive warrants in exchange for funds injected in privately owned Aegean Airlines, which has been hard hit by the pandemic.
Aegean shareholders would in addition provide another 60 million euros in new capital under the plan, government spokesman Stelios Petsas said.
According to Aegean's 2019 balance sheet, the latest available data, the airline had total equity at that time of 328.4 mln euros, or 71.4 million shares outstanding.
The warrants will give the government the right to buy shares in the airline at a set price and during a specific time period. 
""The plan for state support of the airline includes ... the participation of its shareholders. It is being evaluated in order to secure the official approval from European Commission authorities,"" Petsas told a press briefing.
""Air transport is a crucial sector for the economy, the wings that bring tourists to the country. With the warrants the state will get, when recovery comes, the price of the shares will increase, meaning the state will get money back when this coronavirus adventure is over,"" Petsas said.
Aegean, a member of the Star Alliance airline group, swung into the red in the second quarter, reporting a net loss of 73.4 million euros as it was hit by the grounding of planes as the pandemic hammered air travel. Its revenue fell 64% in the first half of 2020.
In May, Aegean said it would ask the country's big banks for 150 million euros of loans under the COVID-19 Enterprise Guarantee Fund, to deal with hardship related to the pandemic.
Under that programme, the state guarantee would be set at 80% for loans lasting up to five years and for up to 25% of annual turnover. The sum of 150 million euros equals about 11% of the carrier's turnover.
The airline operated less than 50% of its scheduled flights in August with particularly low load factors, due to travel restrictions after a surge in COVID-19 infections.

1064,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 07:02AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Rise 208 Pts; More Positive Vaccine News Noted,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, as investors digest more positive news surrounding potential coronavirus vaccines even as Covid-19 cases rise and states mandate new social restrictions.
At 07:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract rose 208 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 futures traded 22 points, or 0.6%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 48 points, or 0.4%. 
Over the weekend, Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. government’s vaccine development effort, named Operation Warp Speed, announced that the first Covid-19 vaccine doses, produced by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech (F:22UAy), could be handed out to key individuals as early as Dec. 11.
Additionally, trial results announced earlier Monday by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) showed their coronavirus vaccine has up to 90% efficacy in one type of dosage, and could be easily transported at normal refrigerator temperatures.
This news comes after the United States recorded its 12th million Covid-19 case over the weekend and as millions of Americans travel for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, likely furthering the spread of the infectious disease.
Several states have responded to the recent surge in Covid-19 cases by adopting more restrictions on social gatherings. LA County in California, the most populous county in the U.S., has suspended outdoor dining, while Nevada’s Las Vegas has cut occupancy limits in casinos, restaurants and bars to 25% from 50%.
Stocks likely to be in focus Monday include Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), after its experimental  drug to treat Covid-19 patients, which was used by President Donald Trump, was granted emergency authorisation, as well as casino stocks on the Las Vegas news.  
The debate over more fiscal help for Americans also continues with more than 100 economists signing a letter calling for a new round of stimulus, trying to raise the pressure on the political elite in Washington.
Economic data centers around flash U.S. PMI numbers Monday, and if Europe is any sort of gauge they could disappoint. Euro-zone business activity contracted sharply in November as renewed lockdowns forced many firms in the bloc's dominant service industry to close temporarily. 
Oil prices pushed higher Monday on the news that the rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine before Christmas now looks likely. Adding to the positive tone were hopes that a meeting of the top producers next week would see curbs on output extended. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $42.86 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.1% to $45.57, climbing to their highest levels since August, having gained over 5% last week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,865.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.1902.

The world's largest maker of latex gloves has racked up record profits this year on skyrocketing demand for its products and protective gear, thanks to the pandemic.
But as many as 28 of its network of more than 30 factories in the southeast Asian nation will be shut after 1,889 workers tested positive for the virus, from 5,794 screened, said Senior Security Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob.
""On the advice and risk evaluation of the health ministry, it is agreed that 28 of Top Glove factories be closed in stages,"" Ismail said, so as to allow further screening and quarantine.
He did not say when the closures would begin, however.
Last week, the government ordered 14-day curbs through Nov. 30 in an area where Top Glove factories and dormitories are located. The company said the curbs would affect 5,700 workers, or more than a quarter.
Analysts had said the curbs did not change earnings forecasts for the company but they could re-assess projections if infections at the factories rise sharply and curbs are extended.

The company did not immediately respond to questions about details of the situation or the impact on production.

The move could ease negotiations between Atlantia and a consortium led by Italian state-backed investor Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) over the sale of Atlantia's 88% stake in Autostrade, analysts said.
A source close to the matter told Reuters on Sunday that Autostrade's new proposal included all elements requested by Rome and the company had told the government it had accepted a contract also needed to close a long-standing dispute over the 2018 deadly collapse of one of its motorway bridges. 
Rome must now review and give final approval to the plan, which sets an average annual rate of growth for tariffs below a 1.75% cap indicated by the transport authority, the source said.
""The implementation of the changes requested by the government in Autostrade's Economic and Financial Plan would suggest a rapid approval of the same by Rome,"" Fidentiis analyst Marco Opipari said in a note. 
The bridge disaster killed 43 people and generated a public backlash against Autostrade and the Benetton family, which owns 30% in Atlantia through its holding company Edizione. 
Separately, the Benettons said on Sunday they had ousted Gianni Mion as head of Edizione, replacing him with well-connected business professor Enrico Laghi.
Laghi, who once served as temporary administrator for ailing airline Alitalia and has strong links with CDP, could help broker a deal, sources told Reuters. 
A deadline for CDP to present a binding offer for Autostrade expires on Nov. 30.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 05:24AM ET</span>","European shares extend rally on vaccine cheer, M&A support","By Shashank Nayar and Shriya Ramakrishnan
(Reuters) - European shares jumped on Monday as encouraging developments around a coronavirus vaccine spurred bets of a faster economic revival globally, even as a surge in infection rates clouded near-term outlook.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.4% by 0945 GMT and hit a fresh high since late February, with energy and banking sectors leading gains.
The benchmark index has gained nearly 40% from its March lows, helped by a flood of stimulus measures, but gains remain capped as investors weigh risks of rising COVID-19 infections against hopes of a vaccine supporting a recovery.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said its COVID-19 vaccine, developed along with the University of Oxford, could be around 90% effective under one dosing regimen.
The company's shares however slipped 2%, with traders attributing the drop to its vaccine showing lower efficacy than rivals such as  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which has reported the highest efficacy rate of 95% so far.
Euro zone business activity contracted sharply in November as fresh virus restrictions across European countries forced many firms in the bloc's dominant service industry to close temporarily, a survey showed.
Manufacturing activity, however, remained a bright spot as many factories remained open during lockdowns.
""The survey data now has given an indication into how vaccine optimism in the market is translating into the economy,"" said Bert Colijn, senior economist for euro zone at ING.
""I think we get the confirmation that companies are indeed getting more optimistic about future output, as vaccine developments are obviously moving in the right direction.""
Regional stocks were also buoyed by hopes of a swifter economic recovery, after the British government said it was working with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ease COVID-19 restrictions over Christmas.
That helped UK's FTSE 100 index gain 0.3%, along with hopes of a post Brexit-trade deal with the European Union. (L)
Among individual stocks, French bank Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) jumped 3.9% after its Italian unit launched an offer to buy Italian bank Credito Valtellinese (Creval).

LONDON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares and oil prices rose on Monday while the dollar fell as investors pinned hopes for economic revival on coronavirus vaccines, even as the world contended with surging case numbers and delays to fresh U.S. stimulus.
The STOXX index of Europe's 600 largest shares rose 0.5% to its highest since February after AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) become the latest major drugmaker to say its vaccine for the virus could be around 90% effective.
Brent crude futures rose nearly 2% as traders eyed a recovery in crude demand due to the successful vaccine trials, while the euro edged up to 1.1864 as the dollar tested the bottom of a range it has been in for the last few months. [/FRX]
The vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University is the third major trial to report success after U.S.-based  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), sending pandemic-weary investors to take on risk in hopes of a swift economic recovery. 
Their optimism also comes after a top official of the U.S. government's vaccine development effort said Sunday that the first vaccines could be given to U.S. healthcare workers and others recommended by mid-December.
Despite the backdrop of accelerating COVID-19 infections in the United States, the forecast helped to raise hopes that lockdowns that have paralysed the global economy could be nearing an end.
""Today's vaccine news is positive, but it is only partly responsible for the rally in stock markets this morning, which is also being driven by the news that the U.S. hopes to start the vaccination program in under three weeks,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London.
The rally showed investors are willing to look past the grim U.S. case numbers -- cases topped 12 million over the weekend -- and weak European economic data released on Monday.
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, edged down to 52.0 from 55.0.
The European share rally took the region's November gains to 15% and followed another record high for Asian equities even before the announcement of latest vaccine news.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan looked set to end the day 0.8% higher. 
Australian shares gained 0.3% as the country eased some COVID-19 restrictions. Most of the country has seen no new community infections or deaths in several weeks.
Chinese bluechips had finished 1% higher, Seoul's KOPSI climbed 1.9% and Bangkok jumped 2.2% to hit a five-month high. 
GOLD LOSING ITS SHINE
Analysts said the gains belied some uncertainty as monetary and fiscal help for the U.S. economy remained elusive. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that key pandemic lending programs at the Federal Reserve would expire on Dec. 31, putting the outgoing Trump administration at odds with the central bank and potentially adding stress to the economy.
""Discussion is only beginning and may take some time if the recent partisan disagreements over the composition and magnitude of fiscal spending are any indication,"" analysts at ANZ said in a note. 
U.S. e-mini futures for the S&P 500 were 0.7% higher at 3,577 in Europe. Wall Street's main markets had dropped 0.4% to 0.8% on Friday on the combination of aid doubts and the country's surging coronavirus infection rates.
With the vaccine news and dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of six major rivals, down to 92.264, commodity markets were still bullish, with traders optimistic about a recovery in crude demand pushing oil higher.
Brent crude futures rose 63 cents, or 1.4%, to $45.59 a barrel in London. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 49 cents, or 1.2%, to $42.91 a barrel. Both benchmarks jumped 5% last week.
Safe-haven gold, meanwhile, drifted at $1,872 per ounce, having lost almost 10% since peaking in earlier August. [GOL/]
""Positive sentiment continues to be driven by the recent good news about the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines in development and the expectation that the OPEC+ meeting at the end of this month could see the group extend current cuts by three to six 6 months,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global markets Strategist at Axi, a financial services firm.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday as investors react with optimism over the continued progress towards workable coronavirus vaccines.
At 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.3%. 
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) announced earlier Monday that the Covid-19 vaccine it has developed in conjunction with the University of Oxford was up to 90% effective in preventing the Covid-19 virus if patients were given an initial half dose, followed by a full dose. 
However, a second dosing regimen showed only 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The somewhat confused communication of the news has led to AstraZeneca’s stock price falling 1%, even though the Astra/Oxford drug has the significant advantage of being able to be stored without specialist refrigeration equipment.
Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. government’s vaccine development effort, named Operation Warp Speed, announced on Sunday that the first Covid-19 vaccine doses could be handed out to key individuals as early as Dec. 11. Germany's health minister Jens Spahn also said he expected vaccinations in Germany to start by the year-end.
This comes after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and German partner BioNTech, applied for U.S. FDA emergency drug authorization for their Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, the same day as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced that it was close to seeking the same approval. 
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both have efficacy levels around the 95% mark, but Pfizer's requires storage at extremely low temperatures.
Still, the prospect of a vaccine starting to be distributed before the Christmas holiday period has buoyed investors, even though it will take some time before production levels and supply chains are able to match  global demand. Meanwhile, new cases continue to grow and large swathes of public life are curtailed across Europe and the U.S., although France said it will reopen stores before Christmas and the U.K. is  expected to announce relaxations of its lockdown measures later Monday. Both countries have registered falling rates of new infections in recent days.
This latest PMI data showed the French and German service sectors were hit hard by the fresh restrictions to contain the coronavirus. The euro-zone composite output index is due later in the session, and is expected to fall to 45.8 in November from 50.0 in the previous month, with the services sector taking the brunt of the hit.
In corporate news, Cineworld (LON:CINE) stock soared 19% after the cinema chain secured a debt reprieve until June 2022 along with $450 million in new loans in a deal to ride out the Covid-19 pandemic.
Additionally, French bank Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) jumped 3.7% after its Italian unit launched an offer to buy Italian bank Credito Valtellinese.
Oil prices pushed higher Monday on vaccine and lockdown-relaxation news, along with reports of an attack by Yemeni Houthi rebels on a Saudi Arabian oil installation.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",Rush for emerging market company bonds as investors look beyond COVID-19,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are buying up debt of everything from Brazilian airlines to Indian ports, hastened by a hunt for yield and default levels among emerging market companies below that of U.S. peers.
In a sign of the sector's growing appeal, year-to-date flows into emerging bonds have turned positive for the first time in eight months, with $3.5 billion flowing in during the week to Nov. 18, the fourth largest inflows ever, according to BofA, citing EPFR Global data.
A breakdown of the push into emerging market corporate debt is not available, but fund managers see signs of growing interest as the passing of the U.S. election and progress on COVID-19 vaccines reawakens investors' appetite for risk. 
For a graphic on Flows to emerging market debt turn positive:
https://graphics.reuters.com/MARKETS-EMERGING/xlbvgzzxjpq/chart.png
""The Fed has indicated it will not hike rates for a long time and in this environment the search for yield will continue and intensify,"" said Rodica Glavan, head of emerging market corporate fixed income at Insight Investment.
""People need to put money to work and as inflows come in they will need to be invested and EM corporates stand to benefit.""
EM corporate fixed income offers a year-to-date return of 5.6%, less than 30-year Treasury bonds, but more than other fixed income peers like U.S. corporate high-yield and emerging market sovereign, according to BofA.
And investors see more upside potential as emerging market corporate bond spreads are trading at around 320 basis points, short of the 255 basis points level of mid-February, indicating there's room for more tightening and, therefore, more returns. 
Their bullishness is built on a belief that a COVID-19 vaccine should help tip the balance back in favour of sectors such as trade, tourism and commodities, the engines motoring emerging markets that have been sputtering since the pandemic.
Brazilian airline bonds are being eyed by Glavan, who is already invested in Pemex, the state-owned Mexican energy behemoth.
Iron ore, copper and zinc producers in South America, as well as Middle East and Indian ports and Egyptian companies in the tourism sector are in the cross-hairs of Alejandro Arevalo, emerging market debt manager at Jupiter Asset Management.
""Once the vaccine starts to play through we're going to see some rotation into Latin America as it has been one of those regions where people have been very cautious because of the continued high spread of the virus and with a vaccine we may see these economies outperform,"" said Arevalo.

RISKS
But risks lurk beneath the surface. Several Chinese state companies have defaulted or faced credit stress in recent weeks, sparking a selloff in China's corporate debt market.
The development alarmed some investors who generally assume state-owned firms will be supported by the government in times of stress.
""More defaults are coming as Chinese authorities refocus on deleveraging of SOEs (state-owned enterprises) now that the worst of the pandemic has passed,"" said Chang Li, China country specialist at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. ""Default rates are still low overall, however, and will unlikely lead to systemic risk.""
Despite the ravages of the pandemic, default rates among emerging market high-yield corporates year-to-date stand at about 3%, roughly half that of U.S. high-yield firms, said Glavan. It's also less than during the global financial crisis when it touched 10.5% for emerging market companies.
Fresh flare-ups in COVID-19 infections that hinder the global economic recovery and sanctions or other adverse policy action by the incoming U.S. administration against the likes of Russia, Turkey and China are other potential pitfalls for investors.
But most investors are betting on a more supportive backdrop, with a Joe Biden presidency seen offering a more predictable policymaking on trade and U.S.-China relations. The outlook for a lower U.S. dollar will also be helpful for developing currencies.
""Looking ahead into 2021, the outlook for EM corporate fixed income remains constructive,"" said Michael Bolliger, chief investment officer, global emerging markets at UBS. ""EM companies stand to benefit from a gradual normalization in global economic activity, the ultra-accommodative monetary policies of major global central banks, and our expectation of a weaker U.S. dollar.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, with investors starting the week by monitoring the continuous progress towards a COVID-19 vaccine.
South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.97% by 11:06 PM ET (3:06 AM GMT) and in Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.53%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.14%. The city is currently fighting a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases, reporting 68 cases on Sunday. On Friday, the rising number of cases halted the prospective travel bubble with Singapore. Authorities on both sides continue to review a new launch date for the alliance, the world’s first and originally slated to have commenced on Sunday.

The first people in the U.S. could be inoculated the day after the approval. The U.K. is also looking to grant regulatory approval to BNT162b2 this week.
The number of global COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise incessantly, surpassing 58.5 million and 1.38 million respectively as of Nov. 23, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The numbers saw investors focus on the data coming from vaccine trials.
Rising numbers of cases continue to be of concern, as millions of Americans are expected to travel for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday despite warnings to stay at home. Germany could see its current lockdown extended until mid-December.
“There is a lot of enthusiasm over the vaccine news and rightly so -- as soon as we can get something that is very effective distributed widely, the sooner we can get back to ordinary life,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management multi-asset strategist Brian Jacobsen told Bloomberg.
“The problem, from our perspective, is we first have to get through winter, and this is setting us up for some downside economic surprises,” he added.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>",Global dividends forecast to inch back from coronavirus cliff edge,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Dividend payouts by the world's biggest firms in 2020 will fall by 17.5%-20%, equivalent to some $263 billion, as a result of the coronavirus crisis, a report on Monday forecast, but could rebound strongly next year.
Although the prediction by investment firm Janus Henderson represents a smaller dividend drop than some had feared at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be the biggest since at least 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis.
Dividends are a major source of income for both public and private pension funds, but companies trying to cope with the coronavirus cut them by $55 billion, or 11.4%, in the third quarter after a $108 billion 22% plunge between April and June when uncertainty over the course of the pandemic peaked.
""Our best case now sees a fall of -17.5% to $1.20 trillion on an underlying basis. Our worst case sees underlying dividends declining -20.2% to $1.16 trillion,"" Janus Henderson said.
However, some firms that axed payments have restarted them, even if at lower levels, while vaccine breakthroughs are also providing hope of a bounce back in 2021.
""This has been the worst year since the global financial crisis,"" Jane Shoemake, Janus Henderson's Investment Director for Global Equity Income, said.
""(But) if life starts to return to some form of normality even some of the hardest hit companies (such as travel, leisure and retail firms) will be able to start to pay dividends again.""
Next year's rebound could be as high as 12% depending on the path of the pandemic and whether Europe's banks are allowed to restart dividends again, the report estimated, although in a ""worst-case scenario"" they might flatline.
""We still have the winter to get through. It is not going to be a clear path.""
NEW TOP SPOT
Broken down by sector, the worst declines in Q3 were from consumer discretionary companies, down 43% in underlying terms, with carmakers and leisure companies making the deepest cuts.
Media, aerospace and banks were also severely impacted, while pharmaceuticals, food producers and food retailers all produced higher dividend payouts.
Geographically, Britain's banks and oil firms meant its payouts fell nearly 42% on an underlying basis, while Australia which has also clamped down bank dividends saw a 40% drop.
U.S. dividends were down 3.9%, with the impact felt in share buybacks instead. Japanese payouts fell 16% with exporters especially hard hit, whereas a 3.3% rise in China and near 10% jump in Hong Kong made for a rare bright spot.
Big tech has largely shrugged off the pandemic and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to become the world's biggest dividend payer for the first time with a near 10% rise in its impending Q4 payout.
""In the last 10 years you have seen a massive shift... There are tech companies that are just throwing off so much cash,"" Shoemake said.

""We're talking to Boeing about lots of different things, the Max included,"" Delta's chief executive told the Financial Times. (https://www.ft.com/content/4f34798a-c407-462a-b7ff-cdcf703c35c8)
Any Boeing 737 MAX order would be the first for Delta, which did not have the aircraft in its fleet when the plane was grounded in March 2019 following two fatal crashes.
""If there is an opportunity where we would feel comfortable acquiring the MAX we’d have no hesitation doing that,"" Bastian added.
Reuters reported in October, Delta is among airlines Boeing has approached to buy dozens of 737 MAX jets built for clients that have since scrapped their orders or gone bust, citing two people familiar with the matter.
The United States lifted a 20-month-old flight ban on Boeing 737 MAX on Wednesday, easing a safety crisis that left its top exporter with a tarnished reputation and hundreds of idle jets.
Bastian also cast doubts on travel corridor between New York and London calling it ""complicated"" and said it would be easier to relaunch transatlantic flights to ""just about any"" other European capital.

Saudi Arabia’s Acwa Power International, half-owned by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, is planning to raise about $1 billion by selling Islamic bonds early next year, according to people familiar with the matter.
The company, one of the largest developers of power plants in the Middle East, has appointed the Saudi unit of  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and Samba Capital to advise on the issuance, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The sukuk, as Islamic bonds are known, will be used to help fund Acwa’s share of an $8 billion acquisition of gasification and power assets at Jazan on Saudi Arabia’s west coast.
The sukuk will be followed by Acwa’s initial public offering on the Riyadh stock exchange, which could raise about $1 billion and value the company at about $8 billion, the people said.
Acwa, HSBC and Samba didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund agreed last week to acquire a 50% stake in Acwa. That deal was part of the kingdom’s plans to develop its renewable-power industry.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Boeing 737 MAX jets undergo round-the-clock effort to clear inventory,"By Eric M. Johnson
MOSES LAKE, Wash. (Reuters) - The future of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's freshly approved 737 MAX is in the hands of nearly 700 workers toiling behind the gray doors of a three-bay hangar at a desert airport in Washington state.
Inside, over an endless 24-hour loop, 737 MAX planes are rolled in for maintenance, and upgrades of software and systems as mandated by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in this week's order lifting a flight ban imposed after two crashes, the airport's director said.
In front, workers in bright yellow vests inspect the roughly 240 jets stored in giant grids at Grant County International Airport in Moses Lake - more than half of an inventory worth about $16 billion, according to investment firm Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
Analysts say clearing the logjam of up to 450 stored jets in total is crucial before Boeing can resume meaningful production of its traditional cash cow - a task complicated by the fact that buyers have in some cases walked away during the grounding.
While parked on the tarmac, each jet is fitted with red engine and wheel covers, a windshield screen to block out the sun, and a small generator powering cycles of fresh air and electricity through its systems - the aviation equivalent of life support.
""It's an enormous undertaking,"" the airport's director, Rich Muller, told Reuters. ""But this go-ahead from the FAA has given them a real shot in the arm. It's really energized everyone.""
The work at Moses Lake is a cornerstone of a global logistical and financial strategy under way at Boeing to clear a backlog of more than 800 mothballed 737 MAX jets. About 450 are Boeing property, and a further 387 were in airline service before the FAA's grounding order in March 2019. 
Across the globe, Boeing teams are hammering out delivery schedules - and financial terms - with airlines who last year had to scale back schedules and fly aging jetliners because they lacked the aircraft to meet strong demand as the MAX grounding dragged on longer than airline and Boeing executives expected.
But the jet is returning at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has hammered demand for air travel and new jets. Boeing also faces new European trade tariffs and palpable mistrust of one of the most scrutinized brands in aviation.
""Airlines and the supply chain do not see major deliveries until 2022,"" said Arndt Schoenemann, managing director of supplier Liebherr-Aerospace Lindenberg. ""Right now, COVID is the biggest problem for the industry."" 
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment beyond listing preparation steps before 737 MAXs go to customers, which include installing a flight control software upgrade to deal with a system tied to both crashes, separating wiring bundles that posed a potential safety hazard, and multiple tests including a test flight before a final FAA inspection.
WHITE TAILS
Airlines say it will take about two weeks to ready each plane for service with maintenance and software upgrades factored in, though Boeing has already deployed teams around the world to help companies get ready.
In a visual display of the jet demand slump, workers at Moses Lake on Thursday rolled a 737 MAX ""white tail"" - a jet without a buyer, or whose buyer has been changed - out of a long row of aircraft awash in the bright liveries of airline customers, ranging from customers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) to Norwegian Air. This week, Norwegian sought bankruptcy protection in Ireland.
Reuters counted 12 white tails at Moses Lake on Thursday, though sources say Boeing is worried about 100 such aircraft in inventory, or more.
Boeing declined to comment.
Jets are also stored at Boeing property in the Seattle area and in San Antonio, Texas. 
Boeing is in discussions with several airlines, including Southwest, Delta and Alaska, hoping to stimulate demand for the jet. Deals are expected to include significant discounts, industry sources have said. But analysts caution cutting prices too far could upset other customers.
A fire sale could also depress resale values of such single-aisle jets - the cornerstone of a complex system of financing that has attracted capital to the industry, powered by relatively strong returns on planes which are seen as mobile real estate.
To kickstart the recovery of the MAX and contain any fallout to the jet's valuation while offering aggressive discounts to find new homes, Boeing is expected to line up a handful of large deals with marquee customers who will put them in long service.
The 737 MAX 8 has a list price of $122 million but the market long ago abandoned published prices as competition heated up. Most jets are privately sold well over 50% below the list price and the new MAX discount may be more, jet traders said.
Slowing the recovery, the FAA, which has faced accusations of being too close to Boeing in the past, has said it plans in-person inspections of each of the 450 planes, which could take at least a year to complete, prolonging the jets' deliveries. 
Grant County International has been a strategically important asset for Boeing at least since the 1960s, and every MAX built in the Seattle area is flown there for touch-and-go landings or other tests.
The airport and abutting Boeing property has absorbed nearly 700 employees and contractors to aid the ungrounding effort, up from only a handful, Muller said. 

Meanwhile, Boeing is paying some $51,000 per plane a month to park its MAXs, he added.

The FDA said the monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, should be administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19. https:// This includes those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions. The treatment is part of a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the human body to fight infections. Regeneron's REGEN-COV2 ""antibody cocktail"" - containing an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that the two antibodies seek out and bind to the coronavirus' spike protein to prevent it from entering healthy human cells. Regeneron said on Saturday the clinical evidence from outpatient trial suggests that monoclonal antibodies such as REGEN-COV2 have the greatest benefit when given early after diagnosis and in patients who have not yet mounted their own immune response or who have high viral load. The company said it expects to have does of REGEN-COV2 treatment ready for about 80,000 patients by the end of this month, about 200,000 patients by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January. The FDA said the antibodies are not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",European regulator to lift Boeing 737 MAX grounding in January,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Europe is set to lift its flight ban on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX passenger jetliner in January after U.S. regulators last week ended a 20-month grounding triggered by two fatal crashes.
The head of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said in remarks aired on Saturday that the 737 MAX was safe to fly after changes to the design of the jet that crashed twice in five months in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.
""We wanted to carry out a totally independent analysis of the safety of this aircraft, so we performed our own checks and flight tests,"" Executive Director Patrick Ky told the Paris Air Forum, an online aviation conference hosted by La Tribune.
""All these studies tell us that the 737 MAX can return to service. We have started to put in place all the measures,"" he said. ""It is likely that in our case we will adopt the decisions, allowing it to return to service, some time in January."" 
EASA's decision is seen as the most important milestone after the FAA's approval since, as the watchdog responsible for Airbus, it too carries significant weight in the industry.
Officials confirmed a draft EASA directive proposing to end the grounding in Europe will be published next week, followed by a 30-day comment period. After finishing touches, that would lead to an ungrounding decision in January.
How long it takes for flights to resume in Europe depends on pilot training and the amount of time it takes airlines to upgrade software and carry out other actions mandated by EASA.
In the United States, commercial flights are scheduled to start on Dec. 29, just under six weeks after the FAA order was published on Nov 18.
EASA represents the 27 European Union countries plus four other nations including Norway, which has 92 of the aircraft on order. Until Dec 31, it also represents the United Kingdom, which left the EU bloc in January.
FAA LESSONS
The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia triggered a slew of investigations faulting Boeing for poor design and the FAA for lax oversight. They also placed tight-knit FAA relations with Boeing under scrutiny.
""It is clear that there were a number of dysfunctions in (FAA) actions and their relations with Boeing,"" Ky said. ""I won't go into details as it is not up to me to do that. The FAA is in the process of putting in place corrective measures.""
He said EASA would change some of its own methods and take a more detailed role in analysing critical features in foreign jets. It would also be ""more intransigent"" about ensuring that key safety reviews are completed before moving on to the next steps, Ky said. Until now, one primary regulator certifies a plane and others mainly follow suit after varying degrees of independent checks.
""What will change is the way in which we validate and certify Boeing aircraft, that's clear, but will it have an impact on (certification) timings? No, I don't think so; we will do things differently,"" Ky said.
Boeing is developing the 777X, a larger version of its 777.
EASA is widely seen as emerging strengthened from the Boeing crisis and some regulators are waiting for its decisions on the MAX rather than immediately following the FAA as in the past.

FAA chief Steve Dickson played down any differences last week, saying there was ""very little daylight"" between regulators and that the FAA worked closely with Europe, Canada and Brazil.

Investing.com -- It's one thing to fill prescriptions. It's another to provide healthcare.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced this week that it's getting into the pharmacy business, news that prompted a sell-off in drug store companies from the traditional players like CVS to newcomers like GoodRx. Not everyone's convinced the online behemoth will so completely take over the business, however. The co-chief executive officer of online start-up Honeybee Health made the distinction between what a pharmacy is meant to provide and what Amazon Pharmacy is likely to offer. 
""What they are known for is logistics and packages; that's very different than what healthcare is,"" said Jessica Nouhavandi, also a co-founder and, perhaps most importantly, a pharmacist. ""Healthcare requires a level of detail to people, not packages.""
It's no surprise Amazon wants to get into the pharmaceuticals business. Americans spent $485 billion on drugs in 2018, and are expected to dish out up to $655 billion in 2023. That would represent growth of 35%, according to the Pharmaceutical Commerce news site. U.S. pharmaceutical sales represent 40% of the global total, the biggest by far, with China's 11% share putting it in second place, according to Statista. 
Why do Americans spend more than any other country on drugs? Unlike elsewhere, there is no regulation on prices and any drug proven to be safe can be brought to market. U.S. consumers also tend to use health insurance when obtaining medications, which depend upon pharmacy benefit managers to manage prescription drug benefits and negotiate with manufacturers on their behalf -- a middleman, if you will. It's clearly a complicated and costly process, full of intermediaries along the way between you and your drugs. 
Nouhavandi, who started out as a small-town pharmacist, along with her colleague Peter Wang, saw that process up close, and the high costs associated with it. 
""We realized we weren't telling patients the truth about how inexpensive the medications actually were,"" Nouhavandi said in a phone interview this week. Insurance companies bound them to only tell them copay price, and not the cost if they bought outright, often a much cheaper option. Nouhavandi saw patients walking away empty-handed when they couldn't afford the copay.
Wang provides a vivid example on his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page of a patient dropping off a prescription for a standard cholesterol medication. Wang submitted the claim to the insurance company, and told the patient his copay for the generic medication was $90.19. What he couldn't tell him was the actual cost of those pills: $2.31. 
""You don't need insurance to buy generic, and you save more buying out of pocket,"" Nouhavandi said. Honeybee, founded in 2017, started taking off last year. The company provides 6,000 generic medications, and for the 50 most popular medications, consumers can choose their manufacturer.
The company works directly with drug manufacturers, providing multiple generic options at low prices. 
""It's our mission to provide transparent pricing and choice,"" Nouhavandi said, ""without so many hands in the pot raising the price.""
Honeybee, which is based in Los Angeles, also provides the option to speak with a pharmacist as it aims to recreate the in-person experience as much as possible.
The company has raised $10 million in funding, and aims for another raise in 2021. Revenue should grow by four times this year, though Nouhavandi declined to give further details. And while there are other competitors, Nouhavandi points out that she and her partners are pharmacists and not Silicon Valley tech bros. 
""When it comes to pharmacy and comes to health, it's all about making sure you're there to listen to the concerns,"" she said. People come first, as does the safety of their information, and Honeybee does not traffic in data. 
It's not been an easy ride, said Nouhavandi, who never pictured herself as the CEO of a venture-backed company. 
""I didn't come up with this because I thought it would make money,"" Nouhavandi said. ""I did this because I have to. This is the oath I took and this is what's right for people.""
While she hopes Amazon does the right thing for patients, she points to the fact that it's doing the same thing as everyone else.
""The news of this launch, as big as they are and as powerful as they are, it was honestly disappointing,"" Nouhavandi said. ""They're not really innovating for patients or providing more transparency around price. That's what we aim to do.""

The signing took place during an event in Hanoi attended by Robert O’Brien, U.S. President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, who was on a three-day visit to Vietnam, said the official, who requested anonymity in order to discuss the issue.
Under the MOU signed with Vietnam's EVNGenco3, the Massachusetts-based U.S. firm will endeavor to provide its ""best-in-class"" gas turbine technology, other equipment and services estimated at more than $1 billion over the lifetime of the project to be built near Ho Chi Minh City, GE said in a statement.
GE said the Long Son LNG facility in Ba Ria-Vung Province would provide 3,600-4,500 megawatts of power to the country.
Pacific Corp., Vietnam’s Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 2 and TTC Group, and Mitsubishi’s Corp.’s local subsidiary, also will participate in the project, GE said.
O’Brien was scheduled to meet government officials and speak to students during his visit.

His visit followed what Hanoi said was the humanitarian release in October of an American, Michael Nguyen, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for attempting to overthrow the state.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A border official who took part in interrogating Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou testified on Friday he did not have reasonable grounds to believe she should have been denied entry to Canada but that he felt the border agency's warrant to detain her was still justified.
Huawei lawyers are seeking to prove in a Canadian court that the investigation by Canada's border agency two years ago at Vancouver International Airport resulted in abuse of process that should get her extradition to the United States thrown out.
Prosecutors and witnesses from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have countered that Meng's investigation and arrest followed usual procedures.
On Friday, defence lawyer Mona Duckett confronted CBSA agent Sowmith Katragadda about a document he signed, which included a declaration that he had reasonable grounds to believe she should be denied entry to Canada and therefore could be arrested with an immigration warrant.
When asked if he had reasonable grounds, Katragadda replied, ""At the time, no I did not."" 
He countered that he did not choose the wording of the paperwork and believed there was still justification for the immigration warrant. 
CBSA officials have previously testified they were concerned about Meng fleeing the country if the RCMP did not arrest her.
Meng, 48, was arrested on charges of bank fraud from the United States, where she is accused of misrepresenting Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s [HWT.UL] dealings with Iran, putting one of its lenders, HSBC, at risk of violating U.S. trade sanctions.
She has denied the charges and sought to have her extradition thrown out because of alleged collusion between Canadian and U.S. authorities among other reasons.
In particular, Meng's lawyers have asserted that Canadian and U.S. authorities used the additional investigative powers of the CBSA to interrogate Meng without a lawyer present.
CBSA officers have testified their investigation was not directed by outside authorities and would have taken place regardless of the outstanding warrant for her arrest.
Meng's arrest has set off a diplomatic conflict between Ottawa and Beijing.

ROME/LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Treasury has picked Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Orrick as financial and legal advisers to secure a merger deal for bailed-out bank Monte dei Paschi (MPS) as part of its privatisation plan, four sources close to the matter told Reuters.
Rome aims to clinch a merger with a healthier peer in 2021, the sources said, to provide a long-term solution for the bank, which has been backed by the government since 2017 following an 8 billion euro ($9.5 billion) rescue deal.
The Treasury's efforts, however, face resistance from the co-ruling 5-Star party, as well as unions and local politicians in Tuscany, who have been asking for the sale to be delayed. 
The mandates, which will last 12 months, will see Bank of America's co-head of the financial institution group, Giorgio Cocini, and Orrick's partners, Patrizio Messina and Marco Nicolini, working closely with the Treasury to attract buyers and address the bank's capital shortfalls.
Italy's Treasury and Bank of America declined to comment, while Orrick was not immediately available.
Rome is expected to pay about 150,000 euros in financial and legal fees, with the lion's share going to Bank of America, the sources said.
The meagre fee pot has put off many banks and law firms which initially looked at the dossier, the sources said, as advisory fees typically come in the millions of dollars range. Intesa SanPaolo's recent takeover of UBI Banca, for example, generated overall fees of $43.8 million for all the advisers involved, according to Refinitiv estimates.
Generally, government work across the world is poorly paid, but banks often vie for such mandates to build a relationship with the state in the hope of getting future business.
Dogged by legal claims and poor quality assets, MPS is a tough sell in Italy's banking market, which has a surplus of branches and has seen a rise in loan losses and remote banking in the COVID-19 pandemic.
UniCredit is seen as the preferred buyer for the 548-year old bank given its robust balance sheet, sources have said, despite boss Jean Pierre Mustier ruling out mergers which, he has said, only add ""branches and staff.""
Italy's third-largest bank, Banco BPM, is in the process of exploring possible tie-ups and may also emerge as a viable bidder for MPS, one of the sources said.
Banco BPM has also denied any interest for MPS.
Any deal for the Tuscan bank would only come after the Treasury acts to remove legal claims amounting to 10 billion euros, while also injecting fresh capital.
Rome has set aside 1.5 billion euros to shore up MPS but the bank faces a shortfall of at least 2 billion, sources have said.
The Treasury is working on a scheme to shift MPS's legal risks to another state-owned entity. In a move that would help a buyer cope with redundancies in the combined entity, Rome is also considering steps to lower the cost of job cuts for banks in case of a merger, one of the sources said.
Similarly, Italy has included in the 2021 budget measures to help corporate tie-ups through tax breaks.
Under the scheme, two companies merging during the course of next year would be able to lower their tax burden by using so-called deferred tax assets (DTAs). In the case of MPS, that entails a 3 billion euro earnings boost, sources have said. 

MPS's capital buffers are set to fall below minimum requirements early next year, hit by the cost of a bad loan clean-up it is about to complete as well as provisions against legal risks following the conviction of former top executives

""Malaysia Aviation Group has requested financial support from our shareholder Khazanah Nasional although the company isn't in a position to comment on amount at this point in time,"" it said in an email to Reuters.
The group said it remains in talks for a restructuring and that it was targeting a commercial agreement in the first week of December.
The airline could be seeking as much as $500 million, said Malaysia's Edge weekly, which first reported the news, citing unnamed sources.
Khazanah said any funding for the airline will depend on the outcome of discussions with creditors and lessors, which it said is crucial to the success of the restructuring.
Malaysia Airlines is seeking to restructure after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to slash operations. 
The parent company had warned leasing companies that Khazanah would stop funding the group and force it into a winding down process if restructuring talks with lessors were unsuccessful, Reuters reported last month.
The carrier restructured after two deadly crashes in 2014, with Khazanah pumping in 6 billion ringgit ($1.5 billion). This time the government has said it will not bail out the struggling company.
Chief Executive Izham Ismail told staff in a memo last month that the restructuring talks were taking longer than planned.

Investing.com -- Global X's newest thematic bet is on disruption and high growth markets. The Emerging Markets Internet & E-commerce ETF (EWEB) launched on  Alibaba 's (NYSE:BABA) Singles Day on Nov. 11 and focuses on companies that derive the bulk of their revenue from internet and e-commerce in emerging markets. Alibaba, in fact, is one of the top holdings among 50 in the fund, which leans heavily toward Asia and more specifically, China. 
That has to do with the rise of e-commerce in the country along with the increase in smartphone and internet penetration, demographics and the size of the Millennial population, said Chelsea Rodstrom, a research analyst at Global X ETFs. China's policies also support making it a global innovator. And then there's the potential market boom ahead, whereas in the U.S., internet penetration is 90%, in China it's closer to 53%.
""These economies are moving from adopters of the latest technology to leapfrog, to jump over and acquire the latest technology and become innovators,"" Rodstrom said in a phone interview.
EWEB is Global X's latest bet on thematic funds as it taps into an ever-expanding demand for exchange traded funds. The market for ETFs has grown from about $4 trillion last year to almost $5 trillion today, and is expected to grow to between $30 trillion and $50 trillion by 2030. ETFs offer lower costs, liquidity and tax efficiency than traditional funds. While ETFs often track indexes, Global X has focused on themes, creating its own basket of companies in areas like genomics and biotechnology, cybersecurity and education. The fund joins the Global X Thematic Growth suite of 24 ETFs and more than $7 billion in assets under management.
EWEB tracks the Nasdaq CTA Emerging Markets Internet & E-commerce Net Total Return Index, with Asia representing a number of the holdings. 
""Asia Pacific region and Southeast Asia are probably the highest growth areas,"" Rodstrom said. Many of the companies are actively expanding globally, either through mergers and acquisitions or partnerships, diversifying and mitigating any possible individual country risks. And emerging markets can be a roller coaster ride for investors, with economies subject to government interference and political instability. 
Such companies have nonetheless outperformed their U.S. counterparts. Rodstrom points to the fact that in 2018, 74% of global growth was attributable to emerging market economies, driven in large part by a rapidly growing middle class of internet-connected consumers. The consumption of emerging markets is expected to be responsible for 84% of the world total by 2023.
""Investors interested in emerging markets understand the reasons why they have higher growth potential but a lot of investors probably don't recognize how much emerging markets contribute to global growth,"" Rodstrom said. ""This is a way to get access to higher growth.""

Investing.com -- When it comes to ETFs, buyer beware. 
""Don't judge a book by its cover,"" said Jillian DelSignore, principal at Lakefront Advisory in Chicago. ""Just because it's called a certain thing, doesn't mean it is a certain thing.""
Exchange traded funds are all the rage, with about $1 trillion in assets added over the past year to the market, for a total of almost $5 trillion. More and more traditional asset managers are moving into the space and with so many offerings on the table, it can be confusing to figure out what's what. 
As an example, DelSignore pointed to iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (NYSE:USMV and Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (NYSE:SPLV)) which promise low volatility but have very different constructions.  
USMV uses an algorithm and is focused on particular sectors, and is overweight in defensive names. Meanwhile, SPLV includes about 100 S&P 500 stocks with the lowest daily volatility over the past year. The difference matters. Year-to-date, USMV is down 4.5% and SPLV is down 9%.
""Understanding what you're getting and popping the hood is really important,"" DelSignore said in a phone interview. DelSignore has been in financial services for some 20 years, about 12 of them focused on ETFs. Prior to joining Lakefront this year, she was head of ETF distribution at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
ETFs are generally understood to be passive, but active ETFs are gaining steam, DelSignore said, including those considered ""non-transparent,"" which simply means they don't reveal holdings on a daily basis. That's attracting large traditional mutual fund managers into the space -- they're highly likely to have been seeing assets flow out and into ETFs --  since they don't have to worry about being copied because they report monthly or quarterly. The move could potentially reverse the outbound trend.  Not that anything is guaranteed, with active ETFs still in early stages.  
""The jury is definitely still out on what the success will look like of these products because they don't have a track record,"" DelSignore said. ""They are going to want to see positive performance.""                
Ultimately, investors need to focus on what they want to achieve, where they want to anchor themselves. DelSignore highly suggests working with a financial advisor amid the noise.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Canada's WestJet said late on Friday they had scrapped a proposed U.S.-Canada joint venture after the U.S. government demanded changes the airlines insisted were ""unreasonable and unacceptable"".
Last month, the U.S. Transportation Department as part of its tentative antitrust immunity approval said it would require the carriers to remove Swoop, an ultra low-cost carrier affiliate of WestJet, from the alliance, and divest 16 takeoff and landing slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport. 
The airlines said in a filing that the U.S. demands were ""arbitrary and capricious"" especially the slot divestitures. They had argued the alliance would ""optimize aircraft utilization, enhance schedules, and lower costs.""
The airlines said in a joint statement they remain committed to developing a joint venture ""but in the meantime will explore deepening the alliance.""
The U.S. Transportation Department did not immediately comment on Friday.
The Delta-WestJet joint venture would have had a combined 27% share of scheduled air carrier transborder capacity, while the dominant carrier,  Air Canada  (TO:AC), has 45%.
WestJet is owned by private equity firm Onex Corp (TO:ONEX).
Canada, with 38 million people, is the second-largest U.S. international passenger air market after Mexico, with Toronto flights accounting for over 50% of transborder air travel demand.
U.S.-Canada transborder flight capacity has grown 15% over the last five years to 39 million seats annually, but passenger traffic has plummeted sharply in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
The airlines' application had been pending with U.S. officials for more than two years. The Canadian Competition Bureau conducted its own review and granted an unconditional ""no action"" letter in June 2019.
U.S. air carriers had urged slot divestitures at LaGuardia, noting American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta and United Air Lines (O:UAL) control 83% of all slots, with Delta controlling 45% of flights. 
WestJet and Delta said losing slots would deprive them ""of critical operating rights at one of the most important strategic hubs in Delta's global network at a time when Delta is
investing billions of dollars of its own capital in a comprehensive facilities improvement project at this airport.""
They would be forced, the airlines added, ""to sell these strategic corporate assets during a global pandemic that has inflicted an unprecedented crisis on this industry, virtually

ensuring that they would be sold at a fire sale price.""

According to several market sources, Hershey moved to take delivery of thousands of cocoa lots before the December contract expires on Dec. 15. Dealers suggest volumes of up to 30,000 tonnes.
Hershey's move happens in a moment when Ghana and Ivory Coast, the world's top producers, are selling their first full crop under a new scheme that includes a price premium of $400 per tonne, created to help alleviate farmer poverty. The premium, known as LID, had vocal support from chocolate makers.
The African countries have struggled to sell their crop with the premium, in large part because the pandemic-induced recession slashed demand for non-staple foods like chocolate.
""The exchange right now is the cheapest place to buy cocoa,"" said a U.S.-based broker, indicating Hershey's move was justified by lower prices compared to the hefty African premiums.
Traders said Hershey asked and obtained an exemption from ICE to sharply exceed delivery limits. The exchange declined to comment.
""While we do not discuss details of our specific buying and hedging activities, we buy cocoa from a variety of suppliers and sources to meet our ongoing business needs,"" Hershey said, adding that it has also bought cocoa from Ghana and Ivory Coast in deals that included the LID premium.
The two African countries reacted to the ICE trade, threatening to suspend cocoa companies' sustainability schemes.
""An unprecedented delivery for a branded company that will push the continued problem of unsold LID premium cocoa back further,"" said one European trader, adding that middlemen have made clear to the African countries that the premium has been hard to market.

Another European trader estimated that Ivory Coast and Ghana sales are 500,000 tonnes behind volumes seen at this time a year earlier.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) applied to U.S. health regulators on Friday for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine, the first such application in a major step toward providing protection against the new coronavirus. 
The application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) comes just days after Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (DE:22UAy) (O:BNTX) reported final trial results that showed the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 with no major safety concerns.
Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla confirmed the application had been made in a video posted on the company's website on Friday afternoon.
The FDA said on Friday it would hold a meeting of the advisory committee on Dec. 10 at which members would discuss the vaccine. The agency declined to predict how long its review would take, although both Pfizer and U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar have said the FDA could authorize the vaccine in mid-December. 
Pfizer's shares closed up 1.4% and BioNTech shares ended 9.6% higher in New York, as the possibility of a vaccine soon raised hopes for the end of a pandemic that has claimed more than a quarter of a million lives in the United States and over 1.3 million worldwide.
For an interactive graphic tracking the global spread of COVID-19, open https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/ in an external browser.
The application also includes safety data on about 100 children 12-15 years of age. The company said 45% of U.S. trial participants are 56-85 years old.
If the data is solid, ""we literally could be weeks away from the authorization of a 95% effective vaccine,"" Azar said on CBS's ""This Morning.""
The companies expect the FDA to grant the EUA by mid-December and said they will begin shipping doses almost immediately. Pfizer has said it expects to have 50 million vaccine doses ready this year, enough to protect 25 million people.
The final trial data showed the vaccine provided a similar level of protection across different ages and ethnicities - an encouraging result as the disease disproportionately hurts the elderly and minorities.
Of the 170 volunteers who contracted COVID-19 in Pfizer's trial involving over 43,000 people, 162 had received only a placebo, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective, far higher than originally expected. The U.S. FDA had set minimum bar for efficacy of 50%.
Pfizer said nearly 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants in the Phase 3 study have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds.
""Filing in the U.S. represents a critical milestone in our journey to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine to the world and we now have a more complete picture of both the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine,"" Bourla said in a statement. 
 Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) is expected to be the next company to seek a U.S. emergency use nod for a COVID-19 vaccine. An initial analysis of data from its late-stage trial showed the vaccine was 94.5% effective. Final results and safety data are expected in the coming days or weeks. 
Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines work using a new technology to trigger an immune response known as synthetic messenger RNA that can be produced at scale much more quickly than traditional vaccines. 
Of dozens of drugmakers and research institutions racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines, the next late-stage data is expected to come from AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN), which is working with the University of Oxford, in November or December. 

Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said it expects to have data needed to seek U.S. authorization for its experimental vaccine by February.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday as investors wrestled with fiscal stimulus developments, concerns over a lengthy rollout of vaccines, and a growing number of state-level shutdowns to combat the spiraling COVID-19 pandemic.
Stay-at-home plays such as  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), which have outperformed throughout the health crisis, helped curb the Nasdaq's loss. 
Throughout the week, the ebb and flow of vaccine news and spiking infections had investors oscillating between economically-sensitive cyclical stocks and pandemic-resistant market leaders.
The S&P 500 and the Dow posted marginal losses for the week, while the tech-laden Nasdaq settled a bit higher from last Friday's close.
""Markets are still stuck in a push-and-pull between the dramatic rise of new COVID cases versus apparent progress on vaccines,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""This is likely to continue until we have an approved and distributed vaccine.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced late Thursday that he would allow key pandemic-relief lending programs at the Federal Reserve to expire at the end of the year, saying the $455 billion allocated last spring under the CARES act should be returned to Congress to be reallocated as grants for small companies.
The decision to pull the plug on lending programs deemed essential by the central bank comes at a time of spiraling new coronavirus infections and a fresh wave of layoffs, and was called ""disappointing"" by Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans.
""This dust-up between the Fed and Treasury could have serious implications, as markets want to see the two institutions working well together,"" Carter added. ""The timing of this dust-up is unfortunate, as the risk of COVID is still very much with us.""
Record infection numbers have caused COVID hospitalizations to soar by 50% and have prompted a new round of school and businesses closures, curfews and social distancing restrictions, hobbling economic recovery from the deepest recession since the Great Depression.
In the latest development in the race to develop a vaccine,  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine, the first application of its kind in the battle against the disease. The drugmaker's shares rose 1.4%, and provided the biggest lift to the S&P 500.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 219.75 points, or 0.75%, to 29,263.48, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 24.33 points, or 0.68%, to 3,557.54 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 49.74 points, or 0.42%, to 11,854.97.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, only utilities (SPLRCU) eked out a gain by closing bell. Tech (SPLRCT) and industrials (SPLRCI) suffered the largest percentage losses on the day.
Stay-at-home beneficiary Zoom provided the biggest lift to the Nasdaq.
 Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) shed 0.9% as a World Health Organization panel advised against use of the company's COVID-19 treatment remdesivir, citing lack of evidence the drug improves survival or reduces the need for ventilation.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.12-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 122 new highs and 10 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.69 billion shares, compared with the 10.70 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

LONDON/ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's  Alpha Bank  (AT:ACBr) has selected U.S. investment fund Davidson Kempner as its preferred bidder to buy a $12 billion portfolio of nonperforming loans in what will be the country's largest ever sale of bad debt, sources told Reuters.
The portfolio, known as Galaxy Project and worth 10.8 billion euros ($12.81 billion), also includes the disposal of Alpha's bad loan servicing unit, Cepal.
Davidson Kempner has valued the assets at about 290 million euros, trumping a rival offer by U.S. investment giant Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO), one of the sources said.
Alpha Bank declined to comment while Davidson Kempner and PIMCO were not immediately available.
The sale, which is expected to be finalised by the end of 2020, is the most significant attempt by a Greek bank to clean up its balance sheet amid fears that loans to businesses and individuals going bad will surge as a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis.
Banks offload bad debts, normally at a fraction of their face value, to free up their balance sheets to make new loans and keep both their own business and economies going.
The sale of the Galaxy portfolio is expected to reduce Alpha's nonperforming exposure (NPE) ratio to 24% from around 43% and its nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio down to 13% from 30%, a banking source familiar with the deal said.
Alpha launched the process early this year, drawing initial interest from a series of bidders including Italian firms Cerved (MI:CERV) and Credito Fondiario, the sources said.
But only Davidson Kempner and PIMCO made it to the final stages of the auction, with Alpha's board selecting Davidson Kempner as its preferred bidder after a board meeting on Friday.

The decision, which could be announced early next week, follows a similar transaction by Greece's Eurobank to sell 80% of its loan servicing unit FPS to Italian debt recovery firm doValue (MI:DOVA) along with a chunk of mezzanine and junior notes from a 7.5 billion euro bad loan securitization known as Project Cairo.

(Reuters) - Workers at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's California vehicle factory are deemed essential and are not impacted by the state's latest restrictions to curb a new surge in coronavirus infections, the California health department said on Friday.
Tesla and local California officials in March engaged in a heated months-long standoff over restrictions imposed to curb the first wave of infections, which culminated in the company's chief executive, Elon Musk, defying health orders, suing local officials and threatening to leave the state.
California's governor on Thursday imposed a curfew on social gatherings and other nonessential activities. 
Beginning on Saturday, the stay-at-home order prohibits non-essential business from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. each day and applies in the majority of the state's counties, including Alameda County, where Tesla's factory is located.
Asked whether the order applied to workers at Tesla's Fremont factory, the California Department of Public Health in a statement said it did not apply to employees deemed essential workers, with manufacturing listed as an essential workforce.
""The Critical Manufacturing Sector identifies several industries to serve as the core of the sector including Transportation Equipment Manufacturing Products,"" the office said.
CNBC first reported on the health department's policies.

Under California law, local counties can impose more restrictive measures than mandated by the state. Alameda County on Friday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement on Monday the county's health department said it was following state guidance, but may act to restrict activities beyond the state's requirements.
During the initial virus outbreak in March, local officials ordered Tesla to halt production and Tesla's factory remained shut down for roughly six weeks. Billionaire Musk in early May defied county orders by reopening the factory, telling county officials he stood ready for arrest.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",UK gearing up to maintain tariffs on U.S. goods in aircraft subsidy case: UK official,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain is gearing up to continue imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods over subsidies provided to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co as it completes its withdrawal from the European Union at the end of the year, a UK official familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Although Britain left the trade bloc on Jan. 31, it joined Brussels in slapping tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. goods earlier this month under a transitional arrangement with Brussels that expires at the end of the year.
Technically that means Britain would no longer be bound to impose EU trade remedies, but it is taking steps to continue the tariffs until the 16-year dispute over aircraft subsidies is settled, the official told reporters.
“Whether we reach a further trade agreement with EU in next days, weeks, or not, we will leave the transition period on the 31st of December, and we will not be bound by EU trade remedies decisions. And we will need to assert our own right to do so,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""And yes, we are preparing to be in a position to be able to do that.""
Britain and Brussels are pushing hard to resolve the dispute even before U.S. President Donald Trump leaves office on Jan. 20, arguing that both sides will face increasing competition from China, Brazil and even Canada in coming years.
The World Trade Organization authorized the EU tariffs against U.S. goods in October, following U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU products that went into effect a year ago after a parallel WTO case against Airbus.
The issue comes at a sensitive time when Britain is trying to negotiate a U.S. trade deal after leaving the EU.
The UK official said Democratic President-elect Joe Biden was not expected to take a ""radically different view"" on the aircraft subsidy issue regarding the previous behavior by Airbus, or its wish to help Boeing, the top U.S. exporter.
""It is clear that these companies are strategically important both to Europe and to the U.S.,"" said the official. ""We need to find a way of supporting them legitimately in WTO rules, and they need to find a way of getting out from under the tariff retaliation against each other, which we think is doing considerable damage to other industries.""
Britain is also seen as anxious to avoid facing ongoing U.S. tariffs against its Scotch whisky producers and farmers over European aid for Airbus without being able to strike back.
Legal experts say the issue may test complex theories over the responsibilities of states in international law. Britain is both a departing member of the EU and, separately, one of four partner nations to Airbus alongside France, Germany and Spain.
Britain is expected to argue that it inherited the right to impose tariffs under rules of state succession, because it suffered harm from the U.S. subsidies covered by the case.

But it is also expected to face U.S. counter-arguments that the WTO ruling in its favour expires when it leaves the EU.

Investing.com - The Dow fell Friday, sapping a two-week win streak as a record surge in Covid-19 cases threatening the economic outlook prompted investors to abandon their bullish bets on stocks. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.75%, or 219 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.69%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.42 %.
The relentless surge in Covid-19 cases is likely to dent the economic recovery as parts of the U.S. impose restrictions to curb the virus at a time when a lack of stimulus will keep a lid on consumer spending. 
{0|JPMorgan}} cut its fourth-quarter 2020 estimate to 2.5% from 3.5% and its first-quarter 2021 growth forecast to 2% from 2.5%, citing an ""immediate impact"" on household incomes from a lack of stimulus.  
The worries over the recovery were exacerbated by data showing cases reached another daily high Thursday with 185,759 new infections, and a surprise move from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin not to extend key lending programs.  
The Treasury Secretary said the programs ""have clearly achieved their objectives,"" but analysts questioned the timing of the move as Covid-19 cases continue to surge.
""(D)epending on the depth and duration of the second-round resurgence and the subsequent policy response, the U.S. economy could slow significantly or potentially fall back into negative territory, creating a second-round recession,"" Stifel said in a note.
Against the growing backdrop of worries about the recovery, industrials, energy, and financials slipped, dragging the broader market deeper into the red.
Financials were hurt by regional banks, with W. R. Berkley (NYSE:WRB), Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG) and Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) down about 2%. A slip in U.S. Treasury yields, with the United States 10-Year falling 2%, exacerbated weakness in banks.
Energy, meanwhile, shrugged off firmer oil prices, paced by a decline in  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO).
Elsewhere, stay-at-home stocks like Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) rose, with the latter up more than 6% as investors bet that further restrictions will keep demand elevated.
On the vaccine front,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) rose 1.4% after confirming it would apply on Friday for emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to review the request in the coming weeks, and the vaccine, if approved, is expected to be rolled out before year-end.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) is hoping to rapidly roll out its experimental COVID-19 vaccine around Latin America soon after it gets emergency authorization in the United States, a senior executive said, which could be as early as next month.
Alejandro Cané, the North America chief of scientific and medical affairs for Pfizer's vaccines division, told Reuters in an interview in Buenos Aires that Latin America and elsewhere in the world should have a ""similar timeline"" to the United States.
""At the beginning the idea is to have the vaccine authorized in the United States,"" Cané said. ""We are confident that in the next weeks or month we will have the vaccine not only in use in the U.S. and Europe, but also in Latin American countries.""
Pfizer is applying to U.S. health regulators on Friday for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine, the first such application, which marks a major step toward providing protection against the deadly virus.
""The idea is just to collect all the info from that trial and we are waiting now for feedback from the FDA to have a VRBPAC (Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee) meeting and after that a potential authorization for our emergency use authorization,"" he said.
""In that way, the vaccine could be used and distributed in the United States,"" he added, saying that authorization could come around 1-2 weeks after the VRBPAC meeting.
Cané said that Pfizer had supply agreements in Chile, Mexico and Peru and that there were several other conversations ongoing, including in Argentina, where the government has said it could receive 750,000 doses of the vaccine by December.
Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) have reported final trial results showing the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, with no major safety concerns.
Cané said Pfizer was ready to supply and distribute around 50 million doses of the vaccine, which requires ultra-low temperature storage, before the end of 2020, which would be split between the United States and the rest of the world.
The firm was aiming to supply around 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year, he said, adding the vaccine had shown high efficacy across different ethnicities.
Regarding the need for ultra-low temperatures in the supply chain, which creates complications in less-developed regions, Cané said it was a matter of speed. A hardier second-generation version could be ready by 2022.
""We know that it is complicated compared to other vaccines, but we are in the midst of a pandemic situation and we are trying to provide the more efficacious solution in the quickest manner,"" he said.

Countries around Latin America also have deals in place for vaccine doses from British drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc, China's Sinovac Biotech and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Zurich Insurance nears $4 billion deal for MetLife unit - sources,"By David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Switzerland's Zurich Insurance Group AG (S:ZURN) is in advanced talks to acquire MetLife Inc's (N:MET) U.S. property and casualty (P&C) car and home insurance unit for close to $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal, executed through its Farmers Group Inc subsidiary, would expand Zurich Insurance's P&C business, as the industry grapples with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove up claims for business interruptions and event cancellations.
It would also allow MetLife to exit a business in which it faces fierce competition from larger players such as State Farm, GEICO and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Insurance.
Its P&C business focuses more on car insurance, an area in which people have made fewer claims due to spending less time on the road during the pandemic.
If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced by early December, the sources said.
MetLife declined to comment, while Zurich did not respond to a comment request.
MetLife, whose offerings also include life insurance, employee benefits and asset management, earlier this month reported a 68% drop in third-quarter adjusted earnings at its U.S. property and casualty division, to $18 million.
The decline was driven by catastrophe losses caused by storms in the United States, it said.
The New York-based company's chief executive, Michel Khalaf, said during its latest quarterly earnings call that the P&C business had ""an important strategic connection"" to the rest of MetLife, but declined to comment on whether he would sell it.
MetLife has been turning to dealmaking to move into more profitable areas.
It said in September it would buy vision-care benefits company Versant Health for $1.68 billion, which would make it the third-largest vision insurer in the United States by membership, and announced in December it would enter the pet insurance market by acquiring PetFirst Healthcare.
Zurich Insurance's U.S. footprint currently includes Farmers Group, an administrator of insurance policies for Farmers Insurance. Zurich Insurance acquired Farmers Group in 1998, while Farmers Insurance is owned by its policyholders.
Farmers Insurance was the fifth- and seventh-largest provider of home and auto insurance, respectively, in the United States in 2019, according to data provider S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence. MetLife was 14th and 18th, respectively.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been ordered by a New York state judge to pay $120 million in damages to a Brooklyn woman and her husband, after she blamed her cancer on asbestos exposure from using the company's baby powder.
Justice Gerald Lebovits of the state supreme court in Manhattan reduced the payout from the $325 million a jury awarded Donna Olson, 67, and Robert Olson, 65, in May 2019 following a 14-week trial.
While upholding the jury's liability finding, Lebovits wrote on Nov. 11 that the damages were too high, and the Olsons could either accept $120 million or have a new trial on damages.
The judge approved the lowered payout on Wednesday, court records show. It includes $15 million of compensatory damages and $105 million of punitive damages, down from an original $25 million and $300 million, respectively.
Johnson & Johnson said it will appeal the verdict, citing ""significant legal and evidentiary errors"" at the trial.
""We deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer, which is why the facts are so important,"" the company said. ""We remain confident that our talc is safe, asbestos free, and does not cause cancer.""
Jerome Block, a lawyer for the Olsons, said they were satisfied with the result and confident it would stand.
He also said Donna Olson's mesothelioma ""is at an advanced stage, and we are hoping for the best.""
Donna Olson had testified that she used Johnson's Baby Powder or Shower to Shower daily for more than 50 years.
Lebovits wrote that jurors could find that Johnson & Johnson was for many years ""knowingly deceitful about"" or ""willfully blind to"" potential health risks of its talc products, in part to maintain market share and profit.
The New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based company is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court a $2.12 billion damages award in Missouri to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in its baby powder and other talc products.
Johnson & Johnson has faced intense scrutiny of its baby powder's safety following a 2018 Reuters investigative report that found it knew for decades about asbestos in its talc. 

Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/)

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Brexit casts long shadow over UK markets,"By Ritvik Carvalho and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union are trying to reach a trade deal to regulate their relationship after Dec. 31, an agreement that should lift some of the uncertainty clouding the UK outlook 4-1/2 years after Britons voted to leave the trading bloc.
The impact on UK financial markets of that vote and the years of negotiations and missed deadlines since has been profound -- the British currency is 20% below its long-term fair value, stock prices have underperformed almost every other major market and businesses have held back on new investment.
On Wednesday, British finance minister Rishi Sunak will announce the heaviest public borrowing since World War Two when he spells out his spending plans.
Below are five graphics setting out the impact of Brexit on British assets since 2016.
1) STERLING'S WILD RIDE
Sterling has been on a rollercoaster since the June 2016 Brexit vote -- some analysts say the volatility resembles that of an emerging market currency.
From trading above $1.50  before the referendum, the pound has had several brief forays below $1.20 - its lowest level since the 1980s. It is now trading around $1.33 - indicating a Brexit discount remains.

2) STOCK LAGGARDS
British share prices have underperformed nearly all their major peers since 2016 as investors put their money to work elsewhere.
Despite a stonking central bank-fuelled rebound in global stocks this year, UK domestic-focused company shares (FTMC) remain just 12% higher than early 2016 levels. The FTSE 100 (FTSE) is up just 1.5% -- that's against a nearly 80% gain for the S&P 500 and a 50%-plus rise for world stocks. 
Graphic: Brexit woes keep UK stocks global laggards - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmxxqzpr/brexit%20and%20uk%20stocks.PNG
3) WEAK INVESTMENT
New UK business investment has flatlined since the 2016 referendum, before falling sharply after the COVID-19 pandemic whacked confidence. 
After steady growth in year-on-year business investment before 2016, companies have since cut back on new capital expenditure amid Brexit-related uncertainty.
Year-on-year growth in UK business investment notably fell in late 2018 as companies concerned about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit postponed or axed spending.

4) BREXIT PREMIUM
British companies have had to pay more to borrow from lenders nervous about Brexit, reflected in bank-issued bonds.
For instance, the gap between the yield on  Barclays  (LON:BARC)'s September 2023 euro-denominated bond and a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) note maturing the same month was as high as 80 basis points in late 2018 when fears of a no-deal Brexit surged. 
It is currently at 5.5 basis points after falling sharply since April, reflecting investor confidence that London and Brussels would agree a trade deal. 
Graphic: UK corporate borrowing premium - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkllzmvm/Pasted%20image%201605855140873.png
5) WEAKER FINANCES
With a large current account deficit and a debt-to-GDP before the COVID-19 pandemic above 80%, Britain is reliant on international investors' confidence in the UK economy and its markets. 
Britain's current account deficit, higher than many peers, has fallen sharply during the pandemic. 
But the budget deficit is soaring as the government ups spending to rescue the economy and debt-to-GDP is approaching 100% -- leaving less headroom to spend should the economy need more support after the Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: Gap between vaccine hopes and pandemic reality poses market hazard,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As winter approaches, U.S. equity investors are weighing brightening prospects for a COVID-19 vaccine against a resurgence of the pandemic across the United States.
Several market strategists have predicted significant gains in U.S. stocks in 2021, as long as Congress passes further fiscal stimulus and a vaccine becomes widely available in the first half. But the path for stocks could be bumpy while investors await those developments, they said.
Over the past few weeks, investors had largely looked past immediate risks from the pandemic. The benchmark S&P 500 index recently soared to record highs on evidence of high efficacy rates in two experimental vaccines - from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and jointly from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). Both vaccines could be ready for U.S. authorization and distribution within weeks, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said.
Still, the pandemic remained an immediate threat as the number of U.S. deaths from the disease has climbed to 250,000. The S&P 500 fell more than 1% on Wednesday as New York City announced the closure of public schools.
Economic indicators including a rise in jobless claims last week signaled that the recovery may have stalled, reflecting the need for further fiscal stimulus, some investors said. Data from IHS Markit's flash purchasing managers' index and the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey are scheduled for release next week.
""We anticipate a vaccine becoming partially available this year, but that still leaves a gap,"" said Colin Moore, global chief investment officer at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.
Further signs the pandemic is growing more severe could stir volatility in U.S. stocks. The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" fell sharply after the U.S. presidential election but has leveled off and remains above its long-term average near 20. VIX futures also reflect elevated expectations for market gyrations throughout the first half of 2021.
Questions about more stimulus have fed volatility expectations, investors said. Two U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia scheduled for January could decide which political party controls that chamber and hence the scope of further pandemic relief.
""The big event risk in 2021 might be that's just completely off the table,"" said Derek Devens, senior portfolio manager of Neuberger Berman's options group, referring to further stimulus. ""That would be a pretty negative event for the market.""
Some strategists anticipate a bid to haven currencies as a hedge against market declines. TD Securities strategists wrote on Tuesday that they expect the dollar, which has weakened this month, to gain for a brief period in part due to ""evolving COVID realities."" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) has recommended options strategies that would benefit from a strengthening in the yen.
But overall, investors largely expect any further slide in U.S. stocks to be fleeting. Restrictions on mobility and economic activity in response to rising COVID-19 cases are likely to be more limited than in the spring, they said. New York City, for instance, has kept stores and restaurants open even as schools close.
Simply seeing a light at the end of the tunnel has helped limit investor anxiety, said David Lefkowitz, head of Americas equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. Even if a stimulus package does not materialize as expected, optimism about a vaccine could blunt any hit to U.S. stocks, in his view. 

""There's a pretty clear line of sight to an improvement beginning after the first quarter,"" he said. ""I don't think we're going to see a huge pullback because the market knows that this is a very temporary situation.""

Investing.com --  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) fell 3.2% despite fabulous earnings that put analyst estimates to shame.
Third quarter earnings per share of $1.21 beat the estimated 53 cents on sales of $2.11 billion versus the expected $1.89 billion. Comparable-store sales for the period increased by 7.7%, and sales grew 9%, while gross margin decreased to 30.9% from 32.1% a year earlier.
Chief Financial Officer Lauren Peters urged caution for the fourth quarter, citing uncertainty around the effects of the pandemic. Additionally, higher than normal markdown rates may be possible alongside elevated freight costs.
""Although the back-to-school selling season kicked in later than usual due to COVID-19-related delays, momentum built as the quarter progressed,"" said Richard Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer. 
Foot Locker has bounced back over the past two quarters after a tough first quarter saw the beginning of the pandemic and the shutting down of stores. The stock got hit hard along with the rest of the market at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with shares dropping by more than half. They have now recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks edged higher Friday, but gains were capped by dwindling stimulus in the United States and concerns about the damage to the global economy from further COVID-19 infections.
Hopes of a stimulus-led recovery receded after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said key COVID-19 pandemic lending programs at the Federal Reserve to support businesses and local governments would expire by the end of 2020.
Meanwhile, flare-ups in coronavirus cases dampened sentiment, with California announcing fresh curfews to try to fight surging infections, while Japan faces a third wave of the virus, and parts of Europe are already under recently renewed restrictions.
The World Trade Organization said that while global trade in goods had rebounded in the third quarter from lockdowns, there would be a slowdown at the end of 2020.
Europe's STOXX 600 edged 0.4% higher, while the global stocks index was also 0.2% firmer and on course for its third weekly gain in a row.
S&P500 futures were flat, while Dow futures fell 0.1%, cancelling out a firmer lead from a strong Wall Street session overnight.
The dollar edged up before reversing later and the 10-year Treasury yield slipped to the lowest in 10 days at 0.818%, before stabilizing in later trading.
Benchmark German 10-year Bund yields fell to a nine-day low < US10DE10=RR>.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei stumbled 0.4%, weighed down by a rise in new domestic coronavirus infections to record highs. Chinese shares were 0.3% stronger. 
In a letter to U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Mnuchin said $455 billion allocated to Treasury under the CARES Act should be instead available for Congress to reallocate.
Although not used extensively, Fed officials felt the programs reassured financial markets and investors that credit would remain available to help businesses, local agencies and even non-profits through the pandemic.
Mnuchin's decision added to market anxiety about broader economic growth as data shows the early fast recovery from a historic plunge in the U.S. economy is fading, with more than 10 million who had jobs in January still out of work.
""The fact the market is able to resist to this extent means there is some sun ahead, driven by the fact that in the medium term economic activity will accelerate and there is positive news on the vaccine,"" François Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners, said.
Investor sentiment was also hit by data that showed COVID-19 hospitalizations across the United States jumped by nearly 50% in the last two weeks, threatening the recovery of the world's largest economy as cities and states imposed lockdowns.
All three major U.S. stock indexes, however, got a boost overnight after Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had agreed to revive talks to craft a new fiscal relief package. 
In Europe, investors clung to signs of progress on coronavirus vaccines.
The European Union could pay more than $10 billion to secure hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine candidates being developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and CureVac, an EU official involved in the talks told Reuters.
In currencies, the dollar index was at 92.20, broadly flat on the day after it slipped overnight then picked up again as European markets opened. [L1N2I60G8]
The euro was flat against the dollar, at $1.18705, on track for a small weekly gain, while the Australian dollar is having its best month versus the U.S. dollar since April, in terms of percentage change.
The New Zealand dollar rose to a new two-year high against the U.S. dollar. 
In commodities, oil prices steadied after losses the previous day, when concerns about coronavirus lockdowns affecting fuel demand weighed on the market. [O/R]
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) January crude contract added 0.5% to $42.09 a barrel. Brent crude was up 0.7% at $44.51.

1118,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>","Mnuchin Says Treasury, Fed Have ‘Plenty of Capacity Left’","(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his agency and the Federal Reserve have enough firepower to continue to support the economy, a day after calling for several emergency lending programs to be sunsetted by the end of the year.
“Markets should be very comfortable that we have plenty of capacity left,” Mnuchin said Friday on CNBC. He said he is “merely, simply following the intent of the law. It was not a decision on whether we needed these or didn’t need this.”
In a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell released on Thursday, Mnuchin sought a 90-day extension for four of the central bank’s emergency lending programs, while requesting that five other programs expire on schedule on Dec. 31. He said the Fed must return unused funds, allowing Congress to re-appropriate $455 billion and spend the money elsewhere.
The move sparked a rare public rift between Treasury and the Fed, when minutes later the central bank responded in a short statement, saying it “would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained and vulnerable economy.”
Mnuchin also faced wider backlash, with some outside critics saying he was blocking a smooth transition with President-elect Joe Biden’s administration during a time of crisis.
“We’re not trying to hinder anything. We followed the law as we’re supposed to,” Mnuchin said. He added that he was with lawmakers in March when they wrote the Cares Act and that “the law was very clear” that the money would need to be returned on Dec. 31.
One possible reason for the Treasury Department to make the announcement this week is to avoid releasing market-sensitive decisions in December, when markets tend to be less liquid and more susceptible to swings as it absorbs new information.
Mnuchin, and his successor in the Biden administration, can still work quickly with the Fed to renew lending facilities that may be necessary. The agency has roughly $75 billion available to use toward Fed facilities that can be used without Congress’s approval.
In an interview with Bloomberg News on Wednesday, Mnuchin said that lawmakers should redirect the $580 billion in unspent stimulus funding, including money he’s pulling back from the Fed, to buoy the economy as the U.S. waits for a coronavirus vaccine.
Mnuchin also said he will discus fiscal stimulus efforts with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell later Friday.

U.S. housing finance regulator Mark Calabria is focused on the exit plan for the home mortgage companies, but completing the procedure before U.S. President Donald Trump's term ends on Jan. 20 is a long shot, and President-elect Joe Biden will most likely not continue the effort, according to the report. (https://on.wsj.com/3nAGqcO) 
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Mnuchin is ""supportive of locking in a path to private ownership"", but mindful of steps that could disrupt the housing-finance market, the report said, citing one person familiar with the effort. 
It also said Mnuchin must agree to any move to alter the terms of either Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's bailout agreement or the government's stakes. 
The companies have operated under government conservatorship since they were bailed out during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. But for years now, Washington has struggled to devise a plan to safely return the guarantors of over half of the nation's mortgages to the private sector.
Calabria has outlined an ambitious course for removing the two firms from government control, which includes reviewing their business activities, shoring up their accounting, and raising billions in capital.
FHFA has finalized a capital rule for the pair that will require them to raise more than $200 billion.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened modestly lower on Friday, seemingly immune to incremental progress in the development of vaccines that could end the Covid-19 pandemic. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19 points, or 0.1% at 29,464 points. It's on course to end the week effectively flat, despite having surged on Monday in response to the news that  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s experimental vaccine is effective against the disease.
Since then. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has also confirmed its drug stimulated a strong immune response to the disease, especially in older people, while  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) said on Friday that they will file their request for Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration today. Pfizer stock rose 1.4%, while BioNTech's rose 4.7%.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were also down 0.1%.
The market was held back by the familiar problem of negative news in short-term developments on the virus front, and the less familiar problem of the Federal Reserve publicly at odds with the administration over Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's decision not to extend authority for a number emergency Fed lending programs past the year end. Mnuchin said on Friday morning that the money could be reappropriated and redeployed by Congress more effectively. Much of the potential firepower of the lending programs in question hasn't been touched. 
The Fed had taken the rare step of issuing a statement rebuking the administration for its decision on Thursday, saying: “The Federal Reserve would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained and vulnerable economy.”
Reuters reported that corporate debt prices fell sharply on Friday, on fears that the credit 'backstops' put in place earlier in the pandemic were being eroded. Markit's high-yield credit-default swap index fell in price, a bearish signal, to 107.42% in Friday morning trade. The spread of Markit's investment grade CDX widened to 55.61 basis points, also a bearish signal and its its highest since November 4. 
Hopes for a quick end to the pandemic next year were overshadowed again by the grim near-term realities. Hospitalizations due to Covid-19 topped 80,000 nationwide for the first time on Thursday, while nearly 2,000 more deaths were reported, bringing the total to 252.299, according to Johns Hopkins. 
Among early movers, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) stock fell 7.0% despite the company beating forecasts for the latest quarter after the bell on Thursday. Chief financial officer Robynne Sisco warned that headwinds from the pandemic would become worse next year.

Washington has long complained of lack of access to audit working papers for U.S.-listed Chinese companies and in August threatened measures to delist Chinese firms that fail to meet its auditing requirements, before Beijing proposed a trial joint inspection of any of its state-run firms.
""It is believed the two sides will adopt an open and professional attitude to reach a consensus"" on a plan for joint inspection by auditors on both sides and ""create a good regulatory environment for cross-border listed companies,"" the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement.
The latest CSRC proposal aimed at resolving the dispute was sent in August to the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which said it would actively study the document, after describing China's previous proposals as ""materially deficient.""
President Donald Trump's administration last week issued executive order prohibiting U.S. investments in Chinese companies Washington says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.

That prompted some of the firms set to be affected by the order - including those with U.S.-traded American depositary shares such as  China Telecom  (NYSE:CHA) Corp Ltd (HK:0728) - to warn of an impact on their share prices.

(Reuters) - NetJets, a private jet firm owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, expects aircraft deliveries to rise by a third next year, as wealthy travelers looking to avoid commercial flights due to the COVID-19 pandemic fuel a recovery in demand.
The world's largest private jet operator, which had earlier halved its delivery target for this year to 30, said it now expects to take delivery of 40 new airplanes in 2021.
""We are ramping our deliveries ... we expect deliveries to remain at that level (40 airplanes a year) for the next couple of years,"" said Patrick Gallagher, the company's president of sales, marketing and service.
Operators of private jets, which can carry up to 19 people, have fared better than commercial airlines as they promise less risk of exposure to the coronavirus because their passengers can avoid crowded airport counters and packed planes.
U.S. private aviation traffic has sharply rebounded from an about 75% fall in April, and was down only about 20% for the two weeks ended Nov. 8, according to data from FlightAware traffic.
In comparison, the U.S. commercial airline traffic has seen a slower recovery, with traffic down about 47% for the two weeks ended Nov. 8 from April when air traffic collapsed as the virus started spreading around the world.
""We have signed on three times as many new customers year to date this year as we did last year. That trend continues for November and December,"" Gallagher.
NetJets specializes in selling ""fractional"" ownership in private jets, allowing individuals and companies to travel on short notice and at much cheaper rates than owning a whole jet. It has a fleet of 511 planes.
Nearly half of NetJets' fleet comprises aircraft manufactured by  Textron Inc  (N:TXT), and the rest by  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), General Dynamics (N:GD), Dassault (PA:AVMD) and Embraer (SA:EMBR3).

Textron, the maker of Cessna and Beechcraft planes, has also been benefiting from the trend. Rob Scholl, a senior VP at Textron Aviation, told Reuters earlier this month that the company is seeing higher demand from first-time owners.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Car manufacturers will need to meet tight emissions limits for their activities to be classed as a sustainable investment under proposed European Union rules, which the auto industry said could undermine investment in the sector's green transition.
Under green finance rules that kick in at the end of 2021, the EU will define which investments can be marketed as ""sustainable"" based on criteria that they make a ""substantial contribution"" to tackling or adapting to climate change. 
The EU aims to force providers of financial products to disclose which investments meet these criteria to avoid ""greenwashing"", or presenting a product as environmentally friendly even when it falls short, and steer private investment into low-carbon projects.
The European Commission published proposals for the rules on Friday, opening them to public feedback before finalising them this year. 
Under the rules, car manufacturing would only count as a ""sustainable"" investment for vehicles that emit less than 50g of CO2 per km. This would apply to passenger vehicles and freight vehicles that weigh less than 3.5 tonnes.
From 2026, only zero-emissions vehicles in these categories would be classed as a sustainable, meaning hybrid vehicles would lose their ""green"" label.
The limits are lower than current EU targets for new cars - an average of 95g CO2/km - which carmakers must meet to avoid paying fines.
Industry lobby group the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said the green finance rules could leave carmakers struggling to raise funds needed to clean up their fleets.
""The automotive sector is worried that the regulation might instead deter investors at the very time when it needs additional funding to transition towards cleaner solutions,"" a spokesperson for the group said.
Europe's CO2 emissions from transport are higher than they were in 1990. This trend needs to change for the EU to meet its economy-wide target to have net zero emissions by 2050.
Transport produces roughly 30% of total EU CO2 emissions, with about three quarters coming from road transport.
Carmakers in Europe are adding zero-emission vehicles to their model lineups.  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has said the company will no longer invest in internal combustion engines.

Zero-emission battery-electric car sales jumped 71.2% in the first three quarters of 2020 in the EU, but still only made up 4% of new vehicle sales.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",How Airbnb's CEO succumbed to an IPO he resisted,"By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky resisted calls from his investors for years to follow the lead of other Silicon Valley unicorns and take the home rental startup public, as he pursued his dream of turning it into a one-stop shop for leisure and travel. He is now pressing ahead with a stock market debut just as the COVID-19 pandemic hits its peak. 
Airbnb aims to complete its initial public offering (IPO) on Nasdaq next month, 12 years after Chesky founded the company with former roommates Joseph Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk. The long road to the IPO frustrated many investors and employees waiting for an opportunity to sell their Airbnb shares in the stock market.
Reuters interviews with more than a dozen Airbnb executives, advisers, investors and employees show that Chesky put IPO plans on the backburner as he sought to turn the company into a full-fledged travel agency, adding ""experiences"" so guests could participate in vacation activities such as book-guided tours of local attractions. By increasing spending on these ventures, he sacrificed Airbnb's profitability, the IPO prospectus shows.
It took years of pressure from investors and employees, as well as a deterioration in Airbnb's finances during the pandemic, for Chesky to give up on his expansion plans and commit to a listing. Airbnb is poised to seek a valuation of around $30 billion, less than the $50 billion that investment bankers told Chesky the company could have been valued in a listing two years ago.
""Chesky is one founder where it wasn't his dream to go public but it's part of the process of satisfying all your stakeholders and rewarding them,"" said SV Angel founder Ron Conway, an early investor in Airbnb and a supporter of Chesky who liaises with him regularly.
Airbnb declined to comment, while Chesky declined to comment through a spokesman.
Airbnb officially reached technology unicorn status in 2011, when it crossed the $1 billion valuation threshold. As Airbnb raised more money from investors, Chesky resisted taking it public. He split his time between running the company, visiting properties and developing experiences for guests.
""He now has a proper house, but for years he would go and try out a new Airbnb every night. He would stay for a few nights in each one. In the trunk of his car he would have his belongings,"" Conway said.
IPO SPAT
Investors were growing frustrated with the IPO's elusiveness. In 2017, Lawrence Tosi, who had joined Airbnb as chief financial officer two years earlier from buyout firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), guided investors in a $1 billion fundraising round that a listing was likely in the next 12 months, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Tosi also initiated talks with investment banks about a stock market debut that would value Airbnb at between $45 billion and $50 billion, one of the sources said. He was doing this at the behest of Chesky, who had asked Tosi to have Airbnb ready for an IPO by the first quarter of 2018, the source added. 
But then Chesky pulled the plug on Tosi's IPO preparations. He published a memo describing Airbnb as focused on an ""infinite time horizon"", a clear sign he had decided to eschew the quarterly financial disclosures of a publicly listed company.
Tosi clashed with Chesky, arguing the future of Airbnb lay in its core business of vacation rentals and business travel, and that putting off the IPO to expand the experiences segment would waste money and leave the company worse off. The spat resulted in Tosi's departure from Airbnb in 2018.
CORONAVIRUS HITS
Chesky kept the prospect of an IPO alive for investors but never firmed up plans until September 2019, when Airbnb announced it would go public sometime in 2020. In signing off on that statement, Chesky was responding to the frustration of many of his employees, who had been granted stock options expiring in early 2021 and would lose out if the company was not public and they could not sell shares by then, the sources said.
Then in March, the novel coronavirus outbreak shook Airbnb. Bookings hit rock-bottom and guests canceled reservations. 
Chesky decided to raise money again. Yet previous fundraising rounds were based on the prospects of rapid growth, not a crisis. Had the San Francisco-based company gone public, it could have raised money through a stock sale in the open market.
The option that was left was debt, and it was expensive. Airbnb secured $2 billion in term loans from several investment firms, including Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners, at a blended annual interest rate of more than 9%. By comparison, ride-sharing company  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), which also relies on the gig economy, inked a $1.5 billion term loan in 2018 at a 6.2% interest rate. 
Some of Chesky's grandiose plans, including making Airbnb TV shows and movies, were out the window, as he laid off a quarter of the workforce and slashed the marketing budget.
He focused on revitalizing Airbnb's core home listing business by transitioning from city apartments to vacation homes that people wanted to rent in the pandemic. The turnaround worked, and Airbnb posted a profit of $219 million in the third quarter. 
Yet it has never been profitable on an annual basis, and lost almost $700 million in the first nine months of the year, a far cry from its performance two years ago, when it was only $17 million away from being profitable.
At an Airbnb board meeting in late July, Chesky signed off on an IPO by the end of the year, according to the sources.
""When COVID-19 hit, Chesky had to reverse a whole series of initiatives that had been in the works for three years,"" said Michael Ovitz, co-founder of Creative Artists Agency and an informal adviser to Chesky. 

""He was really affected by this and it went to the core of everything he is about.""

1127,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 07:14AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Mixed; Vaccine News Helps Balance Treasury/Fed Spat,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Friday, with investors having to digest fresh restrictions as Covid-19 cases rise, tensions between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve as well as more positive vaccine news and renewed fiscal stimulus talks.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract fell 27 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded flat, and Nasdaq 100 Futures was up 27 points, or 0.2%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 indices are near breakeven for the week, but the Dow is currently on course for its best month since 1987 and the S&P 500 for its best since April. The Nasdaq Composite is heading for its second up week in three.
The U.S. set a new single-day record of 185,000 new Covid-19 cases Thursday, with the number of patients hospitalized jumping nearly 50% in the last two weeks, prompting states to impose new restrictions to try and curb the spread.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered a 10 PM. curfew in the most populated U.S. state, starting Saturday, while the Center for Disease Control urged Americans not to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday.
Also weighing on sentiment was a disagreement between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve over whether some of the emergency programs implemented to support the economy during the recession still need to be funded. 
This contrasted with news that Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had agreed to revive talks to craft a new fiscal relief package.
Helping the tone Friday was  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) announcing it would be applying to the U.S. FDA later today for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine, which it is developing in conjunction with German BioNTech. The pharma giant said it could start shipping the vaccine as soon as it received approval.
Both the earnings and economic data slates are quiet Friday, with quarterly numbers from  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) the only release of note.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, continuing a largely positive week despite concerns about demand growth given the growing number of coronavirus cases and signs of a slowdown in the U.S. labor market. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $41.97 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $44.37, both remaining well above the $40 mark after the gains earlier in the week on the back of vaccine optimism.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,863.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1869.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>","In pandemic Christmas, U.S. rivals aim to challenge Amazon under the tree","By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) and hundreds of smaller retailers are bolstering their online gift features, hoping to challenge Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s dominance as a seller of holiday gifts to homebound shoppers.
The new services seek to take some of the drudgery out of gift-giving. The features let consumers purchase a present online and have it delivered to the recipient with, for example, the retailer handling wrapping, a personal message or a receipt that does not show the gift's price.
Amazon's rivals have tried to chip away at its online preeminence, spending millions to fulfill orders faster, expand product catalogs and, in some cases, provide free shipping and even subscription services. But the first holiday sales season with widespread coronavirus has drawn attention to a previously overlooked battlefront: gift giving.
Consumers flocked to Walmart and other retailers early in the pandemic when Amazon was at times slow to deliver essentials including toilet paper. Now, Amazon competitors see another opportunity to seize market share.
""This is an area of opportunity where smaller or large retailers could differentiate given most consumers will be doing their holiday shopping online this year,"" said Bobby Figueroa, who worked for Amazon's ad sales unit before founding retail analytics startup Gradient.
Walmart.com on Oct. 28 added a ""gift eligible"" label on hundreds of thousands of U.S. product pages, including for toilet paper, a status previously not displayed until checkout. Gift eligible means Walmart can send gift receipts as well as let shoppers customize an email greeting. It will also ship the item in its boxes, concealing manufacturer packaging. 
With gift giving already up over last year, Walmart increased inventory of laptops, loungewear and exercise equipment ahead of the holidays. Shoppers can search specifically for only gift-eligible items for the first time.
BestBuy.com in mid-October added an option for gift receipts with store pickups. It also started allowing shoppers to arrange for Best Buy to email gift recipients with a festive greeting on the same day items are delivered. 
 Estee Lauder  Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) this year is using technology from startup SmartGift that added options across five of its websites for shoppers to designate cosmetics and other items as gifts while letting recipients select color, size or scent before shipping.
Americans will spend $160 billion on gifts during the current quarter, up 5% from a year ago as people put savings from skipped outings into celebrating Christmas and other year-end holidays, according to industry analyst Coresight Research.
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc's e-commerce software unit Magento expects Americans to ship 67% more holiday gifts than a year ago and to 18% more recipients as travel gets curbed.
But Coresight still expects Amazon.com to capture 18% of gift purchases and 7.2% of overall U.S. retail sales, up from 14% of gift purchases and 5.6% of total sales in 2019.
Amazon has maintained its dominance as the entire ecommerce industry thrives in the pandemic. Amazon's product sales rose 32% this year through September, nearly 2-1/2 times the rate over the same period last year.
It pushed its annual sales event Prime Day to October from July as an early start to holiday shopping, and it brought forward the release of its annual guide of potential gifts to just before. The guide, which included new sections for items from small and Black-owned businesses, was Amazon's largest ever.
The company has long provided basic gift features. It charges several dollars to gift-wrap shipments, and a free message of up to 240 characters per item can be printed on black-and-white gift receipts. A year ago, it started offering emailed gift receipts for some items.
MYSTERIOUS SENDER
But some consumers are frustrated that Amazon does not offer options others do, such as the ability to specify delivery date or gift wrap color, have recipients enter their shipping address or send gift messages by text, video and physical card.
""The gift thing on Amazon is completely broken,"" said Lawrence Greenberg, 54, a financial planner in New Hope (OTC:NHPEF), Pennsylvania. He said he will buy elsewhere when possible after four of his gift recipients over the last three years either did not notice or receive the printed gift message. Just last month, a client puzzled for two weeks over who sent cocktail glasses until Greenberg asked.
Amazon said its gift features remain popular.
Jeff Jordan, 33, of Charlotte, shipped three Amazon purchases to himself this month, with plans to wrap and re-ship the gifts. He lost faith in Amazon last year when it wrapped a gadget for his parents in a gray plastic sleeve with a tiny gift tag and a wad of tissue paper.

Though Amazon apologized and refunded, Jordan said he ""learned his lesson.""

1129,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Should Corporate Zombies Give You Nightmares?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s something of a zombie apocalypse happening in the U.S. corporate bond market.
An analysis from Lisa Lee and Tom Contiliano of Bloomberg News found that 527 of the companies in the Russell 3000 index of large U.S. corporations, with a combined $1.36 trillion of debt, are “zombies” — meaning they had trailing 12-month operating income that fell short of the interest expenses they owed over the same period. That’s up from 335 firms with $378 billion of debt at the end of last year. It’s a staggering increase for a list that includes companies ranging from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. to Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and even vaccine wunderkind  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc., and it raises serious questions about what America’s post-pandemic recovery might look like. After all, companies that don’t even make enough to cover their obligations aren’t in much of a position to hire more workers or invest in opportunities to grow their businesses.
In starting to unpack this list, it becomes clear that share prices are only so useful as a guide. Uber reached an all-time high this week; AMC Enterainment Holdings Inc. nearly set a record low on Nov. 2. Credit ratings also can’t tell the whole story. Boeing and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. have had issues with their balance sheets for years but were given plenty of time to sort it out and still hold investment grades. Meanwhile, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp.’s senior unsecured debt rating was cut five separate times by Moody’s Investors Service since the start of the pandemic: from A3 to Baa1 on March 11; to Baa3 on March 31; to Ba1 on May 18; to Ba2 on June 23; and to B2 on Aug. 24. Debt from Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) Entertainment Corp. has an even lower rating, B3, but that’s the same as roughly 20 years ago.
Even published research on corporate zombies is mixed. On one end, there’s the Bank for International Settlements, which found that once a company becomes a zombie, its “performance remains significantly poorer than that of non-zombie firms” and it “faces a significantly higher probability of exiting the market through bankruptcy or takeover.” Yet the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests that in an economy like the current one, zombies are worth fighting for: “It costs creditors little to keep loss-making firms in operation in hopes of renewed profitability when the economy recovers. There is nothing wrong with this outcome.”
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon seemed to echo the latter point in remarks this week about the optics of government bailouts. “I wouldn’t not do the right thing because you might be helping a few zombie companies,” he said at The New York Times DealBook Online Summit. “Who is going to sit down and say, ‘Well these won’t survive, and these will?’ We don't have the time to do that. Get through the problem — don’t make it worse.”
It’s a lot to sift through. Fortunately, Bloomberg Opinion has columnists who are intimately aware of trends within each of these industries. Here are their views on this year’s rise of the corporate zombies.
Fright night at zombie movie theaters: AMC, the largest cinema operator in the U.S. and Europe, could soon run out of cash needed to keep the company solvent, and it can’t entirely blame Covid-19 for that. AMC and its peers responded to worsening box-office trends in recent years by loading up on debt to make acquisitions in the U.S. and internationally, install more luxurious seating, buy back stock and pay out hefty dividends. Now the industry as a whole faces an existential question. Surveys show that surging virus cases keep delaying when movie fans will be comfortable returning. In the meantime, entertainment giants such as Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. have made it no secret that they’re prioritizing streaming. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T).’s Warner Bros. is even debuting “Wonder Woman 1984” on its $15-a-month HBO Max app on Christmas, the same day it gets released in theaters. — Tara Lachapelle
Not really dead. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the streaming trend is  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc. — a zombie, yes, but also the most popular connected-TV device. Lower advertiser spending at the height of the coronavirus crisis did hurt the company, but Roku is less of a true zombie than a small fry in a land of giants. It joins other companies that technically qualify as zombies but are mainly growth plays like Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc., Spotify Technology SA, Uber and Moderna. — Tara Lachapelle
Longing for live action. While theater-wary consumers are just as uncomfortable going to amusement parks or concerts, those businesses seem more likely to rebound once vaccines are widely available and the virus threat diminishes. Shares of ticket seller Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) Inc. tripled from 2016 through 2019 before necessary pandemic lockdowns obliterated its revenue growth and made it a zombie. Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA). CEO Brian Roberts said last month that he’s “very bullish” on theme parks (it owns Universal Studios), and Disney CEO Bob Chapek signaled confidence that demand will rebound. That may bode well for other adventure destinations such as SeaWorld (NYSE:SEAS) Entertainment Inc. and Six Flags, though it may take time before long lines form again. Cruise lines Carnival and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd. could be in a similar boat. — Tara Lachapelle
Escape from Zombieland? GE has been limping along under a mountain of debt for years. The last time the company’s annual operating income exceeded its interest expenses was in 2016 — the year before longtime CEO Jeff Immelt stepped down and it became clear GE had been aggressively chasing revenue in an oversupplied gas turbine market and splurging billions on buybacks and dividends it couldn’t afford. Immelt’s successors — first, John Flannery, and now, Larry Culp — have sold billions in assets, including GE’s rail business and its biopharmaceutical arm, to help reduce debt. Through it all, ratings companies have been extraordinarily patient. While both Moody’s and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings have downgraded GE multiple times since 2016, they continue to view it as an investment-grade company even as many financial metrics have pointed to the contrary. It’s unlikely that they would break with that pattern now, especially because Culp’s turnaround efforts are starting to gain traction. Long term, however, GE’s balance sheet stress puts it at a disadvantage. The company operates in capital-intensive industries with high technological competition and its main rivals aren’t as encumbered by debt. — Brooke Sutherland
Clipped wings at Boeing. The Federal Reserve's bond-buying program opened the credit markets enough for Boeing to launch a jumbo $25 billion debt sale in April. The offering included a provision that promised to increase interest payments with each downgrade into junk, a sign that both bond traders and the company saw a reasonable possibility that Boeing might slip to speculative grade. But however dire Boeing’s finances might look and however ill-advised its strategic decisions may be, the company plays a central role in U.S. national security and is a symbol of the country’s manufacturing might. The federal government would never allow it to go under, so it’s a reasonable bet for bondholders that they will eventually get repaid. The government backstop has its limits, though, and Boeing’s future looks far from rosy. While its 737 Max jet finally won approval to fly again, appetite among airlines for deliveries in the middle of a pandemic is low, and it will take years for Boeing to unwind a stockpile of 450 jets. Free cash flow probably won’t turn positive until 2022. Boeing has said paying down debt will be a top priority once it starts generating cash again. That’s as it should be but leaves little to spend on improving its competitive position relative to top rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY). — Brooke Sutherland
Zombies at 30,000 feet. Pre-pandemic, all of the major U.S. airlines were generating enough operating income to cover their interest expenses. Now they’re all zombies after taking on billions in new debt to cope with a dramatic slump in air travel that’s left them bleeding cash. As travel starts to return, that dynamic should reverse. It may take years, though: the International Air Transport Association doesn’t expect global passenger traffic to recover to last year’s levels until 2024. With some business travel likely gone forever as corporations adapt to virtual interactions, positive vaccine news only helps so much. A combination of government bailouts, the Fed’s bond-buying binge and creative debt maneuvers have helped give the carriers a temporary financial cushion. But additional stimulus spending would give airlines more breathing room. Most airline executives are expecting mergers between international operators, but “if the crisis persists through 2021 and dips its tail into 2022, maybe you'll even see some consolidation domestically, certainly among the second and third-tier airlines in the U.S.,” Mike Leskinen, vice president of corporate development and investor relations at United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc., said at a Bernstein conference this week. — Brooke Sutherland
Zombies at Olive Garden. Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI)., corporate parent of Olive Garden and other restaurant chains, is a zombie now but there’s a good chance it will shed its undead status once the public health crisis wanes. Business was solid before the pandemic snapped a streak of comparable sales growth that went back to fiscal 2015. Local capacity restrictions on restaurant seating will choke its sales growth for as long as they are in place. But the company is finding ways to save by simplifying menus and pulling back on marketing while improving digital capabilities to make takeout orders more seamless. CEO Gene Lee has said that his team believes some takeout orders are being generated at restaurants today by people who show up and can’t get in because the wait is too long. That’s a good sign diners are eager to return to the mecca of unlimited breadsticks as soon as it is safe to do so. — Sarah Halzack 
Zombie Fashion Flops. Macy’s Inc. and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). came into the pandemic on unsteady footing, with consumers fleeing them in favor of off-price chains, fast-fashion retailers and e-commerce rivals. The pandemic has dealt a particularly tough blow to the apparel sector, with demand for new outfits hurt by stay-at-home living. Macy’s still owns plenty of real estate that it could theoretically monetize to pay down debt. Both retailers have committed to closing a broad swath of stores in the next several years, which should help reduce costs. But these chains have fallen into sales holes this year, and it will be extremely difficult to recover. Gap’s sales in fiscal 2020 may be the lowest in two decades, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Macy’s revenue could be the lowest since 2004 – before Federated Department Stores acquired May Department Stores and made the company that is now called Macy’s a much larger entity. Given their already-tenuous grip on shoppers, I suspect Gap and Macy’s will have a harder time winning back customers than some of their apparel industry peers. That’s a scary prospect, even for zombies. — Sarah Halzack

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Retailers are eager to hire - if you're a digital whizz,"By Sonya Dowsett, Melissa Fares and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
MADRID/NEW YORK/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Are you a ""user-experience"" gun for hire? Well, your time has come.
Even as retailers lay off hundreds of thousands of workers globally in response to the pandemic, they are seeking to capitalise on a consumer rush online. 
They are recruiting e-commerce experts to help maximise sales, as some brands like Ralph Lauren (N:RL) and  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) launch more ambitious online plans to simulate the physical shopping experience, such as 3D-effect virtual stores.
U.S. digital recruiter Ecommercejobs.com has seen inquiries increase by around 30% since the start of the pandemic, president Harry Joiner said. London-based 24 Seven Inc is also fielding more searches for online retail experts since March, according to European general manager Peter Geary.
There is heavy demand for specialists who look at shopper data and feedback and scrape social media for trends, to figure out consumers' loves and hates, and how to make store and brand websites ""stickier"". 
These skills have become more important as retailers lose face-to-face interaction with shoppers during the pandemic. 
""A user-experience person will get up to 600 pounds ($800) a day in London,"" Geary said. ""They are highly sought-after."" 
In the United States, average salaries for ""Head of User Experience"" come in at over $150,000 per year, according to Glass Door, with e-commerce directors paid over $130,000. 
Digital marketers who know how to maximise sales through third-party sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and can drive products up searches, are also in demand, according to recruiters. Retailers are turning to these platforms to broaden their reach.
""Knowing how to sell on Amazon is a much bigger deal than it used to be,"" said Joiner of Ecommercejobs.com.
Despite this specialist digital recruitment, the jobs news in the industry is bleak.
Nearly half a million U.S. retail employees have lost their jobs since February, with the apparel sector accounting for the bulk of losses. In the European Union, over 400,000 jobs in retail were lost in the three months from end-March to end-June.
LOOKS GOOD ON VIRTUAL YOU
Danish jeweller Pandora told Reuters it had 120 specialists working in a ""digital hub"" near its Copenhagen HQ, 80 of whom were hired this year, and said it was looking to hire more.
The company's website offers a feature where some products like rings and bracelets have a ""try it on"" button. Customers can see the item on a photo of a model's hand, or can upload a photo of their own hand to see what it looks like on them.
Ralph Lauren's online version of its Beverly Hills flagship store lets you move around a 3D simulation of the real thing. You can click on items hanging on racks or on shelves to find descriptions, pricing and availability.
The fashion company, which said in September it would cut its workforce by 15%, plans to roll out virtual versions of its stores in New York, Paris and Hong Kong in coming weeks.
In New York, Saks Fifth Avenue will live-stream the unveiling of its holiday windows and its traditional light show and is urging customers to watch the show from home. 
CRITICAL HOLIDAY SEASON
The pandemic and lockdowns have dramatically changed consumer behaviour, and the shifts could be long-lasting.
Average monthly visits to the top 10 global shopping sites from March to October were 6.9% higher than a year before, with nearly 451 million additional visits, according to SimilarWeb. 
The upcoming period from Thanksgiving to Christmas is critical because it can account for as much as 30% of a clothing retailer's annual sales and half of toy sales, according to research firm NPD Group.
An online spike could pose technical problems though. 
Last year, Costco (O:COST) and Nordstrom (N:JWN) had website crashes around Black Friday in the United States at the end of November. J Crew and Lululemon (O:LULU) experienced glitches in 2018, such as shoppers not being able to complete orders.
None of these retailers responded to questions as to whether they were taking extra measures this year to ensure robust systems.
The new consumer reality could also present headaches for industry analysts who are usually on the lookout for early signs to gauge the winners and losers of the holiday season.
Some have long sought to size up how well stores converted visits to sales, for example, by counting the number of cars in parking lots or the number of shoppers in its stores, and then seeing how many people exited with bags in their hands.  
Not so useful in a lockdown economy.
""Traditional reads were based on store mostly, and additional online sales,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief retail industry adviser based in the U.S. ""This year, it is the other way around.""

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>","Investors rush to buy equities, dump gold in vaccine euphoria","LONDON (Reuters) - Investors stormed into riskier assets last week, pumping $27 billion into equity funds as positive COVID-19 vaccine updates led to euphoric buying of shares in worst-hit sectors such as banks, travel and leisure, and oil, BofA said on Friday.
Citing data from EPFR, the bank said inflows into global stocks in the last two weeks soared to $71.4 billion, the biggest ever. The flows were led by U.S. and emerging market stocks.
Still, investors were not ready to pull the plug on high-flying technology stocks, which saw $2.4 billion inflows last week. BofA said the feedback was ""we're on it (the rotation to value stocks), but we ain't selling tech"".
Value stocks, typically companies that are more sensitive to economic cycles, have been soaring since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s announcement earlier this month of positive data from its vaccine trial, raising hopes of an economic recovery.
BofA said it expected 2021 to be the ""year of vaccine"", leading to outperformance of value stocks versus growth stocks, high-yield debt versus investment-grade debt, emerging markets versus S&P 500 and small cap versus large cap.
The risk-on moves last week prompted investors to pull $4 billion from gold, the biggest outflow ever. The yellow metal is poised to finish 2020 with the best annual performance since 2010.
The bank, however, advised clients to ""sell the vaccine news"".
""We say credit and equity prices (are) to peak in coming months on peak positioning, peak policy, peak profits as optimism tops ahead of vaccine distribution.""
Major banks have upgraded their stock market forecasts for 2021 in recent days, expecting double-digit returns on European U.S. and European stock indexes.
""With both fiscal and monetary policy still highly accommodative, a sharp rebound in company earnings will drive equity returns,"" said Jeroen Blokland, a portfolio manager at Robeco.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler, PSA merger to include investor loyalty scheme","By Agnieszka Flak and Nick Carey
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler's merger with Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA will include a loyalty scheme to reward long-term investors and help prevent future takeover attempts, the prospectus for the planned tie-up shows. 
Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and France's PSA agreed to combine in a $38 billion all-share deal in December, uniting brands such as Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Maserati with the likes of Peugeot, Opel, Citroen and DS. 
Holders of shares in Stellantis - as the merged group will be known - for an uninterrupted period of at least three years may receive a special voting share in addition to each common share, the companies said in the prospectus.
Such a move could make management changes and takeover attempts of Stellantis more difficult, they added. The tax consequences of the loyalty scheme are uncertain, the companies said.
Stellantis will have a Dutch-domiciled parent company and its shares will be listed in Paris, Milan and New York.
Loyalty schemes are common for companies in the Netherlands and have already been used by Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family and FCA's controlling shareholder, not least during the spin-off of Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), boosting Exor's grip on the luxury sports car maker. 
PSA CEO Carlos Tavares will run Stellantis and will receive a 1.7 million euro ($2.02 million) bonus upon completion of the merger.
FCA CEO Mike Manley will receive ""a recognition award with a value equivalent to approximately five times his annual base salary"" and a cash retention after the merger if certain conditions are met.
The two companies said they have agreed to review the potential distribution of 1 billion euros to shareholders, either through a dividend evenly before the merger, or to be distributed afterwards by Stellantis.
PSA and FCA have filed the merger plan with antitrust authorities in 21 countries and the European Union. To date, they have obtained approval from 15 countries and a preliminary okay from Brazil which becomes final next week. 
The EU is also expected to authorise the merger, sources have said.

1133,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>","Tesla’s S&P 500 Debut May Spark $8 Billion Demand, Goldman Says","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s already impressive stock market rally might be on the verge of a further massive boost.
The electric carmaker’s scheduled Dec. 21 inclusion in the S&P 500 Index could result in $8 billion of demand from active U.S. large-cap mutual funds, analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). wrote in a note on Friday.
“Of the 189 large-cap core funds in our universe, 157 funds that manage around $500 billion in assets under management did not hold Tesla on Sept. 30,” the analysts wrote. Assuming those funds chose to hold the carmaker at benchmark weight, they would need to buy $8 billion of the stock, or about 2% of Tesla’s market value, the analysts said.
The shares were 0.5% lower U.S. pre-market trading, but set for a 22% weekly gain after Thursday’s all-time high. Tesla is the best-performing large-cap stock in the U.S. this year, soaring about 500%, as investors show increasing confidence that electric cars, trucks and buses will dominate the future of the auto and transportation industries.
As Tesla’s market value burgeons, the Palo Alto-based company is also winning over some long-term skeptics.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts this week gave Tesla an overweight rating for the first time in more than three years, predicting that Elon Musk’s firm is on the verge of a “profound model shift” from selling cars to generating high-margin software and services revenue."

1135,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 05:24AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Surge, Schmurge: The Rotation Trade Is Intact","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Anyone reading the markets news this week could be forgiven a bit of confusion. The tug-of-war between the promise of victory over Covid-19 and the grim present reality of tightening lockdowns and soaring case numbers has become truly intense. 
However, at the end of a choppy week, it's possible to say that the optimists - those willing to trade on the likelihood of vaccines crushing the pandemic next year - are winning. A look at the sectoral performance of the various Stoxx indices this week bears this out. 
The best performing sectors over the past week have been oil and gas, banks and autos: all highly cyclical and all massive underperformers for the eight months that led up to the breakthrough announcement by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech about the efficacy of their vaccine.  Pharma, tech and food and drink, the outperformers of the last eight months, all lagged.
Over the last week, the benchmark Stoxx 600 has gained 1.2%. The STOXX 600 Oil & Gas index, meanwhile, has put on 5.3% and is now up 22% over the last month. It's the same story in banks, where the corresponding index is up 3.9% on the week and 25% on the month. The Stoxx 600 Autos & Parts index is up 4.6% and 15.2% for the week and month, respectively. 
In each of those sectors, there have been stories that speak of a fundamental change for the better: Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), the industry benchmark, announced a new dividend policy that aimed to restore the trust of those burned by its first dividend cut in decades, Spanish bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) has agreed one deal (the sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC)) and entered talks into another (to merge with smaller rival Banco Sabadell (MC:SABE)), proving that trapped value can be unlocked (although some might wonder about the wisdom of how BBVA is using that windfall); Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and BMW (DE:BMWG) have both reported quarterly results well ahead of expectations, as the rebound in the Chinese market has reassured many that underlying demand for automobiles is as strong as ever. 
The key question, however, is whether these gains can be sustained. For every positive story this week there have been a couple of negative ones. For oil companies, the dramatic spread of Covid-19 is feeding through into slower demand for oil and gas in the short term, putting pressure on the OPEC+ agreement that is propping up crude prices. Every American who heeds the Center for Disease Control's call not to travel home for Thanksgiving will pressure it further. And short-term demand problems have been accompanied by long-term ones too, with the U.K. and China both accelerating their timetables for making the shift to electric mobility. That's a challenge, too, for a European auto sector that still needs to retool for the electric age - and to find a way of bringing EV prices down to a level where they can realistically be bought by average people. 
For banks, meanwhile, any thought that a recovery next year could lead to a steeper yield curve and better profit margins was quickly squashed by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who said the vaccine news ""isn't a game-changer"" for her and repeated her intention to push through a major easing of monetary policy next month. The best that can be hoped for is that the extra stimulus will keep the bad loan burden down next year by preventing more bankruptcies. 
It's not hard to see this process continuing for the near future. In Europe's four biggest markets and many of its smaller ones, virus numbers still look likely to get worse before they get better. Yet the rhythm of pharmaceutical companies completing their various vaccine tests and pushing their drugs through the approval process is also likely to pick up (note AstraZeneca's (LON:AZN) positive update from its Stage 2 trial this week). That will increase the options available to public health systems and alleviate concerns about availability and distribution bottlenecks.
In short, it looks like two-steps-forward-one-step-back for the next few weeks. But that is still better than the Danse Macabre that has been 2020 so far."

(Reuters) - European stocks edged higher on Friday as gains in commodity and retail shares offset worries about U.S. politics and an impasse over fresh stimulus measures to support a pandemic-stricken global economy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.4% and was on track for marginal weekly gain after signs of progress on COVID-19 vaccine pushed the index to February highs earlier this week.
Energy stocks were among the top gainers as oil prices steadied, putting them on course for a third straight weekly rise on prospects of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. Miners also jumped over 1% on stronger metal prices. 
Global mood remained subdued after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said key pandemic lending programs at the Federal Reserve would expire on Dec. 31, putting the outgoing Trump administration at odds with the central bank.
""European markets are a bit fatigued with 2020,"" said Keith Temperton, a sales trader at Forte Securities. ""Any more upside will come only when physical cash enters markets through stimulus measures."" 
The benchmark STOXX 600 has gained nearly 40% from its March lows on the back of stimulus measures and hopes of a vaccine, but is still 10% below its all-time high. 
UK's FTSE 100 found some support as retail sales bounced in October and British health minister said there were encouraging signs that virus cases were starting to flatten.
The retail index rose 0.9% and was among the top gainers. 
German fashion e-tailer Zalando rose 1.4% after its chief financial officer forecast an acceleration in growth next year.

1137,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Only the Best London Offices Thrive in an Emerging Covid Divide,"(Bloomberg) -- The best new office buildings in London are commanding near record rents and prices during the pandemic; everything else, not so much.
The divide is unfolding as the slump in economic activity damps development, helping the most prestigious buildings achieve high rents and lure yield-hungry investors. At the same time, companies are dumping space they no longer need with workers still cocooned at home, which is weighing on values for anything but fresh buildings that boast top green credentials and first-class amenities.
The split can be seen from the City of London to the West End and beyond. Just this week,  British Land  Company PLC (LON:BLND) sold its Clarges office and luxury-apartment development overlooking Green Park in upscale Mayfair, at a price more than 7% above its valuation. Yet the landlord’s overall office values declined by 3.1% in the six months through September as vacancy rates rose across the city.
“With so much uncertainty, it is very natural to see a flight to quality and have investors flee to what they perceive to be the best new offices,” Dror Poleg, author of “Rethinking Real Estate,” said by phone. “Unfortunately, I don’t think we know yet what the best is going to be post-pandemic.”
The Clarges sale is one of a handful of eye-catching deals in an otherwise grim year for London real estate investment. Investors spent about 4.1 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) on London offices in the nine months through September, a drop of almost 45% from a year earlier, according to a report from broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.
With Brexit looming, developers were already taking a cautious approach to new projects even before the outbreak. That means companies seeking large new offices will have little to choose from in the next few years, particularly the cutting-edge buildings that could help lure employees back to the city center when the virus subsides.
This shortage of supply has helped spur a slew of big leasing deals by companies including Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and law firm Latham & Watkins. Yet new leases overall were down 60% in the first nine months of the year, according to the Jones Lang LaSalle report. The average rent on the best new offices has risen by 12% since the onset of the pandemic in March, while declining by 9% for second-hand space, the broker’s data show.
This divergence is encouraging some developers to start new projects despite the gloomy economic outlook. British Land has decided to start work on a new office-led development in London’s trendy Spitalfields district.  Derwent London  PLC (LON:DLN) confirmed earlier this month it would push ahead with a large project on Baker Street.
Central London will see a “bifurcation of demand” after the pandemic,  Land Securities  Group Plc (LON:LAND) Chief Executive Officer Mark Allan said earlier this month.
“We will see occupiers prioritize wellbeing, sustainability, adaptability, quality in their office space as they look to evolve the role the office plays for them in their organization and culture,” he said. “We expect that to lead to an acceleration in obsolescence in some of the more secondary, older offices within the London market, which ought to yield development opportunities.”

1138,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",Aberdeen Bets Indonesia Stocks Will Top Regional Peers Next Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesian equities should beat their Southeast Asian peers next year as the region’s battered stock markets recover from the hit they have suffered in 2020 from the coronavirus pandemic, according to Aberdeen Standard Investments.
The Jakarta Composite Index has rebounded some 40% from its March low but is still down about 12% this year. That puts it roughly tied with benchmarks in Singapore and Thailand in the ranking of Asia’s worst performers.
With global investors rotating into economically sensitive value stocks, Indonesia’s rally could gather steam. The country is home to some of the region’s largest financial stocks, and these should lead help lead gains, followed by shares of materials and automotive companies, said Bharat Joshi, an investment director at Aberdeen in Jakarta.
“Indonesia has plenty of cyclical names. With animal spirits returning to Asia following the positive vaccine news, Indonesia will likely outperform its neighbors,” Joshi wrote in a text message. His Aberdeen Standard Indonesia Equity Fund is down 4.6% this year, outperforming the local benchmark and 90% of its peers.
Household consumption accounts for more than half of Indonesia’s gross domestic product, which shrank 3.49% in the third quarter, pushing the country into its first recession in more than two decades. But that contraction in the nation’s economy, Southeast Asia’s largest, was smaller than the 5.32% decline it recorded in the previous three months. The third-quarter decline was also less severe than contractions in Indonesia’s export-dependent Southeast Asian neighbors.
Consumers remain cautious, however, as total virus infections have doubled in the past two months to 480,000. Retail sales in the world’s fourth-most-populous nation fell 8.7% in September, though the decline had narrowed for the fourth-straight month, according to a central bank survey.
Joshi said rising commodity prices as well as the government’s social assistance programs should help improve consumer sentiment, which, in turn, should help boost corporate fundamentals and share prices.
“As we enter 2021, we remain bullish on financials, materials and cyclical stocks which are expected to see revenue and margin improvement following a weak and smaller base in 2020,” he said."

The so-called pre-emptive rights were eased in March to speed up capital-raising for companies hit by COVID-19 and facing Britain's worst downturn in 300 years.
""Market activity over the past eight months has shown that investors were clearly in favour of companies having access to the capital they needed quickly to maintain their solvency during this unprecedented economic downturn,"" FRC-based Pre-Emption Group (PEG) said in a statement.
The relaxation in pre-emption rights will not be extended beyond the end of November, PEG said.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Friday, as investors look for more stimulus, despite conflicting reports in the U.S., as the surge in the number of coronavirus cases threatens the global economic recovery.
At 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.4%.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced plans late Thursday to let several of the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending programs expire on December 31, seeking the re-appropriation of some $455 billion allocated earlier in the year.
While this was the first serious sign of discord between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve during the Covid-19 pandemic, investors have reacted calmly, seeing the move as politicking with the programs likely to be restored under the new administration. 
Helping the tone was the news overnight that Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had agreed to revive talks to craft a new fiscal relief package.
Back in Europe, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde promised a forceful monetary stimulus package for December, while speaking to a European Parliament committee Thursday. 
Additional aid is needed as the surge in coronavirus cases throughout Europe and the U.S. has resulted in the imposition of many new restrictions. Although Britain’s health minister said there were encouraging signs that the virus curve is starting to flatten, in the U.S. the state of California has just imposed a new curfew to curb the increase in infections and the Center for Disease Control urged Americans not to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday.
There was also some positive economic news Friday, as U.K. retail sales climbed 1.2% in October on the month, the country’s consumers proving more resilient than expected.
In corporate news, Sage (LON:SGE) stock fell over 10% after the U.K.-based software company’s profit dipped following a Cloud investment, while AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock climbed 1% after the pharma giant’s cancer treatment Imfinzi got U.S. approval for less frequent, fixed-dose usage.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, continuing a largely positive week on growing hopes that OPEC+ producers will freeze their output at current levels for at least another three months when they meet at the end of November.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $42.07 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $44.42 a barrel, both remaining well above the $40 mark after the gains earlier in the week on the back of vaccine optimism.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU could pay over $10 billion for Pfizer and CureVac vaccines - source,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union could pay more than $10 billion to secure hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine candidates being developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and CureVac, an EU official involved in the talks told Reuters.
The bloc has agreed to pay 15.50 euros ($18.34) per dose for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate being developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech, according to the official. 
That would mean an overall price of up to 3.1 billion euros ($3.7 billion) for 200 million doses, rising to 4.65 billion euros if another optional 100 million doses are purchased under the deal, the official said.
The pricing information, previously undisclosed, confirms the EU is paying less per dose than the United States for an initial supply of that vaccine, as reported by Reuters last week.
The deal includes an insurance for EU countries to get compensation if the companies divert doses to the United States, according to the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
The EU has separately agreed to pay 10 euros ($11.84) per dose for an initial supply of 225 million doses of the vaccine candidate from CureVac, a discount from the 12 euros the company set as the price for the shot, the official said.
The bloc struck the deal with CureVac this week to secure the supply of up to 405 million doses, of which 180 million are optional. 
The official said CureVac had committed to starting deliveries by the end of March. It is unclear whether the additional 180 million doses would cost 10 or 12 euros each. Under the 10-euro price, though, the bloc would pay 4.05 billion euros for 405 million doses.
A spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc's executive body, declined to comment on terms and pricing of vaccine contracts because they are confidential.
Germany's BioNTech and CureVac declined to comment.
U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said it and BioNTech were using a tiered pricing formula based on volume and delivery dates and that the EU deal represented the largest initial order of its vaccine candidate to date. 
""We are not disclosing further details of this agreement,"" it added.
AMERICAN PRICE
Pfizer and BioNTech said on Wednesday that final data showed their shot was 95% effective against COVID-19, and that they could start distributing shots before Christmas should they secure emergency authorisations.. 
In July the U.S. government agreed with Pfizer to pay $19.5 per dose for 100 million, with an option to buy a further 500 million under terms to be negotiated separately.
The lower price partly reflects the financial support given by the European Union to BioNTech for the drug's development, a second EU official told Reuters last week.
Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and CureVac candidates are based on new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and designed to be administered in two doses. That means, for the EU's Pfizer shot, it would cost 31 euros to inoculate one person. 
To secure the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the EU has made a non-refundable down payment. The amount has not been disclosed, but the official said the bloc had paid 700 million euros to the companies.
The agreed price of 15.50 euros per dose would only be paid by those European governments willing to buy the shot, and only if it is approved by the EU regulator as safe and effective. 
In a sign of the global race to secure vaccines, the EU required Pfizer and BioNTech to accept a ""breach of contract clause"" if they diverted doses to the United States, the source said.

In that eventuality, EU states would be reimbursed 50% of the money they had paid, the official said. This clause was requested by the EU, the official added, despite the companies planning to produce the doses for Europe in Belgium and Germany.

Perdue became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower in mid-January 2019, which plays a key role in determining spending on the Navy. 
In the six weeks before he took the panel's helm, Senate financial records show that Perdue accumulated between $32,000 and $305,000 worth of stock in BWX Technologies Inc (N:BWXT), a supplier of nuclear components for Navy submarines and aircraft carriers. 
The lawmaker then sold BWX stock from Feb. 26 to July 9, 2019, and reported earning between $15,000 and $50,000 from the investment for that year. 
Between December 2018 and and July 9, 2019, BWX stock rose from less than $42 per share to nearly $53 on the New York Stock Exchange, the records show. 
Perdue's transactions in BWX were first reported by The Daily Beast on Wednesday. 
In response to inquiries from The Daily Beast about this activity, Perdue's office referenced past scrutiny of the senator's stock trading, insisting that he does not have anything to do with his investment portfolio.
Perdue's Senate office and campaign did not respond to Reuters queries seeking comment. 
A BWX spokesman said the company does not control purchases of its stock by individuals and was unaware of Perdue's transactions.

Perdue faces Democrat Jon Ossoff in a Jan. 5 runoff election that will help determine whether Democrats or Republicans win control of the Senate.

1149,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 09:38PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, Even as Treasury-Fed Spat Grows","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, despite the growing dispute between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the Federal Reserve over funds earmarked to help businesses, nonprofits and local governments overcome the COVID-19 impact.
In a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, delivered after markets closed on Thursday, Mnuchin sought to end the central bank’s relief programs by requesting the re-appropriation of some $455 billion allocated to Treasury under the CARES Act earlier in the year.
The move could see these programs, viewed as vital to economic stability, end by Dec. 31.
“The White House wants to pull the unused portions back so Congress can spend the money elsewhere, while the Fed is pushing back … indeed, this does not help the push-pull tug of war around short-term versus long-term markets narrative at a time when it is important that all levels of government, including the Fed, at least put up the pretense of a unified front,” Axi global chief market strategist Stephen Innes told Reuters.
U.S. shares had rallied before Mnuchin’s announcement, after Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had agreed to revive negotiations to craft “a real good COVID-19 relief bill."" A mid-afternoon meeting on Thursday among congressional aides reportedly discussed efforts to pass a $1.4 trillion bill to keep government agencies operating beyond Dec. 11, when current funding is set to expire.
“A meaningful stimulus package will aid small companies, the underlying economy, as well as the unemployed and people most at need … and there might be less of an inclination for cities to shut down,” Great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes told Reuters.
Although the news saw U.S. shares tumble, Asia continued to avoid big moves.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 were down 0.71% by 10:30 PM ET (2:30 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.03%, even as Prime Minister Chung Sye Kyun urged citizens to stay home and cancel gatherings after new COVID-19 daily cases exceeded 300 for a third day.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.19% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.25%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.04% while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.17%.
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases continues an incessant rise globally. U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations jumped nearly 50% during the last two weeks, with lockdowns in some cities and states threatening the U.S economic recovery. Data released on Thursday showed 742,000 U.S. jobless claims for the week, above the 707,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous week’s 711,000 claims.
The International Monetary Fund and Group of 20 nations also issued a warning that the fresh restrictions on households and companies due to the resurgence of COVID-19 globally is a risk to the economic recovery.
President-elect Joe Biden expressed frustration at incumbent President Donald Trump’s administration, which has been un-cooperative in the transition process leading up to the inauguration ceremony. The lack of help has hindered his team’s ability to get accurate COVID-19 data, Biden said.
However, some investors warned of continued volatility ahead.
“There’s the push-pull of short-term versus long-term and that’s what investors are looking at right now … there are some very serious risks in the short term, especially with the lockdowns,” TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney told Bloomberg."

The COVID-19 crisis has weakened one of the core elements of the airline playbook: price many fares attractively low, then charge for ticket changes. American Airlines (O:AAL) said it will eliminate change fees for first class, business class, premium economy and main cabin tickets for all long-haul international flying, if the travel originates in North or South America. 
United said it will announce an extension of its change fee waiver for basic economy and international tickets later this year ""to continue to offer more flexibility to all customers who travel with us.""

Chicago-based United is among the major U.S. airlines that began implementing temporary waivers of change fees this year, given the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus crisis. Earlier, both airlines said they had seen an uptick in decrease in bookings due to a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in the United States.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>",Kids gaming platform Roblox faces hurdles ahead of public listing: rough words,"By Munsif Vengattil and Joseph Menn
BANGALORE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Profanities and other offensive content that basic word-filtering tools are designed to catch can be found in some game titles and user profiles on children's gaming platform Roblox, searches of the website show, despite the company's ""no tolerance"" policy and assurances it has safeguards to enforce it.
Powered by user-created games, Roblox filed late Thursday for a multibillion-dollar stock market debut, riding the lockdown entertainment boom with its appeal as a place for safe fun and interactions for the youngest gamers.
But parenting groups and investors alike said they were concerned about whether the company's automated systems to moderate content can effectively delete potentially offensive language and images that pop up on the platform.
Simple Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) keyword searches of its site - conducted twice by Reuters since the company announced its stock market plans in October - turned up more than 100 examples of abusive language or imagery. One profile, for example, included ""shut up and rape me daddy"" in the profile description line, while another had ""MOLESTINGKIDSISFUNTOME."" 
In response to written questions, company spokeswoman Teresa Brewer said in a statement that Roblox ""has no tolerance for inappropriate content, which is why we have a stringent safety system, including proprietary text filtering technology, third-party machine learning solutions, and customized rules on what to block, which we update daily."" 
Last month, Roblox removed the examples within hours of Reuters sharing them with the company. Roblox has said it has 1,600 people working full time to eliminate inappropriate content on the platform.
In the stock registration filed after this story was published, the company acknowledged that ""from time to time inappropriate content is successfully uploaded onto our platform and can be viewed by others prior to being identified and removed by us"" and was a ""risk factor.""
""This content could cause harm to our audience and to our reputation of providing a safe environment,"" the company wrote of the former concern.
""If we are unable to prevent, or are perceived as not being able to sufficiently prevent, all or substantially all inappropriate content from appearing on our platform...[that] would likely result in significantly reduced revenue, bookings, profitability, and ultimately, our ability to continue to successfully operate our platform.""
Roblox offers account controls for parents to restrict how their kids can interact with others on the site. It also lets parents limit the child to a curated list of games vetted for kids under the age of 13. Reuters did not find any inappropriate content on such games.
All sites that rely on users to create material must grapple with how much effort to expend policing that content, and even if that is enormous, there could still be inappropriate posts. Unlike Twitter (N:TWTR) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which publish quarterly transparency reports about the types and volumes of purged content, Roblox does not provide such data. That makes it difficult to tell how common it is.
Roblox is a free platform which offers millions of games, many of them created by its own young users through a simple programming tool that the company provides. It has been credited with developing kids' logic and creativity. Like  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) Minecraft, Roblox allows users to create and share 3D gaming content via simple tools and send messages to others.
The simplicity of many Roblox games stands in contrast to popular videogame hits like Fortnite or Apex Legends, which depict killing competitions and target teens. Roblox adviser Larry Magid said that three quarters of U.S. children between nine and 12 used the platform. 
Reuters picked about 20 words commonly considered offensive and looked for them using the site's own search tool, and also through Google's system for searching within a specific site. Roblox's tool revealed no hits, because filters were preventing users from actively looking for problematic content while playing Roblox games. However, the Google search showed that kids could see the problematic profiles and descriptions in a variety of ways, including through friend invitations and group activities.
Most of the examples Reuters found on Roblox included deliberate misspelling of obscenities, or the n-word, which industry veterans say should not make it past standard filtering software. 
NBC reported last year that it found neo-Nazi and racist profiles on the site, which Roblox later removed.
Yet early this year, an industry expert who asked not to be named, sent Roblox head of safety Remy Malan a dozen examples of games with racial slurs or the word ""Jew"" in the title, including some with concentration camp uniforms or other imagery, according to screen shots of the email seen by Reuters.
The examples were confirmed by Reuters and dated as far back as 2009. Some of them were deleted after Reuters described them to Roblox in October. Malan did not respond to the expert or to a Reuters request for comment.
Tech and entertainment watchdog Common Sense Media has lifted its suggested age for Roblox players to 13 years old over the last few years, after abusive language in profiles and sexual content in games kept appearing on Roblox after the company said it would remove it, according to Jeff Haynes, who oversees video gaming coverage for the nonprofit.
Five online safety experts who reviewed the examples found by Reuters said they were surprised such profiles and wording managed to slip through when rudimentary filtering systems can catch and remove such content. 
Magid, a Roblox advisor and CEO of the nonprofit ConnectSafely.org - which takes funding from Roblox and other companies to promote safety guidelines for parents - said the examples Reuters had found showed the safeguards did not fully work.
""I think scale is part of it. What I don't understand is why the software didn't pick it up,"" he told Reuters. 
As its stock listing draws near, the company could come under closer public scrutiny from Wall Street, said John Streur, chief executive of Calvert Research and Management, which focuses on socially responsible investing.

""From an investor perspective, it will be a major problem if the headlines months from now reveal that the company is unable to manage the risk of its platform,"" Streur told Reuters. Roblox declined to respond to comment on that view.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>","Asia overtakes United States in corporate climate disclosure, Arabesque says","LONDON (Reuters) - European companies are the leaders in corporate disclosure on greenhouse gas emissions but Asia overtook the United States to claim second place in 2019, according to an analysis of more than 2,000 of the largest companies by Arabesque.
The goal of capping the rise in average global temperatures at 1.5C, as enshrined in the 2015 Paris climate accords, is almost certainly out of reach unless greenhouse gas emissions rates fall sharply in the biggest economies.
Arabesque, an ESG research and asset manager headquartered in Frankfurt, found that the quantity and quality of global corporate emissions data disclosure had risen between 2014 and 2019 but was uneven across major regions.
""The rate of disclosure has not been consistent across regions, and has been led by Europe,"" it said.
""What is more surprising is the recent change in second place from the USA to Asia in 2019. This is driven both by a decrease in disclosures from the USA and an increase in disclosures from Asia,"" it added.
The increase in emissions disclosure was led by companies in Japan, India, Singapore and Malaysia. In the United States, there was a decrease in the scope of corporate emissions data disclosure.
""There is still a lot of disclosure to be done in carbon data - and we are still far from where we should be,"" Andreas Feiner, CEO of Arabesque S-Ray, told Reuters. ""There are a lot of companies that are not in line with the Paris goals.""
President-elect Joe Biden has promised sweeping measures to make the U.S. economy carbon-neutral by 2050 to put the United States on a path to cut emissions as deeply as scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
The bid to reverse President Donald Trump's legacy of climate deregulation would likely start with some easy wins, such as rejoining the Paris Agreement.
""I expect the U.S. to take big big steps,"" said Feiner, adding that he expected Biden to make significant moves towards tackling emissions in the world's largest economy.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>",Wall Street closes higher as new stimulus talks ease shutdown worries,"By Stephen Culp
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended in positive territory on Thursday as fresh stimulus hopes buoyed investor sentiment toward the end of a session fraught with worries over mounting shutdowns and layoffs linked to spiraling COVID-19 infection rates.
All three major stock indexes got a healthy boost after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had agreed to revive talks to craft a new fiscal relief package.
""We've seen this playbook before, where investors flock to the safety of tech and growth when the economy shows signs of slowing down,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""But everything changes now that there's hope of the next stimulus plan."" 
""Clearly markets are bouncing on that optimism."" 
Even so, spiraling COVID-19 infection rates turned investors toward market-leading growth stocks that have shown resiliency to the pandemic. 
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX), which thrived throughout the health crisis, handily outperformed the broader market, rising 1.6%.
""In a COVID world, semis are a safer play as they're not impacted as much due to shutdowns,"" Detrick added.
The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, the data painting a grim picture of increasingly elevated layoffs as spiking coronavirus cases and subsequent shutdowns continue to hobble the labor market. 
Record infection numbers have caused COVID hospitalizations to soar by 50% and have prompted schools and businesses to close once again, thwarting the recovery of the world's largest economy from the deepest recession since the Great Depression.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 44.81 points, or 0.15%, to 29,483.23, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 14.08 points, or 0.39%, to 3,581.87 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 103.11 points, or 0.87%, to 11,904.71.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, energy (SPNY) and tech shares (SPLRCT) gained the most, while utilities (SPLRCU) and healthcare (SPXHC) were the only percentage losers.
Third-quarter reporting season is nearing the finish line, with 472 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 84.5% have beaten consensus, according to Refinitiv data.
Macy's Inc (N:M) reported a 20% plunge in quarterly same-store sales and the department store forecast a tough holiday season.
Chipmaker  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) forecast a slight dip in data center chip sales but the company beat quarterly revenue expectations.
L Brands Inc (N:LB) surged 17.7% after posting better-than-expected quarterly results and a 56% jump in same-store sales.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares rose for the third straight session to touch a record high, riding the wave of its pending inclusion in the S&P 500, announced on Monday.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.80-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 87 new highs and 10 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.94 billion shares, compared with the 10.55 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>",Tesla surge adds to dominance of S&P 500's biggest players,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) extended its rally on Thursday ahead of its December debut in the S&P 500 (SPX), with its market value nearing $500 billion, highlighting the growing domination of mega-cap growth stocks within Wall Street's main benchmark.
The California company's stock rose 2.6% and is up over 20% since S&P Dow Jones Indices announced on Monday it would add Tesla to the index as of Dec. 21, a change that will force index funds to buy around $50 billion of its stock.
The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated cloud computing, online shopping and other trends that have helped the largest U.S. companies, including Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), extend their leads over smaller rivals, driving their shares higher and increasing their already-massive influence within stock indexes. 
""The rapid changes in the economy have accelerated concentration at the top,"" said S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt. ""These companies prospered and grew even bigger, so we now have these haves and have-nots.""
Up about 500% in 2020, Tesla has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors Co (N:GM).
""Tesla is emblematic of a business that has changed dramatically because of technology,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, which owns shares of Tesla. 
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 after Tesla's debut - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/TESLA/qmypmxxnmvr/chart.png)
Now worth $470 billion, Tesla will increase the concentration of heavyweight companies within the S&P 500. It will be the seventh-most valuable company within the index, just behind Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) and ahead of  Visa Inc  (N:V), according to Refinitiv data. At its current value, Tesla is about five times more valuable than GM and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) combined.
(GRAPHIC: Tesla in the S&P 500: small profits in a big pond - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/TESLA/xlbpgzznyvq/chart.png)
Still, today's domination of Wall Street by a handful of companies is not unique. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple now make up about 20% of the S&P 500. In 1976,  IBM  (N:IBM), AT&T Inc (N:T), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and GM accounted for the same proportion of the index, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Volume in Tesla call options has also climbed this week. The buying spree and subsequent hedging from dealers could drive up Tesla shares further when November options expire on Friday, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
(GRAPHIC: Then and now: The S&P 500's largest players - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/TESLA/jbyprexkwve/chart.png)
About a fifth of Tesla's shares are closely held by Chief Executive Elon Musk and other insiders, and since the S&P 500 is weighted by the amount of companies' shares actually available on the stock market, Tesla's influence within the benchmark will be slightly diminished, putting it in eighth place, just behind Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), and equivalent to just over 1% of the index.
Traders skeptical of Tesla's rally have made it Wall Street's most shorted stock, and those short sellers are down a combined $4 billion in four days, according to financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners. 
Surging Big Tech stocks have played a major part in the S&P 500's bull markets in recent years, and investors continue favoring them even as some worry that a potential turn away from their high valuations could hurt the broader market. 

""These companies are where all the growth is. But I'm sure eventually we will see new entrants that will create value and represent a headwind to some of these businesses,"" Martin said.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",BuzzFeed acquires news website HuffPost from Verizon Media,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - BuzzFeed on Thursday bought news website HuffPost from  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) in the latest sign of consolidation in the online media world.
The deal brings two once-hot digital properties - viewed as the future of news media but which have suffered from competition for ad dollars from Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google and Facebook (O:FB) - under the control of one of HuffPost's co-founders.
Verizon, which also owns Yahoo and TechCrunch, said it will invest in the new combined company and take a minority stake.
The companies will syndicate content across each other's platforms, explore monetization opportunities and leverage ad formats, the companies said in a statement. 
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
In an interview, BuzzFeed Chief Executive Officer Jonah Peretti, who co-founded the Huffington Post in 2005, said he was attracted to the property's more affluent and age-diverse audience which ""enhanced the size and scale of our media network.""
Verizon has struggled to grow its media properties, declaring them nearly worthless with a $4.6 billion write-down in 2018. Last year it sold blogging platform Tumblr for an undisclosed sum. It also tested the market for potential buyers of Yahoo Finance, according to Reuters reporting, but ultimately ended that search. 
Verizon Media has no plans to sell other properties at this time, said CEO Guru Gowrappan in an interview.
In the past few years, HuffPost has struggled with declining advertising revenue and adopted a series of cost-cutting measures, including layoffs. The outlet has tried to pivot to a subscription model since last year, with limited success, according to a person familiar with its operations.

Independent digital media outlets have consolidated to compete for ad dollars against big rivals. Vox Media last year acquired New York Media - the publisher of a print magazine and several online properties - and Vice Media bought Refinery29, an online publication geared to women.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Association of Realtors (NAR) settled a federal lawsuit by agreeing to give potential home buyers more accurate information about commissions and fees, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday.
The proposed settlement requires the Chicago-based NAR to revise its rules to provide home buyers with greater transparency about commissions of brokers representing them, the Justice Department said.
The changes include requiring NAR to stop misrepresenting that buyer broker services are free, eliminate rules that prohibit filtering multiple listing services based on the level of buyer broker commissions and change rules limiting access to lockboxes to only NAR-affilated real estate brokers.
The Justice Department, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, said the group's policies on publication and marketing of real estate, commissions and access to lockboxes ""resulted in a lessening of competition among real estate brokers to the detriment of American home buyers.""
A spokesman for NAR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Buying a home is one of life’s biggest and most important financial decisions,” Makan Delrahim, who heads the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. ""Today’s settlement prevents traditional brokers from impeding competition — including by internet-based methods of home buying and selling — by providing greater transparency to consumers about broker fees.""

DUBLIN/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A day after  Boeing Co  (N:BA) received approval for its 737 MAX to fly again following a 20-month grounding, its two largest U.S. and European customers signaled caution on their order books as they monitor demand in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. based Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), Boeing's largest customer worldwide, said this week it would just take new MAX jets to replace jets it's retiring rather than grow its fleet, and on Thursday raised the prospect of scaling back its fleet due to the pandemic.
""If demand is going to be persistently depressed, we can retire and not need to take airplanes as replacements,"" Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told journalists.
When the 737 MAX was grounded globally in March 2019 following two fatal crashes, airlines canceled flights because they lacked enough airplanes to meet strong travel demand.
Now many have parked jets or even gone out of business in the pandemic, creating challenges for Boeing as it tries to find homes for 737 MAX jets that are built but now lack buyers.
A senior executive of Boeing's largest European customer, low-cost carrier Ryanair (I:RYA), said on Thursday that it is not currently looking at additional orders for the jet, but may buy more if prices fall in the wake of COVID-19.
Executives at the airline have said repeatedly over the past year that the airline was discussing possible additional orders amid ongoing talks with Boeing on compensation for delays to its current order for 210 MAX jets. 
""Over time one can see that there will be a way that aircraft are going to be cheaper ... and we will capitalize on that at some stage,"" Ryanair DAC Chief Executive Eddie Wilson said at the Skift Aviation Forum.
""But at the moment it's just the ... existing order that we have,"" he said. 
Ryanair has said it expects to take delivery of its first 30 MAX jets by next summer. The United States lifted a 20-month-old flight ban on the MAX on Wednesday and European regulators are expected to follow suit.

Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NORR), another major MAX customer, this week sought bankruptcy protection in Ireland.

Investing.com -- The Dow spent much of the day down, but rallied after lawmakers said they'd go back to the drawing board to discuss stimulus.  
In less good news, the Labor Department reported that 742,000 people filed for unemployment insurance in the week ended Nov. 14, above economists' forecasts for 707,000 claims. Signs of weakness in the labor market will likely continue as a surge in the virus shuts business down again.  
The U.S. reported a daily record of 1,900 deaths on Wednesday and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against travel ahead of Thanksgiving next week.  
On the plus side, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) did provide a vaccine update showing it provides a strong immune response among older adults.
Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (NYSE:LB) jumped following earnings that topped analyst estimates, underpinned by strong results at Bath & Body Works. 
The week wraps up on a relatively slow note, with little in the way of earnings and economic data.   
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1 Nice kicks
We hope you like sneakers, because  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) is about all the earnings calendar has to offer. Analysts are expecting profit of 51 cents a share on sales of $1.89 billion, both of which are a tick down from the previous quarter. The company just maintained its quarterly dividend at 15 cents a share.
2. Wrapping up the week
It's been a bumpy week on Wall Street. Markets were elated when on Monday  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said its vaccine is 94.5% effective. On Wednesday,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said its coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective with no serious side effects. Shares started out excited about both pieces of news, but have been on a downward trend since then.
The virus is raging and new restrictions are being put in place across the U.S. An unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims also didn't help. Same goes for a lack of stimulus, though our political leaders appear to be back in discussion (we've been hearing this story for months now), which helped bring shares back up a bit today. Luckily, we have ahead of us a shortened and possibly (thankfully) quiet Thanksgiving holiday week.  
3. Happy Birthday Mr. President-Elect
This is highly unlikely to move markets, but, as we mentioned, there's a drought of market-moving events on the schedule, so we would like to wish Joe Biden a very happy birthday. The president-elect of the United States turns 77.

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>",GM's Barra accelerates 'all out pursuit of global EV leadership',"By Ben Klayman and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra said the Detroit automaker is accelerating an ""all out pursuit of global EV leadership,"" challenging electric vehicle leader Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) with increased spending and sped-up vehicle production targets.
Over time, GM plans to offer electric vehicles across its lineup, from below $30,000 to over $100,000, with a goal of ""putting everyone in an electric vehicle,"" Barra told investors Thursday during a conference sponsored by  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
Barra said EVs could help GM expand sales in the United States by as much as 280,000 vehicles a year in coastal states where the company's brands are weak. ""We want to be No. 1 in EVs in North America,"" Barra said.
GM plans to increase spending on electric and autonomous vehicles to $27 billion by 2023, up 35% from previous disclosed plans, she said. The automaker also plans to speed the launch of a dozen new electric models.
GM's ambitions to be the leading electric vehicle producer put it on a collision course with Tesla and German automaker Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), which last week outlined an $86-billion electric vehicle investment plan. GM and VW compete head to head in China.
GM shares rallied into positive territory after Barra outlined her EV strategy. Tesla shares were up 3% on Thursday, pushing the carmaker toward a $475-billion market capitalization that is almost eight times greater than GM's. 
Some investors have pressed Barra to separate GM's electric vehicle operations from the automaker's profitable, legacy internal combustion business. Asked about a spinoff of GM's skateboard or battery operations, Barra said, ""We don't think it has to be separated.""
Instead, Barra emphasized the advantages she sees in integrating internal combustion and electric vehicle businesses, noting that EVs can share up to 70% of the components used in traditional vehicles. 
GM will boost battery-making capacity at the plant it is building in northeast Ohio with South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) and will increase the number of plants in which it builds electric vehicles, Barra said.
Tesla's soaring market capitalization, and growing pressure from regulators to phase out carbon-emitting gasoline engines, has put pressure on established automakers to accelerate production of electric vehicles, even though for now those models promise less profit than current trucks and SUVs.
GM was criticized by Democrats and environmentalists last year when it sided with U.S. President Donald Trump in backing efforts to strip California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules and later on Trump's decision to cut Obama-era efficiency requirements.
GM confirmed it will speed up the rollout of new EVs, and will offer 30 models globally by 2025, expanding on a prior target of 20 electric models by 2023. Barra said GM wants to exceed its prior target of annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. 
GM's pitch to investors focuses on the company's Ultium battery technology, which GM said will now offer electric driving range of up to 450 miles on a single charge, up from 400 previously stated.
The second generation of Ultium batteries, available mid-decade, should close most of the cost gap with gasoline engines, GM global product development chief Doug Parks said on a call with reporters.

GM also said it was creating an umbrella organization for its electric vehicle and digital marketing efforts called Ultifi.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Ken Bertsch, who spent four years pressing large investors' concerns as the head of trade group Council of Institutional Investors, is reuniting with former colleagues as a member of PJT Camberview's Advisory Council.
""Ken is one of the most trusted and knowledgeable individuals in the corporate governance community,"" Abe Friedman, partner and head of PJT Camberview, told clients on Thursday. Reuters saw a copy of the memo announcing the move.

He retired as the Council of Institutional Investors' executive director in August and was succeeded by Amy Borrus, who had been his deputy.
Bertsch, a trained lawyer, spent his career in the governance world, having previously worked as the CEO of the Society for Corporate Governance and head of governance at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund investor William Ackman said on Thursday that he expects to see market gains next year but warned there could be volatility in the months ahead as the coronavirus continues to take its toll.
Ackman told investors that he's ""happy to be long"" on equity exposure and is ""bullish"" on 2021 at a time of low interest rates, more expected stimulus and infrastructure spending.
But he also warned that dark days lie ahead as the United States passed a milestone with 250,000 coronavirus deaths. While he is generally optimistic, the investor said it is ""prudent"" to insure his portfolio now amid a range of uncertainties that can lead to market volatility.
Ackman put on a new hedge -- roughly one third the size of the one he put on earlier this year -- as corporate credit spreads are very tight. On a conference call with investors he said he likes the companies he's invested in now and expects Lowe's (N:LOW), Starbucks (O:SBUX),  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (N:HLT) and Chipotle (N:CMG) to perform well after an end to the pandemic.
Pershing Square Capital Management, Ackman's $12.5 billion firm, boasts one of the industry's best records this year with a return of roughly 55%. Ackman said it is the 16-year old firm's best year ever on a gross basis. 
He said that he has agreed to hire a woman to his all-male investment team but declined to name her, saying only that she performed extremely well on the tests he gives to candidates and is expected to join late next year.

He also declined to offer any new details about his blank check company Tontine, short of saying that the extensive shareholder list will be an asset in finding a target. [L1N2I305K]

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",U.S. court allows Equitrans to keep building Mountain Valley natgas pipe,"By Scott DiSavino
(Reuters) - The U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a motion to stay a permit for the $5.8-$6.0 billion Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia.
Analysts said that court decision on Wednesday - not to stay the pipeline's Biological Opinion - increases the odds  Equitrans Midstream  (NYSE:ETRN) Corp can put the long-delayed project into service in the second half of 2021.
The Biological Opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service allows construction in areas inhabited by endangered and threatened species.
Mountain Valley is one of several oil and gas pipelines delayed by regulatory and legal fights with environmental andlocal groups that found problems with permits issued bythe Trump administration. 
When Equitrans started construction in February 2018, it estimated Mountain Valley would cost about $3.5 billion and be completed by the end of 2018.
The 303-mile (487.6 km) pipeline was designed to deliver 2 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to consumers in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast. One billion cubic feet is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day
Analysts said denial of the stay allows Equitrans to continue construction in areas other than the 25-mile (40-km)exclusion zone surrounding the Jefferson National Forest while the court considers the merits of appeals against the Biological Opinion.
Analysts at Height Capital Markets said the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may decide soon to reduce that exclusion zone to 7.7 miles.
Height Capital Markets also said Mountain Valley must begin applying for an individual stream crossing permit in case it loses an ongoing lawsuit against its Nationwide Permit or President-elect Joe Biden's administration remands the permit, both of which seem probable.
The Nationwide Permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers allows the project to cross waterbodies.
""We continue to have high conviction that the project will be completed, though the Biden administration could delay the ultimate in-service date to 2022,"" Height Capital Markets said.

Mountain Valley is owned by units of Equitrans,  NextEra Energy Inc  (NYSE:NEE), Consolidated Edison Inc (NYSE:ED), AltaGas (TSX:ALA) Ltd and RGC Resources.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. regulators open process to ensure self-driving car safety,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators on Thursday said they were opening a formal regulatory proceeding that could eventually result in the adoption of new safety standards for autonomous vehicles.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was issuing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to get public input on how to ensure the safety of future self-driving vehicles. Companies like General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc are working on vehicles that can drive themselves.
""This rulemaking will help address legitimate public concerns about safety, security and privacy without hampering innovation in the development of automated driving systems,” said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao in a statement.
NHTSA said the proceeding could result in the agency issuing new guidance documents addressing best industry practices, providing information to consumers or formal regulations including rules requiring reporting and disclosures to new legally binding safety standards on automated driving systems. Any final rules are still likely years away.
The agency said it is focused on key primary functions for self-driving systems including how use sensors; detect other road users; plans routes; makes decisions on how to respond appropriately to road users and execute driving functions.
NHTSA seeks input to develop ""a framework that meets the need for motor vehicle safety and assesses the degree of success in manufacturers’ efforts to ensure safety,"" it said.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has faulted NHTSA for adopting what it called ""a nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle safety"" sand the agency has failed to develop a method for verifying manufacturers of ""partial automation systems are incorporating system safeguards.""
On Thursday, NHTSA said it ""has no desire to issue regulations that would needlessly prevent the deployment of any (automated-driving system)-equipped vehicle"" adding ""an ill-conceived standard may fail to meet the need for motor vehicle safety and needlessly stifle innovation."" 
NTSB has criticized NHTSA in investigations of fatal crashes involving an Uber (NYSE:UBER) self-driving test vehicle and another involving a California driver killed using Tesla's driver assistance system Autopilot.
There are also no regulations governing the performance of systems like Autopilot that allow drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods, but NHTSA can demand a recall if believes any vehicle poses an unreasonable risk to safety.

NHTSA's special crash unit is investigating a dozen Tesla crashes in which it suspects Autopilot or some other advanced driver assistance system was in use.

Investing.com -- Coty (NYSE:COTY)'s been on a tear this month, up 111%, and the praise keeps coming. 
Shares are up 15% today after Barron's said it might be time to buy shares, and Seeking Alpha said it's ""positioned itself for a tremendous recovery.""
Seeking Alpha cited new management -- long-time industry executive Sue Nabi joined this year -- deleveraging and moves into Gen-Z preferred businesses.
On Nov. 6, Coty reported earnings that sent shares soaring. A fiscal 2021 first quarter loss per share of 2 cents was better than the loss of 7 cents that analysts expected. Revenue of $1.12 billion also beat the estimated $1.08 billion. Coty also said it was on track to deliver more than $200 million in savings for the fiscal year.    
Little more than a week later, Peter Harf, who has served as chief executive officer and is now executive chairman of Coty, reached a deal to buy shares from KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR)., boosting his personal stake in the company by $150 million, Bloomberg reported.  
And today, Citi upgraded Coty to buy from neutral with a price target of $10, up from $4.50, StreetInsider reported. 
""We think Coty has the potential to pick a lot of low hanging fruit in terms of accelerating growth, improving margins and deleveraging its balance sheet,"" Citi analyst Wendy Nicholson said. 
Nicholson is one of two buys on the stock, which has eight holds and no sells.

Investing.com -- L Brands (NYSE:LB) may have found the right recipe. Shares are rallying 15% after the Victoria's Secret owner reported figures that far outstripped those from a year earlier.
Bath and home products like Winter Candy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fragrance and Blueberry Sugar candles continued to be the big sellers, pumping revenue higher. Victoria's Secret, which had looked like a big drag on the company, appears to be recovering, if ever so slightly.  
“L Brands reported a record third quarter, driven by exceptional results and continued strength at Bath & Body Works, and a significant improvement in performance at Victoria’s Secret,"" said Chief Executive Officer Andrew Meslow in a statement. 
L Brands earnings per share of $1.13 beat the estimated $1 on sales of $3.06 billion, higher than the expected $2.66 billion. EPS compared to a loss per share of 91 cents in the same quarter in 2019, while revenue a year ago totaled $2.677 billion.
Third quarter operating income at L Brands was $580 million compared to an operating loss of $151 million last year, and net income was $330 million compared to a net loss of $252 million last year.
Bath & Body Works represented the lion's share of the growth, with same-store sales up 56% year-on-year. But Victoria's Secret is recovering, with same-store sales up 4% compared to a year earlier, when they dropped 8%. That said, overall sales at the lingerie maker dropped 14%. The company also succeeded in cutting costs for the quarter.
L Brands is prudent amid the good news.
""We are cautious about our ability to exceed last year’s fourth quarter sales and earnings results, given anticipated constraints on store traffic, online fulfillment and shipping capacity, as well as other uncertainties related to the COVID pandemic,"" Meslow said.
Meanwhile, Macy's (NYSE:M) eked out better-than-expected results, but shares were little changed.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) newly introduced Model Y crossover, which has had body-hardware and paint issues, dragged down the electric-car maker's standing in Consumer Reports magazine's annual reliability study.
Owners of the Model Y, which began production in January, have reported misaligned body panels that had to be fixed and mismatched paint including, in one case, human hair stuck in the paint, according to Consumer Reports. The Model Y finished with a ""much worse than average"" reliability rating. 
Tesla's ranking would have risen a few spots if not for the Model Y's performance, said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. 
New models often have reliability issues, but Tesla's problems were not typical. 
""I am surprised that we would see just basic paint and trim type issues and body panel fitment issues,"" he said in an interview. ""You would think that that would have been worked out a long time ago.""
""Really disappointing when you spend this much money for a car and hopefully they'll be able to rectify a lot of these as time goes by,"" Fisher added.
Tesla's ranking slipped two spots to No. 25 out of 26 brands rated in the U.S. market, ahead of only  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) Lincoln luxury brand, according to the annual survey released on Thursday. (www.CR.org/reliability)
The Tesla Model S sedan and Model X SUV were both ""worse than average, with the former losing its ""recommended"" status, Fisher said. The Model 3 sedan maintained an ""average"" rating and its ""recommended"" status.
Tesla could not be reached for comment. 
The poll predicts which new cars will give owners fewer or more problems, based on data collected for more than 300,000 vehicles from model years 2000 to 2020. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.
Brands with no major changes to their lineups, such as Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261), made gains. Mazda finished above  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp's (T:7203) Toyota and Lexus brands, marking the first time a Toyota brand did not finish first in the survey, Fisher said.
The reliability of full-sized pickups, the most popular vehicles in the U.S. market, was weaker. 

General Motors Co's (N:GM) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 1500 pickups had ""much worse than average"" reliability, while  Fiat  Chrysler Automobile's (MI:FCHA) Ram pickup finished ""worse than average."" Ford's F-150 was not rated because a redesigned model was just launched, but the larger F-250 and F-350 versions were ""average.""

(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) reported a more than 20% drop in quarterly comparable sales on Thursday and said it expects declines of that magnitude to continue into the fall, signaling a tough holiday season for the coronavirus-battered department store chain.
The retailer's shares fell nearly 8% to $8.30 in morning trading. Its stock has lost nearly half its value in a tumultuous year in which it has had to lay off thousands of workers and suffer through plunging sales due to outlet closures and no international tourism.
Macy's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in a statement the company was keeping an eye on a new wave of COVID-19 cases across the United States and the potential impact on its business.
The country has been regularly recording over 100,000 daily COVID-19 infections over the last two weeks, raising fears that the spiking numbers will keep people away from already sales-battered retail stores heading into the holidays.
Macy's said it expects comparable sales of owned and licensed stores to fall by a low- to mid-20s percentage in the fall season. It also said holiday surcharges will lead to higher delivery expenses that will weigh on the fourth quarter.
Increased investments in its fulfillment offerings, such as curbside store pickup and same-day delivery, executives said, would help Macy's during the holiday season, which accounts for a huge chunk - 20% - of annual sales for retailers.
""Looking to Holiday 2020, we know this year is different,"" CEO Gennette said. ""We have the right gifting assortment with newness from value to luxury, and our expanded fulfillment options allow customers to shop safely and conveniently, in store or online.""
To attract new customers and retain existing ones, Macy's said it added new, exclusive products as consumers shift what they spend on and how they spend it, in particular online. Categories including loungewear, home decor, fine jewelry, and fragrances have been performing well, Macy's said.
Gennette said he was optimistic about COVID-19 vaccines, and expects demand for occasion-based apparel, such as formal gowns and prom dresses, ""to surge"" when people get back to their normal lives.
""We've gotten our inventories down in those dressier categories, but we will ramp that up very quickly with all of our partners and our private brands as the vaccination becomes more apparent,"" he said on a call with analysts.
Craig Johnson of Customer Growth Partners said Macy's sales drop lagged the department store sector but noted that the company is beginning to see the light of day with store traffic pickup in late October through November as the holidays approach.
Big box retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (N:TGT), on the other hand, have seen sales soar during the pandemic, clocking record high online sales as Americans opt to make fewer trips and load up on daily essential items like toilet paper and cleaning wipes.
Macy's net sales fell in the third quarter ended Oct. 31 to $3.99 billion from $5.17 billion a year earlier but beat analysts' estimates of $3.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company posted an adjusted net loss of $60 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with earnings of $21 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected a loss of 79 cents per share.

1180,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens Lower as Virus Numbers, Jobless Weigh; Dow Down 120 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday, on course for their third straight daily loss after more gloomy numbers on the health front and the first rise in weekly jobless claims since September.
By 9:35 AM (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 117 points, or 0.4%, at 29,322 points and has now lost all of the gains it made on Monday in response to  Moderna 's (NASDAQ:MRNA) announcement that its experimental drug for treating Covid-19 was 94.5% effective.
The S&P 500 was likewise down 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%.
The move comes amid signs that institutional fund managers are turning bearish on the outlook for stocks, with Bank of America’s latest monthly survey showing that some are inclined to “sell the vaccine” after buying into story of accelerated development earlier in the year. In part that’s due to the awareness that even an effective vaccine will take time to be authorized, manufactured, distributed and administered.
Until such a time, the pressure on the economy from public health measures designed to stop the spread of the disease looks likely to stay. The Labor Department earlier reported that 742,000 people filed initial claims for jobless benefits last week, the first rise in six weeks, as the gradual tightening of restrictions on social activity hit the leisure and hospitality sectors in particular.
Fears of a bigger hit to the economy are gaining credence, with New York City deciding to close its public schools for the first time since spring. School closures, a widespread feature of policy responses to the first wave, have been shown to be particularly damaging to local economies, putting pressure on women in particular to drop out of the workforce, if only temporarily.
Among individual stocks moving early, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) stock rose 25% after a strong quarterly report that showed it profiting from people investing more in home audio systems due to their enforced confinement away from the office. The news also lifted  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock 5.8%, on the perception that similar trends will have helped the maker of streaming devices.
That stay-at-home trend has been hard on department stores, however, and Macy’s (NYSE:M) stock fell 3.4% after it warned of low visibility about the upcoming holiday season. The company expects comparable sales to be down over 20% on the year in the current holiday quarter. The stock was vulnerable to some profit-taking after rising nearly 30% since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) became the first company to announce it had a drug that worked against the coronavirus.
Another early mover was Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, which fell 2.0% after its latest quarterly update, released after the close on Thursday, raised concerns that its windfall gains from the virus - which has greatly boosted demand for data center and video game chips - may be levelling off. The chipmaker warned that sales of data center chips could fall in the current quarter from Q3 levels. "

NPC filed for bankruptcy protection in July and started a process to sell its assets, including its interests in Wendy's restaurants across eight different markets.
Restaurants have been among the worst hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many dining chains, including California Pizza Kitchen, Chuck E. Cheese parent CEC Entertainment and Rubio's Restaurants Inc, filing for bankruptcy.
Wendy's said https:// it remains committed to maintaining its ownership level at about 5% of the total Wendy's system. The burger chain expects several existing and new franchisees, part of the consortium bid, to buy most of the NPC markets, with Wendy's buying one or two at most.
Wendy's did not disclose the size of the consortium bid.
NPC Quality Burgers' parent, NPC International Inc, earlier this month said restaurant franchisee Flynn Restaurant Group LP had agreed to buy all of its more than 1,300 Pizza Hut and Wendy's restaurants.
Wendy's filed an objection last week to the sale of NPC International's assets to Flynn, saying the bidder also operates a few of its competitors' restaurants.

1187,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Nasdaq to buy financial fraud detection firm Verafin for $2.75 billion,"By Anna Irrera and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Exchange operator Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) said on Thursday it would buy anti-financial crime software firm Verafin for $2.75 billion in cash, significantly expanding its reach in the regulatory technology market.
Verafin, founded in 2003, provides more than 2,000 financial institutions in North America a cloud-based platform to help detect, investigate, and report money laundering and financial fraud.
Nasdaq will aim to provide Verafin's technology to the 250 banks, exchanges, broker-dealers and buy-side organizations, and regulatory authorities, that use its trade surveillance systems, the company said.
With the deal, the exchange group is doubling down on its push into the anti-money laundering software sector and furthering its strategy of repositioning the company as a leading financial technology and data vendor. 
While Nasdaq is best known for operating exchanges in the United States and globally, it is also a provider of market technology to banks and other financial institutions. 
It has a strong foothold in the trade surveillance software market, as well as in the trading technology systems sector. It made its first move in the anti-money laundering software market in September when it launched artificial intelligence technology to help retail and commercial banks automate investigations.
""The problem of detecting money laundering and fraud hasn't been solved very well yet,"" Valerie Bannert-Thurner, senior vice president and head of sell-side and buy-side solutions, market technology at Nasdaq, said in an interview. ""With our acquisition we are doubling down on our belief this as an area that is being disrupted and where we can have a big impact.""
Nasdaq's push comes as banks and other financial firms look to automate many of their more expensive and complex back office processes to reduce costs and increase efficiency. 
This includes compliance and surveillance functions, where costs have been growing significantly following tougher regulatory crackdowns over the past decade. 
Still, up to $2 trillion is laundered globally each year, representing up to 5% of global GDP, according to the United Nations. 
The acquisition marks another milestone in Nasdaq's effort to diversify its revenue stream away from trading, where fees have been declining, into areas such as technology and data. 
Nasdaq's revenues from its market technology and investment intelligence businesses have grown 54% since 2016, and non-trading revenues represent 73% of the group's overall revenues.
The deal is Nasdaq's largest since its $3.8 billion purchase of Nordic exchange OMX in 2008. 

Nasdaq will finance the transaction, which will add to its earnings per share beginning in 2022, with a combination of $2.5 billion of debt and cash on hand.

The data, reported in part last month but published in full in The Lancet medical journal on Thursday, suggest that those aged over 70, who are at higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19, could build robust immunity.
""The robust antibody and T-cell responses seen in older people in our study are encouraging,"" said Maheshi Ramasamy, a consultant and co-lead investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group.
""We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.""
Late-stage, or Phase III, trials are ongoing to confirm the findings, researchers said, and to test whether the vaccine protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of people, including people with underlying health conditions.
Results of those trials should definitely be known by Christmas, the Oxford Vaccine Group's director, Andrew Pollard, said, adding it was too early to know whether and how well the vaccine works in preventing COVID-19 disease. 
""We're still waiting to get to the point where we can do the analysis to just work out how well the vaccine can protect people, and we're getting ever closer to that,"" he told journalists. 
""We are optimistic that we'll be able to do that before Christmas, and obviously we'll share that with you as soon as we can at that point.""
The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine candidate, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, had been among the front-runners in global efforts to develop shots to protect against infection with the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. 
But rival drugmakers  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), BioNTech (F:22UAy) and  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) have in the past 10 days edged ahead, releasing data from late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trials that shows more than 90% efficacy.
""We're not in a rush. We and it's not a competition with the other developers,"" Oxford's Pollard said, adding that AstraZeneca would release headline efficacy data before it was published in an academic journal.
Oxford University has set a target of 53 infections to start the interim analysis of its late-stage trial results, though ""lots of cases"" in its trial arms in Britain, South Africa and Brazil mean the exact number of infections reported could differ.
Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots, both of which use new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), AstraZeneca's is a viral vector vaccine made from a weakened version of a common cold virus found in chimpanzees.
The Phase II trial reported in The Lancet involved a total of 560 healthy volunteers, with 160 aged 18-55, 160 aged 56-69, and 240 aged 70 or over.
Volunteers got two doses of the vaccine or a placebo, and no serious side effects related to the AZD1222 vaccine were reported, the researchers said.

AstraZeneca (L:AZN) has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening slightly lower Thursday, as concerns of further lockdowns outweigh positive coronavirus vaccine news.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 46 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 27 points, or 0.2%. 
The number of Covid-19 deaths in the United States exceeded 250,000 on Wednesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The fresh surge in infections has resulted in the number of people hospitalized with the virus rising above 79,000, the highest ever for a single day during the pandemic.
Authorities across the country have brought in a range of measures in recent days to try to limit this swell, including New York City's school district, the country’s largest, halting in-person learning from Thursday.
The major stock indices are still having a strong November, boosted by positive news about potential Covid-19 vaccines. In addition to strong reports from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN) candidate, developed in conjunction with Oxford University, showed a strong immune response in older adults, according to data released earlier Thursday.
However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 recorded their worst day in three weeks on Wednesday, and these indices are set for their third straight day of losses as this vaccine optimism dissipates.
On a more positive note, the retail sector has more earnings data due Thursday, with warehouse club BJs Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) and department store giant Macy’s (NYSE:M) reporting early. This sector has been a bright spot in recent earnings, as e-commerce sales help stores overcome lower foot traffic because of the pandemic.
The key economic release Thursday will be the weekly initial jobless claims reading, which is expected to come in at 710,000, roughly flat compared with the prior week, as the rebound in the labor market slows as Covid cases rise.
Additionally, existing home sales for October are due out, and are expected to be 6.4 million, adding to the similarly strong trend in September. 
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, consolidating after climbing to their highest levels since early September during the previous session after a smaller-than-expected build in U.S. stockpiles. 
Still, Covid-19 infections are rising worldwide, particularly in big fuel users like the United States and Europe, and this will put pressure on the world’s major producers to adjust their output expectations next year.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $41.62 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $44.14, both remaining well above the $40 mark.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,860.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1837.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) said on Thursday it has completed a $95 million financing package for Zippy Shell (LON:RDSa) Inc, one of the largest moving-and-storage service providers in the United States.
Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle said its financing package consists of a $75 million second-lien term loan and $20 million in preferred equity.
Zippy Shell, which has a network of more than 71 warehouse facilities across the country, is owned by buyout firm Virgo Investment Group LLC. The Wake Forest, North Carolina-based company was founded in 2009 and merged with 1-800-PACK-RAT, another moving firm, in 2018.
The company plans to use the financing to make acquisitions, open more storage locations across cities, invest in its technology, and expand its fleet of trucks and moving containers, Zippy Shell Chief Executive Officer Mark Kuhns said.
Carlyle provided the financing for Zippy Shell from its $2.4 billion Credit Opportunities Fund, which was recently used to back International Creative Management Partners, one of the most prominent Hollywood talent agencies, in its recent acquisition of London-based sports management agency Stellar Group.

1193,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 05:57AM ET</span>",StockBeat; The Recovery May Come Too Late for Thyssenkrupp,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- A recurrent feature of Covid-19 is that it has hit those hardest who suffer ‘co-morbidities’. That’s as true for stocks and companies as it is for people.
When the economic history of the pandemic is written, it looks very likely that someone will have to decide whether Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) died ‘of’ Covid-19 or ‘with’ Covid-19.
That the company is doomed one way or the other, however, looks increasingly clear.
Thyssenkrupp reported a loss before earnings and taxes of 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion) for the year through September on Thursday, actually a little better than its forecasts of somewhere between 1.7 and 1.9 billion thanks to cost control and liquidity management. But sales fell 15% and order intake, a forward look into next year’s business, was just as miserable, falling 17%.
That means that further, deeper cost-cutting is required. The company said it will shed another 5,000 more job cuts, a recognition of the fact that its operating businesses continue to hemorrhage cash. That brings the total planned job cuts over the next three years to 11,000, over one-tenth of the workforce. So far, Thyssenkrupp has agreed packages with 3,600 of those affected.
“We will have to move further into the “red zone” before we have made Thyssenkrupp fit for the future,” said Martina Merz, the Bosch veteran who felt compelled to take direct responsibility for steering the company away from the rocks when she fired CEO Guido Kerkhoff earlier this year.
Merz dropped a heavy hint that the next step may have to be compulsory redundancies, a rare step in a country whose working-age population is shrinking faster than any in Europe.
“The next steps could be more painful than the previous ones,” she warned. “But we will have to take them.”
That is putting it mildly. One third of the 15 billion euro gain on the sale of its elevator division was eaten up by operating losses and another 600 million euros by restructuring costs. The rest will only be thrown at covering the yawning gap in its pension liabilities. The automotive sector, Thyssenkrupp's key customer, expects to produce 25% fewer cars in Europe this year, and is in any case set to buy less steel in future as it replaces it wherever possible with lighter, higher-performance materials.
Thyssenkrupp stock fell 7.6% on the news on Thursday to a two-week low. The stock already trades as a bankruptcy play rather than a bona fide steel stock, its own particular problems outweighing the mini-revival that has grabbed the sector recently.
The outlook for the rest of the sector has taken a turn for the better in recent weeks, with the election of Joe Biden seen as likely to end the era of transatlantic tariff wars, and with progress in vaccine testing encouraging broader hopes for an end to the pandemic.  Arcelormittal stock is up over 30% since late September while Austria’s Voestalpine is up 20%. Kloeckner, which makes steel products rather than the commodity steel itself, is up 25% in the last three weeks and now trades at its highest since February.
For Thyssenkrupp, however, it may all be too late."

UBS, along with rival Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), in April decided to postpone payment of part of its 2019 dividend after mounting pressure from authorities over lenders' payouts during the coronavirus pandemic.
Banks across Britain and the euro zone were halted from paying 2019 dividends during the peak of economic uncertainties in March and April, while Swiss financial market supervisor FINMA took a softer approach, warning banks not to pay out dividends in order to conserve capital without banning them outright.
Major Swiss banks have since weathered the pandemic's economic fallout with strong capital positions.
Some 99.49% of the bank's shareholders on Thursday approved a special dividend of $0.365 per share in a virtual extraordinary general meeting, matching the initial payment made in May. 
Credit Suisse will hold its extraordinary general meeting on Nov. 27 to request approval for the second tranche of its 2019 dividend payment.

UBS has set aside some $2.5 billion to return to shareholders next year. At FINMA's behest, it is rebalancing the amount of payouts earmarked for buybacks to favour these over dividends, with former CEO Sergio Ermotti saying the approach allowed for greater flexibility amid economic uncertainty.

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World stocks eased for the third day in a row and oil fell on Thursday tracking overnight weakness in Asia and Wall Street as widening COVID-19 restrictions weighed on market sentiment.
Positive news about potential vaccines had helped push the MSCI World Index to a record high earlier in the week, only to see investors pull back as a host of countries announced record infection rates and tougher lockdowns.
At 0844 GMT, the broad gauge of global equities was trading down 0.3% while Europe's major indexes were down around 0.7%. Oil prices also eased as virus restrictions crimped demand expectations.
The weaker sentiment was triggered by a late U.S. sell-off overnight that had seen the S&P 500 close down 1.1%; weighed by news COVID-19 deaths in the world's biggest economy had passed 250,000, underpinning a host of lockdowns.
Similarly sombre news in Japan, where a record number of cases and a rise in Tokyo's pandemic alert level sent the Nikkei down 0.4%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5%.
""The biggest question in the markets right now is whether the headlines of renewed school closures, lockdowns and social restrictions is enough to derail vaccine positives and the fact that COVID survival rates are climbing along with the hospitalisation and infection rates,"" said a London-based trader.
The positive vaccine news had continued yesterday after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said its COVID-19 vaccine was 95% effective and it would apply for emergency U.S. authorization within days, following a similar recent report from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
Looking ahead, Wall Street futures point to a steady open, with all eyes on the Federal Reserve for further signs it could step in with fresh monetary stimulus - something two officials nodded to on Wednesday..
Investors will also await U.S. jobs data at 1330 GMT.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar was last at 92.575, marginally in the black but just off its recent low of 92.129. The euro, meanwhile, was down 0.1% and just short of the recent peak of $1.1919.
""The vaccines news are a positive medium-term impulse for the global economic outlook and investors are trying to weigh that against the prospect of an imminent stalling of the European and U.S. recovery amid the prospect of extensions of current lockdown measures,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB.
Sterling, however, was weaker still, down 0.5% after a report Europe's leaders would demand the European Commission publish no-deal plans as the deadline for talks over a trade deal go down to the wire.
Despite the equity market caution, gold traders continued to take a longer-term view, betting the COVID-19 vaccines would translate into a quicker economic recovery, sending the yellow metal to a one-week low. 

Bitcoin, sometimes regarded as a safe haven or at least a hedge against inflation, also pulled back and last stood at $17,500.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, as optimism surrounding the latest vaccine news yields to fears for the immediate future due to lengthy lockdowns.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.8%, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index dropped 0.9%.
Earlier Thursday, mid-stage trial data from a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and Oxford University showed a strong immune response in older adults. This positive news adds to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) showing very high success rates for their late stage trials, giving hope that workable vaccines are not far away. T
However, this has had a limited impact on the markets Thursday, especially with the World Health Organization warning that vaccines won't be on time to deal with the current worldwide wave of the pandemic. The  likes of the U.K., Italy and Spain this week reported their highest death tolls from the Covid-19 virus since the first outbreak in the spring.
Governments have resorted to partial shutdowns throughout the continent to combat the recent surge in coronavirus cases. While there has been some success in reducing the rate of infections, it has come at a high economic cost.
In corporate news, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) stock slumped 6.6% after the German steel giant said it would need to cut a further 5,000 jobs with its net operating loss widening in the third quarter.
 Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) stock dropped 3.1% despite the home improvement retailer reporting a rise in sales in the third quarter, while Norwegian Air (OL:NORR) dropped 15% after it asked an Irish court to oversee a restructuring of its massive debt as it seeks to stave off collapse.
There was some good news.  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) stock rose 5.8% after a promising earnings report, while CMC Markets (LON:CMCX) climbed 2.9% after the online trading platform posted a record trading performance.
EU leaders are set to hold a video conference later Thursday to try and secure the release of hundreds of billions of euros of pandemic relief and budget funds after Hungary and Poland threatened to hold this up.
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, consolidating after climbing to their highest levels since early September during the previous session after a smaller-than-expected build in U.S. stockpiles.
Wednesday's crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a 768,000-barrel build for the week to Nov. 13, against the forecast 1.650 million. On Tuesday, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute had reported a 4.174-million-barrel crude gain.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $41.66 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $44.11, both remaining well above the $40 mark.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Some of the relatives of victims of a fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crash in Indonesia have slammed a decision by U.S. aviation authorities to allow the jets to return to the skies, saying the move comes too soon.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday lifted a flight ban on Boeing's 737 MAX imposed after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months in 2018 and 2019.
Two years after the plane operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea, killing all 189 on board, the tragedy is still raw.
""The U.S. authorities shouldn't have lifted the grounding order this quickly,"" said Aris Sugiono, who lost his sister and brother-in-law in the crash. ""They must consider the feelings of the victim’s families.""
In the past, global air regulators promptly followed the guidance of the FAA, credited for decades with pioneering aviation safety. But many are now wary of seeming to toe the FAA line after the U.S. agency was faulted for lax oversight. 
""It's too soon,"" agreed Anton Sahadi, who had two young relatives on board the doomed flight. ""It wasn’t just the Lion Air flight, but also the victims in Ethiopia... The victims' families haven't 100% recovered yet.""
Families of the Ethiopian crash victims said in a statement they felt ""sheer disappointment and renewed grief"" after the FAA's decision to return the aircraft to service.
""Our family was broken,"" Naoise Ryan, whose 39-year-old husband died aboard Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, said.
In Indonesia, some of the aggrieved relatives said clearance had been granted faster than compensation. 
""Why has the flight permit been granted while the affairs of the victims' family have not been fully resolved?"" asked Latief Nurbana, a civil servant who lost his 24-year-old son.
He said compensation payments and arrangements with the Boeing Community Investment Fund (BCIF) were still unsettled.
The BCIF's website said that the distribution of funds to provide philanthropic support to communities affected by the crashes would be completed by Jan. 15, 2021.
A Boeing spokeswoman and spokesman for Lion Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In both accidents a stall-prevention system known as MCAS, triggered by faulty data from a single airflow sensor, repeatedly and forcefully shoved down the jet's nose as the pilots struggled to regain control.
Adita Irawati, an Indonesian transportation ministry spokeswoman, said Indonesia would allow the Boeing 737 MAX to fly once the FAA issued airworthiness directives. 
On-the-ground and simulator training for pilots would be included in that process, and the timing would be dependent on compliance with the requirements, Irawati said. 
Grieving relative Sahadi said profit should not guide an urgency to get back in the air. 

“This means they don't prioritize safety, considering there have been fatal mistakes that led to these two airlines having terrible accidents,"" Sahadi said.

The union at South Korea's No.2 automaker has decided to suspend work for a part of the day over Nov. 24-27, an union official said, adding Kia's plan to introduce EV production is one of the thorny issues in the annual wage deal negotiations.
Kia has laid out plans to produce an EV model comparable to its K7 sedan at one of the factories in its Hwaseong plant in South Korea starting July next year, the union official said. 
""Building electric cars requires about 30% less labour than building internal combustion cars, because they require fewer parts, resulting in job losses,"" a union member at Kia said. 
""If the shift to electric cars is inevitable, we are asking the management to ensure longer-term job security by having EV module production lines at our factories,"" the member added. 
Kia said in September that it plans to have eleven EVs by 2025 and have 25% of its global sales in EVs by 2029. 
Automakers around the world are expanding their electric car production to comply with tougher air-pollution rules that require them to reduce carbon emissions or face stiff fines.
The union at Kia has also asked for a raise in wages and a performance pay, but these have not been accepted by the company, the union official said.
Kia wants to freeze wages but has proposed a bonus and other benefits if the union does not strike, a company official said on condition of anonymity as negotiations are ongoing. 

The labour action at Kia comes even as the union at affiliate  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) avoided a strike amid the coronavirus pandemic.

1203,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 02:04AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Largely Lower; Vaccine Optimism Wanes,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely lower Thursday, as optimism surrounding the latest vaccine news yields to fears for the immediate future due to lengthy lockdowns.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, but CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.9% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.8%. 
Recent positive news from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), with the final results of its Covid-19 vaccine trial showing it had a 95% success rate on Wednesday, and earlier Thursday news that the Oxford potential vaccine showed ""encouraging"" immune response in older adults, have had a limited impact on the markets. Especially with the likes of the U.K., Italy and Spain this week reporting their highest death tolls from the Covid-19 virus since the first outbreak in the spring.
Governments have resorted to partial shutdowns throughout the continent to combat the recent surge in coronavirus cases, and while there has been some success in reducing the rate of infections, it has come at a high economic cost.
The European Central Bank projects that real GDP will fall by 8.0% in the euro area in 2020, but President Christine Lagarde warned this week that the region’s economy was taking a bigger hit from the second wave of the pandemic than expected.
Additionally, Hungary and Poland are now threatening to sabotage the release of hundreds of billions of euros of pandemic relief and budget funds following a row over the rule of law within the European Union.
EU leaders are set to hold a video conference later Thursday to address the holdup in the release of these funds, which are seen as vital given the escalating health crisis and risk of a double-dip recession.
Earnings from the likes of Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) will catch the eye Thursday, while the European economic data slate centers largely around the Eurozone current account release for September.
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, consolidating after climbing to their highest levels since early September during the previous session after a smaller-than-expected build in U.S. stockpiles. 
Wednesday's crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a 768,000-barrel build for the week to Nov. 13, against the forecast 1.650 million. On Tuesday, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute had reported a 4.174-million-barrel crude gain.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $41.74 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.3% to $44.22, both remaining well above the $40 mark.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,860.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1849.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>","Hedge funds sold Moderna, BioNtech shares before vaccine news","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - A number of hedge funds sold positions in two drug companies leading the race to a coronavirus vaccine in the quarter before both announced breakthroughs that lifted their stock prices, while a few took stakes in the companies during that time.
Regulatory filings show that hedge funds sold millions of shares in drugmakers  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNtech during the third quarter, missing out on big gains this month when each announced their vaccines are more than 94% effective.
Since the end of the third quarter BioNtech's stock has jumped another 26% and Moderna's stock has climbed 28%, adding to triple-digit percentage gains and putting them among the biggest winners this year, during which the S&P 500 has rebounded 60% from its March lows. 
By the end of September, Balyasny Asset Management, Adage Capital Partners and Verition Fund Management had liquidated their positions in Moderna while Healthcor Management, Logos Global Management and Duquesne Family Office exited positions in BioNtech, according to regulatory filings and data from research firm Symmetric.io.
Redmile Group, BioNtech's largest hedge fund investor, slashed its holdings by 59% during the quarter and Theleme Partners, Moderna's largest hedge fund investor, cut its exposure by 11%, regulatory filings show.
Additionally, Millennium Management, Myriad Asset Management and Citadel cut holdings in Moderna while Citadel, Balyasny and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors cut holdings in BioNtech, the filings show.
Symmetric.io data show that hedge funds owned 3.4 million shares of BioNtech, a German company which partnered with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) to bring its vaccine to market, at the end of the quarter, 1.9 million shares less than at the start of the quarter. At Moderna, hedge funds owned 11.7 million shares at the end of the quarter, down 2.2 million shares from the start.
Moderna's stock price surged 376% since January while BioNtech's rose 157%, handily beating the S&P 500 index which is up 12%, having bounced back from deep losses earlier in 2020.
Representatives for the funds either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on what prompted their sales. Investors who put money into hedge funds, including some of those mentioned in the article, said some fund managers had started locking in profits ahead of U.S. elections on worries over potential market volatility stemming from the Nov. 3 vote.
The average hedge fund gained 1.2% through October, while healthcare focused funds, on average, rose 13%, Hedge Fund Research data show.
Even as certain hedge funds took money away from Moderna and BioNtech the two companies did attract new hedge fund investors during the quarter, the data show.

Voloridge Investment Management and LMR Partners initiated new positions in Moderna while Armistice Capital and Adage Capital put on new positions in BioNtech. And Millennium boosted its investment in BioNtech while D.E.Shaw increased its holding in Moderna, the filings show.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Thursday morning. U.S. shares ended on a down note overnight, with fresh U.S. restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19 overshadowing more positive news about a potential vaccine.
New York City suspended in-person teaching in the U.S.’ largest public-school districts as the number of COVID-19 cases in the city rose. The number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. surpassed 250,000 as of Nov. 19, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Investors digested this news alongside  Pfizer  Inc's (NYSE:PFE) announcement on Wednesday that its vaccine candidate, BNT162b, that is being co-developed with Germany’s BioNTech (F:22UAy), is 95% effective in a trial involving almost 44,000 participants. The pair could receive both U.S. and European regulatory approval as early as mid-December, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters.
“If all goes well, I could imagine that we gain approval in the second half of December and start deliveries before Christmas, but really only if all goes positively,” Sahin said.
Other vaccine developers also recently announced positive news for their candidates.  Moderna  Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) mRNA-1273 candidate was almost equally as effective as BNT162b, the company said on Monday. Trial results for a third candidate, AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) and the University of Oxford’s AZD1222, are expected to be released soon.
The ride between optimism and pessimism was dizzying for some investors.
“It’s like a seesaw, the fight between the growth of COVID-19 and the excitement about the vaccine is really weighing on the market,” Kramer Capital Research chief investment officer Hilary Kramer told Reuters.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.77% by 11:18 PM ET (3:18 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.60%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.17%, with South Australia beginning a tough lockdown on Thursday to curb a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 in the state. The six-day lockdown prohibits even outdoor exercise and dog-walking, with one person from each household allowed to leave home each day for essential reasons.
The lockdown also sees the closure of schools, universities, cafes and restaurants, a ban on weddings and funerals and mandatory mask-wearing.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Scott Morrison responded to escalating criticism of his government from China by stating that he would not compromise Australia’s national security and sovereignty.
“Australia will always be ourselves … we will always set our own laws and our own rules according to our national interests, not at the behest of any other nation, whether that’s the U.S. or China or anyone else.” Morrison said on Thursday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.77%. China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.01% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.58%.
Investors are curbing some of the enthusiasm that saw global shares reach record highs, despite the positive vaccine news, with the focus squarely on the latest number of COVID-19 cases. The infection rates in both Europe and the U.S. remain high as both areas battle a second wave of cases.
“We are expecting tough times in coming months because of the resurgence of cases, but in terms of the longer-term recovery path, the vaccine was a very important news milestone. We think that the cyclical recovery is going to come back but there are going to be some bumps along the road,” Columbia Threadneedle Investments deputy global head of equities Melda Mergen told Bloomberg."
1207,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 10:15PM ET</span>",U.S. airline CEOs renew request for more aid in letter to Congress,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The chief executives of the seven largest U.S. airlines made a fresh plea for more payroll relief before the end of the year and pointed to the challenges of distributing a COVID-19 vaccine in a letter to Congressional leaders on Wednesday.
The letter, seen by Reuters, was sent by the main industry lobby Airlines for America and signed by the heads of the top seven U.S. airlines. 
""As the nation looks forward and takes on the logistical challenges of distributing a vaccine, it will be important to ensure there are sufficient certified employees and planes in service necessary for adequate capacity to complete the task,"" they said.
U.S. airlines received $25 billion in federal aid to keep employees on payroll between March and September and have asked for a second round of support after cutting tens of thousands of jobs either through furloughs or early retirements in recent months.
They have argued that they need trained employees to help service an economic rebound, with the prospects of a vaccine in the coming months underscoring the urgency.
The number of travelers that passed through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints on Tuesday was down two-thirds from the same day in 2019, an improvement from the start of the pandemic but not enough to bring airlines out of their cash hole, particularly with further lockdowns looming as COVID-19 cases rise.
Still, the industry's aid request has received wide bipartisan support but has so far failed to pass as Congress remains deadlocked over a broader COVID-19 relief and stimulus plan.
They are now hoping that Congress can pass airline aid through some other vehicle such as a funding bill this year, people familiar with the matter have said. 
Congress is not expected to return until Nov. 30.

Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), which has never laid off any employees in its 49-history, sent warnings of potential furloughs to about 400 employees on Wednesday.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>","Rivian CEO eyes smaller electric vehicles for China, Europe","By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - Electric vehicle startup Rivian, which is backed by Amazon (O:AMZN) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), on Wednesday said it plans to follow up its first two products, a full-size pickup and SUV, with smaller models targeted at China and Europe where it may eventually build some vehicles.
While Rivian plans to begin selling the SUV in Europe in 2022 and China soon after, ""what will really drive volume in those markets is the follow-on products"" that are smaller and tailored for overseas customers, Rivian founder and Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe told Reuters.
The smaller models, which are expected to share key components with the pickup and SUV, will ""fit some of those other markets really well, in particular China,"" Scaringe said.
""To really scale in those markets as we bring on follow-on products, having a production footprint outside the U.S. is going to be important,"" he said. ""That's a ways off."" 
Scaringe added: ""We wouldn't be serious about building a car company if we weren't thinking about China and Europe as important markets long term.""
The company's first plant in Normal, Illinois, has begun pilot production ahead of next year's launch of three models - the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which Scaringe described as ""halo products"" for Rivian, and a large electric delivery van for Amazon.
Speaking from a room overlooking the assembly line, Scaringe said the former Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) plant reflects an unusual degree of vertical integration, with room for building motors and battery packs for the vehicles and for further expansion.
The Amazon delivery van is built on a version of the same platform, or basic underpinnings, used by the R1T and R1S.
Rivian has said deliveries of the pickup would start in June 2021, while those of the SUV would begin in August. Launch editions of the vehicles are priced at $75,000 and $77,500, respectively, with a 300-mile (480 km) driving range for both.
The electric pickup market will soon be crowded as Ford, General Motors Co (N:GM) and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), as well as several other startups, are developing similar models. Numerous automakers also are rolling out electric SUVs.
In July, Rivian, founded in 2009, boosted its war chest with a $2.5-billion investment round led by T. Rowe Price, raising total investment in the startup to $6 billion. Investors include Soros Fund Management, Fidelity and BlackRock (N:BLK), as well as Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co (ALJ). 
Amazon, which has relationships and deals across the auto industry, led a $700 million investment round in Rivian last year.
The e-commerce company also ordered 100,000 electric vans from Rivian. The first Amazon vehicles go into production in Normal in late 2021, with all deliveries to be completed by 2024.

Scaringe said Rivian has begun setting up service centers and will deploy mobile units to handle maintenance and repair work on Amazon's vans, as well as Rivian vehicles for retail customers.

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (O:TSLA) surged 10% to end near a record high on Wednesday, extending a two day rally after it was announced the electric car maker will join the S&P 500.
The California company's stock has jumped nearly 20% since S&P Dow Jones Indices announced late on Monday it would add Tesla to Wall Street's most watched benchmark as of Dec. 21, a change that will force index funds to buy around $50 billion of its stock.
A blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle for Tesla's potential inclusion in the S&P 500, leading to speculation that the company, now with a market capitalization over $450 billion, might be added to the index and spark a surge in demand for its shares. 
Up about 500% in 2020, Tesla has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor (T:7203), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (N:GM).

Its stock tumbled 21% in one session on Sept. 8 after it was left out of a group companies being added to the S&P 500, underscoring how much many traders expected it to be added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Housing giants Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) would have to raise over $200 billion in new capital to fall in line with a rule finalized on Wednesday by their regulator.
The new rule from the Federal Housing Finance Agency places bank-like capital requirements on the pair, and was seen as a key step in preparing the two to eventually leave government control and return to operating as private companies.
The rule is ""substantively similar"" to one proposed by the FHFA back in May, the agency said. It establishes new capital and leverage requirements for the pair, as well as buffers that would allow the enterprises to continue guaranteeing mortgages even in an economic downturn. Fannie and Freddie guarantee roughly half of all the nation's mortgages.

All told, the final rule anticipates the pair would need roughly $283 billion in total capital. That is up by about $40 billion from the proposal, due in part to growing portfolios at Fannie and Freddie and also due to a ramped-up requirement for how much risk-based capital they should hold.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and BioNTech (DE:22UAy) could secure emergency U.S. and European authorization for their COVID-19 vaccine next month after final trial results showed it had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects, the drugmakers said on Wednesday.
The vaccine's efficacy was found to be consistent across different ages and ethnicities - a promising sign given the disease has disproportionately hurt the elderly and certain groups including Black people.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could grant emergency-use by the middle of December, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters TV. Conditional approval in the European Union could be secured in the second half of December, he added.
""If all goes well I could imagine that we gain approval in the second half of December and start deliveries before Christmas, but really only if all goes positively,"" he said.
The success rate of the vaccine developed by the U.S. drugmaker and German partner BioNTech was far higher than what regulators had said would have been acceptable. Experts said it was a significant achievement in the race to end the pandemic.
Of the 170 volunteers who contracted COVID-19 in Pfizer's trial involving over 43,000 people, 162 had received a placebo and not the vaccine, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective. Of the 10 people who had severe COVID-19, one had received the vaccine.
""A first in the history of mankind: less than a year from the sequence of the virus to the large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine, moreover based on a whole new technique,"" said Enrico Bucci, a biologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""Today is a special day."" 
BioNTech's Sahin said U.S. emergency use authorization (EUA) would be applied for on Friday. 
An FDA advisory committee tentatively plans to meet on Dec. 8-10 to discuss the vaccine, a source familiar with the situation said, though the dates could change. The FDA did not respond to requests for comment. 
COVID-19 RUNS RAMPANT
The final trial analysis comes a week after initial results showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective.  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine showing 94.5% effectiveness.
""We now have two safe and highly effective vaccines that could be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and ready to distribute within weeks,"" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.
The Moderna vaccine is likely to be authorized within seven to 10 days of Pfizer receiving its EUA, U.S. officials said, with states ready to begin distribution within 24 hours.
The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life.
The news was especially welcome with the virus again running rampant around the world, setting records for new infections and hospitalizations almost daily. 
The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to have 94% efficacy in people over age 65, a particularly high-risk group.
""This is the evidence we needed to ensure that the most vulnerable people are protected,"" said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool's department of pharmacology.
Global shares rose as the trial results countered concerns around the soaring infection rate. Pfizer shares were up 1.6% while BioNTech jumped 3.8% in the United States. Moderna shares fell 3.6%. [MKTS/GLOB] 
Investors have treated vaccine development as a race between companies, although there is likely to be global demand for as much vaccine as can be produced for the foreseeable future.
DISTRIBUTING SHOTS
Pfizer said it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.
While some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritized in the United States and Britain for vaccinations, it will be months before large-scale rollouts begin in either country. 
On Wednesday, Pfizer said it had offered to provide Brazil with millions of doses in the first half of 2021. It also has agreements with the European Union, Germany and Japan where distribution could begin next year. 
Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization's top emergency expert, said it would be at least 4-6 months before significant levels of vaccination were taking place around the world.
Distribution of a Pfizer-BioNTech shot is complicated by the need to store it at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius. It can, however, be kept in normal refrigeration for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.
Moderna's vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20C though it is expected to be stable for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36°-46°F).
FATIGUE AND HEADACHES
Pfizer said vaccine was well-tolerated and that side effects were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The only severe adverse events experienced by volunteers were fatigue (3.8%) and headaches (2%) after the second dose. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.
""These are extraordinary results, and the safety data look good,"" said David Spiegelhalter, a professor and expert in risk and evidence communication at the University of Cambridge. 
Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines, the next late-stage data will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said it is on track to deliver data this year.
Authorization of vaccines for children will take longer. Only Pfizer has started vaccinating volunteers under age 18 and as young as 12. Moderna and J&J have said they hope to start testing the vaccine in younger people soon.

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The United States lifted a 20-month-old flight ban on Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX on Wednesday, easing a safety crisis that left its top exporter with a tarnished reputation and hundreds of idle jets. But relatives of crash victims denounced the move. 
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson signed an order lifting the longest jet grounding in commercial aviation history, and the agency released final details of the software, system and training upgrades Boeing and airlines must complete before carrying passengers.
When flights resume, Boeing will be running a 24-hour war room to monitor all MAX flights for potential problems, from stuck landing gear to health emergencies, three people familiar with the matter said.
The 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months in 2018 and 2019 and triggered a hailstorm of investigations, frayed U.S. leadership in global aviation and cost Boeing some $20 billion.
""This airplane is the most scrutinized airplane in aviation history,"" Dickson told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. ""The design changes that are being put in place completely eliminate the possibility of an accident occurring that is similar to the two accidents.""
""I feel 100% confident,"" he added. ""We have run this thing top to bottom ... We’ve done everything humanly possible to make sure.""
While U.S. airlines can start flying commercially once they complete the FAA's requirements, including a one-time simulator training session for all MAX pilots, flights elsewhere will depend on approval from other regulators across the globe.
In a show of independence, Canada and Brazil said on Wednesday they were continuing their own reviews but expected to conclude the process soon, illustrating how the 737 MAX crashes upended a once U.S.-dominated airline safety system in which nations large and small for decades moved in lock-step with the FAA. 
Questions remain over how quickly other regulators, especially in China, will lift their flight bans. 
The U.S. planemaker's best-selling jet will make its comeback facing headwinds from a resurgent coronavirus pandemic, new European trade tariffs and mistrust of one of the most scrutinized brands in aviation.
The 737 MAX is a re-engined upgrade of a jet introduced in the 1960s. Single-aisle jets like the MAX and rival Airbus A320neo are workhorses that dominate global fleets and provide a major source of industry profit. 
Boeing shares were down 2.3% at $205.27 late on Wednesday afternoon.
Families of the Ethiopian crash victims said in a statement they felt ""sheer disappointment and renewed grief"" following the FAA's decision to return the aircraft to service.
""Our family was broken,"" Naoise Ryan, whose 39-year-old husband died aboard Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, said on Tuesday. 
LONG RUNWAY AHEAD
While regulators were quick to ground the plane globally after the second MAX crash in March 2019, the process of putting it back in the air is long and complex.
The FAA is requiring new pilot training and software upgrades to deal with a stall-prevention system called MCAS, which in both crashes repeatedly shoved down the jet's nose as pilots struggled to regain control.
U.S. airlines with 737 MAX jets said on Wednesday they would complete the FAA's maintenance and training requirement as they gradually return the plane to schedules that have been drastically reduced in the pandemic.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) plans to relaunch the first commercial MAX flight since the grounding on Dec. 29, followed by United Airlines in the first quarter of 2021 and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) in the second quarter.
Meanwhile, Alaska Airlines expects to receive its first 737 MAX early next year and begin passenger service in March. 
However, in a sign of the worsening economy since the MAX was grounded, Boeing customer Norwegian Air sought bankruptcy protection on Wednesday amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The FAA, which has faced accusations of being too close to Boeing in the past, said it plans in-person inspections of some 450 737 MAXs built and parked during the flight ban which could take at least a year to complete, prolonging the jets' deliveries.
A humbled Boeing is scrambling to keep up maintenance and find new buyers for many of its mothballed 737 MAXs. Boeing, which in normal years describes itself as the largest U.S. exporter, has removed more than 1,000 MAX jets from its official backlog because orders were canceled or were in doubt.

""Every next plane we deliver is an opportunity to rebuild our brand and regain trust,"" Boeing's chief executive, Dave Calhoun, told employees in a memo.
Even with all the hurdles, resuming deliveries of the 737 MAX will generate cash for Boeing and hundreds of strained parts suppliers.
Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said last month he expects about half of the 450 stored jets to be delivered by the end of next year, with the majority of remaining jets handed over in 2022.
Investigation reports have faulted Boeing and the FAA on the plane's development and for concealing information about MCAS from pilots, while a Justice Department criminal probe is ongoing. Dickson said the FAA is still reviewing Boeing's actions in the MAX and could take additional enforcement actions. Boeing also faces lawsuits from victims' families.

U.S. lawmakers are also weighing proposals to reform the jet safety certification process.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks lost substantial ground at the close of a see-saw session on Wednesday as investors weighed encouraging vaccine developments against surging COVID-19 infections and lockdowns.
While all three major U.S. stock indexes closed in the red, surging Tesla Inc (O:TLSA) shares helped cap the Nasdaq's loss.
""It's a confused market because portfolio managers don't know which time period to focus on,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""It's this trade-off between the near term over the six to nine months of continued spread of the virus and the period after that when everyone's vaccinated and the virus is eradicated.""
""There's a lot of issues out there but the decided bias has been toward value and cyclicals,"" Ghriskey added.
 Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech (O:BNTX) revealed a 95% success rate at the conclusion of their COVID-19 vaccine trial, just days after  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) announced a similar rate of success in preliminary data from its vaccine candidate.
Market participants have been greeting vaccine developments with guarded optimism as global new infections soar to record levels, raising the possibility of increased restrictions as the economy struggles to recover from recession. The United States remains the country worst affected by the pandemic.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 345.91 points, or 1.16%, to 29,437.44, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 41.81 points, or 1.16%, to 3,567.72 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 97.74 points, or 0.82%, to 11,801.60.
Third-quarter reporting season has reached the final inning, with 468 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 84.4% have surprised consensus to the upside, according to Refinitiv.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) initially provided the biggest lift to the Dow after the Federal Aviation Commission green-lighted the planemaker's grounded 737 MAX aircraft to resume flights, but its shares later reversed course.
Shares of  Target  Corp (N:TGT) advanced after handily beating quarterly profit and sales estimates, which were boosted by a 155% jump in comparable digital sales.

Lowe's Companies Inc (N:LOW) dropped after the home improvement retailer forecast lower-than-expected holiday quarter earnings as it beefs up its online business and doles out employee bonuses to ease pandemic-related hardship.

Investing.com - The Dow ended lower following late-day selling Wednesday on signs of further Covid-19 restrictions in the U.S. that threaten the pace of the recovery, and an intraday reverse in Boeing.   
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.16%, or 345 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.17%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.82%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) cut gains after Morgan Stanley warned that bullish sentiment on the stock was getting ahead of fundamentals. The aircraft had been up more than 6% intraday after the Federal Aviation Authority ordered the ungrounding of Boeing's 737 Max, which was involved in two deadly crashes.
The positive vaccine news and the 737 Max ungrounding ""does not affect our financial estimates for Boeing,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note, Bloomberg reported. Getting more positive on Boeing would require a ramp-up in orders of the aircraft.
Following the news, several airlines that carry the 737 Max in their fleet confirmed they would begin to fly the jets within weeks.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) said it plans to fly its Boeing 737 Max jets in the first quarter next year, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said it will fly at the end of the year. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) will fly the jets in the second quarter.
Sentiment on stocks was dealt a further blow on signs of further restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, with deaths nearing 250,000. New York City shut schools starting on Thursday, and switched to fully remote learning.  
The move higher in value stocks on positive vaccine faded, adding downside momentum on the broader market.    
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech reported final data analysis showing their coronavirus vaccine was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19, and also said they had surpassed the safety levels needed to seek authorization for the vaccine within days.
Energy stocks also gave up gains even as oil prices were pushed higher following a smaller-than-expected build in weekly inventories.
U.S. weekly crude inventories rose by 0.78 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, well below forecasts of 1.65 million.
On the earnings front, investors digested earnings from  Target  and Lowe's.
Target (NYSE:TGT) reported better-than-expected earnings of $2.79 a share and same comparable-store sales of 20.7% that topped estimates, sending its shares about 3% higher.
Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW), meanwhile, reported third-quarter earnings of $1.98 per share just missed estimates, but same-store sales jumped 30.1%, above expectations for a 22.8% increase. Its shares fell 8%.
Tech struggled to participate in the broader move higher. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended lower.

Investing.com --  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) will get to fly its 737 Max jets once again, but with Covid-19 cases spiking every day in the U.S., the question is when.
Stocks pared gains on Wednesday with the Dow ending in red territory. The U.S. recorded more than a quarter of a million deaths from coronavirus, a grim milestone in the eight-month pandemic as public health professionals urge people to give up on holiday gatherings. Boeing shares fell 3%.
The Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. is just a week away. Positive news about vaccines has countered negative headlines about the spread of the virus as well as President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede the election. 
Retail has been a bright spot in recent earnings, as e-commerce sales help stores overcome lower foot traffic.  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) beat expectations on Wednesday, and more retailers are due to report Thursday.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. Retailer earnings in the spotlight
Warehouse club  BJs Wholesale Club Holdings Inc  (NYSE:BJ) and department store giant Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) report in the morning. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings per share of 65 cents for BJ’s Wholesale on revenue of $3.7 billion. Macy’s is seen reporting a loss of 84 cents a share on revenue of $3.9 billion.
 Ross Stores Inc  (NASDAQ:ROST) is seen reporting earrings of 60 cents a share on revenue of $3.4 billion.
2. Jobless claims seen coming in about the same as before
Thursday is the day we get unemployment numbers for the prior week. Initial claims are expected to be 707,000, not much changed from the prior week as households and businesses continue to struggle with the aftermath of pandemic shutdowns and new shutdowns in some locations.
Continuing claims are expected to be 6.47 million, slightly lower than the prior week as joblessness continues to remain elevated. Congress has continued to waffle on approving a new round of economic stimulus that could aid families and businesses.
3. Existing home sales hint at consumer spending
A feature of the pandemic has been a move of households from urban centers to the suburbs, boosting shares of homebuilders but also sales of existing homes. On Thursday, existing home sales for October are due out. They are expected to be 6.4 million, adding to the similarly strong trend in September.
As with retailer earnings, existing home sales are a barometer of consumer spending power. Disappointing data on that front weighed on stocks earlier this week.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Explainer: What is happening with the Keystone XL oil pipeline?,"By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - TC Energy (NYSE:TRP) Corp says it is continuing to advance its Keystone XL (KXL) oil pipeline, the $9 billion project that would move oil from the province of Alberta to Nebraska. 
Most recently, a Canadian indigenous group said it would invest C$1 billion ($764.35 million) in the project, which has been in the works for 12 years.
That surprised some, as KXL has been slowed by legal issues in the United States, and faces a potential fatal blow next year when President-elect Joseph Biden takes office, if he follows through on a vow to scrap KXL's presidential permit. 
WHY HAS THIS PROJECT BEEN DELAYED SO LONG?
Keystone XL was an early target in a strategy by environmentalists to choke the expansion of Canada's oil sands by opposing new pipelines to move its crude to refineries. Former U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, axed the project in 2015, saying Canada would reap most of the economic benefits while the project would add to greenhouse gas emissions. President Donald Trump, a Republican, issued a presidential permit in 2017 that allowed the line to move forward, and several environmental groups sued the U.S. government.
IS THIS PIPELINE STILL NECESSARY?
This is debateable. Work to increase capacity of two other Canadian export pipelines, the government-owned Trans Mountain and Enbridge (NYSE:ENB)'s Line 3, is proceeding with fewer remaining hurdles than KXL. Some analysts say these projects will provide enough capacity for the foreseeable future, now that analysts and major industry groups, including OPEC, expect that global oil demand will peak sooner than was previously anticipated.
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has said the project is important because he is not certain that Trans Mountain will proceed. 
WHAT IS THE STATE OF CONSTRUCTION?
Construction is well under way in Canada. The international border crossing is complete. In the United States, TC has started construction on pump stations in each of the states the line will pass through, but legal setbacks cost it much of the 2020 construction season.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld an injunction on KXL construction in July, leaving a ruling in place that blocks TC's use of a federal permit that allows dredging work on pipelines across water bodies.
TC continues to plan for a 2023 in-service date.
WHAT HAPPENS IF BIDEN REVOKES KXL'S PERMIT?
TC requires the permit to build and operate KXL. 
Given the permit's importance, TC, the Canadian and Alberta governments are trying to convince Biden to allow the project. TC is looking for further equity investments from U.S. indigenous groups and has awarded construction work to four U.S. unions, hoping to make the project more politically palatable.
TC is also framing KXL as a jobs-creating project that could bolster Biden's Build Back Better economic plan.
If Biden revokes KXL's permit, it would be a blow to TC's growth plans, give Canadian oil shippers fewer future options and likely divert more volumes to competitor Enbridge's Mainline.
WHO OWNS KEYSTONE XL?
TC is still the major investor, but it has now sold significant minority stakes to both the Alberta government, and to Natural Law Energy (NLE). NLE is a coalition of five First Nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan, whose traditional lands KXL crosses.
NLE's investment is expected to close in the third quarter, 2021, subject to financing, by which time it should be clear what position Biden will take.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>",COVID-19 survivors may have long lasting immunity; Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective in trial,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
Immune protection against severe reinfection appears lasting
Regardless of their detectable antibody levels, most COVID-19 survivors are likely to have lasting protection against severe COVID-19 if they become reinfected, thanks to other components of the body's immune response that remember the new coronavirus in different ways, researchers say. In a study of 185 patients, including 41 who had been infected more than six months earlier, scientists at La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California found that multiple branches of the immune system - not just antibodies - recognized the novel coronavirus for at least eight months. For example, so-called memory B cells that could recognize the virus and produce antibodies to fight it were more abundant six months after infection than at one month, they reported in a paper posted on Monday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. The new findings ""suggest that the immune system can remember the virus for years, and most people may be protected from severe COVID-19 for a substantial time,"" said study leaders Shane Crotty and Alessandro Sette. (https:// Final data from  Pfizer  vaccine trial shows 95% efficacy Final results from Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s pivotal COVID-19 vaccine trial show it had a 95% success rate - even higher than an earlier analysis - and two months of follow-up data without serious side effects, the company said on Wednesday. In the study involving about 43,000 volunteers, 162 of the 170 who contracted COVID-19 had received a placebo, not the vaccine. Of the 10 participants who had severe COVID-19, only one had received the vaccine. The final analysis of the trial's data comes a week after interim results showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine, showing 94.5% effectiveness. Pfizer said the efficacy its two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), was consistent across different age and ethnic groups. Efficacy in adults over age 65 was over 94%. Pfizer said it expects to make up to 50 million vaccine doses this year - enough to inoculate 25 million people - and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Respiratory muscle damage linked to severe COVID-19 Critically ill COVID-19 patients develop virus-induced damage of respiratory muscles, scientists at Amsterdam UMC in The Netherlands reported on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. They performed autopsy studies of the diaphragm, the main respiratory muscle, in 26 COVID-19 patients who died in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 8 ICU patients who died without COVID-19. In everyone, the diaphragm muscle cell membranes contained a protein called ACE2, which the new coronavirus uses as an entryway into cells. The researchers found genetic evidence of the virus in diaphragm muscle cells in some of those who died from COVID-19, and microscopy analyses showed much more connective tissue scarring (fibrosis) in COVID-19 patients' diaphragms, indicating damage, study coauthor Coen Ottenheijm told Reuters. He said the diaphragm damage may help explain why it is often difficult for COVID-19 patients to breathe on their own again after they have been on mechanical ventilators in the ICU. It may also explain the persistent shortness of breath in patients recovering from COVID-19. (https:// Cardiac arrest survival is down during the pandemic U.S. data from early this year suggest the pandemic has led to decreased survival rates after ""out-of-hospital"" cardiac arrest. Based on nationwide data, the proportion of patients whose hearts could be restarted was 21% lower in March-April 2020 than in the same period in 2019, researchers reported on Saturday at the annual American Heart Association meeting, held virtually this year, and in JAMA Cardiology. The proportion of patients who survived to be discharged from hospitals was also lower in 2020, at 6.6%, versus 9.8% in 2019. Survival rates after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest had nearly doubled in the last 20 years, and ""we want to make sure we don't lose those gains,"" said coauthor Dr. Paul Chan of St. Luke's Mid-America Heart Institute in Missouri. Dr. Clifton Callaway of the University of Pittsburgh, who viewed the presentation but was not involved in the study, said other viewers noted it is more difficult for paramedics to work wearing full personal protective gear as it takes time to put on and can impede emergency care. Furthermore, some patients may have delayed calling for help over concerns of becoming infected with the coronavirus. And some may have also had COVID-19, making their medical condition more severe.

(Reuters) - S&P 500 dividends are likely to fall about 1% this year, much less than previously expected, as companies reinstate previously suspended payments as they become more confident about recovering from the coronavirus, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 dividends on track for minor 2020 decline - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/DIVIDENDS/xegvbqlmkpq/chart.png) 
S&P 500 (SPX) companies slashed or suspended over $40 billion in dividends in the second quarter, the deepest quarterly drop since 2009.
But cuts tapered off mid-year as the U.S. economy began to rebound and some companies reinstated their dividends, while Microsoft (O:MSFT) in September hiked its dividend by 10%.
As a result, dividends paid by S&P 500 companies are likely to end 2020 at $479.5 billion, compared to $485.5 billion last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Although smaller than expected, the annual decline would still be the first since 2009 during the financial crisis.
S&P Dow Jones Indices' newest projection is a major improvement from earlier in 2020, when analysts expected the pandemic to result in as much as a 10% annual decline in dividends.
""Last year was a record year. This year your paycheck is going to be down 1%,"" said S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt. ""You can cry, but I’m not feeling sad for 1%.""

Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has imposed trade curbs on Chinese telecoms equipment and smartphone maker Huawei [HWT.UL], seeking to hobble its ability to equip next-generation 5G mobile networks.
Although Infineon is a Huawei supplier, its main power-management products tie it more to China's broad industrial development than to 5G, Ploss told the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) European Technology, Media and Telecoms conference.
""We think we can still compete quite nicely,"" Ploss told the online event, adding that Infineon's development roadmap for the coming years was ""very healthy"". [nL8N2HV0ZR]
Infineon makes more than two-fifths of revenue in the auto industry, where a recovery in China contrasts with a wider global industry slump. It strengthened its autos presence with the $10 billion takeover of Cypress Technologies last year.
Infineon did face growing competition from China-based power-management chipmakers, Ploss said. While it was confident of its position in the profitable premium segment, Infineon did need to defend its position in commoditised parts of the market.

""We need to compete here because you don't want to let these markets go,"" said Ploss, warning the alternative would be to ""get eaten up by the competition Pacman"".

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will pay $113 million to settle allegations from 33 U.S. states and the District of Columbia that it slowed down iPhones to mask battery issues and get users to purchase new devices, state officials announced on Wednesday.
The deal with a coalition led by Arizona, Arkansas and Indiana is separate from a proposed settlement Apple reached in March to pay affected iPhone owners up to $500 million to stem a class action.
Apple in 2016 quietly updated software on models of the iPhone 6, 7 and SE to throttle chip speeds so that aging batteries on the devices would not send power spikes to the phone's processor and cause it to unexpectedly shut down. States contended Apple acted deceptively and should have replaced batteries or disclosed the issue. 
Millions of users were affected by power shutoffs, according to an Arizona court filing.
""My colleagues and I are trying to get the attention of these big tech companies, and you would hope a multimillion-dollar judgment with more than 30 states will get their attention,"" Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in an interview. 
""Companies cannot be disingenuous and conceal things,"" he added. 
Apple, which has denied wrongdoing, declined to comment on the settlement.
Apple also agreed for the next three years to provide ""truthful information"" about iPhone power management across its website, software update notes and iPhone settings. Arizona said Apple's present disclosures and options are sufficient. The settlement with states is subject to court approval.
The multistate investigation into Apple, which Reuters first reported in July, is part of a wave of probes into the world's biggest technology providers.
Republican attorneys general in 11 U.S. states last month joined the U.S. Justice Department in an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, and large, bipartisan groups of attorneys general have ongoing investigations into Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) over potentially deceptive and anticompetitive practices.
Apple acknowledged its update reduced power demands after researchers found unusual slowdowns in 2017. The company publicly apologized and slashed prices on battery replacements.

The settlement includes $5 million to Arizona, $24.6 million to Apple's home state of California and $7.6 million to Texas. The latter two states have the nation's Nos. 1 and 2 affected iPhone user bases. Brnovich said the penalty in his state would help fund more investigations into tech and other companies.

(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has an opportunity to start fresh with China, a move that would benefit both nations, Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg, chairman of Starr Insurance Companies, told Reuters on Wednesday.
""President-elect Biden is no stranger to that problem,"" Greenberg said at the Reuters Events Future of Insurance USA conference https://vimeo.com/480869621/53512e1a2c. ""We can start anew with that relationship, and we should.""
Greenberg's comments are notable because of his extensive experience in expanding U.S. insurance offerings into China.
The 95-year-old executive first traveled to China more than 40 years ago, eventually helping the country launch its first insurance operation.
At the time, Greenberg was CEO at American International Group Inc (N:AIG), then a subsidiary of his current company, which has operated in China for more than a century. AIG later launched the first licensed foreign insurer in China. 
AIG has since spun off the bulk of the China operations Greenberg built, to repay the U.S. government for a $180 billion bailout during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
In the interview, Greenberg encouraged Biden to respond to a congratulatory message China sent last Friday. He also gave some credit to President Donald Trump for trying to balance trade relationships between the United States and China, but stopped short of calling Trump's hardline policies a success.
Trump signed a multibillion-dollar trade deal with China in January that cut some U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Chinese pledges to purchase more American farm, energy and manufactured goods. The agreement also addressed some U.S. complaints about intellectual property practices.
The president's rhetoric on China has been severe at times, accusing the country of ripping off the United States and causing a pandemic he occasionally calls the ""Wuhan virus,"" referring to a Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have begun.
Chinese President Xi Jinping also has some work to do, Greenberg said, criticizing the leader for China's behavior toward countries in Southeast Asia. U.S. embassies in Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Cambodia have accused China of encroaching on others' sovereignty by, for example, using dams to hold back water from the Mekong River during a drought last year.
Trump ""did a great deal to run on an even track,"" Greenberg said. ""But maybe too fast, too far. So there'll be an opportunity for [Biden] to probably do halfway in between.""

1225,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",U.S. insurance executives seek to fix industry's diversity problem,"By Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) - When Jerald Tillman and Mike James started their careers more than 20 years ago, working in the U.S. insurance industry was not on their radar, but programs to attract Blacks and other minorities brought them into the fold.
Today, Tillman runs his own insurance agency in Ohio and is the founder of the National African American Insurance Association. James, who is also Black, heads the division in charge of life insurance, long-term care, annuities and wealth management at broker NFP in its Boston office.
They and other minority insurance leaders told Reuters that despite years of recruitment and a strong pipeline of talent, the industry has not changed enough where it matters most: at the top.
""There are not enough people of color in executive leadership in the insurance industry,"" James said in an interview.
Three insurance industry leaders who spoke at the Future of Insurance USA conference said during a panel hosted by Reuters Events on Tuesday that they are working to fix what they described as diversity shortcomings in the industry. 
For example, only three of 168 senior executives of the top 10 U.S. insurers and brokers by market value are Black, according to a Reuters review of their websites. Among 119 board members at the same companies, 13 are Black.
""We must get white males involved with us in this leadership effort,"" George Nichols III, president of the American College of Financial Services and the first African-American insurance commissioner in Kentucky, said during the panel discussion. ""They control the positions. They control the decision-making process.""
Criticism of corporate America for a lack of diversity intensified after a white Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, a Black man, in May, setting off nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality.
Insurance, though improving, remains a less diverse industry than other financial services and U.S. employers as a whole, research has shown.
Non-white employees, including Black, Asian and other racial minorities, totaled 21.4% of the workforce at U.S. insurance companies last year, up from 19.8% in 2018 and 15.3% in 2010, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence. 
That compares with 24.9% of employees who are non-white in banking and related activities and 22.3% for the overall workforce, it said.
DOOR 'BLOWN OPEN' 
Police killings of Blacks and the resulting civil unrest this year have sparked discussions ""that we never used to have before - the hard conversations about race,"" Lata Reddy, senior vice president of Inclusive Solutions at Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) and chair of The Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Foundation, told the panel.
""The opportunity to build right now on that is huge,"" said Reddy, who identifies as Indian American. ""A door has been blown open and it's incumbent upon all of us to run through it.""
Diversity programs work best when top leaders see the benefits and give strong support, but awareness also is critical throughout a company. 
Research has shown direct managers have even more impact than senior leaders on employees' experiences, Lauren Young, director of diversity and inclusion at Zurich North America, part of Zurich Insurance Group AG (S:ZURN), said during the event.
""If they're not aware of their own unconscious bias, it's very difficult for them to understand what role they play,"" said Young, who is Black. 
Zurich held a town hall in June to allow Black employees to share stories about facing inequality. More than 3,000 people attended what became a catalyst for more action, Young said. 
""It was very raw, it was very honest, there was a lot of emotion felt,"" she said. 
ARE YOU HIRING?
When companies say they are committed to increasing the number of minority employees they have, Nichols said he wonders if they're hiring.
If not, ""you've just created a dynamic in your organization that may not be so great,"" he said. ""Because in order for you to bring these folks in, somebody may have to go if you're not creating new jobs and new opportunities.""
Reddy said research has shown racial diversity improves a company's ability to innovate, reduce risk and bring different perspectives to decisions. 
""Without that (diversity) we're not going to be able to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse customer base,"" Reddy said. 
""Ultimately what we're doing is leaving money on the table.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lawyer representing Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google in the search and advertising giant's legal fight with the government pressed on Wednesday for a faster release of documents used to write the complaint against the company.
""We need to get access to that material. We need to know more about the contours of that material,"" said Google attorney John Schmidtlein in a status conference held by phone.
Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is hearing the case in which the Justice Department accused the $1 trillion company in October of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades.
Mehta, who indicated he would not be surprised if a trial lasted for months, asked the Justice Department's attorney if Google could quickly be given a list of companies that gave information to the government, how much information each gave and copies of any document requests.
The Justice Department's Kenneth Dintzer made no promises but added that what Google asked for ""is not unreasonable.""
Judge Mehta noted that Google would soon receive a list of 100 potential witnesses. ""It seems like you're going to have a pretty good window into the government's case,"" he said.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others which assisted the government are to tell the court on Friday how they want their information treated.
Dintzer also noted that seven states investigating Google said in October that if they opt to sue, they would want to consolidate their case with the government's. Dintzer said that statement remained relevant.

Google is expected to file an answer to the government's complaint before Dec. 21.

""This is childish behavior on the part of our politicians,"" Dimon said about an impasse between Democrats and Republicans over how much additional spending should be authorized.
The two parties should split the difference between the amounts they want to devote to coronavirus relief, he said.
""Just get it done,"" he said, declining to blame one side over the other.
The issue came up again in Congress on Wednesday, as U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi had formally invited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans to bipartisan talks on relief legislation. 
Earlier in the day, McConnell said Congress should aim for agreement on items where there is little disagreement. But he blamed Democrats for blocking earlier Senate Republican efforts to approve spending packages of $500 billion, which Democrats have called inadequate.
Dimon also advocated higher taxes to pay for stimulus spending, but said hikes have to be done in a way that does not harm economic growth. 

""Taxing my income a little bit more, that does not hurt growth,"" he said. ""Taxing capital formation, over time, hurts growth. We should have a competitive international tax system for business.""

Lucira Health’s single-use test kit is good for people over 14 years old and will use a self-collected nasal swab. Results are shown within 30 minutes.
The test kit will cost around $50, according to the California-based company, and is expected to be available nationally through health care providers by early spring 2021.
Although a recent string of positive news from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) on potential vaccines has raised hopes of combating COVID-19, testing still is a key factor in controlling the spread of new cases, which have soared across the U.S. this fall.

Investing.com --  Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND)'s doing a good job of changing the subject. Shares are up more than 5% after the company issued a press release announcing two new versions of the Beyond Burger, and sending out an email saying it would start selling a plant-based minced pork product at five restaurants in China. CNN said the plant-based minced pork product would be available only for a limited time. 
The relatively insignificant announcements come on the heels of McDonald's announcing its plant-based meat platform, the McPlant, and confusion as to whether or not Beyond Meat is involved in the project. The two had previously partnered to serve Beyond Meat burgers at stores, but that was discontinued earlier this year. 
Beyond Meat said the company co-created the plant-based patty that will be a part of the McPlant line, to which McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) declined to comment. 
Bloomberg's Kyle Stock, though, seems to have nailed the puzzle. He called the McPlant name ""fantastic"" in a Sunday column.
""The name is one of the many things that probably would not have been possible had McDonald’s gone with a third-party supplier like Beyond Meat for its cow-free protein. The decision to keep its veggie-forward products in-house, announced last week, is certainly an anomaly in the fast-food world,"" Stock wrote. Thanks for clearing that up.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",GM will announce boosted spending plans for EVs on Thursday: sources,"By Ben Klayman and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will roll out details of an expanded and accelerated electric vehicle strategy on Thursday in an effort to convince investors it can be a serious competitor to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, people familiar with the plans said.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra, who is scheduled to speak at a conference hosted by  Barclays  (LON:BARC), is expected to say the automaker is ready to spend more on electric models by 2025 than the $20 billion previously outlined, the sources said. 
Supplier sources said previous plans to make the Cadillac brand all electric by 2030 are being sped up, possibly to 2025, and other sources said that acceleration will be repeated in other brands and in segments such as commercial vans.
Asked about the Thursday appearance, a GM spokeswoman called talk of increased spending speculative and declined to give details.
The Detroit automaker is also expected to discuss a new timeline for many of the EVs to follow those already identified, such as the GMC Hummer EV pick-up and Cadillac Lyriq crossover, people familiar with the plans said.
Lyriq is slated to go into production in late 2022, but GM officials have been stung by criticism the automaker was bringing the vehicle to market too late, one source said. 
""The pull-ahead in programs is real and the organization is really doubling down on speeding up product development,"" the source said.
Barra and other GM executives have been signaling the automaker's EV acceleration plans. She said earlier this month GM would boost capital spending over the next three years to speed EV development and was talking with other automakers about partnerships to develop more vehicles using GM's battery technology.
Last week, a GM executive said the company had pulled forward the rollout of two ""major"" EV programs, and GM officials have touted the faster 18-month development time for the Hummer truck.
Tesla's soaring market capitalization, and growing pressure from regulators to phase out carbon-emitting engines, has put pressure on established automakers to respond to investors who view their internal combustion lineups as outmoded and doomed in the long run.
A critical part of GM's pitch to investors has been its new Ultium batteries, which it estimates will offer an electric driving range of 400 miles or more on a single charge. It is building a battery plant with Korean battery maker LG Chem in northeast Ohio. 
GM has said it plans to raise annual capital spending through at least 2023 to above the $7 billion rate previously outlined to fund its new timetable for EVs.

That’s according to consultancy Bain. 
It predicts sales of expensive handbags and the like will drop 23% this year to 258 billion dollars. 
That’s actually at the better end of a forecast range it gave in the spring. 
Back then it said sales might drop as much as 35%. 
But the outlook could yet get worse again, with fresh lockdowns in Europe among factors that might further sap sales. 
China is the one bright spot. 
Sales on the mainland are seen growing by 45% at current exchange rates to about 52 billion dollars. 
Demand there has surged since the country emerged from lockdowns in the spring. 
Bain says revenues for the likes of Louis Vuitton and Prada (OTC:PRDSY) should partially recover in 2021. 
But it predicts that it could be 2022 or even later before luxury sales recover to pre-crisis levels. 
The consultants say this year’s events have also accelerated other trends. 
Consumers stuck at home have driven a near-doubling in online sales of high-end goods.

Investing.com -- Americans are living life comfortably, helping La-Z-Boy shares jump 11% after the furniture maker gave strong guidance for upcoming quarters.
Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter are expected to jump 40% to 45% on record demand for recliners, driven by stay-at-home mandates as the country scrambles to stem the spread of Covid-19. Suddenly, a recliner seems like a brilliant idea, doesn't it? 
Anyway, La-Z-Boy reported second fiscal 2021 quarter earnings per share of 82 cents, which was better than the expected 50 cents, while revenue of $459 million compared to the estimated $434 million.
Americans are also still spending at retailers including  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and TJX (NYSE:TJX), which are trading up 6% and 3%, respectively, after reporting better-than-expected earnings.
Target's earnings per share of $2.79 beat the expected $1.60 on sales of $22.63 billion, which were higher than the estimated $20.76 billion. Target said third quarter comparable sales grew almost 21%, and digital comparable sales were up 155%.     
TJX reported EPS of 71 cents, higher than the estimated 40 cents. Sales of $10.12 billion beat the $9.37 billion expectation.
La-Z-Boy, which sells not only recliners but also pet beds, dining room sets and couches (who knew?), is expanding its manufacturing capacity in Mexico as it seeks to keep up with the sudden need Americans are feeling to invest in their homes. 
""Demand across all La-Z-Boy Incorporated businesses is at record levels as consumers continue to allocate more discretionary spending to home furnishings,"" said La-Z-Boy Chief Executive Officer Kurt L. Darrow in a statement. ""Orders are fueling an unprecedented backlog and our supply chain team is doing a great job to continually increase weekly production to service customers and drive increased delivered sales.""
Darrow said he's optimistic that the company will deliver strong results in the second half of fiscal 2021 as it ""significantly"" increases production capacity.  La-Z-Boy expects consolidated sales growth in the third quarter of flat to 4% above the prior year's record-high third quarter, and fiscal 2021 fourth quarter sales growth of 40% to 45% versus the prior-year quarter.        
Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), however, failed to impress. Third-quarter same-store sales growth of more than 30% wasn't enough to counter higher costs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds pulled $4.1 billion from United States stocks in the third quarter, while adding to their U.S. bond holdings by the most in at least three years, data showed on Wednesday. 
Around $4.5 billion was sucked into U.S. fixed income, with the bulk into short-duration instruments, according to the eVestment data on strategies managed by third-party fund managers.
The activity came ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, which sparked volatility on Wall Street in the week prior to the vote as investors worried about the possibility of a contested outcome and as coronavirus cases soared globally.
The exodus from U.S. stocks, the most in at least three years, was likely not driven by the need for cash for governments at home, said Elliot Hentov, head of policy research at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, noting that recent debt issuance by sovereign funds' governments was up massively and that they had a decent cash pile ahead of the coronavirus crisis.
""The U.S. election may partially have been a driver and expectations of an eventual non-U.S. recovery picking up, as well as the fact that markets had recovered a lot by Q3 and, if well timed, it was an opportune moment to sell,"" Hentov said.
The U.S. stocks outflow, which contrasted with an inflow into non-U.S. equity for the second quarter in a row, was evidenced by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund cutting its exposure to North American equities by $3 billion in the third quarter, a regulatory filing showed.
""SWFs are becoming much more agile in response to the extreme fluctuations we have seen this year,"" said Rod Ringrow, head of official institutions at asset manager Invesco. ""I think these comments can be applied to the PIF as well, although we do not see any pressure for cash calls as of now, the PIF continues to lead the efforts to rebalance the (Saudi Arabian) economy away from reliance on hydro-carbon revenue, actively managing their portfolio to provide funds for investment makes sense.""
The move into U.S. fixed income contrasted with an outflow from non-U.S. fixed income by almost the same amount, the data showed. 
The preference for U.S. bonds could be a desire to seek quasi-cash in anticipation of future liquidity needs, said Hentov.
Governments in several countries have drawn down savings from their funds in the months after the pandemic.
Around 24 withdrawals totalling about $137 billion had been made from sovereign funds globally in the wake of the pandemic and commodity price collapse, Global SWF said in September.
Across all forms of investment, U.S. allocations had grown in 11 out of a total of 15 sovereign funds which disclosed geographic allocation in their latest annual reports, noted Javier Capapé, director of the sovereign wealth research at IE Center for the Governance of Change.

That increase may be challenged by the possible continuation under Joe Biden's administration of the economic protectionism started under Donald Trump's presidency, said Capapé.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Target beats estimates as same-day delivery boosts online demand,"By Aishwarya Venugopal and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) blew past analyst expectations for quarterly profit and sales on Wednesday as more Americans used the retailer's quick-delivery services to buy everything from electronics to home goods during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shares of the Minneapolis-based retailer hit a record high of $168.42 with a gain of about 3% in morning trading, adding to the 27% advance seen so far this year.
Comparable digital sales rose 155% in the third quarter, the company said, driven largely by same-day services like Drive up, Shipt or straight in-store pick ups, with more than 95% of sales being fulfilled through stores.
Target, which operates nearly 1,900 stores, has emerged as one of the big winners from the disruption caused by the coronavirus health crisis as investments in its private label and online business, including faster shipments, have paid off.
While people were making fewer trips outdoors, many who did venture out visited Target, raising its store traffic during the quarter. Bigger rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) on Monday said it saw foot traffic fall, though U.S. e-commerce sales surged 79%.
""The investments we've made in safety and our team are being recognized, and they're rewarding us even during the pandemic with more and more trips to our stores,"" said Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a media call.
The retailer was also winning the loyalty of fresh customers, analysts said.
""It's clear that Target is not only gaining new customers but also retaining them, which will be critical as we move into 2021,"" said Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom.
Comparable sales, which include online and store sales, rose 20.7% in the third quarter ended Oct.31, trouncing expectations for an 11.31% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Electronics sales jumped more than 50%, while comparable sales for the home category were up in the mid-20% range.
Other categories that performed well in the quarter included home decor, intimates and sleepwear, men's apparel, food and beverage, toys, and beauty. 
Earlier this month, Target said it struck a long-term deal with Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) Inc to open the cosmetics store chain's stores at the retailer's locations.
The pandemic has forced retailers to bring forward their holiday promotions, casting a shadow over the traditional holiday shopping season from Thanksgiving to Christmas day.
""We expect this to be a season that's going to be very different, unlike any other we've ever seen. But we expect that guests will decorate their home, and there'll be gifts under the tree,"" Cornell said.
Retailers that have seen sales surge during the pandemic, including Target and Walmart, are grappling with how to restock shelves quickly with highly sought essentials, especially as COVID-19 cases are surging in much of the United States and across the world, spurring Britain and other countries in Europe, and many American states, to go into another lockdown.
Target, whose inventory of cleaning and paper products had taken a hit at the start of the health crisis, said it was making progress in these categories even though sales had not returned to pre-pandemic levels. It said it felt ""well positioned"" in all of its major categories heading into the peak of the holiday season.
Target's net earnings rose to $1.01 billion, from $714 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.79 per share, beating estimates for $1.60.
Total revenue surged 21.3% to $22.63 billion, beating estimates for $20.93 billion.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",Green is the new black in boom for clean energy funds,"By Tommy Wilkes and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are pouring money into green funds, banking on a Joe Biden presidency in the United States for a further boost to the renewable and alternative energy industry at the expense of traditional oil and gas businesses. 
Shares in solar and wind energy businesses, electric vehicle companies and environmental technology pioneers have been on the rise for months, widening their lead over fossil fuel rivals since the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.
Even without U.S. President-elect Biden's win, investors have been positioning for governments worldwide to enact more climate-friendly legislation. The UK, for instance, announced this week that it would ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2030 to cut carbon emissions. 
Data from research firm Morningstar shows that investors ploughed 1.9 billion euros ($2.3 billion) into European renewable energy investment funds in the July-September period, 11 times the amount for the same months last year.
In contrast, European conventional energy funds tracked by Morningstar achieved third-quarter inflows of less than 115 million euros.
Globally, traditional energy funds have been haemorrhaging cash in recent years, halving assets under management https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-ENERGY/qzjvqonnovx/index.html (AUM) since 2018.
Graphic: Alternative energy funds' assets hit record high - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-ENERGY/qmypmxbayvr/chart.png
Morningstar does not track U.S. alternative energy funds, but in Europe the August-September inflows to such vehicles touched their highest in at least three years, taking AUM to a record 9.8 billion euros.
That's more than double 2018 levels https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-ENERGY/oakpexeezvr/index.html
AUM at European funds investing in oil and gas, meanwhile, dwindled to 4.85 billion euros.
POLICY SHIFT
Investors were loading up on green energy holdings in the run-up to Biden's victory.
Though U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to concede the Nov. 3 election, Biden has pledged to tie the U.S. economic recovery to tackling climate change in a significant policy shift from Trump's easing of regulations on fossil fuel. He has also vowed to rejoin the Paris climate accord that Trump exited.
October energy fund flow data is not yet available, but provisional numbers suggest a big swing towards funds that claim to meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, though that includes investing in conventional energy companies.
Net flows into all energy funds deemed ESG-compliant topped a record $1.79 billion in October, against $871 million for traditional energy funds, according to fund tracker EPFR.
The centrepiece of Biden's climate plan is a target of net zero carbon emissions for the U.S. economy no later than 2050. 
Analysts at financial advisory firm Raymond James noted that getting there would require a dramatically different pace of decarbonisation. They warned that Republican control of the Senate would ""make it difficult, if not impossible"" for Biden to enact major climate reforms.
""Investors looking for such reforms will need to focus on Europe rather than the U.S.,"" they wrote.
However, many fund managers are undeterred by legislative roadblocks in Washington.
Guillaume Mascotto, head of ESG at American Century Investments, said the appeal of investing in renewable energy assets would continue irrespective of regulatory developments as understanding of the technology improves. 
STEAMING AHEAD
The RENIXX Renewable Energy Index, which tracks the 30 largest renewable energy companies worldwide, has more than doubled in 2020, including a 9% gain in November. 
The S&P500 energy sector index meanwhile is down 41%, hurt by a slump in oil prices.
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), an American renewable energy company, this month briefly overtook U.S oil majors  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) in market capitalisation after a 28% rise in its shares since January.
Other strong performers include Invesco's Solar Exchange Traded Fund, up 143% in 2020, and First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), which has registered a 46% gain.
Among Europe's top-performing greener energy companies are Vestas Wind Systems and EDP Renovaveis. Vestas shares have risen by 72% this year while Spanish renewables business EDP has gained 62%, lifting its market value to 15 billion euros.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>",FAA chief '100% confident' of 737 MAX safety as flights to resume,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Steve Dickson is ""100% confident"" in the safety of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX but says the airplane maker has more to do as it works to improve its safety culture.
Dickson on Wednesday signed an order to allow the best-selling plane to resume flights after it was grounded worldwide in March 2019 following two crashes that killed 346 people and led to Boeing's biggest crisis in decades.
The order will end the longest grounding in commercial aviation history and paves the way for Boeing to resume U.S. deliveries and commercial flights by the end of the year.
""We've done everything humanly possible to make sure"" these types of crashes do not happen again,"" FAA Administrator Dickson told Reuters in a 30-minute telephone interview, adding the design changes ""have eliminated what caused these particular accidents.""
The FAA is requiring new training to deal with a key safety system called MCAS that is faulted for the two fatal crashes as well as significant new safeguards and other software changes.
""I feel 100% confident,"" said Dickson, a former airline and military pilot, who took over as FAA administration in August 2019 and took the controls for a 737 MAX test flight in September.
In a video message released on Wednesday, he said that the 20-month review was ""long and grueling, but we said from the start that we would take the time necessary to get this right.""
Dickson said he emphasized to Boeing the importance of safety. ""I understand they have a business to run but they don't have anything if they don't have a safe product,"" Dickson said.
Dickson suggested Boeing has more to do to improve safety.
""They have taken some actions, but it's going to take more then putting new processes in place and moving boxes around the organization chart. Cultural changes take a long time to take effect and we've got to be skeptical,"" he said.
Boeing said it is ""committed to learning from our mistakes to build a safer future so accidents like this never happen again.""
The FAA has also come under harsh criticism over its certification of the 737 MAX. The U.S. House of Representatives approved a reform measure on Tuesday of the FAA's aircraft certification program.
Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said the FAA failed to properly ensure the safety of the 737 MAX, and called aircraft certification ""a broken system that broke the public’s trust.""
Dickson acknowledged there was fragmented communication within the FAA and between the FAA and Boeing during the 737 MAX certification. He noted the agency is adopting certification reforms and improvements in response to outside reviews of the 737 MAX certification.
The FAA could take new enforcement actions or issue new civil penalties against Boeing over the 737 MAX and on other issues stemming from a 2014 settlement agreement, but Dickson did not elaborate.
""It's a matter of our review of what Boeing's actions have been up to this point,"" Dickson said. ""There is going to be more that we'll be able to talk about that in the coming weeks and months.""
The MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, is designed to help counter a tendency for the nose of the 737 MAX to rise up, known as a pitch up, and it could be activated after data received from one of two sensors.
Boeing says inputs from both sensors on the MAX will be used after the updates but the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has called for a third synthetic sensor to provide independently computed data. Dickson said the FAA will consider requiring that synthetic sensor in future 737 MAX versions, but has made no decisions.

Dickson said he said expects other international regulators will ""complete their work within a relatively short period of time.""

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 08:06AM ET</span>",Analysis: U.S. manufacturing is booming - but not for these guys,"By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - Jim Kirsh initially thought his family-owned foundry in southeastern Wisconsin might stay busy during the pandemic.
Kirsh Foundry Inc, a cluster of buildings nestled in Beaver Dam, a city of 16,000 about an hour's drive from Milwaukee, entered the year with a bulging order book, thanks in part to a big customer bringing casting work back from China. 
This was quickly followed by an urgent call to make parts for a ventilator being built by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co in response to the coronavirus. 
By summer, however, business started to dry up. Today it remains depressed, emblematic of a U.S. manufacturing economy that, for all its apparent resilience, has notable pockets of weakness.
Broad measures of manufacturing activity, such as the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index, suggest the sector has snapped back from the springtime slump delivered by COVID-19. But the revival is uneven. The Federal Reserve reported Tuesday that while output by consumer goods producers has largely recovered to pre-pandemic levels, those who make things for other businesses have not.
Indeed, some U.S. factories are booming, and there are even shortages of some popular consumer goods. Americans stuck at home or hesitant to get on airplanes are snapping up trucks, appliances, recreational vehicles and boats.
But a large swath of the U.S. industrial economy consists of companies like Kirsh's - which sell goods to other companies -and many of those firms remain crimped by soft demand. 
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), seen as an economy bellwether, reported sales fell by at least 20% in its three main businesses in the latest quarter, while 3M Co reported sales down in half of its business lines compared with a year ago. Aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is mired in a deep slump.
A new surge of COVID-19 across the Upper Midwest, where many of these companies have large operations, is the latest challenge. If officials move to curb economic activity again to halt the spread of the virus, it would prolong the downturn for equipment makers and others dependent on strong business spending.
""At this point, I'm just figuring all of 2021 will be awful, regardless of who's the president,"" said Kirsh, whose grandfather founded the business in 1937 amid the Great Depression. 
'OPEN-ENDED' DOWNTURN
There are few more basic industries than foundries. These factories, which produce metal castings, are a good gauge for the health of the larger manufacturing sector. 
Nine out of every 10 durable goods contain metal castings, which are made by pouring liquid metal into forms to create parts that are then trimmed and polished before they move on to other factories. While castings are found in many consumer goods, including cars and washing machines, a core use is metal parts that go into things like bulldozers, cranes and airplanes.
Kirsh estimates his sales will be down 11% this year - a decent result considering that at one point they were down by half. He has laid off a third of his 115 employees, a combination of hourly and salaried staff, and halted all capital projects. 
His 12 largest customers, which include Caterpillar, Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co, and engine-maker  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI), have curbed orders and given little indication of when orders might return to pre-covid levels, he said. One hopeful sign, he said, is a strong uptick in orders in recent weeks, led by Deere.
What makes this downturn so unsettling, said Kirsh, is its ""open-ended"" nature. ""Even in 2008 and 2009, after a certain point, you could see things start to turn. You knew things would get back to normal,"" he said. ""This is not a normal economic downturn.""
Now he is struggling to ship the orders he does have because the virus has hit the foundry directly. 
In September, one of his supervisors tested positive - after the supervisor spent time talking to 12 workers around the plant. Then the scheduler - another key employee - tested positive, which meant the shipping supervisor who works closely with her also had to quarantine. 
At one point the foundry had 19 employees - about a quarter of their reduced workforce - either sick or in precautionary quarantine. That number is now down to just one. But Kirsh's calculations of how many workers he needs are complicated by figuring out a buffer to account for COVID-19-related absences. He's now trying to hire workers again, in part to compensate for the absences as well as the recent upturn in orders. 
Kirsh is part the Grey Iron Founders Association, a group of 16 small foundries that meets once a quarter in Chicago to talk about business conditions. At the latest meeting, most reported similar conditions. ""Most of us have business down in the 30% range,"" he said.
Thomas Teske, general manager of EJ, a foundry in East Jordan, Michigan, said its business has held steady - mainly because it specializes in making castings for government infrastructure projects. 
""The only state that shut down construction was Pennsylvania - and that was just for a couple of weeks,"" said Teske. ""But our concern is going forward,"" given how heavily state infrastructure projects rely on tax revenue. 

""Funding is going to be an issue,"" said Teske, ""so it's tough to see what the future holds.""

1249,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 07:04AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Up 126 Pts; Pfizer Vaccine Candidate 95% Effective,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening a little higher Wednesday, as investors digest the competing stories of positive news surrounding potential vaccines and mounting numbers of Covid-19 infections.
At 07:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract rose 126 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures traded 10 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.1%. 
The major stock indices are having a strong November, boosted by positive news from two U.S. drugmakers--Pfizer updated the efficacy of its candidate to 95% Wednesday--about the effectiveness of their potential Covid-19 vaccines. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 12% and the S&P 500 is up more than 10% so far this month. The Nasdaq Composite is up more than 9%, underperforming due to the rotation out of  technology shares into cyclical plays.
This has come against a background of an increasing number of Covid-19 infections across the U.S., now averaging over 150,000 new cases a day. This has resulted in a number of major cities, including Chicago, Philadelphia and New York, announcing new restrictions to try and stem the spread.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Tuesday applauded the recent news over potential vaccines, but said the U.S. economy still has a “long way to go”, while calling for additional fiscal stimulus to support the economic recovery.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Tuesday for fresh negotiations with Republicans on a fiscal-stimulus package, with the House returning to session next week, but with the political climate still highly partisan it’s doubtful common ground can be reached.
The retail sector continues to offer up quarterly earnings, after Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) bigger-than-expected bump in quarterly same-store sales, with  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) and TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) reporting before the opening bell Wednesday. 
Economic data Wednesday comes from the buoyant housing market, with October housing starts and building permits information due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). 
Oil prices strengthened Wednesday despite a jump in U.S. inventories raising concerns of a potential supply glut as traders look to plans by the top producers to rein in output next year.
The industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, said late Tuesday that U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 4.2 million barrels last week, well above expectations for a build of 1.7 million barrels. Official supply data are due later in the session.
OPEC+, a group which includes members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia, currently plans to boost output by 2 million barrels per day in January. But expectations are growing that their meeting at the end of the month will see this plan postponed.
Crude futures traded 1.8% higher at $42.38 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.8% to $44.56.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,864.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1867.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>",Airlines scramble to prepare for ultra-cold COVID-19 vaccine distribution,"By Laurence Frost and Ilona Wissenbach
PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airlines are scrambling to prepare ultra-cold shipping and storage facilities to transport COVID-19 vaccines developed by  Pfizer  and  Moderna , whose doses, which require deep freezing, are likely to be among the first to be distributed.
A recent survey by an air cargo association and a drug shippers' group found only 15% of industry participants felt ready to transport goods near the minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94°F) required by the Pfizer Inc (N:PFE) vaccine, while around 60% could meet Moderna Inc's (O:MRNA) less stringent -20°C requirement.
Typically, airlines use containers with cooling materials such as dry ice to transport pharmaceutical products, but some don't have temperature controls, making products susceptible to unforeseen events such as flight delays.
Airlines are now considering options ranging from a large plug-in freezer that can cost about as much as a small car to a multi-layered canister that uses liquid nitrogen to ship vaccines requiring a deep freeze.
The potential demand for such high-end packaging has helped shares of cold container specialists such as  Cryoport Inc  (O:CYRX) and Germany-based va-Q-tec (DE:VQTG) more than double in recent months.
""With direct contracts with five temperature-controlled container manufacturers, Korean Air has secured sufficient quantities of containers. For now, we are in the process of signing contracts with other container manufacturers,"" a Korean Air (KS:003490) spokesperson said. 
Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) said it was gearing up for a test run with one of the drugmakers - it declined to say which - that will see dummy samples shipped at ultra-low temperatures, likely via Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.
The drill will use boxes carrying as many as 5,000 doses each, all cooled by dry ice, Air France-KLM special cargo manager Béatrice Delpuech told Reuters. Later shipments may also use larger ultra-cold containers rented from va-Q-tec.
""They need to validate the entire logistics chain from end to end, including the air freight segment,"" Delpuech said. ""We have a dedicated task force examining every step of the process with all our teams, to make sure there are no hitches anywhere.""
DRY ICE (NYSE:ICE) LIMITS
But one difficulty with vaccine transport is that airplanes can only carry a limited amount of dry ice - frozen carbon dioxide - as it turns into gas over time, displacing the breathable air in the cabin. 
All widebody planes can carry a maximum of around 1 tonne of dry ice in refrigerated and insulated containers, according to a DHL white paper on vaccine transport.
""Depending on the type of aircraft, there are usually not more than a few containers on board at the same time,"" said Joachim von Winning, chief executive of Air Cargo Community Frankfurt.
For an alternative,  Deutsche Post  AG's (DE:DPWGn) DHL has been using Cyroport's capsule containers, which use liquid nitrogen to keep goods as cool as -150C for up to 10 days to support clinical vaccine trials, said Patricia Cole, DHL Global Forwarding's global head of temperature management solutions. 
Although it is relatively a small-scale solution, with only hundreds of vials in each container, broader preparations have already begun.
Pfizer, which is working with DHL, FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) for vaccine distribution in the United States, said on Monday it has launched a pilot delivery programme in four states to help it refine its nationwide and global shipping plan. 
The U.S. drugmaker has also developed temperature-controlled and GPS-enabled boxes that use dry ice to keep its vaccine at around -70C for up to 10 days.
But cold-chain solutions providers such as Sweden's Envirotainer say so-called active containers, which use electric motors to cool their contents, are safer and more cost-effective.
A Envirotainer spokesman said that its fleet of active temperature-controlled containers was twice that of its competitors and that it was preparing to increase its capacity by 50%.
Va-Q-tec also said this month that it would significantly expand its container fleet over the coming months in anticipation of orders COVID-19 vaccine transport.
Airlines have become more reliant on cargo for revenue this year as passenger numbers plunged amid pandemic-related travel restrictions. 
Accenture (NYSE:ACN)'s Seabury Consulting estimates the global roll-out of a vaccine will generate 65,000 tonnes of air freight, which is five times the air vaccine trade in 2019.
But airlines think the potential for the vaccine to allow a return to normal travel is most important, KLM chief executive Pieter Elbers said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event on Nov. 11.

""I think overall for the entire industry, the vaccine is going to be much more important than the cargo revenues it would bring,"" he said.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>",Berkshire's bet a bright spot in gloomy year for Big Pharma stocks,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Berkshire Hathaway Inc 's (N:BRKa) new bet on the U.S. pharmaceutical industry signals hope for shares of large drug companies, which have lagged a broad market rally amid concern about efforts to rein in prescription drug prices.
Drug stocks largely outperformed on Tuesday, a day after Warren Buffett's conglomerate, long underweight in the healthcare sector, revealed $5.7 billion of new investments in Abbvie Inc (N:ABBV), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY),  Merck & Co  (N:MRK) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), whose vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness in late-stage studies against COVID-19.
“It’s a recognition of, 'Hey, there’s some value there,'” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital, whose funds hold shares of Pfizer, Merck and Eli Lilly (N:LLY).
Pharma stocks also received a boost after the Nov. 3 U.S. elections made clear there would be no overwhelming Democratic sweep, an outcome some investors feared could prompt a major overhaul of drug pricing.
Still, many are reluctant to sound an all-clear on the industry, which is trading close to its biggest-ever valuation gap against the S&P 500 based on forward price-to-earnings ratios, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
Among the issues on investors' minds is whether Democrats can secure a slim margin in the U.S. Senate if their candidates win run-off races in Georgia scheduled for January, a result that could spark volatility throughout the healthcare sector.
Beyond that, pharmaceutical stocks continue to face pressure from concerns over lawmakers' efforts to bring down high drug prices, investors said.
""That is an area where you can quickly get to some sort of bipartisan agreement,"" said Les Funtleyder, a healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital.
So far in 2020, the S&P 500 pharmaceutical industry index <.SPLRCCARG> has gained 0.6%, versus an 11.7% gain for the overall S&P 500 (SPX), and an 8.8% gain for the S&P 500 healthcare sector (SPXHC).
Shares of the two biggest pure-play pharma companies by market value, Merck and Pfizer, have fallen 10% and 3%, respectively, this year.
""Big pharma names have underperformed, and look cheap relative to historical valuations and the market overall,"" said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who covers Berkshire. ""These are large, dominant companies in an industry that has demonstrated strong, long-term growth.""
Investors say pharma stocks have also lagged because many top-selling products are slated to lose patent protection in the coming years, including Abbvie's blockbuster Humira.
“As you get within five years of patent expirations, people start to look and get more nervous about growth prospects,” said Marshall Gordon, senior healthcare analyst at Clearbridge Investments. 
Another factor hurting pharma's performance, said Jared Holz, healthcare equity strategist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), is that the stock market currently is dominated on a given day by either a trade favoring big tech, stay-at-home stocks, or a trade favoring economically cyclical stocks. 
Pharma does not fall into either of those categories, Holz said, so ""they seem to underperform irrespective of what the broader markets are doing."" 

At the same time, he said, the stocks ""are trading at such a meaningful discount on an absolute and relative basis that they are intriguing almost solely due to that.""

(Reuters) - Lawyers for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou are set to continue questioning Canadian border officials on Wednesday regarding their investigation of Meng before her arrest two years ago on a warrant from the United States.
Meng, 48, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian police while on a layover bound for Mexico.
She is facing charges of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting the extradition from under house arrest in Vancouver, where she owns a home in an upscale neighborhood in the Pacific coastal city.
Hearings this week and next week consist of witness testimony, from officials in the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, regarding their conduct during Meng's initial investigation and arrest.
On Tuesday CBSA officer Sanjit Dhillon told the court he had received an email from an FBI official with a request for information relating to the CBSA's investigation of Meng before her arrest, but said he did not act on the request.
Meng's arrest has soured diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Soon after her detention, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges. The two men are still in detention.
Meng's case is set to wrap up in April 2021, although the potential for appeals by either side mean the case could drag on for years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge in Detroit on Tuesday dismissed a portion of a criminal case against a Fiat Chrysler senior manager who was charged as part of the government's probe into cheating on diesel emissions tests by the automaker.
Emanuele Palma was charged in September 2019 with making and causing Fiat Chrysler to make misstatements to U.S. regulators about diesel engines' emission control systems and wire fraud.
Of the 13 count indictment, U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds dismissed four counts and a portion of one count - all relating to wire fraud, ruling the causal connection between the alleged deceit and customers' loss of money was ""tenuous at best."" 
Palma, an Italian citizen and auto engineer, is set to go trial in April 2021.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit, Fiat Chrysler and lawyers for Palma did not immediately comment late Tuesday.
U.S. officials embarked on a wide-ranging investigation into diesel emissions cheating in the auto industry after Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in September 2015 to using secret software to evade emissions rules.
Nine people have been charged in the Volkswagen probe, while only Palma has been charged in the Fiat Chrysler case. Two people charged in the Volkswagen case received prison sentences after pleading guilty, while the other seven including former CEO Martin Winterkorn remain abroad and have never made U.S. court appearances.
Fiat Chrysler in January 2019 agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve civil claims from the Justice Department, California Air Resources Board and vehicle owners that it used illegal software which produced false results on diesel-emissions tests.
Last month, the Italian-American automaker recognized a new 222 million euro ($263 million) provision to settle matters primarily related to the DOJ's ongoing criminal probe into diesel emissions.
Fiat Chrysler said at the time that settlement talks were ongoing and it was not clear if an agreement would be reached.

It separately agreed in September to pay $9.5 million to settle allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it misled investors over its compliance with emissions regulations.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Global luxury goods sales set for largest ever fall in Bain forecast,"MILAN (Reuters) - Sales of luxury goods worldwide are set to fall by 23% to 217 billion euros ($258 billion) this year, their largest ever drop and first since 2009, due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, consultancy Bain said on Wednesday.
The expected decline, despite a strong sales recovery in China, is at the lower end of a 20% to 35% range which Bain's closely followed industry forecast had predicted in May.
That is due to a bigger than expected rebound during the summer, when lockdown measures were lifted or eased across the world and stores selling high-end handbags, clothes, jewellery and watches were reopened.
However, a resurgence of the pandemic in Europe and the United States since October has led to new restrictions and shop closures while uncertainty linked to the U.S. elections also weighed on consumer sentiment. 
The only bright spot is China, where sales have surged since it began to emerge from the health crisis in the spring. Sales in mainland China are seen growing by 45% at current exchange rates to 44 billion euros this year.
""We have a two-speed world, with Europe and the U.S. strongly hit by the second wave and by social and political uncertainty, while China is relentlessly accelerating day after day,"" Federica Levato, a partner at Bain, said.
Fourth-quarter sales are expected to drop by 10%, although the decline could be bigger depending on how much the new shutdowns hit the crucial Christmas season. 
Revenues for the likes of Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, Hermes and Prada (OTC:PRDSY) should partly recover in 2021, although Bain says it will take until the end of 2022 or even 2023 to return to 2019 levels. 
The coronavirus crisis has accelerated three trends, Bain said, with purchases online almost doubling from 12% in 2019 to 23% in 2020, and e-commerce set to become the leading channel for luxury purchases by 2025.
International travel curbs have led to people buying more in their home countries, while shoppers born from 1981 onwards now account for almost 60% of total purchases.

Germany on Tuesday earmarked fresh cash to help the industry, which is facing tough competition from Chinese and U.S. rivals in electric mobility, to overcome a collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus.
A central element of the scheme is the allocation of 1 billion euros to extend to 2025 a consumer rebate for buying electric cars that had been due to end next year.
""The extension of the innovation rebate for passenger cars will further accelerate the ramp-up of electric mobility and thus drive the change to sustainable mobility,"" the world's largest carmaker said in a statement. 
""At the same time, by rapidly expanding charging infrastructures, the German government is creating the necessary trust among customers for an easy and smooth transition to e-mobility,"" it added.
A further billion euros will be used for a scrappage scheme for older trucks to help logistics companies and municipalities modernise their fleets while another 1 billion euro fund will finance innovation.
Stephan Weil, premier of the state of Lower Saxony where Volkswagen is based, said transformation and digitisation processes urgently needed a boost.
""The faster a nationwide charging network is created and supplied by renewable energies, the more customers will choose electric vehicles,"" said Weil, who is a supervisory board member at Volkswagen.
Charging spots for electric vehicles in Germany have been rolled out quickly this year, with the burden to expand largely being placed on utilities, but many spots are underused as only 240,000 fully electric cars are on the road, according to energy group BDEW.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global shares were little changed and oil rose on Wednesday as weak U.S. retail sales and a surge of new coronavirus cases dampened but did not extinguish the euphoria from recent COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs. 
The MSCI World index was flat at 0823 GMT, just shy of the previous session's record high.
European shares opened lower, with the STOXX 600 index down around 0.1%, tracking weakness overnight in Japan, where the Nikkei fell 1.1% after coronavirus cases there rose to a high.
Elsewhere in Asia, the picture was more mixed. MSCI's broadest gauge of regional shares rose 0.6%, helped by better handling of the pandemic in much of the region and the prospect of more stimulus in China.
U.S. stocks fell overnight on the sales data and rise in COVID-19 cases, but were expected to hold steady at the Wall Street open on Wednesday, with S&P500 futures flat.
""Overall, the picture for investors is brighter, but the recovery is likely to be uneven,"" said Cormac Weldon, Head of U.S. Equities at UK asset manager Artemis.
""Low inventories and the need to manufacture and distribute goods are likely to be the first drivers of the recovery, with the re-emergence of consumer demand adding a powerful second phase.""
The market caution was reflected in other risk markets, with U.S. crude futures up just 0.1%. Brent crude futures were up 0.4%. 
In Europe's debt markets, Germany saw its benchmark 10-year government bond yield fall to its lowest since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) announced its COVID-19 vaccine update a week and a half ago.
""Yields continue to grind lower as more warning signs flash about the near-term outlook,"" said Benjamin Schroeder, senior rates strategist at ING.
""Euro zone spreads appear to have eyes only for QE (quantitative easing), shrugging off volatility and EU setbacks,"" he said, referring to news this week that Hungary and Poland have blocked the adoption of the 2021-2027 budget and recovery fund by European Union governments.
RETAIL SALES
The retail sales report released by the U.S. Commerce Department showed spending decelerating as the holiday shopping season approached, amid a lack of fresh fiscal relief from Washington.

A skittish mood also swept investors as several U.S. states began restricting gatherings and mandating face-coverings after more than 70,000 Americans were hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19.
The surge in new coronavirus cases comes as investors have hailed two promising vaccine trial results published earlier this month.
""We're are coming out of a solid two weeks, so the market being down half a percent isn't that bad with the prospect of COVID lockdowns,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group.

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: GM warns labor unrest making South Korea untenable,"By Ben Klayman and Heekyong Yang
DETROIT/SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) has issued its strongest warning yet that persistent industrial unrest could drive it out of South Korea, just two years after it received a state-backed rescue package to stay.
GM workers have been staging two, four-hour strikes daily since Oct. 30 as they demand an end to a wage freeze put in place after the 2018 deal that saved the Korean operations from bankruptcy. 
The strikes and other industrial action have cost the company 17,000 vehicles in lost production, a number that will hit 20,000 by the end of the week, Steve Kiefer, president of GM's international operations, told Reuters. 
That blow to production was on top of the 60,000 units lost earlier in the year as the novel coronavirus spread, making it likely GM Korea would not turn a profit this year unless it could recapture that output, he added. 
""We're basically being held hostage in the short term by lack of vehicle production,"" Kiefer said in a telephone interview. ""That's having a very significant short-term financial impact.""
The industrial action would ""basically make it impossible for us to allocate any further investments or ... new products to the country of Korea. It's making the country non-competitive"", he said.
""It is going to have long-term effects if we can't get this resolved in the coming weeks."" 
GM builds as many as 500,000 vehicles a year in South Korea, shipping many to the United States including the popular Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV. The automaker employs about 12,000 people in the country.
GM management wants a two-year labor deal instead of the usual one-year agreement, and have offered a signing bonus of 8 million won ($7,230) for each union member over 2020 and 2021.
The union, however, wants to stick to a one-year deal and a yearly performance bonus of 22 million won, as well as continued operation at both plants in Bupyeong. 
""We are not only striking over wage issues, but also over job security at our No. 2 plant in Bupyeong, which hires about 1,200 workers,"" union official Jung Jai-heon said.
Jung said the company had been putting all the blame on workers while senior management had received performance bonuses since 2018.
The two sides have failed to reach a deal after 24 rounds of negotiations.
LONG-TERM DOUBT
Some current and former subcontract workers are also demanding to be hired as full-time staff with pay and benefits to match, potentially costing GM Korea about $320 million.
Government officials were unavailable for comment but the Korea Development Bank (KDB), GM Korea's second-largest shareholder, called on both sides to make concessions.
GM Korea reported an operating loss of 332 billion won ($300.8 million) in 2019, trimming a loss of 615 billion won a year earlier. 
Faced with low production rates and poor sales, GM agreed on a rescue package worth $7.15 billion, including $750 million from KDB in 2018. Under the terms of the binding deal, GM cannot exit its investment in the country for 10 years. 
While it would be hard to quit South Korea in the short term, the long-term future was in doubt, Kiefer said. 
GM would abide by any past agreements, including plans to build a 2023 Chevrolet crossover in Korea, but even spending on that program had been suspended due to the strikes.
""We would prefer to make this model work ... but as of now, we're losing confidence that we're going to be able to continue to invest in that country,"" Kiefer said. 
GM had other options in Asia including China, where it built nearly 5 million vehicles a year, he said.

Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping line, has recovered faster than expected after the pandemic halted trade around the world, benefiting from higher retail sales in the United States.
The company on Tuesday raised its full-year earnings forecast, citing increased momentum in the fourth quarter in global container volumes and freight rates.
""Demand has begun to partially recover,"" Chief Executive Soren Skou said in a statement. 
""Our progress in earnings and in our transformation allows us to look confidently past the extraordinary 2020,"" he said.
Surging shipments into the United States have fuelled record high freight rates, but the industry has said the rally could slow because of new COVID-19 lockdown measures.
Maersk said the decision to launch a share buy-back programme of up to 10 billion Danish crowns ($1.60 billion) was ""supported by the strong earnings and free cash flow generation seen in 2020"".
In line with preliminary numbers announced last month, Maersk said third-quarter sales fell slightly from last year to $9.92 billion, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 39% to $2.3 billion.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Wednesday, amid worries that the recent surge in coronavirus cases throughout the region will halt the nascent economic recovery even given the Covid-19 vaccine breakthroughs.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.3%.
Sentiment has weakened as the week has progressed as investors returned to the basic concept that large sections of many economies throughout Europe remain closed as governments react to a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
In corporate news, RSA Insurance (OTC:RSNAY) stock rose 3.9% after receiving a cash offer worth 7.2 billion pounds ($9.55 billion) from Canadian peer Intact Financial and Danish insurer Tryg.
Maersk (CSE:MAERSKb) stock fell 0.9% despite the shipping group launching a $1.6 billion share buyback after reporting third-quarter sales and operating profit in line with previous guidance.
 Richemont  (SIX:CFR) stock fell 1.6% after the Swiss luxury group said it plans to issue warrants as part of a shareholder loyalty scheme, following a cut to its dividend.
Equity markets had been given a boost Monday when  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing infection, adding to Pfizer’s promising trial data last week.
However, an effective coronavirus vaccine will not fundamentally change European Central Bank economic projections, as a medical solution was already factored into forecasts, ECB President Christine Lagarde told a Bloomberg event on Tuesday.
Real GDP is projected to fall by 8.0% in 2020, according to the latest ECB staff projections, before rebounding by 5.0% in 2021 and by 3.2% in 2022.
While the deployment of vaccines could occur more quickly than earlier thought, the economy was also taking a bigger hit from the second wave of the pandemic than expected, Lagarde added.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday despite a jump in U.S. inventories that raised fears of a fresh glut. The industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, said late Tuesday that U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 4.2 million barrels last week, well above expectations for a build of 1.7 million barrels. Official supply data are due later in the session.
OPEC+, a group which includes members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia, currently plans to boost output by 2 million barrels per day in January, ahead of a meeting starting at the end of the month. Expectations are growing that this increase will be waived given the hit to demand caused by the pandemic but a meeting of technical experts at OPEC on Tuesday gave no clear recommendation.
Crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $41.55 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $44.02.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,82.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1879.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, amid worries that the recent surge in coronavirus cases throughout the region will halt the nascent economic recovery even given the Covid-19 vaccine breakthroughs.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%. 
Sentiment has weakened as the week has progressed as investors returned to the basic concept that large sections of many economies throughout Europe remain closed as governments react to a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
On Tuesday, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that large areas of the country would shut all non-essential shops from Friday to combat a rise in cases, mostly in the west of the country.
Equity markets had been given a boost Monday when  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing infection, adding to Pfizer’s promising trial data last week.
However, an effective coronavirus vaccine will not fundamentally change European Central Bank economic projections, as a medical solution was already factored into forecasts, ECB President Christine Lagarde told a Bloomberg event on Tuesday.
Real GDP is projected to fall by 8.0% in 2020, according to the latest ECB staff projections, before rebounding by 5.0% in 2021 and by 3.2% in 2022.
While the deployment of vaccines could occur more quickly than earlier thought, the economy was also taking a bigger hit from the second wave of the pandemic than expected, Lagarde added.
In corporate news, Richemont (SIX:CFR) may be in focus after the Swiss luxury group said it plans to issue warrants as part of a shareholder loyalty scheme, following a cut to its dividend.
Oil prices weakened in the U.S. Wednesday after a jump in country's inventories raised fears of a potential glut amid uncertainty over the output plans of the top producers for next year.
The industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, said late Tuesday that U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 4.2 million barrels last week, well above expectations for a build of 1.7 million barrels. Official supply data are due later in the session.
OPEC+, a group which includes members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia, held a ministerial committee meeting on Tuesday. However, it made no formal recommendation over whether to reverse its previously agreed plan to boost output by 2 million barrels per day in January, ahead of a full meeting starting at the end of the month.
Crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $41.38 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $43.80.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Any final exit by Britain from the European Union that worsens business conditions through increased tariffs would threaten the sustainability of Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co's (T:7201) UK operations, the Japanese car maker's chief operating officer (COO) cautioned.
Nissan, which employs 7,000 people at Britain's biggest auto plant in Sunderland, north-eastern England, in June urged for an ""orderly balanced Brexit"". Its latest warning, however, comes as the EU cautions Britain it has less than 10 days left to secure a deal that will govern trade from next year.
""If it happens without any sustainable business case obviously it is not a question of Sunderland or not Sunderland, obviously our UK business will not be sustainable, that's it,"" Nissan's COO Ashwani Gupta told Reuters on Wednesday.
Almost 11 months after it formally quit the union, Britain and the EU have still not worked out a deal that will affect nearly $1 trillion in annual trade following a transition period that has kept custom rules in place. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned his top ministers that a trade agreement is far from certain, but that Britain would thrive with, or without, a deal.
Nissan in March said it will push ahead with a 52-million-pound ($69 million) expansion at Sunderland to build its new Qashqai sports utility vehicle. 
When it announced the plan in 2016, Nissan, which builds it Leaf electric cars there, said Britain had reassured it Brexit would not affect its competitiveness.
But tariffs resulting from a no-deal Brexit would raise costs for Nissan, while any delay in parts supply from overseas due to new customs checks could slow production. 
Gupta said Nissan was not seeking compensation from Britain for costs incurred from any no-deal Brexit, contradicting press reports that it and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) would do so.
""We are absolutely not thinking that and we are not discussing it,"" he said.
On a separate plan announced by Johnson to move up a UK ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans to 2030 from 2035, the Nissan executive said his company was ready to respond. 
""That is not only the UK's transition plan, every country is talking about electrification. We are ready.""

The company said its latest product, Beyond Pork, will initially be available at five popular restaurants in Shanghai. 
China, the world's top pork consumer, is increasing its focus on food security as the coronavirus outbreak has impacted the supply of meat from international companies. 
Beyond Meat said in June it would begin retail sales of its plant-based burger patties in mainland China through  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd's (HK:9988) Freshippo markets. 
Beyond Meat, whose shares have surged over 60% since their market debut a year ago, has emerged as a top supplier to fast-food chains rushing to get vegetarian products on their menus.

SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - Sinovac Biotech's experimental COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac triggered a quick immune response but the level of antibodies produced was lower than in people who had recovered from the disease, preliminary trial results showed on Wednesday.
While the early to mid-stage trials were not designed to assess the efficacy of CoronaVac, researchers said it could provide sufficient protection, based on their experience with other vaccines and data from preclinical studies with macaques.
The study comes hot on the heels of upbeat news this month from U.S. drugmakers  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) as well as Russia that showed their experimental vaccines were over 90% effective based on interim data from large, late-stage trials.
CoronaVac and four other experimental vaccines developed in China are currently undergoing late-stage trials to determine their effectiveness in preventing COVID-19.
The Sinovac findings, published in a peer-reviewed paper in medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, came from results in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in China involving more than 700 participants. 
""Our findings show that CoronaVac is capable of inducing a quick antibody response within four weeks of immunisation by giving two doses of the vaccine at a 14-day interval,"" Zhu Fengcai, one of the authors of the paper, said.
""We believe that this makes the vaccine suitable for emergency use during the pandemic,"" Zhu said in a statement published alongside the paper.
Researchers said the findings from large, late-stage studies, or Phase III trials, would be crucial to determine if the immune response generated by CoronaVac was sufficient to protect people from the coronavirus infection.
Sinovac is currently running three Phase III trials in Indonesia, Brazil and Turkey.
The results must be interpreted with caution until Phase III results are published, Naor Bar-Zeev, a professor from Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the study, said.
""But even then, after Phase III trial completion and after licensure, we should prudently remain cautious,"" he said.
'ATTRACTIVE OPTION' 
CoronaVac is one of three experimental COVID-19 vaccines China has been using to inoculate hundreds of thousands of people under an emergency use programme.
The two other vaccines in China's emergency programme, both developed by institutes linked to Sinopharm, and another vaccine from CanSino Biologics, were also shown to be safe and triggered immune responses in early and mid-stage trials, peer-reviewed papers show.
Gang Zeng, a Sinovac researcher involved in the CoronaVac study, said the vaccine could be an attractive option because it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36°-46°F) and may remain stable for up to three years.
""(It) would offer some advantages for distribution to regions where access to refrigeration is challenging,"" the author said.
Vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna use a new technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus and require far colder storage.
Pfizer's vaccine must be stored and transported at -70C though it can be kept in a normal fridge for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box. Moderna's candidate is expected to be stable at normal fridge temperatures for 30 days but for storage of up to six months it needs to be kept at -20C.
CoronaVac is also being considered by Brazil and Indonesia for inoculations in the coming months. 
Indonesia has sought emergency authorisation to start a mass vaccination campaign by the end of the year and vaccines produced by Sinovac and China's Sinopharm are slated to be used in the early stages of the campaign.
Brazil's Sao Paulo also plans to roll out CoronaVac as early as January and has agreed a supply deal with Sinovac.

""The excellent safety of CoronaVac, compared to other vaccines under development, makes for greater acceptance by the population,"" Ricardo Palacios, trial manager of Brazil's Butantan Institute biomedical centre, which is testing CoronaVac, told Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. travel group said on Tuesday that travel spending is expected to fall by more than $500 billion in 2020 and is not expected to recover to pre-coronavirus levels until 2024.
The U.S. Travel Association projects spending in 2019 will be $617 billion, down from its July forecast of $622 billion, compared with $1.13 trillion in 2019.
The decline reflects the dramatic falloff in business travel. The group said the industry has lost nearly 40%, or 3.5 million, of all direct travel jobs and warned another 1 million jobs could be lost without additional government relief by year-end.
The group forecasts a 75% reduction in international visitors to the United States in 2020, accounting for a $119 billion decline in spending. The United States currently bars most non-U.S. citizens who have recently been in Europe, China, Brazil and some other countries.
The forecast comes as new U.S. COVID-19 infections has reached an all-time daily high and many U.S. states are issuing new orders limiting indoor activities and in some cases temporarily barring indoor dining.
""A lot of businesses that need help to retain and rehire their people won’t be there in January if we wait until the next Congress to get more aid passed,"" said U.S. Travel Association Chief Executive Roger Dow.
The U.S. Transportation Department said last week the country’s airlines carried 65% fewer passengers in September versus the same month last year, the smallest decrease since March. Airlines say travel demand in November remains down 65%.
The U.S. cruise industry has agreed to suspend cruises through Dec. 31 and many major tourist attractions like Disneyland in California and Broadway in New York remain closed. Others remain at limited capacity.
Airlines have made a renewed push for $25 billion in assistance after a $25 billion program of mostly cash grants for payroll approved by Congress in March expired on Sept. 30.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines last month furloughed 32,000 workers.
Hotels, rental car companies and other travel businesses are still struggling even as demand has improved over lows following the coronavirus pandemic.

Marriott said on Nov. 6 that third-quarter occupancy at North American hotels rose to 37%, nearly double the prior three months based mostly on an increase in leisure travel.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>","Utilities, Tesla, Uber create U.S. lobbying group for electric vehicle industry","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of major U.S. utilities, Tesla (O:TSLA), Uber (N:UBER) and others said on Tuesday they are launching a new group to lobby for national policies to boost electric vehicle sales.
The new Zero Emission Transportation Association wants to boost consumer electric vehicle incentives and encourage the retirement of gasoline-powered vehicles. It also advocates for tougher emissions and performance standards that will potentially enable full electrification by 2030.
Under President Donald Trump, the White House rejected new tax credits for electric vehicles as it proposed to kill existing credits and made it easier to sell gas-guzzling vehicles.
President-elect Joe Biden promises new tax incentives, including new rebates to buy EVs and a dramatic expansion of charging stations for electric vehicles - policy measures automakers have long advocated.
""We can own the electric vehicle market — building 550,000 charging stations — and creating over a million good jobs here at home — with the federal government investing more in clean energy research,"" Biden said Monday.
Biden's measures are in line with the group's call for ""strong federal charging infrastructure investments"" and its goal to reach 100% electric vehicle sales by 2030.
Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the group will support ""Uber's work to move 100% of rides to EVs in (the United States), Canadian and European cities by 2030 and go fully zero-emissions by 2040. It will take all of us working together to address the urgent crisis of climate change.""
Automakers in the United States sold 326,000 EVs in 2019, accounting for about 2% of total U.S. auto sales. Tesla sold nearly 60% of the total.
Other members include ConEdison (N:ED),  Duke Energy  (N:DUK), PG&E (N:PCG) along with EV charging companies like Chargepoint and EVgo, fledging automakers like Lordstown Motors (O:RIDE), Rivian and Lucid Motors. Also part are  Albemarle  Corp (N:ALB), the world's largest producer of lithium for electric vehicle batteries, Piedmont Lithium (AX:PLL) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn)
In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state plans to ban the sale of new gasoline powered passenger cars and trucks starting in 2035 in a dramatic move to shift to electric vehicles and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

California is the largest U.S. auto market, accounting for about 11% of all U.S. vehicle sales. Many states have adopted its green vehicle mandates.

The bank had announced https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-layoffs/goldman-sachs-to-go-ahead-with-modest-job-cuts-after-coronavirus-pause-idUSKBN26L3Q7 ""a modest number of layoffs"" in September after pausing job cuts earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Goldman is looking for ways to cut costs to achieve a target of reducing operating expenses by $1.3 billion over the next three years, which it announced in January as part of a broader strategic revamp. 
The latest round of job cuts is not expected to exceed the roughly 400 positions the bank began eliminating in September, Bloomberg News reported earlier on Tuesday. 
Goldman executives expect to go deeper in the coming year, which could eventually lead to one of the most significant staff reductions at the bank, according to the report.
In an email to Reuters, Goldman reiterated its statement from earlier this year, saying it ""has made a decision to move forward with a modest number of layoffs."" 
It was not clear if there would be further job cuts next year, sources told Reuters.
Goldman is also looking to reduce costs by locating more staff in less expensive locations such as Salt Lake City, Dallas and Bengaluru, India, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said earlier this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved legislation on Tuesday to reform the Federal Aviation Administration’s aircraft certification process after two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 but the FAA is set on Wednesday to approve the plane's return to service after a lengthy review, new software safeguards and training upgrades, Reuters reported earlier.
The House bill, approved on a voice vote, requires an expert panel to evaluate Boeing Co’s safety culture and to recommend improvements, and mandates that aircraft manufacturers adopt safety management systems and complete system safety assessments for significant design changes.
It also requires that risk calculations be based on realistic assumptions of pilot response time, and that risk assessments are shared with regulators.
Boeing and the FAA declined to comment on the legislation. The Senate Commerce Committee plans to vote on Wednesday on a similar FAA certification reform bill, but it remains unclear if Congress will be able to adopt a measure by year end. 
""Our intent is to ensure a U.S. manufactured airplane never again crashes due to design issues or regulatory failures,"" said House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, noting that the MAX grounding was the longest in the history of commercial aviation.
DeFazio, a Democrat, said the FAA failed to properly ensure the safety of the 737 MAX, and called aircraft certification ""a broken system that broke the public's trust.""
A report released by DeFazio found the 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019 were the ""horrific culmination"" of failures by Boeing and the FAA and called for urgent reforms.
The House bill would extend airline whistleblower protections to U.S. manufacturing employees, require FAA approval of new workers who are performing delegated certification tasks, and impose civil penalties on those who interfere with the performance of FAA-authorized duties.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co is being sued over a string of battery fires in its electric vehicles (EVs), just as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) recalls nearly 70,000 EVs with batteries from the same maker, LG Chem Ltd.
The owner of a Hyundai Kona EV, a South Korean civil servant who asked to be identified only by his surname Kim, is among some 200 people who lodged a class-action lawsuit against Hyundai last week, seeking compensation for what they say is the reduced value of their EVs and other losses, Kim and two lawyers representing them told Reuters. 
The court filing is not a public record.
Kim had initiated a petition drive to sue the Seoul-based carmaker after the same brand of EV caught fire in his neighbourhood, forcing about 20 residents to evacuate their homes.
One of the lawyers said they were initially seeking 8 million won ($7,200) per plaintiff but they could increase demand as the trial proceeds. 
The plaintiffs want Hyundai to replace the entire battery pack - the most expensive part of the vehicle - of their Kona EVs, not just update the software, as the company's recall provides.
EV sales are climbing globally as the technology holds out the promise of cleaner transportation, with costs falling and driving ranges increasing. But the emerging risk of fire from overheated batteries could set back the entire industry.
Recalls could mean reputational as well as financial damage to Hyundai and other automakers, which are pushing into the EV market to meet tougher emissions regulations and to challenge market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. The problems could also dent consumer demand for EVs.
""A battery that is not safe is like a bomb,"" said Park Chul-wan, a South Korean battery expert.
A series of fires involving automakers, including GM, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, expose the challenge the industry faces in managing the risks of new technology and the pressures to boost battery production and performance. 
GM said on Friday it was recalling 68,677 EVs with LG Chem batteries, after five reported fires and two minor injuries. Hyundai has recalled globally more than 74,000 Kona EVs, its top-selling electric car, after 16 of them caught fire in South Korea, Canada and Europe in two years.
South Korea's safety agency is investigating the cause of the Kona fire, and depending on the results, Hyundai and LG Chem could face costs up to $540 million if they have to replace all the affected batteries, analysts reckon. 
In a statement to Reuters, Hyundai said the cause of fire is unclear but it suspects that internal damage to batteries may be to blame, adding that it is investigating the case with its supplier and the transport ministry. 
Hyundai said it is not considering setting aside money for recalls as it expects its software fix will be able to prevent fires by detecting problems.
""We are constantly monitoring the situation after an update of the (battery management system) and we will continue to try to minimise consumer inconveniences going forward,"" Hyundai said.
A LG Chem spokesman said, ""We will cooperate with Hyundai Motor and General Motors and sincerely proceed with an investigation to identify the exact cause"" of the fire.
LG Chem CEO Hak Cheol Shin told Reuters last month that the battery system is very complex, suggesting problems may be caused by other components made by Hyundai's suppliers.
""As a supplier of a key component of the battery system, we clearly feel responsibility. But until a clear cause would be determined, we can’t come up with measures to address the problems,"" he said. 
In addition to the problems at Hyundai and GM, Ford recently offered to replace the battery packs of its Kuga plug-in hybrid vehicle over fire risks, saying this could cost the carmaker $600 million in the second half, including a cost to meet Europe’s emissions regulations.
Ford and BMW have recalled vehicles using Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co batteries, citing cell manufacturing defects. A Samsung SDI spokesman said investigations are under way into the cause of the fires. 
Tesla was investigated by a U.S. safety authorities over a battery software upgrade of some vehicles following vehicle fires. 
'SCARED'
Hyundai and LG Chem are at odds over the root cause of the fires as South Korea’s safety agency investigates the case. LG denies the battery cells are defective.
The plaintiffs are pressing Hyundai to take more decisive action. ""While acknowledging flaws in the batteries, your company has been relying on the wrong policy – software replacement, which is only a temporary fix – to buy time,"" they say in a letter to the carmaker, seen by Reuters.
A 35-year-old woman, who asked to be identified only by her surname Shin, said she had to evacuate her apartment complex at dawn with her baby in a stroller last month after a Kona EV caught fire and engulfed the underground lot in flames.
""The stench of burned electronics and smoke swept through the whole neighbourhood,"" Shin told Reuters. 
Before the fire, she believed EVs were good for the environment. Now, she says, she tells her relatives not to buy them.

""Electric vehicles have just become something I'm so scared of.""

(Reuters) - Hedge fund veteran William Ackman has the support of some of Wall Street's top investors as he tries to pull off the biggest-ever deal carried out by a blank-check acquisition company, according to regulatory filings published in the last few days.
Among the heavy hitters rounded up by Ackman for his Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd investment vehicle, according to the filings, are mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price Group Inc, investment firm Guggenheim Partners, hedge fund Baupost Group, Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers and private equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc.
Tontine raised $4 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) in July. It is the largest-ever special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and will use the IPO proceeds, as well as debt and new equity it can raise, to acquire a minority stake in a company valued at tens of billions of dollars. 
As is typical with SPACs, Tontine has not told its investors what specific company or type of company will be acquired. As possible targets, Ackman is eyeing family-owned businesses, public companies that want to spin off big divisions and ""mature unicorns,"" developed and privately financed companies worth more than $1 billion, a person familiar with the process said.
This is where deep-pocketed SPAC shareholders come in handy. Were Ackman to seek an investment that exceeded his SPAC's resources, the investors could boost its firepower by providing additional equity financing. Ackman's hedge fund has also committed to investing between $1 billion and $3 billion to any deal.
Tontine's IPO was heavily oversubscribed, allowing Ackman to hand-pick the investors and what stakes to allocate to them, according to people familiar with the process, who requested anonymity.
Tontine brings a ""curated list of shareholders who are expected to be invested for many years,"" Ackman told bankers working on the SPAC, according to one of the sources.
A spokesman for Ackman declined to comment.
HIGH PROFILE 
Tontine is the highest-profile SPAC in a year in which blank-check companies raised $65.7 billion to date, smashing the previous record of $13.6 billion, according to SPAC Research. Lucrative SPAC deals, such as those for electric truck maker Nikola Corp, space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and fantasy sports and gambling company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc, prompted many others to follow suit.
Many institutional investors have stayed away from SPACs, however, concerned that they pose too high a risk. Blue-chip investors' endorsement of Tontine indicates Wall Street is confident of Ackman's ability to find a successful deal. 
Guggenheim Partners owns 22 million Tontine shares worth roughly $507 million, while Seth Klarman's Baupost owns 17.5 million shares or roughly $400 million, the filings show.
Ontario Teachers owns a stake worth $257 million while the T. Rowe Price stake is valued at $174 million. 
Hedge funds Soroban Capital, Millennium Management, Fir Tree Capital Management, Citadel Advisors, Mason Capital Management, Moore Capital Management and Scoggin Management also have stakes in Tontine, according to the filings.
Most Tontine investors are based in North America, but the SPAC also counts sovereign wealth funds in Asia, the Middle East and Europe as shareholders, sources familiar with the matter said. 
NO FOUNDER SHARES
While many SPACs give their managers so-called founder shares that can result in them owning 20% of the merged company, Ackman opted out of that compensation structure. He is also set to receive warrants that require him to invest more money to own less of the target company than managers of other SPACs. 
Tontine shareholders also receive warrants, but unlike with other SPACs they forfeit two-thirds of their value if they cash out when a merger is announced. Ackman did this to discourage investors with a short-term horizon from participating in Tontine's IPO.
Tontine is not Ackman's first SPAC. He co-sponsored Justice Holdings in 2011, which raised $1.5 billion and merged with Burger King Worldwide a year later. The company is now called Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), and remains one of Ackman's biggest investments.

Ackman is best known for his big wins as an activist shareholder in railroad operator  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) and Botox maker Allergan (NYSE:AGN), though he also suffered deep losses at pharmaceutical company Valeant and nutritional supplements manufacturer  Herbalife  (NYSE:HLF). Since his $12.5 billion firm's launch in 2004, Ackman has returned an average 16% annually, compared with the Standard & Poor's 9.3% gain. This year, his Pershing Square Holdings fund is up 55%.

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",Regeneron says Roche successfully tested manufacture of COVID-19 drug used on Trump,"By Carl O'Donnell and Axel Threlfall
(Reuters) - Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) has completed early tests of its ability to produce large quantities of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN)'s COVID-19 antibody treatment, putting it on track to begin manufacturing the drug once it is authorized by regulators, Regeneron's president said on Tuesday. 
The experimental therapy was used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump in October. The companies aim to be able to make 2 million doses of the antibody cocktail next year, but are awaiting clearance from regulators. 
Roche ""has already started engineering runs at scale and (has) been successful,"" Regeneron President and Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said in an interview ahead of this week's Reuters Total Health conference. 
A Roche spokesman said the Swiss drugmaker would be ready to begin producing the treatment in the first quarter of 2021. 
Regeneron has had discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration almost every day since it submitted its application for emergency use of the COVID-19 drug in October, and expects a final decision in the ""very near future,"" Yancopoulos, a co-founder of the U.S. biotech company said.
Regeneron hopes to apply for full approval of the drug shortly afterwards, he said, echoing his comment during Regeneron's investor call earlier this month.
The company has a contract to provide 300,000 doses of the antibody therapy, called REGN-COV2, to the U.S. government and expects to be able to meet that commitment by as early as January. It has more than 50,000 doses currently stockpiled. 
The 2 million doses Regeneron expects to be able to produce in partnership with Roche next year may not be enough to treat all the patients worldwide who could benefit from it, Yancopoulos said, based on the rate at which the virus is again spreading and sickening people globally. 
He added that Regeneron is in talks with U.S. officials about providing more doses than it has already agreed to, but has not reached any conclusive agreement. Regeneron's current contract with the U.S. government priced 300,000 doses at $450 million. 
Regeneron has been speaking regularly with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's COVID-19 task force and has shown them a presentation on the antibody treatment, Yancopoulos said.
After Trump received the Regeneron treatment along with several other medicines during his bout with COVID-19, he touted it as a virtual ""cure"" for the illness, promising to make it free for Americans.

1279,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 04:02PM ET</span>",Dow Slips as Bulls Hit Pause on Value Amid Signs of Weaker Consumer,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com - The Dow cut some losses but ended lower Tuesday, as investors digested data showing signs of weakness in the U.S. consumer, while Amazon's foray into the pharmacy business sent drug store stocks lower. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.56%, or 166 points, but had been down more than 400 points intraday. The S&P 500 was down 0.43%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21%.
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.3% last month, missing economists’ forecast for a 0.5% rise. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP –  climbed 0.1%, well short of expectations for a 0.5% increase. 
The slowdown in retail followed a surprise jump in September, which Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said represented the ""last hurrah"" for the consumer, forecasting further slowing ahead. ""We expect downside momentum to continue through December … Most holiday shopping surveys point in the same direction.""
Against the sluggish economic backdrop, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said both monetary and fiscal stimulus would be needed to support the economic recovery, which still has a ""long way to go.""
Beyond the economic jitters, a sea of red pharma stocks kept the broader market lower after Amazon confirmed its entry into the pharma business with the launch of Amazon Pharmacy. Under the service, U.S. customers would be able to order prescription medications directly from Amazon.
Shares of traditional pharmacies including Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) plunged more than 8%.
Cyclical stocks, which a day earlier had led the market to record highs, fell with materials and financials among the biggest decliners.
Financials were dragged lower by banks made a soft start to the session after Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) released data late-Monday showing it had trimmed positions in banks including JPMorgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
A wave of better-than-expected quarterly earnings, meanwhile, failed to firm up stocks.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) fell 2% despite reporting earnings and revenue that topped consensus estimates, led by ongoing strength in its e-commerce business.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD)'s blowout earnings of $3.18 per share were largely shrugged off with investors seemingly concerned over whether the home-improvement retailer can sustain its level of performance.
Tech played a role in the malaise as the Fab 5 traded lower, with the exception of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed lower.
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 8% after receiving the regulatory nod to join the S&P 500 following four-straight quarters of growth. Inclusion on the index is expected to ramp-up demand for the electric automaker's shares."
1280,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",Tesla surges as fund managers face big decision: How much to own,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Love it or hate it, a much broader universe of portfolio managers will soon have to take a stance on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s stock, which surged 8% on Tuesday following the announcement that it will join the S&P 500.
The electric car maker's stock market value shot up about $40 billion on expectations that Tesla's inclusion in Wall Street's most-followed U.S. stock index in December, announced late on Monday, will force passive funds tracking the index to buy over $50 billion of its shares.
Its inclusion will also force actively managed funds that try to beat the S&P 500 to grapple with a question many have avoided for years: whether to own shares of Wall Street’s most controversial companies, and if so, how many? 
""Tesla is a very under-owned stock across actively managed funds,"" said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, which owns Tesla shares. 
“If Tesla starts to take off… and if they don’t own Tesla, then they are going to underperform by a pretty meaty amount,” he said.
Many fund managers until now have avoided Tesla, according to Lip, because its low profitability and high debt exclude it from screening lists drawn up by fund managers considering new investments. 
Up over 400% in 2020, the California-based car maker has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor (T:7203), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (N:GM).
Entry to the S&P 500 will put Tesla among the index's 10 most valuable companies, larger than Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and approaching the value of Visa (N:V).
Many investors believe Tesla's stock is in a bubble, and some have warned against adding it to the S&P 500 at current levels. Adding to uncertainty around Tesla is Chief Executive Elon Musk, viewed by many as a genius entrepreneur, but who in 2018 agreed to pay $20 million and step down as chairman to settle fraud charges.
With Tesla in the S&P 500, actively managed funds that avoid its shares will risk falling behind if Tesla's blistering rally continues. On the other hand, they may find themselves ahead if they keep the company out of their portfolios and the stock's high-flying performance reverses.
""Many active managers shadow the S&P 500, so this makes it more difficult for them to ignore Tesla,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. 
Krosby compared Tesla's inclusion in the S&P 500 to China's gradual addition in recent years to MSCI's widely tracked equity benchmarks, which led global investors that rate their performance against those indexes to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into the country's stock markets.
Adding companies with extremely high stock market values to the S&P 500 is exceedingly rare, and S&P Dow Jones Indices said Tesla's addition will generate a massive amount of trading by index funds. To ease its addition, S&P Dow Jones Indices said it may add Tesla to the index in two parts, with the company fully added as of Dec. 21.

“Many so-called active management funds are benchmark huggers and now they’re going to have to tinker with what weighting to apply” to Tesla, said David Barse of index company XOUT Capital. “Many of them are going to realize they have to add it.”

""By the end of the year or around the end of the year, we should have 60,000 people in the study,"" Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, said in an interview ahead of this week's Reuters Total Health conference.
""And efficacy endpoint should be there in the first few weeks or months, January or February, of the new year,"" he added.
The Phase III trial of the single-dose vaccine started in late September. The company paused the trial in October because of a serious medical event in one participant and resumed after getting the green light from an independent safety panel. 
J&J must provide safety data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for at least one-half of trial participants for a duration of two months after they receive the vaccine. ""So that will bring us around the year end or early next year for having all the data,"" he added.
J&J lags some of its rivals in the global race to develop a safe and effective vaccine against the virus that has killed over 1.3 million people worldwide and roiled the global economy. 
Rival  Moderna  (O:MRNA) on Monday said its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, following similar results from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) last week.
Both Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines use a new technology known as messenger RNA, or mRNA. By contrast, J&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger the body's immune system.
J&J's candidate is a single-dose vaccine, whereas the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer and another under development by AstraZeneca (L:AZN) all require two shots separated by several weeks.
""In a pandemic a single shot is definitely important globally,"" Stoffels said. ""(A two-shot vaccine) is a very significant operational challenge. More so in healthcare systems which are less well organized.""
Single-shot vaccines will likely benefit in particular remote areas, Stoffels said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Former United Auto Workers Vice President Joseph Ashton on Tuesday was sentenced to 30 months in prison for accepting kickbacks as part of a wide-ranging federal corruption probe into the union.
Ashton, a former General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) board member, pleaded guilty in December 2019 to conspiring with other union officials to receive ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and kickbacks,"" according to documents filed in U.S. district court in Detroit.
Ashton had faced prison time of 30 to 37 months under a plea agreement, but his attorney asked U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman for house arrest and a substantial fine instead.
Friedman said on a webcast of the hearing that there were too many victims and a message had to be sent.
""Punishment in this matter is important ... for deterrence,"" he said. ""People have to know there's a consequence."" 
Ashton on Tuesday apologized to the union and his family.
""I cannot tell you how ashamed and remorseful I am for what I've done,"" he said. 
Ashton, who left the GM board in December 2017 amid the federal investigation, previously forfeited the $250,000 in kickbacks he received.
The U.S. attorney's office in Detroit has been leading a corruption probe into the union that had led to 15 people being charged, including two former presidents. Prosecutors are talking with UAW leaders about reforming the union's structure.
Federal prosecutors said Ashton and other UAW officials steered an inflated $4 million contract to a vendor to provide 58,000 watches to UAW members. The watches were never distributed.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Frances Carlson said Ashton had been ""motivated by pure greed.""

Due to the coronavirus outbreak and Ashton's underlying health conditions, he doesn't have to report to prison until next June, the judge said.

BA was operating 84 flights per week between London Heathrow and New York JFK prior to the pandemic, but last week operated just 21. 
BA CEO Sean Doyle said that without a travel testing regime, Britain was being left behind countries such as Germany.
Alongside its partners, BA plans to collect data from at least 500 passengers on flights from three U.S. cities to London Heathrow by asking them to take three free COVID-19 tests as part of their journey: one before departure, one on landing, and one three days after their arrival. 
""What we're trying to evidence here is the effectiveness of testing to replace quarantines,"" BA CEO Doyle, who has been in the role for just six weeks, told reporters on a call. 
He said that recent positive vaccine news was encouraging but it was unclear when a vaccine would start to have a material effect on travel. 
The data collected from the trial, which will start on Nov. 25, will be collated by independent scientists and presented to UK ministers to help convince them to drop a 14-day quarantine rule for arrivals from most countries.
""If we have a testing framework that is there, you know regardless of the development of the pandemic, it gives people certainty from which they can plan,"" Doyle said.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow retreated from record closing highs on Tuesday as surging cases of COVID-19 and the growing threat of a fresh round of economic lockdowns and weak retail sales data dampened the euphoria caused by potential vaccine breakthroughs.
The broad sell-off was a reversal of Monday's rally, in which the blue-chip Dow reached its first record closing high since before the pandemic.
The Nasdaq was essentially flat, its losses capped by surging Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares.
""We're seeing profit taking after some substantial gains, and we had mixed macro news,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""The market is pulling back, but we're off the lows of the day.""
""There's nothing to suggest we've hit a peak of this 'vaccine rally.'""
Monday's rally was prompted by  Moderna  Inc's (O:MRNA) announcement that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate appears to be 94.5% effective in preventing infection.
But a recent surge in new coronavirus cases across the United States have led several governors to enact new restrictions to prevent the disease from spiraling out of control.
The retail sales report released by the Commerce Department showed spending decelerating as the holiday shopping season approaches amid a lack of forthcoming fiscal relief from Washington.
""The retail sales data was disappointing and that's an alarming sign, in that we're not very far away from the holiday spending season,"" Cardillo added. ""The pandemic is keeping people from opening up their wallets in a big way.""

Walmart Inc (N:WMT) beat profit expectations and posted a bigger-than-expected 6.4% annual growth in same-store sales. 
Home improvement retailer  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) also beat quarterly profit and sales estimates as consumers used stay-at-home restrictions to focus on DIY home projects.
Still, Walmart's and Home Depot's stocks were down 0.6% and 3.1%, respectively.

The consumer behaviors that accelerated at the start of the virus -- think digital ordering, bulkier baskets and no margin for error when it comes to delivery -- are showing zero signs of abating eight months in. For three straight quarters now, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. has seen U.S. customers place fewer total orders but purchase much more when they do.  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN).’s CEO on Monday highlighted “stickiness in click-and-collect and click-and-deliver,” while executives at Chinese online giant JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. said this week the shift toward online shopping is here to stay.
“We’re convinced that most of the behavior change will persist beyond the pandemic,” Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on an investor call after its U.S. e-commerce business jumped 79% in the latest quarter.
The global coronavirus outbreak has upended everything from grocery shopping to restaurant take-out as shelter-in-place orders come and go in waves. In addition to the shift online, shoppers are still stocking up with bigger buys, unwilling to let their pantries go bare before another outbreak. That means large retailers who can keep key goods like paper towels, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) wipes and dried pasta in stock will benefit. Walmart said Tuesday that it’s still struggling to get enough inventory of bath tissue and cleaning supplies, and has seen customers defect to local grocers in some cases. It’s unusual for the world’s biggest retailer to see such strains in the supply chain.
“The U.S. consumer is in the middle of the largest shift in shopping behavior in the last 50 years, as convenience and safety increases in importance and e-commerce grows more rapidly than ever,” Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy in North America at consultant Publicis Sapient, said in an email. Companies that have prioritized digital “will ultimately be the winners in this new era.”

Walmart is an even better buy than it is now,"" said David Harden, President and Chief Investment Officer at Summit Global Investments.Walmart has doubled down on its investments in e-commerce and in September launched a subscription service Walmart Plus, touted as a rival to Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) Prime subscription, which includes perks like free shipping and streaming services.
The company did not disclose any metrics about the new service that costs $98 per year and offers services such as unlimited free delivery, fuel discounts and no checkout lines.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also forced retailers to drastically rethink how they do business during the key holiday season, with many big retailers including Walmart, Kohl's (N:KSS),  Target  (N:TGT), and  Best Buy  (N:BBY) moving their promotions to as early as October.
""This holiday season will obviously be unique ... While many family gatherings may be smaller, we do believe families want to decorate, celebrate and enjoy food and gifts,"" Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a call with analysts.
An early start to the holiday season has helped Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart give ""customers the opportunity to come to stores when they aren't as crowded as they typically would be on a one-day Black Friday type of event,"" Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters.
Still executives warned of continued pressure from COVID-19 related expenses. It incurred about $600 million in additional costs that included higher wages for warehouse workers and bonuses for store employees in the quarter and about $1.5 billion in such expenses in the prior quarter.
With COVID-19 cases rising in much of the United States and across the world that has forced countries like the UK to go into another lockdown, CEO McMillon said that Walmart was reinforcing safety procedures and has resumed limiting the number of shoppers allowed in stores at one time.
Walmart also said that it had begun to see consumers stocking up again on paper goods, cleaning supplies and dry grocery, and said would be able to respond in this instance better than it did at the start of the pandemic, but cautioned that supply chain was ""still stressed in some places.""
Shares were down marginally at $151.95. They have risen 28% this year.
McMillon also called for Washington to help small businesses get through the next phase of the pandemic, while congratulating U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on his victory, saying that he was looking forward to working with the administration.
Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 6.4%, excluding fuel, in the third quarter ended Oct. 31. Analysts had estimated an increase of 4.16%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Operating income jumped 22.5% to $5.79 billion in the third quarter, while Walmart reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 that topped expectations for $1.18.

Total revenue rose 5.2% to $134.71 billion, beating estimates for $132.23 billion.

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said on Tuesday he is sitting on about $80 billion in cash for investment opportunities and share buybacks, and vowed to stick with his famously big bets on technology companies.
The move into cash by selling some SoftBank investments is in part due to concern over the continued spread of the coronavirus globally, Son told the DealBook Online Summit hosted by the New York Times. 
""It's the first time in our history to liquidate any of the assets as quickly as possible,"" Son, speaking from Tokyo, said of SoftBank's recent sales. 
This year, Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) divested more than $21 billion worth of stock in U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) and announced the $40 billion sale of chip designer Arm to  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA). 
Son said he will be ""aggressive"" if there are opportunities to invest in artificial intelligence companies. 
""It is maybe a better price now for investing in unicorns. They need the funding,"" said Son, referring to private companies worth at least $1 billion. He added that he also planned on more share buybacks if SoftBank's stock falls. 
SoftBank has set a $41 billion share buy-back and debt reduction plan. Its stock has more than doubled since its lows in March. 
Son declined to comment on reports that SoftBank is thinking about taking itself private.

Son, who made his name for investing early in startups such as China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group (HK:9988) as well as office-sharing firm WeWork, said he will continue to take stakes in public companies he thinks are frontrunners in the AI race, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 12:47PM ET</span>",Support for MAX brand wavers as Boeing jet nears green light,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tracy Rucinski
SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is set to win approval for its grounded 737 MAX this week, but chinks are appearing in the brand as the most traumatic chapter in the jetmaker's history overshadows the planes' original billing of superlative performance. 
When it returns to the skies next month as expected after a nearly two-year safety review, the ""MAX"" name will still be officially in place. Some airlines, however, have begun to soft-pedal references to the aircraft following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
Industry sources familiar with the branding say the name will likely be phased out over time as a strategy unfolds among airlines to de-emphasize the ""MAX"" label in favor of the formal names assigned to each variant, like ""737-7"" or ""737-8.""
""You will see the MAX name used less frequently,"" one of the sources told Reuters. Another person involved in discussions over the marketing predicted the MAX name would gradually fade in coming years.
Boeing declined to comment.
The wavering support for the brand could be a setback for the company, which had unusually advertised a name as well as a model number, and urged airlines to ""Think MAX."" It also shows a potential sore point with airlines, who had invested promotional dollars in a name now seen as tarnished.
Brand Finance last year estimated the MAX's problems had wiped $7.5 billion off the value of Boeing's corporate image.
Anticipating this week's approval, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc plans to relaunch commercial MAX flights on Dec. 29 from Miami to New York City.
While passengers will see the MAX name on booking systems, they will not see it on safety cards in seat pockets, people familiar with the change told Reuters.
American said the change is not intended to hide the MAX brand and corresponds to a plan to standardize safety cards across its 737 fleet that began even before it took delivery of its first Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2017.
""This approach is consistent with other fleet types where we do not have different safety cards for sub-fleets,"" a spokeswoman said, noting a similar move with its A321 fleet.
American has vowed to be transparent with customers about the MAX and will offer other travel options if they don't want to fly the aircraft.
Originally conceived in 2011, the word ""MAX"" was only ever a marketing title for the latest 737. Removing it from the cards has no impact on safety. But the cabin is where airlines define their brand, planning every visual cue, and virtually nothing there happens by chance, airline marketing experts say.
Doubts over the name surfaced in August when a news release on a MAX order from Poland's Enter Air referred to it as the ""737-8.""
Last week, Air Canada used the same designation in a news release on quarterly earnings, with ""MAX"" appearing only in footnotes - a change from the year-ago format. An Air Canada spokeswoman said the airline uses the term ""interchangeably.""
While it is keeping the name, Boeing allows airlines to decide how they want to market the MAX. Even before the crashes, Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY) PLC had decided to refer to its specially designed version as the ""Gamechanger"" rather than ""MAX"".
""If Boeing's customers want it dropped, it will be dropped,"" a third source said, adding that some key ""customers are saying the name MAX is tainted."" 
HIGH VISIBILITY
Pressures on the once-unstoppable brand name for Boeing's fastest-selling jet highlight a delicate problem for airlines.
In the near-term, they must restore public trust in the aircraft, which calls for transparency about which plane is being used, something U.S. operators have pledged to enforce.
But the name has also drawn high-profile scepticism.
In April 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted, ""I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name."" 
In January 2020, the chairman of Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp, an influential buyer, said the ""damaged"" brand should be dropped.
Changing the name of a tarnished brand has been a well-proven strategy for companies seeking to move past crises.
""Some people will remember and give you grief in the short term, but you've broken the connection,"" said Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. ""Someone getting on the plane four years from now won't remember 'MAX.'"" 
JET NICKNAMES 
The MAX's branding woes are all the more tricky for Boeing, as naming civilian jets is the exception rather than the rule.
While official nicknames are common for military jets like the F/A-18 ""Super Hornet,"" Boeing only gave its first nickname to a civilian jet with its 787 ""Dreamliner"" about a decade ago. 
But for the MAX, it needed to pack a bigger punch in an all-out battle for market share against European rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY).
In 2011, Boeing abandoned plans for an all-new jet and launched a quicker 737 MAX upgrade after being blindsided by a huge Airbus sale to American Airlines, the company now reopening MAX flights.
Boeing marketers came up with a name that ""ticked numerous boxes: max performance, max capacity, max range,"" said a person familiar with the discussions. 
A promotional Boeing video using camera angles to give the impression of a vertical take-off - tagged ""Flown by Boeing test pilots. Do not attempt"" - underscored the superlative claims.

""It was short and effective,"" the person familiar with the discussions said of the name. ""The problem,"" he added, ""is that in a negative context it has been very effective too.""

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",How two companies sprinted ahead in extraordinary race for a COVID vaccine,"By Michael Erman and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - Just as the novel coronavirus was gaining a foothold in the United States in mid-March,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) Chief Executive Albert Bourla called on his top vaccine scientists and laid out a clear mission:
“He basically said, ‘Your mandate is to get this vaccine made. And if you need resources, you come and you ask for them, and you're going to get them’,”chief viral vaccine scientist Philip Dormitzer told Reuters.
The assignment was both inspiring and daunting. It provided researchers with the backing to tackle something that had never been done before: design a vaccine to stop a pandemic in its tracks in less than a year.
“He did not want us to focus on the potential barriers we might face, but instead said that it is much better to try to do something that seemed impossible, and even if you don’t succeed, you still (will) have done something great, ” said Dormitzer, noting that new vaccine development can cost on the order of $1 billion.
What followed was a full-bore effort carried out under strict coronavirus lockdown conditions, borrowing elements from ongoing flu and cancer research, according to Reuters interviews with half a dozen scientists critical to the vaccine program run by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). On Nov. 9, the companies reported the first promising results from large-scale, scientifically rigorous clinical trials around the world - although potential roadblocks remain and widespread distribution is not expected until at least April.
On Monday,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, a scrappy biotech with nearly $1 billion in research and development backing from the U.S. government, announced what appeared to be its own successful vaccine, using the same new technology that brought Pfizer such rapid results.
Both companies have reported preliminary findings of more than 90% effectiveness - an unexpectedly high rate - raising hope for an end to the pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people globally, upended economies and disrupted daily life for billions of people.
Their work validates that of several tiny biotechnology firms, which for years have been laboring to prove a once-unorthodox idea: The human body can act as its own vaccine factory. Both the Pfizer and Moderna inoculations work by injecting people with customized genetic code that instructs human cells to make key virus proteins to induce an immune response.
In Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s case, decision-making that normally would take months was reduced to days, including the crucial call on which vaccine version to use in a human clinical trial that has enrolled about 44,000 people worldwide so far.
In many ways, however, the work has just begun. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna still must finalize their data on efficacy and safety, and share that information with the scientific community and regulators - including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will make the call on whether to authorize the vaccines for emergency use. The companies will have to increase production to as much as 2 billion doses or more by the end of 2021 - and face a massive task in distributing them. 
BORROWING FROM FLU AND CANCER RESEARCH
Pfizer’s Dormitzer is more prepared than many to meet the challenges, having led research efforts at Novartis AG in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. That project produced three licensed vaccines in the most rapid pandemic vaccine response until now.
At Novartis AG, Dormitzer began testing novel ways to make vaccines using messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA, which contains instructions for human cells. In this case, scientists introduce mRNA instructions for cells to make a portion of a virus, which the immune system recognizes as a threat and counters with a protective response. No actual virus is involved in the process.
By contrast, to create a typical vaccine, scientists use bits of dead or weakened virus, which are then injected to produce the immune response.
The appeal of mRNA vaccines - and a key secret to their speed - is they are plug-and-play: The mRNA vehicle does not need to change, only the specific genetic instructions it carries. If the virus changes or mutates, the details of the instructions can be altered accordingly.
At Pfizer, one of Dormitzer’s colleagues, Julia Li, had been scouting for potential partners with mRNA technology for a few years. Li settled on a little-known German biotech firm called BioNTech that was using mRNA technology to make cancer treatments. The company was co-founded by Chief Executive Ugur Sahin and his wife, Chief Medical Officer Oezlem Tuereci.
“I originally wasn’t that interested,” Dormitzer said. “Why would I look at an oncology company?” he recalled. “We’re doing viral infectious diseases.”
Li saw something more. BioNTech had mRNA production capacity, a solid team of scientists and a desire to start working on infectious diseases. “We ended up going into Germany and meeting the folks at BioNTech,” said Dormitzer.In August 2018, the two companies began work on an mRNA-based flu vaccine.
Already concerned about a possible coronavirus pandemic, Sahin decided in January that BioNTech should begin developing a vaccine, said Katalin Karikó, the company’s senior vice president and one of the pioneers behind the mRNA technology. The CEO designed several of the vaccine candidates himself, she said.
Again, the companies proved to have complementary skills. “BioNTech is a smaller company, more flexible,” said Karikó. “A big pharma, like Pfizer, has the infrastructure, knows how to scale up, how to run things.”
In early March, the pair decided to expand their partnership, embarking on a coronavirus vaccine deal worth up to $750 million.
Both companies recognized that mRNA vaccines work very differently in animals compared to humans. For that reason, after doing preliminary animal studies to ensure vaccine candidates were safe, they pared back additional animal studies, which are aimed at identifying the single best candidate, and moved into human trials with several prototype vaccines.
In the spring, the drugmakers’ first human trials began, starting with the phase 1 safety trials in Germany in April, followed by those in the United States in May. They tested four versions in all. The aim was “to figure out in a quick, quick clip, what really was working best in people,” Dormitzer said.
Pfizer and BioNTech disclosed preliminary Phase 1 data on 45 U.S. adult volunteers on July 1, showing one version of the vaccine - called B1 for short - appeared to be safe. Scientists noticed then that the vaccine appeared to induce antibody production exceeding that in people who recovered on their own from COVID-19.
On July 20, the companies’ German trial indicated for the first time that the vaccine also induced production of T-cells that are thought to be important in activating an immune response against the coronavirus.
The two companies believed they were ready to test this candidate in a clinical trial that would ultimately enroll 44,000 people in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa and Turkey.
But on July 24, just days before they were scheduled to start the crucial trial, data on a different candidate called B2 became available. That version turned out to produce a similar immune response to B1, but had fewer side effects in older adults.
The researchers pivoted quickly to B2.
Work proceeded so fast that some researchers went weeks without seeing their families. Dormitzer hasn’t seen his wife and kids since March, apart from Zoom calls.
“The urgency, the coordination, the intensity, I've never felt it more strongly … there is no downtime,” said Dr. Pei-Yong Shi of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, who developed a new method to test the strength of the antibodies generated by the vaccine.
At the same time, hundreds of workers at the Pfizer research center in Pearl River, New York, were held to rigorous coronavirus prevention protocols: They couldn’t touch door handles so all doors were propped open. They had to list everyone they came into contact with every day so that if anyone got sick, they’d have a map of potential exposures.
As the late-stage trial quickly enrolled volunteers, Pfizer’s Bourla announced that efficacy data could come as early as October. It took a little longer - but not by much.
On November 9, based on results from a total of 94 infections, Pfizer made its bombshell announcement. Dormitzer says he only learned the apparent efficacy of the vaccine hours before the public did.
“I don't think any of us expected to see greater than 90% efficacy,” Dormitzer said, adding that the FDA had specified a goal of at least 50%.

Karikó said she never had any doubt the vaccine would work. “We could see the high level of cellular immune responses,” she said. “I was not nervous. I was so confident.”

(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) said on Tuesday it will spend about $1 billion more on employees' wages annually as the home improvement chain benefits from a sustained surge in demand for tools and building materials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Home Depot's blue-chip stock, up 28% this year, fell 2.5% in early trading, despite the company beating quarterly sales and profit estimates. 
Demand for home improvement products have remained elevated since coronavirus lockdowns started in March, as Americans spending more time at home due to limited options for travel or leisure activities use their discretionary income on minor home remodeling and repair work. 
The heavy activity has, however, also led Home Depot to spend $1.7 billion in temporary pay and benefits for staff working through the health crisis. The company said on Tuesday it will change some of those benefits to permanent wage increases for frontline hourly employees.
A strengthening U.S. housing market, owed in part to record low mortgage rates, also encouraged customers to invest more in their homes, Home Depot said, signaling strong sales in the holiday season. 
Business has been unaffected by spiking virus cases, the company said, a day after it agreed to buy HD Supply Holdings (O:HDS) in a deal valued at about $8 billion. 
The company posted a 24.1% rise in same-store sales for the third quarter ended Nov. 1, beating analysts' average estimate of a 14.8% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Home Depot earned $3.18 per share on net sales of $33.54 billion, while analysts had expected a profit of $3.06 per share on net sales of $32.04 billion.

The United States last year imposed sanctions barring imports of Venezuelan oil and transactions made in U.S. dollars with Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA, a move designed to starve the country of oil dollars and oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
Chevron has had a special U.S. operating license exempting it from sanctions on Venezuela's vital oil sector since January, but the latest waiver was due to expire on Dec. 1.
The new license, which also applies to Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Ltd , GE company Baker Hughes and Weatherford International (OTC:WFTLF), continues the restrictions imposed in the last waiver and does not authorize the companies to drill, sell, ship or trade Venezuelan oil.
The companies are also not authorized to repair or improve wells, hire additional staff or services, pay dividends to Venezuelan state-run PDVSA or negotiate any new loans.
The license allows the companies only to conduct transactions with PDVSA ""necessary for the limited maintenance of essential operations in Venezuela or the wind down of operations"" by June 3.
The Trump administration has waged a ""maximum pressure"" campaign of sanctions and diplomatic measures in an effort to oust Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.

But Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela's military as well as Russia, China and Cuba. Some U.S. officials have said this has been a growing source of frustration for President Donald Trump.

The company's statement did not disclose other terms of the agreement, including the number of doses it agreed to supply.
UK Health Minister Matt Hancock told a news conference on Monday that the deal would see the U.S. startup, one of two vaccine makers who have so far published positive data on final-stage trials, supply five million doses from next spring.
Moderna on Monday said mRNA-1273 was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from its late-stage clinical trial.
Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in October started a real-time review of the vaccine candidate, a process which allows for a faster approval of a treatment.
The company on Tuesday also said it was on track to deliver about 500 million doses per year and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, beginning in 2021.

It has tied up with manufacturing partners Lonza of Switzerland and ROVI of Spain, for manufacturing and fill-finish outside of the United States, to supply the vaccine to Europe and other countries outside U.S.

""In the light of uncertainty amid the current health crisis, the Watches and Wonders Geneva Exhibitor Committee has taken the decision not to hold the physical Salon, scheduled April 7 to 13,"" the exhibitor committee said in a statement.
Richemont's watch labels, Rolex, Patek Philippe, Chopard, Chanel, Hermes and  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Ulysse Nardin, will instead interact with customers, retailers and journalists online, on the same dates, with other brands also invited to participate, the organisers said. 
Swiss watchmakers previously held two big watch fairs annually, the SIHH in Geneva and Baselworld, but the Basel show was shaken by the departure of Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) in 2019 and the exit of Rolex, Patek Philippe and other major brands this year.
Both physical fairs were cancelled this year due to the pandemic, but the SIHH, rebaptised Watches & Wonders, took place online.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Tuesday, giving much but by no means all of the gain they made on Monday in response to the latest booster shot of good news on the Covid-19 vaccine front.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 340 points, or 1.1%, at 29,610 points, having closed on Monday at a new record high for the first time since the pandemic erupted in February.
The S&P 500 was down 0.7%, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was up 11.3% after S&P Dow Jones Indices said it will include the carmaker in its benchmark index from December 21.
Despite the gains in Tesla, the NASDAQ Composite was down 0.2%.
Sentiment was dented earlier by the release of figures showing that retail sales rose more slowly than expected in October, by a mere 0.3%. September’s figures were also revised downwards, reviving fears that the failure to extend government support for the high numbers of Americans made unemployed by the pandemic may be feeding through into demand.
Another headwind came from Washington, where Senate Leader Mitch McConnell signaled there would be no more accommodation with House Democrats in the near future than there had been before the election, at least where the issue of fiscal support for the economy was concerned. McConnell accused the Democrats of ;holding a virus relief bill hostage.'
There were big losses in drugstore stocks after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced its plans to get into online filling of prescriptions, over two years after its $750 million acquisition of PillPack. CVS (NYSE:CVS) stock fell 7.9% and Walgreens Boots Alliance  (NASDAQ:WBA) fell 8.7% on fears that the online giant could erode what has previously been an impregnable market position for them. Amazon stock gained 1.2%, meanwhile, on the prospect of another significant revenue stream and rich source of customer data.
Elsewhere, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) stock both fell despite both companies reporting quarterly earnings that were better than expected.  Walmart’s earnings per share rose 15% on a 5.2% rise in revenue that owed much to a 79% increase in sales through its online channel. Its stock still fell 0.5% on concerns that its sales growth was slowing..
Home Depot, a big winner from a pandemic, fell 2.5% amid fears that the end of the pandemic – which has made its way onto people’s radar screens thanks to signs of at least two effective vaccines being distributed next year – may also end the incentive to invest in home improvement.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>","Analysis: Negative rate risk, QE overload may push central banks towards yield caps","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Central banks are delving further into their tool kits to help economies recover from the coronavirus - cue yield curve control, a form of pinning down borrowing costs that more countries might need to embrace in the months and years ahead.
Because government bond yields are used as reference rates for business and consumer lending, controlling them can influence the price of credit in the broader economy.
Of course, all major central banks are already holding down yields, via 0% or sub-zero interest rates and aggressive bond buying (QE). But explicit yield curve control (YCC) involves imposing a cap on part of the curve - say five years - then defending that by buying bonds of that maturity when needed.
Proponents increasingly believe this is the path central banks will adopt in order to anchor borrowing costs for governments, particularly those such as the Federal Reserve and Bank of England which are not keen on negative interest rates.
""If yields spiral higher, we would actually expect to see central banks step back in and control the bond market, whether through more bond buying or yield curve control,"" said Craig Inches, head of rates and cash at Royal London Asset Management (RLAM).
Just how quickly yields can climb if the economic outlook appears to brighten even slightly became evident last week when  Pfizer 's (N:PFE) vaccine update drove a 14 basis-point leap in U.S. Treasury yields, the biggest daily rise since March (US10YT=RR).
A rebound in economic activity next year might well send yields higher, which could then threaten that recovery which is still fragile. And merely expanding already-large bond-buying schemes may not resolve the problem.
""The benefit of YCC is that you can provide an implicit guarantee about the cost of funding the real economy, some certainty to businesses that they can invest at pre-determined rates,"" said Thomas Costerg, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management. 
For instance, Australian banks and companies usually borrow in the three-year space so the central bank uses its purchases to keep that rate around 0.1%.
Graphic: Australia's three-year bond yield and yield curve control - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpexoonvr/AUbond1611.png
OLD POLICY, NEW RISKS
The Fed isn't a stranger to YCC, having used it in the 1940s to cap wartime borrowing costs. The Bank of Japan adopted it in 2016 and Australia followed in March 2020.
The Fed and BOE have discussed but not endorsed the policy, the former describing it as providing ""only modest benefits"" at present.
Indeed in Japan, YCC is a double-edged sword. It has tamped down borrowing costs for the economy but the success has come at banks' expense.
Graphic: Japan's 10-year govt bond yield and YCC - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbqoowpq/JGB1611.png
Others question the need for YCC at central banks such as the Fed which already efficiently control rates via forward guidance.
In Australia, central bank bond buying focused on the three-year tenor has drained liquidity without really helping credit conditions, said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY)'s head of fixed income and currency strategy, Martin Whetton.
For all that, a powerful argument in favour of YCC has emerged in recent months - in a world where central banks own a record high proportion of government debt, targeted purchases could ease a deepening bond market squeeze.
Graphic: Central bank holdings of government bonds - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-BONDS/azgvoznnapd/chart.png
Concentrating purchases in one part of the market can ensure an adequate supply of securities for other buyers, in particular pension funds.
""Potentially yield curve control will keep the 0-10 year (yields) capped, while longer yields rise slightly thanks to the expectation of better economic growth ahead. That's a good scenario for pension funds and could be in the mindset of central banks,"" Inches at RLAM said. 
WHEN?
The catalyst for YCC adoption might be an abrupt rise in longer-dated yields - a so-called curve steepening. 
The Fed anchors short-dated yields near 0% but markets watch 10-year yields - the main reference rate for U.S. mortgage borrowing, corporate and municipal debt. 
Pictet's Costerg expects the Fed to act if 10-year U.S. yields approach 1.5% - they are currently around 0.9%. 
It gets more complicated in the 19-member euro area, though many would argue the ECB focus on spreads - the gap between German and southern European yields - is effectively a form of YCC.
Gilles Moec, chief economist at Axa Investment Partners, is among those who believe YCC is more likely, noting ECB chief Christine Lagarde's calls for a continued, powerful and targeted response to the crisis and her emphasis on fiscal policy.

""I think we are going in that direction if the ECB is now saying openly 'we have governments' back' and we will make sure that they can fund deficits easily,"" Moec said.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",U.S. hospitals to restrict Lilly COVID-19 antibody treatment due to limited supply,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - U.S. hospitals, weighing high demand and tight supplies, said they may limit use of a new Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) antibody drug to COVID-19 patients with multiple risk factors for serious illness or to those whose immune systems have not begun to fight the infection. The treatment, bamlanivimab, was given U.S. emergency use authorization (EUA) last week by the Food and Drug Administration for helping newly-diagnosed, high-risk patients avoid hospitalization.
""There will be a lot of pressure on physicians,"" said Dr. Adarsh Bhimraj, an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic and chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's guidelines panel, which is still discussing its recommendations for the drug. 
President Donald Trump has touted experimental antibody drugs after being treated with a similar therapy from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) during his own bout with COVID-19.
The federal government has paid $1,250 per dose for 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab, which experts estimate may only be enough for one weeks' worth of Americans becoming infected, based on the FDA label identifying appropriate patients.
The United States on Sunday crossed 11 million total coronavirus infections just a little over a week after hitting the 10 million mark since the pandemic began. Medical groups and hospitals said they are working to establish criteria for which patients are likely to benefit most from the drug, which consists of manufactured copies of an antibody made by the human body to fight COVID-19. ""Otherwise, we will be out of drug real soon,"" said Dr. Howard Huang, a lung specialist at Houston Methodist.
The FDA authorized bamlanivimab for patients over age 65 recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and patients with obesity, diabetes, or another risk factor. The agency said the drug should not be used in hospitalized patients.
""There may need to be some sort of composite score"" to select patients, Huang said. ""Maybe we would use it for someone who has cardiovascular disease, and a history of stroke and is older?"" 
Dr. Neha Nanda, medical director of infection prevention with Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles said ""more conservative criteria"" is needed. ""One group you could exclude is someone who has an antibody test that is positive,"" she said. ""I think we may need to do that."" 
Regeneron has said its experimental COVID-19 antibody cocktail has shown the most benefit in patients who had not mounted their own immune response prior to treatment. The company is also seeking an EUA.
Despite the FDA's clearance of Lilly's drug - based on published findings from a small mid-stage study - experts said they would like to see more clinical trial data.
The drug, given as a one-time infusion, is initially being distributed only to hospitals. Some were already set up to treat trial patients, while others said they are working on logistics.
The United States has the option to buy another 650,000 doses, but hospitals expect the drug will eventually become a commercial product.

Eli Lilly officials did not respond to requests for comment on pricing plans.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mostly lower Tuesday, after Monday’s record-breaking session, with sharp gains in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock likely to cause the Nasdaq to outperform.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 163 points, or 0.6%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.5%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 37 points, or 0.3%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.6%, or 472 points, higher Monday, while the S&P 500 was up 1.2%, both at record closing highs, as vaccine news from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) sparked a rally in value stocks on hopes for a quicker end to the pandemic. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.8%. 
However, this optimism has partially dissipated Tuesday as the number of coronavirus cases continues to increase in the short term, dampening the country’s near-term economic outlook. The U.S. recorded 166,000 new cases on Monday, along with 995 deaths. A record one million new cases were recorded last week.
The tech sector, which has tended to perform well during the pandemic, looks set to outperform Tuesday, especially given the likely hefty gains in Tesla’s stock after it was announced that the electric car maker is set to join the S&P 500 index in December. The $11.2 trillion of funds which are benchmarked to the index will have to gain proportional exposure to the stock.
The retail sector is also likely to be in focus Tuesday, with three big retailers--Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS)--reporting earnings before the market opens. All three handily beat expectations.
Additionally, news that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has launched an online pharmacy in the U.S., allowing customers to order and receive prescriptions without visiting stores, will hit competitors such as Walgreens Boots (NASDAQ:WBA), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD). CVS stock was down 7% in premarket, while the other two stocks were down over 10% each.%  
 Retail sales are expected to slow in October from the 1.9% growth seen in September, when the numbers are reported at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Analysts estimate a rise of 0.5%.
Industrial production for October is expected to have increased 1% from a contraction of 0.6% the prior month, while manufacturing production is seen up 1%, from a contraction of 0.3% in September. These numbers are due at 9:15 AM ET.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, with eyes on the world’s top producers to see whether they will agree to a further extension of supply curbs given the hit to demand caused by the pandemic.
OPEC+, a group which includes members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia, is due to hold a ministerial committee meeting later Tuesday which could recommend changes to production quotas when all the ministers meet on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $41.25 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $43.73.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Many EU governments oppose common rules on the use of rapid COVID-19 tests, an internal document seen by Reuters says, in a new blow to airlines which are betting on fast-track testing to help bring the travel industry back to life.
Airlines are pressing governments for alternatives to blanket curbs on movement amid a second wave of COVID-19 sweeping Europe, with Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Alitalia (DE:LHAG) spearheading the use of rapid antigen tests.
But many EU governments are not ready for common procedures on the tests which would help ease travel across Europe, according to the document prepared by the German government, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
""A large number of member states made clear that discussions on common minimum standards and criteria were premature,"" the paper, dated Nov. 12, says.
The document will be on the table when EU leaders discuss coordination in fighting the pandemic in a video conference on Thursday.
Rapid antigen kits are less accurate than standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, but can offer results in a few minutes, as opposed to days.
European airlines are using them on passengers before departure, allowing only those who test negative to travel. But the testing is largely limited to domestic flights, partly because of European countries' reluctance to apply consistent rules.
Some governments seek more scientific evidence behind rapid testing, the German document says. Many say testing is a national issue for which there is no need for a common approach, the document says without naming any state.
The executive EU Commission will issue a recommendation on how to use rapid testing on Wednesday, but governments are not obliged to heed it.
The commission had also planned to issue advice on Wednesday on quarantine and self-isolation for those who come into contact with people who test positive for COVID-19 - but it has now decided to delay the non-binding proposal because of contrasting scientific advice, an EU official said.
A commission spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
""IT IS A DISASTER""
That comes as a further blow for the industry, as common quarantine rules would eliminate another major hurdle to travelers, who now have to abide by different requirements when they cross a national EU border.
""The approaches of member states on quarantine obligations in connection with travel differ considerably,"" the German document says.
At a video conference in late October, EU leaders pledged to do more together for testing and tracing, and avoid divisions that dogged the 27-nation bloc at the beginning of the pandemic in the spring, when many countries closed their borders contributing to medicine shortages and food blockages.
But immediately after the virtual summit, national experts in technical meetings kept dragging their feet.
""It is a disaster,"" a second EU official said, adding that diplomats and experts showed little appetite for more cooperation.
The German document was initially labeled a ""progress report"", but it has been renamed ""report on the state of play of EU coordination"" against the pandemic, because there had been ""little progress"", a European diplomat said.
""The report provides a snapshot of the state of play on a number of COVID-19 related topics. Given that the issues addressed are all matters of national competency, we will continue to work intensively with our EU partners and the commission to take EU coordination forward,"" a spokesman for the German presidency said.
On tracing, which is essential to monitor the spread of the disease, the EU Commission has set up a platform that would allow national apps to work across EU borders, so that people can continue to be traced when they are abroad.
But at present only six national apps have joined the common platform, the document says, adding however that other 19 were lined up to be added by the end of this month.
A common digital form to locate passengers is still a work in progress. Currently states use these forms for different purposes, some of them only on paper.

The document says that the goal is to have a system in place for all types of transport by April.

The airline and its subsidiaries, Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian and Brussels Airlines, are cutting their schedules, fleet and staff, with air travel not expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels before 2025.
""Our current snack offer in economy class does not always meet the expectations of our guests,"" Christina Foerster, executive board member, said in a statement.
Instead, Lufthansa and its subsidiaries will introduce a new range of food and drinks for sale on short and medium-haul flights, with Austrian airlines starting the new offer, followed by Swiss and Lufthansa.
Lufthansa and Swiss will also give passengers a complementary bottle of water.
Passengers on budget airlines such as Ryanair (I:RYA) and Lufthansa's Eurowings, have long had to pay for their own snacks and drinks.

1315,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 06:42AM ET</span>","Stocks Retrace, Tesla Makes S&P 500, Retail Sales, OPEC+ - What's up in Markets","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) makes it into the Promised Land, Stocks retrace a little from record highs posted in the wake of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccine announcement, U.S. retail sales and industrial production are both due, and OPEC's technical experts meet to review the oil market. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, Novermber 17th.
1. Tesla cracks the S&P 500
Tesla has made it into the promised land. From December 21, Elon Musk’s electric car company will be admitted to the S&P 500 index, from which moment the $11.2 trillion of funds which are benchmarked to the index will have to include proportional exposure to the stock.
S&P Dow Jones Indices said that because of the company’s size – at over $400 billion it’s the most valuable company ever to be admitted to the index – it will hold a consultation as to whether to incorporate it in two stages (on December 14th and 21st ), rather than one.
This is the moment that the retail investor bulls who drove the stock’s giddying rally earlier this year have been waiting for: the opportunity to sell to a person or robot who has no choice but to buy. Despite being widely anticipated by that rally, the news still pushed the stock up 12.5% in premarket trading to within 10% of its all-time high.
2. Trump tries to leave his mark on Afghanistan, Alaska and the Fed
President Donald Trump continues to make life as hard for the incoming administration as possible. The Wall Street Journal said the outgoing administration is drawing up plans to order a further drawdown of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan by January 15, five days before he leaves office.
Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said the move would be a boon to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, and an abandonment of the Afghan government that is fighting the Taliban. He compared it to the U.S. withdrawal of Vietnam in 1975.
In addition, the Interior Department is finalizing orders to allow oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, something that President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to block.
Trump’s plan to fill the Federal Reserve’s board with loyalists, however, faces resistance. On Monday, Lamarr Alexander became the third GOP Senator, after Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, to say he wouldn’t vote for Judy Shelton’s nomination to the Fed’s board of governors.
3 Stocks set to retrace; Walmart's earnings due
U.S. stocks are set to open slightly lower, retracing some - but by no means all - of Monday’s surge that took both the Dow Jones and S&P 500 to new record highs.
By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was down 159 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.5% and Nasdaq futures were up 0.4%.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) lead a thin line of companies reporting Monday. Home Depot got the ball rolling with earnings that beat expectations by just under 4%, chalking up another victory for the skill of expectation management.
Also in focus will be Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), which said after the close last night it had bought stakes in four big pharma companies -  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Abbvie, Merck and Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb. All four have seen sales of their key products suffer this year as Covid-19 has disrupted treatment schedules for other ailments.
4. Industrial production, retail sales eyed
The economic data calendar is headed by the release of industrial production and retail sales data for October, at 9:15 AM ET and 8:30 AM ET, respectively.
Industrial output fell in September for the first time in five months, but is expected to return to growth with a rise of 1.0% last month.
Retail sales, meanwhile, are on a five-month winning streak, after picking up to a 1.9% increase in September. As they account for a much bigger part of the U.S. economy, the market will be looking particularly closely to see whether this trend can be sustained.
5 OPEC+ experts meet; API inventories due
The so-called OPEC+ bloc of oil producers will hold a virtual meeting of technical experts to review the state of the oil market, two weeks before its ministers decide on the bloc’s output policy for the coming months.
The meeting of the ‘Joint Technical Committee’ will take no decisions on output policy, but its recommendations will naturally carry a good deal of weight. The open session of the meeting starts at 8 AM ET.
Ahead of the meeting, both Saudi Arabia and Russia have hinted heavily at their readiness to postpone a planned production increase of nearly 2 million barrels a day that is scheduled for the start of next year. There are fears that global demand will not be strong enough to absorb the increased supply.
Elsewhere, the American Petroleum Institute will report its U.S. inventory data for last week. Traders will be looking to see which way the contradiction implicit in the API and governments reports last week will be resolved."
1316,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Record high stocks bask in November reign,"By Alun John and Chibuike Oguh
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets grabbed a well-earned breather on Tuesday after a second major coronavirus vaccine boost in the space of a week had propelled them higher again and put Europe on course for its best month in nearly three decades.
The pan-European STOXX 600 dipped 0.2% in early moves but there was little sign of an end to the November bull run that has also seen confidence-sensitive commodities and emerging markets surge. 
MSCI's main 49-country world stocks index was perched at a record high having risen 11% and all but once this month, while China's yuan hit a near 2-1/2 year peak in the currency markets as the U.S. dollar continued to sag.
Investors are in ""full bull"" mode, BofA's monthly investor survey showed on Tuesday.
With global economic growth and profit expectations running at a 20-year high among those the bank surveyed, the ""reopening rotation"" back into coronavirus-hit sctors is likely to continue for the rest of the year, BofA added, although they did also recommend cashing in in the coming weeks or months.
The latest boost come from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) which said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing infection based on interim late-stage data.
The U.S.-based firm became the second drugmaker, after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), to announce promising data. Its shares gained 9.6% on the day.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.2% overnight, a day after hitting its highest level since launching in 1987.
Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.4% after hitting a 29-year high the day before, but Chinese blue chips dipped as recent bond defaults hit sentiment. 
""The market is assuming that we can see the end of the tunnel, that in 2022 a large part of the world's population will start to receive access to vaccines,"" said Herald van der Linde (NYSE:LIN), HSBC's head of equity strategy for Asia Pacific. 
There were initial indications that this was sparking a change in investors' attitudes, he added. 
OIL ON THE BOIL
The positive vaccine news helped oil prices add to their 16% November gains. 
U.S. crude inched up to $41.57 per barrel after rising 3.02% on Monday, and Brent gained 0.7% after a 2.43% jump the day before. 
In currency markets, China's central bank on Tuesday lifted its official yuan midpoint to the highest in nearly 29 months, underpinned by solid gains in spot prices a day earlier on the back of strong economic data.
The vaccine news also helped the risk-friendly Australian dollar, which climbed to a one-week high against its U.S. counterpart. Rising virus case numbers in the United States clouded views on the dollar, which dropped against a basket of major currencies. 
Euro zone bond markets showed little reaction to Hungary and Poland's veto of the EU's budget and recovery fund in early Tuesday trade.
Italy was expected to sell a U.S. dollar bond while China was preparing for a potentially record euro-denominated bond sale which was due to be finalised on Wednesday.
Euro zone bonds, which sold off moderately and then recouped losses later on Monday, were steady in early Tuesday trade, with Germany's 10-year benchmark yield at -0.55% and Italy's 10-year yield at 0.61%.
The closely watched gap between Italian and German 10-year yields -- effectively the risk premium on debt from Italy, one of the main beneficiaries of the recovery fund - was near its lowest since early 2018 at around 115 basis points.

The lack of market reactions ""tend to reflect the market's view that the EU will find a way to hammer out a compromise that keeps all parties roughly happy,"" Andy Cossor, a strategist at DZ Bank, said of the Polish and Hungarian vetoes.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Amazon launches online pharmacy in new contest with drug retail,"By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Tuesday launched an online pharmacy for delivering prescription medications in the United States, increasing competition with drug retailers such as Walgreens (O:WBA), CVS (N:CVS) and Walmart (N:WMT). 
Called Amazon Pharmacy, the new store lets customers price-compare as they buy drugs on the company's website or app. Shoppers can toggle at checkout between their co-pay and a non-insurance option, heavily discounted for members of its loyalty club Prime.
The move builds on the web retailer's 2018 acquisition of PillPack, which Amazon said will remain separate for customers needing pre-sorted doses of multiple drugs.
Over the past two years, Amazon has worked to secure more state licenses for shipping prescriptions across the country, which had been an obstacle to its expansion into the drug supply chain, according to analyst notes from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Equity Research.
The company founded as an online bookseller has disrupted industries including retail, computing and now potentially pharmaceuticals, drawing criticism of its size and power from labor groups and lawmakers along the way.
TJ Parker, PillPack's CEO and vice president of Amazon Pharmacy, said in a statement the retailer aimed to bring ""customer obsession to an industry that can be inconvenient and confusing.""
Amazon faces entrenched competition from Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, CVS Health Corp, Walmart Inc,  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD),  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and others. Take-up of online ordering of drugs has been low, according to market research from J.D. Power.
Should Prime members prefer buying in person, Amazon said its discounts on non-insurance purchases apply at more than 50,000 brick-and-mortar pharmacies - including those run by rivals. Inside Rx, a subsidiary of  Cigna Corp 's (N:CI) Evernorth, administers that benefit, Amazon said.
Still, the pandemic may help bring drug orders online. E-commerce has surged this year as governments told people to stay home to stave off infections of COVID-19, and Prime members - more than 150 million globally - may be receptive to buying medication online now that it's from Amazon.
The company said Prime subscribers get up to 80% off generic and up to 40% off brand drugs when they pay without insurance, as well as two-day delivery.

Amazon's online pharmacy is not yet available in Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana, Kentucky, and Hawaii, a spokeswoman said.

(Reuters) -  Autodesk Inc  (O:ADSK) on Tuesday said it acquired Spacemaker, a Norwegian firm whose software is used by architects to create and evaluate buildings or urban developments, for $240 million.
San Rafael, California-based Autodesk is a major supplier of the three-dimensional design software that architects use to create structures. Oslo-based Spacemaker's software pulls in data about a potential building site such as the surrounding terrain, weather patterns, traffic patterns and information about zoning rules and then uses artificial intelligence to generate a range of options for how architects can get the most out of the space.
In an interview, Andrew Anagnost, chief executive of Autodesk, said what drew the company to Spacemaker was the use of artificial intelligence ""to help maximize the return for all the stakeholders in the process"" of an urban development.
The software can be used to try to maximize the return on investment for developers while also meeting other goals, such as giving future tenants the best possible natural lighting or views in a given landscape or minimizing additional traffic congestion generated by a project.
""You can actually put all of these constraints into the system and dial in which one you want the most attention for,"" Anagnost said.
Spacemaker is Autodesk's thirteenth acquisition of a technology startup in the architecture, engineering and construction industries since 2017. The company's last three acquisitions have totaled more than $1.1 billion.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: BMW deal to lift stake in China venture unaffected by Brilliance parent's debt issues,"By Yilei Sun and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) said on Tuesday there was no indication that its deal to increase its stake in its joint venture with Brilliance China Automotive (HK:1114) would be affected by debt issues at Brilliance's parent.
BMW said in 2018 that it would pay 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in 2022 for a further 25% stake in the venture with Brilliance - its main joint venture in China - adding to its existing 50% holding and giving it control of BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA). 
However, investors have raised doubts over whether the deal will proceed as creditors of Brilliance's parent, Huachen Automotive Group, have applied to a court asking for a restructuring of the company. 
""For the BMW Group, there is no indication that the validity of these contracts would be limited by the current situation,"" a BMW representative told Reuters via an emailed statement on Tuesday. 
""The BMW Group and the operating business of the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd (BBA) are not directly affected by the payment difficulties of the Chinese Brilliance Group."" Brilliance's parent is officially named Huachen Automotive Group Holdings Company Ltd.
Since September Brilliance has held conference calls with investors to provide assurances that Huachen's debt problems were unlikely to impact the execution of the deal, three people who joined different calls said.
A fourth source close to the government in Liaoning province, where the joint venture is based, told Reuters that the authorities are keen to let BMW increase its stake in the JV and expand manufacturing capacity there as planned.
Brilliance and Huachen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Haitong International analyst Shi Ji said that according to the contract terms, 50% of BBA is not directly held by Brilliance, but through two layers of entities that are 100% owned by Brilliance and its subsidiary.
Therefore, even if Huachen Group goes bankrupt or transfers its stakes, BBA's operation is legally protected, he said.
China has seen a smattering of high-profile Chinese debt defaults in recent days, spooking traders and sparking a bond market selloff. 
The latest clutch of defaults, which Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) noted are bigger and include more state-owned enterprises than last year, highlight that investors need to pay close attention to avoid being caught in the credit cleanup.
Bondholders see a bankruptcy restructuring by Huachen to be unfavourable as they will likely end up getting little out of the process.
Sources told Reuters in September that Chinese state-backed investors are considering taking Brilliance private, although that is not expected to affect BMW's plan to lift its stake.

1321,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 05:53AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Vaccines Widen the Light at the End of the Tunnel for EasyJet,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- This is starting to become a pattern.
Every positive announcement about vaccine development is triggering a surge in optimism and a rotation into cyclical, ‘value’ names, which immediately – if only partially – unwinds the minute that everyone remembers how grim the current situation still is.
Europe’s stock markets were all trading lower on Tuesday, realizing again that the announcement of a drug’s effectiveness against Covid-19 is not the same as having that drug manufactured, distributed and administered at such scale that the pandemic can be declared over.
By 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.2% at 389.16. Most of the big national indices were down in line.
The good news is that the market’s momentum is still intact: both the Stoxx 600 and the Euro Stoxx 50 hit their highest levels since February on Monday, building on the breakout from the summer box that they made in reaction to the Pfizer/Biontech announcement last week. Anyone looking at the charts can still justifiably call that announcement a game changer.
This being the case, it seems only reasonable to assume that further gains will be made when the pharma industry reaches the next key milestones, with requests for and the granting of regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU. Every milestone reached allows the discount for various risks to be eroded.
For easyJet (LON:EZJ), which was Europe’s second-biggest airline going into the pandemic, any cry of victory would still be premature, however. The group said on Tuesday is set to burn through more cash between now and December, flying at only 20% of its capacity due to the current wave of lockdowns, down from 38% in the three months through September. That's despite radical cost-cutting measures that included thousands of job cuts the sale and leaseback of much of its fleet. It paid no dividend for the past fiscal year, and gave no guidance for the one just started.
How much money it will burn by New Year depends on that crucial question of whether and how hard European governments will fight to keep their societies open at Christmas. As yet, there is no single answer to that question: French Health Minister Olivier Veran told BFM TV on Tuesday that bars and restaurants, which have already been closed for two weeks, are unlikely to reopen next month, even though it’s still the government’s aim to reopen non-essential shops on Dec. 1. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's plans to tighten restrictions in order to allow a loosening by Christmas were rebuffed strongly by regional governors at a meeting Monday. They'll meet again next week to set a course for Europe's largest economy.
EasyJet shares fell 1.7% by mid-morning in London, underperforming the broader index. But like other companies that depend on people regaining the confidence to travel, it’s holding on to the vast bulk of its gains since the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) news. The stock is up 61% on the month as is IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways and Iberia. Air France-KLM is up 46%, while Ryanair, which fell less than most airlines in the sector is now up 2% year-to-date.
With the light at the end of the tunnel getting bigger, the key task for airlines in particular seems to be to remove the tail risk of bankruptcy in the short term. SAS, with its latest capital increase, may have managed that – it was up 3.2% by mid-morning in Europe and up 45% in the week since it announced the measure – but its local low-cost rival Norwegian Air Shuttle seems ever less likely to make it to the end of the tunnel: it fell another 7.7% on Tuesday to a new all-time low. With a remaining market value of only $180 million, it’s all but out of runway."

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",Investors in 'full bull' mode as vaccine hopes run high: BofA survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are in ""full bull"" mode, deploying more money into emerging markets, small-cap stocks and the banking sector on hopes a COVID-19 vaccine will turn around these hard-hit market segments, BofA's monthly investor survey showed on Tuesday.
Global stocks hit a new record high on Monday as positive data for a potential COVID-19 vaccine came from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), following similarly upbeat data from rival  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE). Investors surveyed by BofA expect a ""credible vaccine"" by January.
The euphoria sent investors' cash levels down to 4.1% in November, from 4.4% last month, to pre-COVID-19 levels last seen in January, according to the survey of 190 fund managers with $526 billion in assets under management.
With global economic growth and profit expectations running at a 20-year high among the investors surveyed, the ""reopening rotation"" into oversold business sectors is likely to continue in the fourth quarter, BofA said.
But the bank advised clients: ""We say 'sell the vaccine' in coming weeks/months as we think we're close to 'full bull'.""
Meanwhile, in U.S. Treasuries, 73% of the investors surveyed were expecting steeper yield curves -- rates on longer-term U.S. Treasury securities rising faster than short-term rates. Expectations were far higher than after the 2008 Lehman bankruptcy, 2013 taper tantrum and 2016 elections.
For 2021, investors named ""long"" emerging market assets, S&P 500 (SPX) and oil as their favourite trades. Nearly half of the investors surveyed by BofA said they expect emerging markets to outperform in 2021.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",Vaccine-led rally stalls in Europe as travel shares slide,"(Reuters) - European stocks eased from eight-month highs as tighter coronavirus-driven restrictions across the continent hit travel stocks, halting a broader rally that was powered by encouraging COVID-19 vaccine news.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) slipped 0.1% in morning trading. The index closed at it highest level since Feb. 27 on Monday after positive data from drugmaker  Moderna 's (O:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine.
Earlier,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech flagged strong progress in their COVID-19 vaccine, sparking a rally in global equities last week.
""Though the vaccine developments were incredibly positive, markets still have a bit of a 'show me the logistics' side to it,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid wrote in a morning note. 
Near-term economic outlook remains hazy as the grip of the virus grows stronger, with Sweden moving to restrict the size of public gatherings and a British medical adviser suggesting strengthening the three-tier system of restrictions when the full lockdown in England ends.
Travel stocks (SXTP) fell the most, with British airline EasyJet (L:EZJ) sliding 5% after it recorded a 1.27 billion pound ($1.68 billion) annual loss, the first in its history that also highlights the extent of the pandemic's impact on air travel.
European banks (SX7P) retreated after a more than 3% surge on Monday. BBVA (MC:BBVA) fell 4.2% after it and smaller rival Sabadell (MC:SABE) said they were in talks to create Spain's second-biggest domestic lender by assets.
Sabadell shares jumped 3.5% to become the second-biggest gainer on the STOXX 600. 
Other economically sensitive sectors such as oil and gas (SXEP) and automakers (SXAP) retreated after a sharp rally in the past week as hopes of a vaccine prompted investors to bet on a faster economic recovery.
Tobacco company Imperial Brands (L:IMB) gained 3% after it forecast a rise in profit for 2021, helped by expected improvements in its e-cigarette business.

Defensive sectors such as utilities (SX6P) and healthcare (SXDP) inched higher.

Investing.com - European stock markets drifted lower Tuesday, amid caution over the economic outlook given the restrictions to combat the Covid-19 surge despite the latest positive Covid-19 vaccine news.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.3%.
Investor sentiment was given a boost Monday when  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing infection, adding to  Pfizer  's (NYSE:PFE) promising trial data last week.
However, the near-term economic outlook remains dim, with many European countries resorting to partial lockdowns to try and combat the recent surge in coronavirus cases throughout the region as the colder weather forces people inside. Germany, which is struggling to bring its infection rate down, largely put off major decisions on new restrictions at a high-level meeting on Monday. 
The European Central Bank has already hinted at further action when it next meets in December, but the central bank can only really provide cheap liquidity to support the real economy. Most needs to come from fiscal policy, and there was a setback there on Monday with Hungary and Poland blocking the adoption of the 2021-2027 budget and the 750 billion euro recovery fund.
Additionally, investors have started to reassess the situation amid worries over vaccine production and delivery, and given the ever-increasing number of coronavirus cases globally, particularly in the U.S..
The United States recorded more than one million new Covid-19 cases last week, with new infections rising in every state except for Hawaii, according to Reuters data, while deaths increased 12% in the week ended Nov. 15.
In corporate news, easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock fell 4.4% after the budget airliner swung to a loss in fiscal 2020 as revenue was hit hard by the pandemic and said it will operate at only 20% capacity in the current quarter. It also declined to pay a dividend.
On the flip side, Dassault Systemes (PA:DAST) stock rose 0.7% after the French technology and software company issued a new financial outlook on Tuesday, forecasting solid growth in its cash flow over the next few years.
Oil prices edged lower Monday, with eyes on the world’s top producers to see whether they will agree to a further extension of supply curbs given the hit to demand caused by the pandemic.
OPEC+, a group which includes members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia, is due to hold a ministerial committee meeting later Tuesday which could recommend changes to production quotas when all the ministers meet on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.
Expectations are growing that the group will suggest a postponement of the planned January increase in oil output for at least three months to support prices as the pandemic continues to hit demand.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $41.27 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $43.81.
Elsewhere, gold futures traded 0.1% higher at $1,888.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1870.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",Tricking the taste buds: flavour makers rise to meaty challenge,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) - At flavour maker Givaudan's innovation centre near Zurich, veteran chef Sam Brunschweiler serves up a lamb shawarma dish that looks and tastes appropriately meaty but is made from pea protein.
The Swiss company and competitors such as International Flavors & Fragrances and Symrise are vying to create the tastiest plant-based meat alternatives in a market that is growing fast on the back of consumer concerns about health, sustainability and animal welfare.
""A pea tastes like a pea. You put it in a burger, it's not exactly what you would expect,"" Givaudan's head of savoury flavours, Flavio Garofalo, told Reuters.
Givaudan analyses how fat, proteins, sugars and water in meat produce different flavours when heated because ""most of the flavour comes from the cooking"", Garofalo said.
Mimicking the conditions in a vessel with non-animal proteins, sugar and fat - and using less water for roasted and more for boiled flavours - allows specialists to re-create a meat taste without meat, he said, just as a strawberry flavour can be created from bananas and apples.
The market for plant-based meat analogues, dominated by U.S.-based Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Impossible Foods and global food group Nestle, is expected to be worth $27 billion by 2025, according to Euromonitor http://blog.euromonitor.com.
TOO MUCH SALT?
Stacy Pyett, who manages a protein programme at Wageningen University & Research, said flavour houses played a key role in creating tastier plant-based meat analogues.
Improving their nutritional profile, which typically has more salt but fewer vitamins and iron than meat, is also a challenge. 
Pyett said research showed salt was easier to taste in a juicy sausage than in a dry one, an indication that enhancing juiciness in meat analogues might allow for reducing added salt. 
Garofalo said Givaudan had created flavours that allowed cutting the salt content by 35-40% while keeping the taste.
The company has also developed a 'fat encapsulation' technology that preserves fat in plant-based burgers during cooking as in real meat. Normally with plant-based products, most of the fats melt and flow into the pan.
""Fat is present in meat in what we call fat cells. When the fat melts, it's inside a little capsule that only breaks at a certain temperature,"" Garofalo said.
The technology, which is awaiting a patent, would keep the fat inside the patty and make it juicier, allowing for a reduction in fat content of up to 75% and of calories by around 35%.
Chantelle Nicholson, a London-based chef who participated in Givaudan's Chef's Council on plant-based food last year, said the fat encapsulation technology was ""a huge breakthrough"" because fat gave flavour to meat and it was still difficult to get the same depth of flavour with plant-based alternatives.
For Givaudan's peers Symrise and IFF, too, plant-based meat substitutes are a priority. 
Symrise said it was particularly important to use natural ingredients from sustainable sources because consumers cared about that. The German group has developed ProtiScan, a procedure allowing quick detection of off-tastes in food containing plant-based proteins.

U.S.-based IFF, which increased its plant-based footprint through a merger with Dupont Nutrition & Biosciences, said it was about to launch technologies that improve mouthfeel and texture and use new natural maskers.

DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) began marketing a five-tranche U.S. dollar-denominated bond sale on Tuesday, as the world's largest oil producer seeks cash after low oil prices dented its finances.
The move is part of an onslaught on international debt markets by Gulf issuers seeking to plug finances hit by the pandemic and weak oil prices, which has pushed regional issuance past last year's record to surpass $100 billion again.
Aramco needs the money to pay dividends of $37.5 billion for the second half of 2020 and fund its $69.1 billion purchase of 70% of Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) (SE:2010). 
It raised a loan of $10 billion this year, to be paid by installments until 2028, to back that acquisition.
Aramco gave initial price guidance of around 140 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries (UST) for a three-year tranche, around 155 bps over UST for five-year bonds, around 175 bps over UST for 10-year notes, around 205 bps over UST for a 30-year tranche and around 230 bps over UST for 50-year bonds, the document showed.
There has been no official indication of size but Aramco's second foray into the international debt markets is expected to be sizeable, after raising $12 billion in its debut bond issuance last year.
""An issuer like this doesn't usually print tranches smaller than $1.5 billion or thereabouts,"" a banker on the deal said.
Last year, Aramco priced inside the sovereign of Saudi Arabia's curve, but financial sources expect its new bonds to be around 10 bps wider, suggesting investors see a slightly higher risk profile after this year's drop in oil prices.
Citi (N:C), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), HSBC (L:HSBA), JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and NCB Capital (SE:1180) were hired as active book runners, a document issued by one of the banks on the deal showed.

Other banks involved in the deal include  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), BOC International (SS:601696), BofA Securities (N:BAC),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), First Abu Dhabi Bank (AD:FAB), Mizuho (T:8411), MUFG (T:8306), SMBC Nikko (T:8316) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), the document showed.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Tuesday, handing back some of Monday’s sharp gains after optimism over the latest positive Covid-19 vaccine news wanes.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%. 
Investor sentiment was given a boost Monday when  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing infection, adding to Pfizer’s promising trial data last week.
This resulted in strong equity market gains, with the FTSE 100 and the CAC 40 both closing 1.7% higher and the DAX gaining 0.5%.
However, investors have started to reassess the situation amid worries over vaccine production and delivery, and given the ever-increasing number of coronavirus cases globally, particularly in the U.S..
The World Health Organization welcomed the vaccine news but said that ""many questions"" remained and there was no time for complacency, particularly as only very limited amounts of any vaccine will be available in the first half of 2021 for people other than priority health workers.
A number of European countries appear to have had some success in controlling the rate of growth of new cases, largely by shutting parts of  their economies down again, but the situation in the U.S., the world's largest economy, looks much more grim. 
The United States recorded more than one million new Covid-19 cases last week, with new infections rising in every state except for Hawaii, according to Reuters data, while deaths increased 12% in the week ended Nov. 15.
In corporate news, Dassault Systemes (PA:DAST) will be in focus Tuesday after the French technology and software company issued a new financial outlook on Tuesday, forecasting solid growth in its cash flow over the next few years.
Oil prices edged higher Monday, helped by the news of another promising vaccine trial and expectations that the world’s top producers will agree to a further extension of supply curbs.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 12:47AM ET</span>",We can stop COVID-19: Moderna vaccine success gives world more hope,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Michael Erman
(Reuters) -  Moderna  Inc's (O:MRNA) experimental vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial, the company said on Monday, becoming the second U.S. drugmaker to report results that far exceed expectations.
Together with  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) vaccine, which is also more than 90% effective, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the United States could have two vaccines authorized for emergency use in December with as many as 60 million doses of vaccine available this year.
The vaccines, both developed with new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), represent powerful tools to fight a pandemic that has infected 54 million people worldwide and killed 1.3 million.
Unlike Pfizer's vaccine, Moderna's shot can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, which should make it easier to distribute, a critical factor as COVID-19 cases are soaring, hitting new records in the United States and pushing some European countries back into lockdowns.
""We are going to have a vaccine that can stop COVID-19,"" Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in a telephone interview.
Moderna's interim analysis was based on 95 infections among trial participants who received the vaccine or a placebo. Only five infections occurred in volunteers who received the vaccine mRNA-1273, which is administered in two shots 28 days apart.
""The vaccine is really the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert said. He urged Americans not to let their guard down and to continue washing hands and being vigilant about social distancing.
Even with fast authorization, the vaccines will not come in time for most people celebrating the U.S. Thanksgiving and end-of-year holidays, when families and friends come together - just the types of gatherings public health officials warn against.
Moderna expects to have enough safety data required for U.S. authorization in the next week or so and expects to file for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the coming weeks.
The company's shares, which have more than quadrupled this year, jumped 8%, while European and U.S. stocks rose. The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) rose 1%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) climbed 1.3%. [MKTS/GLOB]
Shares in Pfizer and its partner BioNTech (O:BNTX), whose vaccine must be transported at far colder temperatures, fell 4.3% and 16.4% respectively, while Britain's AstraZeneca (L:AZN), which has yet to release any results from its late-stage vaccine trials, was down 1%.
(For graphic on U.S. biotech shares: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlalampb/biotech.PNG)
SEVERE CASES
Moderna's data provide further validation of the promising but previously unproven mRNA platform, which turns the human body into a vaccine factory by coaxing cells to make virus proteins that the immune system sees as a threat and attacks.
Moderna expects the vaccine to be stable at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F) for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20C.
Pfizer's vaccine must be shipped and stored at -70C, the sort of temperature typical of an Antarctic winter. It can be stored for up to five days at standard refrigerator temperatures, or for up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.
The data from Moderna's trial involving 30,000 volunteers also showed the vaccine prevented cases of severe COVID-19, a question that still remains with the Pfizer vaccine. Of the 95 cases in Moderna's trial, 11 were severe and all 11 occurred among volunteers who got the placebo.
Moderna, part of the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed program, expects to produce about 20 million doses for the United States this year, millions of which the company has already made and is ready to ship if it gets FDA authorization.
""Assuming we get an emergency use authorization, we'll be ready to ship through Warp Speed almost in hours,"" Hoge said. ""So it could start being distributed instantly."" 
The 95 cases of COVID-19 included several key groups who are at increased risk for severe disease, including 15 cases in adults aged 65 and older and 20 in participants from racially diverse groups.
""We will need much more data and a full report or publication to see if the benefit is consistent across all groups, notably the elderly, but this is definitely encouraging progress, said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
The trials were designed to measure whether the vaccines stop people from getting sick rather than whether they prevent transmission, which remains to be tested.
""It is likely that vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease will reduce the duration and level of infectiousness, and thus reduce transmission, but we don't yet know if this effect will be large enough to make any meaningful difference to the spread of the virus within communities,"" said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh.
ROLLING REVIEW
Most side effects were mild to moderate. A significant proportion of volunteers, however, experienced more severe aches and pains after taking the second dose, including about 10% who had fatigue severe enough to interfere with daily activities while another 9% had severe body aches. Most of these complaints were generally short-lived, Moderna said.
""These effects are what we would expect with a vaccine that is working and inducing a good immune response,"" said Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.
The U.S. government, faced with the world's highest known number of COVID-19 cases, could have access next year to more than 1 billion doses from Moderna and Pfizer, more than needed for the country's 330 million residents.
The Trump Administration has mainly relied on the development of vaccines and treatments as its response to the pandemic. Moderna has received nearly $1 billion in research and development funding from the U.S. government and has a $1.5 billion deal for 100 million doses. The government has an option for another 400 million doses.
The company hopes to produce between 500 million and 1 billion doses in 2021, split between its U.S. and international manufacturing sites, depending in part on demand.
Europe's health regulator said on Monday it had launched a real-time ""rolling review"" of Moderna's vaccine, as it has done for vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca (L:AZN). Brussels also said it was in talks with Moderna about securing doses.

Other countries such as China and Russia have already begun vaccinations. Russia licensed its Sputnik-V COVID-19 vaccine for domestic use in August before it started large-scale trials. It said on Nov. 11 that its vaccine was 92% effective based on 20 infections in its large trial.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said on Monday it has begun investing in the stocks of four large drugmakers, betting on an industry that could benefit when the world begins emerging from the coronavirus pandemic.
In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of Sept. 30, Berkshire disclosed $5.7 billion of new healthcare stakes, including more than $1.8 billion each in Abbvie Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co, Merck & Co and $136 million in  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)
Shares of the drugmakers rose in after-hours trading.
The filing signals where Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler see value. Buffett normally handles large investments for Berkshire's $245.3 billion stock portfolio himself.
""COVID-19 has made us think differently about healthcare,"" said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong & Associates in Pittsburgh, which owns Berkshire stock.
""The sector has become more efficient as big drug companies partner with smaller, inventive rivals,"" Armstrong added. ""But you will always need companies with scale for manufacturing and distribution, including vaccines with global application.""
Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
During the third quarter, Berkshire also took a $276 million stake in wireless phone company T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc.
It sold a $1.3 billion stake in Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), which benefited as people stocked up on groceries and home supplies during the pandemic, and pared holdings in four banks: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), PNC and M&T.
The stake in JPMorgan, where Combs is a director, fell by 96%.
Berkshire also bought more stock in the grocer Kroger (NYSE:KR), sold some stock in mining company Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), and confirmed it bought more Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock while trimming its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stake.
The healthcare bet is structured similarly to the more than $6 billion wager that Buffett made on the four largest U.S. airlines.
Buffett sold Berkshire's airline holdings in April, saying the pandemic had changed the industry and made its outlook uncertain.
Other new investments in the quarter included a $6 billion stake in five Japanese trading houses and a $1.5 billion wager on newly public data storage company Snowflake Inc.

Berkshire also has more than 90 operating units including Geico car insurance, BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream.

1334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 11:00PM ET</span>",Here’s What People Are Saying About China at the Bloomberg NEF,"(Bloomberg) -- The challenges posed by China’s rise and the incoming Biden administration’s future approach toward Beijing dominated discussions on the first day of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, as leading global thinkers offered insights into the world’s most important bilateral relationship.
Current and former prime ministers, presidents and other top officials spoke at the virtual Bloomberg forum about the trajectory of U.S.-China ties as the two powers continue to spar on everything from trade and technology to human rights. They spoke about how President Donald Trump changed relations, and the challenges facing President-elect Joe Biden.
Below are some of the key highlights. The New Economy Forum is organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.
Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore Prime Minister
In an interview with Bloomberg Editor-In-Chief John Micklethwait, the leader of the Asian city-state said Biden should look to develop an “overall constructive relationship” with China following “quite a tumultuous ride” over the course of President Donald Trump’s reign in the White House. He said Southeast Asian countries don’t want to be forced to choose between the U.S. and China.
“We all want to work together with the U.S., we all want to work together with other vibrant economies, we would like to cooperate within the region,” Lee said. “I think not very many countries would like to join basically a coalition against those who have been excluded, chief of whom will be China.”
Wang Qishan, Chinese Vice President
The influential Chinese official called for global solidarity and a shift away from protectionism, as Beijing assesses changes that may come under a Biden administration.
“Countries must rise above exclusive blocs and reject the zero-sum mentality,” Wang said. “We should build an open world economy that works for all. We must firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system under the WTO and unequivocally reject unilateralism and protectionism.”
Bill Clinton, Former U.S. President
The former U.S. president spoke in a wide-ranging conversation with former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair about how a Biden administration would reinvigorate America’s presence in international institutions, how to prepare for the next pandemic and changes that have taken place under President Xi Jinping. Clinton said there were “clear disagreements” with Beijing over its crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong and the internment of Uighur Muslims in western China, but said there was a “desperate need to work together” on climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The old Chinese system, which was by no means a democracy, still guaranteed enough debate, and play, and openness because there was a regular rotation of leadership,” Clinton said. “Now that it appears that a person is in charge of China who intends to stay there for life, in essence, that changes things. But we shouldn’t accept or assume that it’s all going to be bad without working to make it better.”
Tony Blair, Former U.K. Prime Minister
Blair agreed with Clinton that it was time for the president-elect’s team to take a more coherent, coordinated approach to China, rather than relying on the more unpredictable mix of measures -- from tariffs to sanctions -- that were pursued by the Trump administration.
“For the new administration in the U.S., I think the big challenge with China is to get what I would call a strategic framework for dealing with China, rather than a series of ad-hoc reactions to whatever the Chinese may be doing,” Blair said. He added that he had long hoped China’s political system would open up alongside its economy, but that didn’t turn out to be the case. “That was our hope, and possibly and certainly, it was my actual expectation. You’ve got to say in the last few years, there’s been more external aggression and more internal repression. That’s just a fact.”
Henry Kissinger, Former U.S. Secretary of State
The long-time diplomat -- an architect of U.S.-China relations and former President Richard Nixon’s landmark trip to China in 1972 -- had a stark warning for the incoming Biden administration. He said Biden’s team should quickly restore lines of communication with China that frayed during the Trump years or risk a crisis that could even escalate into a military conflict.
“Unless there is some basis for some cooperative action, the world will slide into a catastrophe comparable to World War I,” Kissinger said. He said military technologies available today would make such a crisis “even more difficult to control” than those of earlier eras. “America and China are now drifting increasingly toward confrontation, and they’re conducting their diplomacy in a confrontational way,” he added.
Kevin Rudd, Former Australian Prime Minister
Noting that in any relationship “it takes two to tango,” the former Australian prime minister outlined several ways Biden and Xi can avoid any future escalation -- most notably by avoiding confrontations in disputed waters off China’s coast. But there’s also an opportunity for the U.S. and China to mend rifts by working together on climate change, he said.
“China wants to act, but it realizes that China’s national actions will be inconsequential in the absence of global action,” he said. “That’s why China wishes to engage the Americans and why the Biden administration will want to engage the Chinese.”

1335,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 10:33PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Mixed Over Fading Vaccine Optimism,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Tuesday morning, giving up some earlier gains after optimism over the latest positive COVID-19 vaccine news fizzled.
 Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) became the latest pharmaceutical company to report a positive development when t said on Monday that its candidate mRNA-1273 had a 94.5% efficacy rate from the results of a large, late-stage phase III COVE study. The news follows  Pfizer  Inc's (NYSE:PFE) announcement during the previous week that its candidate, BNT162b, that is being co-developed with Germany’s BioNTech (F:22UAy), prevented more than 90% of symptomatic infections.
Moderna’s news saw the company’s shares climbed up to 15% and helped U.S. shares see record highs over hopes of a quick economic recovery.
As was the case after the Pfizer announcement, shares, particularly those for value and cyclical sectors hit by the pandemic such as aviation, initially rose over hopes of a global economic recovery and the possibility of re-openings in 2021.
However, worries over vaccine productions and delivery remain. The ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cases globally, particularly in Europe and the U.S., also dampened the enthusiasm.
“We might be transitioning from a defensive bull market to a more cyclically offensive one, but more clarity is required in terms of when social mobility will normalize. That isn’t clear yet. The euphoria created by the presidential election result and the vaccine announcement will give way to a more sober analysis of how long and smooth the road to recovery will be,” AXA Investment Managers Core Investments chief investment officer Chris Iggo said in a note.
Other investors remained more optimistic.
“This is a continuation of what we saw last week as the vaccine being a catalyst for a rotation into cyclical sectors such as energy, financials, and defense with expectations for renewed demand and travel … the light switch has really been turned on and this is the real deal unlike some months back,” Great Hill Capital managing member Thomas Hayes told Reuters
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.20% by 11:27 PM ET (3:27 AM GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.14%. Prime Minister Sye Kyun Chung announced tighter social distancing rules for the greater Seoul area earlier in the day. The country reported 230 COVID-19 cases as of midnight on Monday, the highest number since early September.
The increase to Level 1.5 means banning public gatherings of 100 people or more, limiting religious services and audiences at sporting events to 30% capacity, and requiring high-risk facilities, including clubs and karaoke bars, to increase the distance among guests.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.33% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.01%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.19% and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.22%.
On the data front, the U.S. will release retail sales and industrial production data for October later in the day, following China’s release of its own positive October retail sales and industrial production data on Monday."

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is set to join the S&P 500 in December, a major win for Chief Executive Elon Musk that boosted the electric car maker's shares 14% on Monday in anticipation of a $51 billion trade by index funds adjusting their holdings.
S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that the company would join the S&P 500 index prior to the opening of trading on Dec. 21, potentially in two tranches making it easier for investment funds to digest.
""(Tesla) will be one of the largest weight additions to the S&P 500 in the last decade, and consequently will generate one of the largest funding trades in S&P 500 history,"" S&P Dow Jones Indices said.
With a stock market value over $400 billion, Tesla will be among the most valuable companies ever added to the widely followed stock market index, larger than 95% of the S&P 500's existing components. 
Its inclusion means investment funds indexed to the S&P 500 will have to sell about $51 billion worth of shares of companies already in the S&P 500 and use that money to buy shares of Tesla, so that their portfolios correctly reflect the index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Tesla will account for about 1% of the index.
Additionally, actively managed investment funds that try to beat the S&P 500 will be forced to decide whether to buy Tesla shares. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in additional assets.
Up about 450% in 2020, the California car maker has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Many investors believe Tesla's stock is in a bubble, and some have warned against adding it to the S&P 500 at current levels.
""(Monday's) price jump means the retirees and other individual investors who put their money into index funds will see some of their money go into Tesla stock at a price even higher than its controversially high pre-S&P price. It's a downside of index investing for conservative investors,"" Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, warned in an email.
A blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle for Tesla's potential inclusion in the S&P 500, leading to speculation that it might be added to the index and spark a surge in demand for its shares. 
In 1999, Yahoo surged 64% in five trading days between the announcement that it would be added to the index on Nov. 30 and its inclusion after the close of trading on Dec. 7. Yahoo's market capitalization at the time was about $56 billion, around a fraction of Tesla's current value.

In a separate press release, S&P Dow Jones Indices asked investors for feedback about whether to include Tesla all at once on Dec. 21, or in two tranches, with the first added a week earlier, due to Tesla's unusually large market capitalization.

Tesla short sellers point to looming competition from longer-established rivals. They are also skeptical of Tesla's corporate governance under Musk, who in 2018 agreed to pay $20 million and step down as chairman to settle fraud charges.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Elliott Management, which last year took a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (N:T) and pushed the company to sell some assets, has itself exited the telecommunications and media company, according to a regulatory filing on Monday.
The New York-based hedge fund liquidated its investment when it sold 5 million shares during the quarter that ended Sept. 30. It had first bought into the stock during the third quarter 2019, according to another filing.
Investment companies are required to say what U.S. stocks they own at the end of each quarter. While these filings are made with a delay, they often shed light on investment trends that are closely watched by other investors.
Elliott, which invests $41 billion and is known as one of the world's busiest corporate activists, originally criticized AT&T for operational missteps and its takeover strategy as well as its choice of leaders. But by the time company veteran John Stankey succeeded AT&T's long-time CEO, Randall Stephenson, as its chief in July, Elliott had come around to the choice.
Among its many investments, Elliott did not make any changes to its stake in eBay (O:EBAY), another company where it pushed for changes in 2019. The filing shows that Elliott owned 9.9 million shares in eBay even after Jesse Cohn, the partner who runs Elliott's U.S. activism practice, stepped off its board in September.
Elliott won the eBay seat in March 2019.
Starboard Value, another influential activist investor, which also reached a settlement with eBay in early 2019 and was able to fill one seat on eBay's board, sold off the rest of its stake during the third quarter, a filing shows.
The hedge fund sold 2,090,000 eBay shares after having already sold three quarters of its stake during the second quarter, filings showed.

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>","Universal, Cinemark agree on earlier home release for movies","By Lisa Richwine
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Movie theater operator Cinemark Holdings Inc (N:CNK) struck a deal that will allow Universal Pictures to offer its movies in U.S. homes as soon as 17 days after they debut in theaters, the companies said on Monday.
The multi-year agreement is similar to one that Comcast-owned (O:CMCSA) Universal made in July with AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (N:AMC), the world's largest theater chain, embracing a major shift from traditional movie release patterns.
Under the arrangement, Universal could offer movies for sale via premium video-on-demand after they have played for at least three weekends in theaters, a statement from the companies said. That would shrink the exclusive window a movie plays in theaters from the roughly 74 days that was typical before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down cinemas.
Movies that open with more than $50 million at box offices would be exclusive to theaters for at least five weekends, or 31 days, before they could be offered on demand. That would likely include Universal's big franchises such as ""Fast & Furious"" and ""Jurassic World.""
""That was a concept that was very important to us, the concept of having a dynamic window instead of a static, one-size-fits-all (approach),"" Cinemark Chief Executive Mark Zoradi said in an interview.
The company is in ""active discussions"" with other studios about similar terms, Zoradi added.
In a statement, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group Chairman Donna Langley said the studio was ""more committed than ever"" to the big screen. The deal with Cinemark will ""provide consumers with the optionality that they are looking for,"" she said.
Universal is one of the few major studios sending movies to theaters in the coming months as many movie houses remain closed due to the pandemic. The studio will debut animated film ""The Croods: A New Age"" on Nov. 25, Tom Hanks drama ""News of the World"" on Dec. 25 and three other movies before year's end.
Theaters had long resisted moves to shorten the window of time they can show a movie exclusively, and threatened to refuse to show films if they were released too quickly on-demand. That changed in July, when AMC reached the deal with Universal to allow premium video-on-demand after three weekends. AMC will receive an undisclosed portion of the on-demand sales.
It is unclear if Cinemark, the third-largest theater operator in the United States, also will earn a percentage of Universal's on-demand revenue. Financial terms of their arrangement were not disclosed.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>","Airbnb IPO filing shows third-quarter earnings beating virus with cost cuts, new focus","By Anirban Sen and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Airbnb Inc's initial public offering (IPO) registration showed on Monday that the home rental startup turned a profit in the third quarter despite the COVID-19 pandemic, as it gears up for one of the most anticipated stock market debuts in recent years.
The filing, published ahead of Airbnb's anticipated stock market debut in December, showed a dramatic recovery in its fortunes, after the coronavirus outbreak dragged down its core home rental business during the first half of the year.
The slump forced it to lay off 25% of its workforce in May, suspend marketing activities for the year and seek $2 billion emergency funding from investors, including Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners, at a valuation of $18 billion. It has recovered by focusing on listing homes away from cities that people want to rent during the pandemic. 
Airbnb's revenue fell 18% in the third quarter to $1.34 billion from a year earlier, but it reported net profit of about $219 million, helped mainly by a clamp-down on costs. Its business took a bigger hit internationally than in the United States, reflecting the financial fallout of extensive lockdowns in Europe to contain the spread of the virus.
""The recovery in the second and third quarters of 2020 is attributable to the renewed ability and willingness for guests to travel, the resilience of our hosts, and relative strength of our business model,"" Airbnb said. 
The listing would cap a blockbuster year for IPOs, as companies capitalize on a stock market rally in the second half of the year, fueled by monetary as well as fiscal stimulus in a bid to blunt the fallout of the pandemic.
Airbnb has not turned an annual profit since its launch in 2008, and warned this will likely also be the case this year despite it being profitable in the third quarter. It said it expected a decline in bookings and rise in cancellations in the fourth quarter.
The company also revealed it faces a hefty tax bill. It said that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service informed it in September it owed $1.35 billion, plus penalties and interest, over the sale of international intellectual property to a subsidiary in 2013. Airbnb said it would ""vigorously contest"" the tax adjustment.
Airbnb said that its co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky, who will remain in control of the company following the IPO thanks to shares with special voting rights, has agreed to a cut to his base salary from $110,000 to $1 amid the belt-tightening.
In exchange, the company approved restricted stock units for Chesky over the next 10 years that could be worth $120 million, if the company's stock hits certain milestones. Chesky intends to donate the net proceeds from this award to community, philanthropic and charitable causes, the company said. 
UNICORN STATUS
Airbnb was launched by Chesky and Joe Gebbia 12 years ago as a website to take bookings for rooms during conferences, including the Democratic National Convention that year in Denver.
It expanded its listings to include apartments, houses, and vacation rentals in the following year after taking seed funding from investors, including Sequoia Capital.
Airbnb achieved ""unicorn"" status in 2011, with listed properties in 13,000 cities across more than 180 countries at the time, after being valued at more than $1 billion in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz.
Some of Airbnb's other investors include Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher; buyout firms General Atlantic, TPG, Hillhouse Capital; and investment management firms Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments.
Airbnb plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ABNB. It filed for an IPO of up to $1 billion on Monday, but that is a placeholder amount and is expected to change before its debut. 
Reuters was the first to report in October that Airbnb was aiming to raise around $3 billion in its IPO that could value it at over $30 billion.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) are the lead underwriters for the IPO.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As positive coronavirus vaccine news makes strategists more optimistic about the future for retailers, investors will look to earnings results and forecasts from these companies in the coming days for clues about consumer spending.
The thinking is that effective vaccines will ""translate into positive performances for discretionary,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for CFRA, which recently raised its recommendation on the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (SPLRCD) to overweight from market weight. 
The pandemic and restrictions on businesses have added to revenue struggles for some traditional retailers like department stores while boosting sales for Amazon (O:AMZN) and other sellers that have capitalized on the work-from-home phenomenon. 
Results from  Home Depot  Inc. (N:HD), Walmart Inc. (N:WMT) and Kohl's Corp. (N:KSS) are due on Tuesday, while reports from Macy's Inc. (N:M), L Brands (N:LB),  Target  Corp. (N:TGT) and TJX Cos (N:TJX) are expected later this week.
The U.S. retail sales report for October also is due on Tuesday.
Investors will be especially eager to hear guidance and commentary from retail executives on consumer spending.
""We've gotten used to now buying online increasingly and delivery has become smoother,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""The question is, does it continue?""
Shares in a number of retailers rallied on Monday as a result of optimism that a COVID-19 vaccine will help the economic recovery in the months ahead.
 Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) said its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial.  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said last week its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective based on initial trial results.
Among the biggest percentage gainers in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index on Monday were Gap Inc. (N:GPS), up 9.5%;  Under Armour  (N:UAA), up 5.8%; and Ulta Beauty (O:ULTA), up 4.9%. 
Investors also are watching whether upcoming holiday sales data can support hopes for retailer shares despite a surge in COVID cases and increased restrictions across the United States and in Europe.
""As long as the jobs market holds up and we see (unemployment benefit claims) continuing to go down, that helps consumers' optimism,"" said Krosby. 
Some retailers' shares remain down sharply this year so far, including Macy's, which is off more than 50% since Dec. 31 despite a 9% gain on Monday as the pandemic added to their recent struggles.
On the earnings front, there continues to be a big divide within the consumer discretionary sector. 
Analysts expect the sector to post an earnings decline of 5.1% for the third quarter from a year ago, compared with a 7.4% decline for the entire S&P 500 (SPX), according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
But earnings for internet and direct marketing retail companies are show about a 43% rise in the quarter, while apparel retail earnings are forecast to fall 40.1%. 

 Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN), Gap Inc (N:GPS) and  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc (N:AEO) report earnings next week.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork processor, and a subcontractor face fines of more than $100,000 from California's workplace safety regulator for failing to protect employees from COVID-19 and other violations during the pandemic.
The penalties increase pressure on Chinese-owned Smithfield over U.S. working conditions during the health crisis, after federal regulators hit the meatpacker and others with smaller fines.
California's regulator, known as Cal/OSHA, issued ""the largest citation at a meatpacking plant nationwide"" to Smithfield's Farmer John plant in Vernon, California, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents meatpacking workers.
More than 315 workers out of 1,800 at the plant contracted COVID-19 since March, with at least three people hospitalized, the union said.
Smithfield and its subcontractor, CitiStaff Solutions, failed to ensure employees used masks and had physical barriers like plexiglass between them to keep them safe, according to Cal/OSHA.
The companies also failed to train employees on the risks of COVID-19, including how the virus spreads and how they could avoid infection, the regulator said.
Nearly 20 meat plants run by companies like Smithfield,  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN) and JBS (SA:JBSS3) closed temporarily this spring because of outbreaks among workers, limiting supplies.
Smithfield, owned by WH Group (HK:0288), said it will appeal the citations.
The company said it provided masks, face shields and other personal protective equipment to workers during the time covered by the citations. The citations also cover a time when employers were told not to require masks, according to Smithfield.
CitiStaff declined to comment.
""They've never taken our health seriously,"" José Guzman, a Farmer John worker, said in a statement. ""We are disposable to them as long as their profits keep going up.""
Smithfield in September became the first major meatpacker to be cited by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for failing to protect employees from COVID-19, after an outbreak at a South Dakota pork plant.

OSHA fined the company $13,494, the maximum allowed by law. Smithfield is appealing.

Investing.com -- Once again positive news on the vaccine front clashed with foreboding news about the spreading pandemic, but stocks won the day, anyway.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to record levels after Cambridge, Mass., drug company  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) said its vaccine candidate was more than 94% effective. That’s even better than last week’s news from drug giant  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) which said its candidate was 90% effective.
Now with two possible vaccines headed toward regulatory consideration for emergency use permission, the future looks a slight bit brighter.
The news comes as U.S. coronavirus cases continue to mount, hitting daily records and forcing local governments like El Paso, Texas, and Philadelphia to halt or reverse business reopening plans. California’s governor also put the brakes on most of that state again on Monday.
Putting a halt to the spreading virus is essential to keep businesses operating during the holiday season, which is a major driver of sales for many companies. 
We may get a glimmer of what is to come in retail sales and industrial production data set for release on Tuesday, alongside earnings from major retailers. 
Here are three things that might affect markets tomorrow:
1. Retail sales for October
Retail sales are expected to slow down in October from the prior month, with analysts tracked by Investing.com estimating a reading of 0.5%. That compares to 1.9% in September. The numbers are reported at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Consumer spending is an important barometer of economic health, especially heading into holiday shopping season. Lower consumer spending could be an indication households are still struggling with pandemic-related factors like lost wages, as Congress continues to stall on new economic relief.
2. Data on production
A potentially more positive reading is due out at 9:15 AM ET (1315 GMT). Industrial production for October is expected to increase 1% compared to a contraction of 0.6% the prior month. Manufacturing production is seen coming in up 1%, from a contraction of 0.3% the prior month.
3.  Home Depot , Kohls and Walmart
Three big retailers report earnings on Tuesday before the market opens.
Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is seen with earnings per share of $1.18 on revenue of $131.8 billion. Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) is expected to report EPS of $2.99 on revenue of $31.3 billion.  Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS) is seen reporting a loss of 50 cents a share on revenue of $3.87 billion.

Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) on Monday said its coronavirus vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective at protecting people from the disease, sending its shares more than 10% higher. The company said detailed data from the study was expected later in November, and added that it planned to request emergency use of its vaccine by early December.

Airlines, banks and cruise operators – sectors hit hard by the pandemic amid global restrictions to curb the virus – racked up gains, propelling the broader market higher.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) closed higher, with the latter up 5%.
Energy, meanwhile, surged on rising oil prices as a speedier end to the pandemic could shore up demand.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), (NYSE:XOM) closed up 7% and 5%, respectively. 
Tech, meanwhile, also contributed to the broader move higher as gains in chip stocks, led by Micron.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) jumped nearly 7% on bets the rapid increase in digital transformation will continue to support the rebound in demand for memory chips after a recent glut had weighed on prices.

""Banco Santander will acquire the technology platform of the payment service provider in Europe as well as all highly specialized technological assets,"" Jaffe said in a statement.
In a separate statement, Banco Santander said it had agreed to acquire several highly specialised technological assets from the merchant payments business of Wirecard in Europe, to accelerate its growth plans in Europe.
The acquisition does not include Wirecard companies and Santander will not assume any legal liability relating to Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) and Wirecard Bank AG or its past actions, Santander said. 
The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year and is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. 
Around 500 Wirecard employees will join Santander, the Spanish lender said.
Most employees currently managing the acquired assets will become part of Santander's global merchant services team. This also applies to the majority of employees of Wirecard Bank AG.
A source familiar with the matter said Santander had agreed to pay around 100 million euros for those assets.
Currently, investor processes are still underway for the sale of other Wirecard subsidiaries in Asia, South Africa and Turkey, Jaffe said, adding that assets from subsidiaries in Brazil, Romania and North America have already been sold. 

Results are expected within the next weeks, Jaffe said.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",Breakthrough COVID vaccine tech could help defeat other diseases,"By John Miller and Ludwig Burger
ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Breakthrough technology that transforms the body into a virus-zapping vaccine factory is poised to revolutionise the fight against COVID-19 but future pandemics and even cancer could be next, scientists say. The initial success of so-called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines in late-stage trials by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) as well as  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech is the first proof the concept works.
Both experimental vaccines had efficacy rates above 90% based on interim findings, which was far higher than expected and well above the 50% threshold U.S. regulators insist upon for vaccines.
Now scientists say the technology, a slow-motion revolution in the making since the discovery of mRNA nearly 60 years ago, could speed up the development of new vaccines. 
The traditional method of creating vaccines – introducing a weakened or dead virus, or a piece of one, to stimulate the body's immune system – takes over a decade on average, according to a 2013 study. One pandemic flu vaccine took over eight years while a hepatitis B vaccine was nearly 18 years in the making.
Moderna's vaccine went from gene sequencing to the first human injection in 63 days.
With BioNTech and Pfizer's COVID-19 candidate on a similar trajectory, both could win regulatory approval this year, barely 12 months since the coronavirus first emerged. 
Other companies are pursuing the technology such as Germany's CureVac also has an mRNA vaccine candidate, though has yet to start a late-stage trial and is hoping it will get the green light after July 2021. ""We'll look back on the advances made in 2020 and say: 'That was a moment when science really did make a leap forward',"" said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, which is backed by the Wellcome Trust. 
THE LAST LAUGH 
Discovered in 1961, mRNA carries messages from the body's DNA to its cells, telling them to make the proteins needed for critical functions, such as coordinating biological processes like digestion or fighting disease. 
The experimental vaccines from Moderna as well as Pfizer and BioNTech use lab-made mRNA to instruct cells to make the coronavirus's spike proteins, which spur the immune system into action without replicating like the actual virus.Back in 1990, scientists managed to get mice to generate proteins by injecting mRNA, an early sign of the technology's potential.
But early proponents such as Katalin Kariko, a Hungarian-born scientist and senior vice president at BioNTech, were hampered by obstacles such as mRNA's instability in the body and its propensity to cause inflammatory responses.
A breakthrough came around 2005 when Kariko, along with colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, figured out how to deliver mRNA without kicking the immune system into overdrive.
Still, it took another 15 years - and a pandemic that brought the world's economy to its knees - to reach the cusp of success. Kariko said her years of dogged pursuit once made her the butt of jokes for some university colleagues.
""The last time they laughed at me and ridiculed me was when they learned that I was going to join BioNTech seven years ago and they realised this company (didn't) even have a website,"" she told Reuters. ""But now, they learn of BioNTech and that we can do good things.""
Kariko said her life's work could pay dividends, not just against COVID-19, but other diseases. 
""It could be easier sailing for the next anti-viral product, a vaccine for influenza and other infectious disease,"" said Kariko, whose daughter is a U.S. Olympic gold medalist rower.
CANCER NEXT?
Moderna and BioNTech, for example, are also applying mRNA technology to experimental cancer medicines.
Biontech is testing an anti-melanoma mRNA with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche in a Phase II trial. 
Among Moderna's most advanced projects, besides its COVID-19 vaccine, are mRNA compounds to treat ovarian cancer or Myocardial ischemia, which are also in the second test phase.
None of the potential mRNA cancer therapies have reached the critical large-scale Phase III trials, however, and Kariko acknowledges that cancer presents a bigger challenge. 
While a virus is a foreign intruder, cancer cells, however malignant, come from within the body, making them tougher to seek out and expose so they can be attacked. 
""Sometimes cancer is just caused by gene and chromosome duplication and then everything about it looks normal and the cell is just dividing more than it should,"" she said. 
For vaccines against infectious diseases, the pharmaceutical industry's traditional approach has been to whip them up in large bioreactors, a time-consuming, expensive process in facilities that can cost up to $700 million to build. 
By contrast, Zoltan Kis, an Imperial College London researcher who models vaccine manufacturing, estimates that one five-litre bioreactor inside a $20 million facility could make a billion doses of some kinds of mRNA vaccines a year.
Drug manufacturer Lonza, enlisted to make ingredients for 400 million doses of Moderna's vaccine annually at U.S. and Swiss sites, is due to start production this year with manufacturing lines costing $60 million to $70 million each.
""We are producing mRNA at smaller scales and in smaller facilities when compared to traditional larger-scale equipment and facilities,"" Andre Goerke, Lonza's global lead for the Moderna project, told Reuters. ""The manufacturing ramp-up is quicker and more economical.""
'ULTRA-FAST RESPONSE'
Raymond Schiffelers, of University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, who heads a European Union programme for mRNA therapeutics, said the major advantage of the technology was that vaccine developers could mount an ""ultra-fast response"".
""Within weeks, testing can start, a major advantage over conventional vaccines,"" he said.
The moment a pathogen's genomic sequence is known, synthetic mRNAs can be designed that encode key parts of the virus, such as the coronavirus's potentially lethal spike protein.
Risks and challenges for mRNA remain. 
Some candidates must be stored at extremely cold temperatures, making delivery potentially difficult in countries with limited infrastructure. They also may be fragile to transport, Schiffelers said. 
BioNTech's vaccine, for example, must be transported at minus 70 degrees Celsius, though Moderna said on Monday it can ship its candidate in normal refrigerators.
Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), which funded Moderna's vaccine development, also said mRNA vaccines may not be a silver bullet for flu, since it mutates so swiftly that reaching 90% efficacy is unlikely.
But for COVID-19, Collins said mRNA is likely to be a revolution.

""It's clearly several months faster than any of the other methods,"" Collins said. ""In a crisis moment, several months really matter.""

VANCOUVER/TORONTO (Reuters) - A key witness involved in the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou two years ago has decided not to testify in the Canadian court as part of Meng's ongoing witness cross-examination, the court heard on Monday.
Meng arrived back in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Monday as her U.S. extradition hearing resumed. Her lawyers are fighting to establish that Meng's rights were violated during the events leading up to her arrest. Her lawyers called the refusal of a senior Canadian police officer to testify in court ""concerning.""
Meng, 48, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian police, on a warrant from the United States. She is facing charges of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC (L:HSBA) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting the extradition from under house arrest in Vancouver, where she owns a home in one of Canada's most expensive neighborhoods.
On Monday defense lawyer Richard Peck told the court that one of the key witnesses, Staff Sergeant Ben Chang with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), would not be testifying after seeking counsel from a lawyer.
According to court documents, Chang, who is now retired, allegedly sent details of Meng’s electronic devices to the FBI. Chang denied the allegation in an affidavit submitted to courts.
Peck told the court that Chang's refusal to testify is ""a matter that will be of some concern,"" adding that ""there may be any number of consequences from his refusal to testify.""
Monday kicks off 10 days of testimony that are a continuation of hearings that were set to wrap up in early November but ran overtime, necessitating more hearings to be scheduled.
Lawyers for both Meng and the Canadian government will cross-examine Canadian law enforcement officers and border officials who were involved in the initial investigation and arrest of Meng.
Defense attorney Mona Duckett will question Canada Border Services Agency Superintendent Bryce McRae on Monday.
Meng's lawyers are fighting to get her extradition dismissed on the basis of alleged abuses of process, arguing they constitute violations of her civil rights laid out in Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
In the first week of hearings, prosecutors for the Canadian government tried to prove that Meng's arrest was by the book and any lapses in due process should not impact the validity of her extradition.
The extradition hearings are scheduled to wrap up in April 2021, though the potential for appeals mean the case could drag on for years.

Diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing became rocky following Meng's arrest. Soon after her detention, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges.

Investing.com - The Dow rallied Monday, as positive Covid-19 vaccine news boosted expectations for a quicker economic recovery, prompting investors to up their bets on stocks linked to the progress of the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.19%, or 365 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.75%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.40%.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) on Monday said its coronavirus vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective at protecting people from the disease, sending its shares more than 10% higher. The company said detailed data from the study was expected later in November, and added that it planned to request emergency use of its vaccine by early December.
The update added to the recent optimism in the race to find a vaccine after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) last week said its vaccine candidate was proven to 90% effective in a clinical trial.  
Airlines, banks, and cruise operators – sectors hit hard by the pandemic amid global restrictions to curb the virus – racked up gains, propelling the broader market higher.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL),  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) rose about 4%, and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) was up 5%.
Energy, meanwhile, surged on rising oil prices as a speedier end to the pandemic could shore up demand.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), (NYSE:XOM) jumped more than 7% and 5% respectively. 
Tech, meanwhile, also contributed to the broader move higher as gains in chip stocks, led by Micron, helped offset mixed performance in the Fab 5.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) jumped nearly 6% on bets the rapid increase in digital transformation will continue to support the rebound in demand for memory chips after a recent glut had weighed on prices.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were about unchanged on the day, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded mixed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on Tuesday on bipartisan legislation to reform the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) aircraft certification process after two fatal Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 but the FAA is set on Wednesday to approve the plane's return to service after a lengthy review, new software safeguards and training upgrades.
The House bill requires an expert panel to evaluate Boeing’s safety culture and recommend improvements, and mandates that aircraft manufacturers adopt safety management systems and complete system safety assessments for significant design changes. It also requires that risk calculations be based on realistic assumptions of pilot response time, and that risk assessments are shared with regulators.
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the measure unanimously on Sept. 30.
Representative Peter DeFazio, the panel's chairman, told Reuters in a statement that the measure is ""a strong bill that has support from both sides of the aisle and addresses something we all agree on — keeping people safe. There’s no reason to wait until the next Congress to get this done.""
DeFazio, a Democrat, said the FAA failed to properly ensure the safety of the 737 MAX, and called aircraft certification ""a broken system that broke the public's trust.""
Boeing and the FAA declined to comment on the legislation.
A report released by DeFazio found the 737 MAX crashes were the ""horrific culmination"" of failures by Boeing and the FAA and called for urgent reforms.
The House bill would extend airline whistleblower protections to U.S. manufacturing employees, require FAA approval of new workers who are performing delegated certification tasks, and impose civil penalties on those who interfere with the performance of FAA-authorized duties.
The panel's top Republican, Representative Sam Graves, said the bill ""will help ensure the United States remains the gold standard in aviation safety and maintain our competitiveness in the aerospace sector because we were able to leave partisan politics at the door (and) adhere to the experts’ conclusions that our system should be improved but not dismantled.""

It is unclear if the U.S. Senate will take up the measure before the current Congress expires this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks advanced on Monday, setting the S&P 500 and the Dow on course for all-time closing highs as news of another promising coronavirus vaccine bolstered hopes of eradicating the disease, while spiking infections and new shutdowns threaten to hobble a recovery from the pandemic recession.
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average hit an intraday high and flirted with the 30,000 mark while the Russell 2000 was also on track for record close.
Value, cyclical and small cap shares, which stand to benefit most from an economic rebound, outperformed the broader market.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing infection based on interim late-state data. It was the second drugmaker in as my weeks, after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), to announce promising trial data in the development of a vaccine to defeat the pandemic.
Combined, pending further data and regulatory review, the United States could have as many as 60 million emergency doses available this year.
""It's good news along the lines of Pfizer's news a week ago,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""We have another vaccine that down the road that will enable us to get back to life as we used to live it.""
""We're seeing the end of the tunnel getting closer.""
Travel-related stocks, which were clobbered by restrictions enacted to contain the pandemic's spread, were in demand.
Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd jumped between 3.4% and 8.3%.
But COVID-19 continued its U.S. rampage, with cases surging past 11 millions and record infections in 40 states, prompting states to tighten social distancing mandates.
""It's the great conundrum,"" Tuz added. ""Do you invest for the next three months that are likely to be pretty bleak, or do you invest for the period after that that's likely to be much better?""
""It is a battle between short term bad news and longer term great news regarding the vaccine,"" Tuz said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 337.29 points, or 1.14%, to 29,817.1, the S&P 500 gained 26.18 points, or 0.73%, at 3,611.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 48.65 points, or 0.41%, at 11,877.94.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, energy stocks were enjoying the largest percentage gain.
Earnings from high-profile retailers are expected this week, with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) expected to report on Tuesday and Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) on Wednesday.
This, together with the Commerce Department's October retail sales data, expected on Tuesday, should provide evidence as to how consumers are weathering a languid economic recovery as stimulus runs dry.
Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG) jumped 6.0% after the biggest U.S. mall operator cut its purchase price for an 80% stake of rival Taubman Centers (NYSE:TCO) Inc, as the pandemic pressures the retailers.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.97-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>","UK businesses not covered for pandemic, insurers tell Supreme Court","By Carolyn Cohn and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Major insurance companies told the UK Supreme Court on Monday that thousands of small companies battered by the coronavirus pandemic were not eligible for business interruption payouts and to suggest differently was ""reverse engineering"".
On the first day of a four-day appeal of a test case brought by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) against insurers, industry lawyers told top judges that businesses could not claim for losses stemming from nationwide lockdowns to curb the virus.
Gavin Kealey, a lawyer for insurer MS Amlin, said that only business losses related to COVID-19 infections within a 25-mile radius of insured properties were covered.
""If these insureds wanted pandemic cover or epidemic cover on a national scale, then they didn't get it,"" he said ""... You can't reverse engineer those cases ... No, FCA, insureds, we are awfully sorry, but no.""
Thousands of small firms from holiday cottage firms to restaurants and night clubs had to shut down or restrict trading during the pandemic and say they face ruin after insurers rejected claims for business interruption cover.
The case revolves around whether 21 policy wordings, affecting potentially 700 types of policies, 60 insurers, 370,000 policyholders and billions of pounds in claims, should cover disruption caused by the virus.
The wordings cover business interruption when insured premises cannot be accessed because of public authority restrictions, in the event of a notifiable disease within a specified radius and hybrid wordings.
Michael Crane, a lawyer for insurance company QBE (AX:QBE), told the live-streamed hearing that QBE had foreseen a possible pandemic -- but that a government response that closed down almost the entire national economy and consigned healthy citizens to their homes was ""inconceivable"" last year.
But he added: ""The fact that a contingency may have been foreseeable does not mean that an underwriter agreed to cover that contingency without limits.""
A lower court in September found largely in favour of the FCA and the  Hiscox  Action Group, a policyholder action group that has joined the lawsuit, when judges ruled some insurers were wrong to reject the claims.
But the FCA -- and the action group -- are challenging elements of the ruling, including whether businesses have a valid claim if they are partially closed and when insurers can reduce payments. 
Six insurers -- Arch (O:ACGL), Argenta (DE:HNRGn), Hiscox (L:HSX), MS Amlin, RSA (L:RSA) and QBE -- are also appealing.
Insurers say they are paying valid claims but that paying out all claims could be catastrophic for the industry.
They argue that ""prevention of access"" clauses do not apply to government restrictions, that pay-outs should reflect the broader economic downturn caused by the pandemic and that disease clauses do not cover a nationwide epidemic.

Companies in countries from South Africa to the United States are locking horns with insurers over pandemic-related claims.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) is eyeing Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets which have lost their original buyers, the so-called ""white tails,"" Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on Monday, but has no plans to increase the size of its fleet as it continues to weather the COVID-19 crisis. 
""No one should think Southwest is gonna get 50 more airplanes than what they were planning on in terms of incrementing the fleet,"" Kelly said on an aviation webinar. ""That'd be crazy. We're not thinking about that at all.""
Low-cost carrier Southwest has parked between 150 and 200 jets as travel demand wanes in the pandemic, but as it plans its fleet make-up over the next decade or two, it wants to make a decision soon about refreshing its aging 737-700 jets with 143 seats.
Kelly said the airline is debating between the Boeing 737 MAX-7, which has yet to come out and be certified, or European planemaker Airbus's (PA:AIR) A220s, which would mean a shift away from its all-Boeing fleet for the first time.
The Boeing 737 MAX has suffered a setback following two fatal crashes that sparked a massive safety review and a global grounding of the models that were in service before the crashes. U.S. regulatory approval is expected this week for those jets to fly again after nearly two years. 
""If we get what we need on the MAX, then it makes it more difficult for the A220, but I think Boeing and Airbus understand that's (737-700) a very important airplane for us,"" Kelly said.

While there's some flexibility on the timing of a decision, Kelly said the airline ""absolutely needs a solution for that the over the next several years and as far as I'm concerned the sooner we make up our minds on that the better.""

(Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
Vaccine from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is second to exceed expectations in pivotal trial
Moderna Inc's experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial, the company said on Monday. That followed last week's news that  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine was also more than 90% effective based on initial data. Pending more safety data and regulatory review, the United States could have two vaccines authorized for emergency use in December. Both vaccines employ synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA), which coaxes cells to make certain virus proteins that the immune system sees as a threat and mounts a response against. Moderna's trial involved 30,000 racially diverse U.S. adults, including people at high risk for severe COVID-19. Only five of the 95 COVID-19 cases in the initial analysis occurred in participants who received the vaccine, while the rest had received a placebo. The vaccine, administered in two shots 28 days apart, also appeared to prevent cases of severe COVID-19. Side effects, largely occurring after the second shot, included muscle aches, fever, headache and redness at the injection site. Moderna's vaccine does not need ultra-cold storage like Pfizer's, making it easier to distribute. Moderna expects it to be stable at normal refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F) for 30 days and can be stored for up to 6 months at -20C. (https://reut.rs/35xtZIB; https:// Mutated virus may be more vulnerable to new vaccines The mutated form of the new coronavirus that is now the most common strain worldwide is more infectious but may also be more vulnerable to vaccines under development, new research suggests. In experiments reported on Thursday in Science, researchers saw that the newer strain, which originated in Europe, is more efficient at infecting airway cells and at making copies of itself, although it does not appear to produce more severe illness. The D614G mutation causes a ""flap"" to open on the tip of a spike on the surface of the virus, improving its ability to break into cells, but also creating a pathway for antibodies in vaccines to enter the virus and disable it, the researchers explained in a statement. New SARS-CoV-2 mutations are continually emerging, ""like the recently discovered mink SARS-CoV-2 cluster 5 variant in Denmark that also encodes D614G,"" coauthor Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine said in the statement. ""We must continue to track and understand the consequences of these new mutations on disease severity, transmission, host range and vulnerability to vaccine-induced immunity,"" he added.

Of the 37 items they tested, one piece of paperwork carried genetic material from the coronavirus. The form had come from a low-risk hospital ward, and the specimen from the patient was negative for the virus, ""indicating contamination may be occurring as a result of environmental or healthcare worker contamination,"" the researchers wrote on Thursday in the Journal of Hospital Infection.

Investing.com --  Micron rose 5% on Monday after Barron's said the outlook is improving and shares could double. 
The memory chip maker has lagged the Nasdaq's 2020 increase, up about 9% versus the index's 32% rise. Shares are trading at a two-year high.
Demand for automotive chips has come back quickly after dipping as operations halted amid the spread of the coronavirus, and 5G smartphone sales -- which use more DRAM and flash than 4G phones -- should rise to 500 million units next year up from 200 million this year, Barron's said. 
Micron (NASDAQ:MU) also got hit with the U.S. crackdown on Huawei, which represented almost 10% in revenue and is now nil, the financial news source reported, since being forced to stop selling to the Chinese company in September. On Saturday, Reuters reported that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) had received an exemption from the U.S. government allowing it to sell 4G mobile phone chips to Huawei. Micron has also apparently applied for similar permission. 
The company has beat profit and revenue estimates for the past seven quarters, with its most recent earnings per share of $1.08 comparing to the expected 98 cents.
 Analysts also seem largely partial to the stock. Micron has 17 buy ratings, five holds and a single sell.

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 12:21PM ET</span>","Travel restrictions challenge vaccine rollout, airlines warn","PARIS (Reuters) - Air cargo operators may struggle to distribute new COVID-19 vaccines effectively unless pandemic travel restrictions are eased, global airlines cautioned on Monday.
The warning came in vaccine transport guidelines issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is pushing governments to replace travel curbs and quarantines with testing.
""If borders remain closed, travel curtailed, fleets grounded and employees furloughed, the capacity to deliver life-saving vaccines will be very much compromised,"" the IATA document said.
 Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine had proved 94.5% effective in a clinical trial, a week after rival drugmaker  Pfizer  (N:PFE) reported 90% efficacy findings for its vaccine. Once approved, both vaccines are likely to require transport and storage well below freezing, posing logistical hurdles.
Widespread grounding of passenger flights that normally carry 45% of global cargo in their holds has taken out capacity, thinning the air freight network and driving up prices.
Existing immunisation campaigns have struggled with the partial shutdown. The World Health Organisation and UNICEF ""have already reported severe difficulties in maintaining their planned vaccine programmes during the COVID-19 crisis due, in part, to limited air connectivity,"" IATA said.
Vaccines will need to be shipped to developing countries reliant on passenger services for cargo, IATA's head of cargo Glyn Hughes told Reuters. Even in industrialised states, vaccine dispersal may be a tighter bottleneck than production, requiring shipments to secondary airports on passenger jets.
In preparation for the challenge of mass vaccine distribution, governments should move to reopen key passenger routes backed by robust testing, the airline body argues.
""There are several more months for governments to go through the planning cycle,"" Hughes said, leaving enough time to ""get passenger networks safely resumed, looking at safe travel corridors (and) mutual acceptance of testing procedures.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Shares in  Pfizer  (N:PFE) fell on Monday after rival drugmaker  Moderna  (O:MRNA) said its experimental vaccine against COVID-19 was 94.5% effective and that it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures.
Moderna is the second U.S. company to report encouraging trial results on a COVID-19 vaccine, joining Pfizer (N:PFE) which has said its vaccine is also more than 90% effective.
But while Pfizer's vaccine has to be stored and shipped at ultra-cool temperatures, Moderna said its product can be kept at normal fridge temperatures. 
""This is very important, perhaps a game changer,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets. 
""The Pfizer vaccine had to be kept in very cold temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius, making it logistically difficult to produce and transport large doses of the vaccine,"" he said. 
Pfizer shares, which on Nov. 9 hit their highest levels since end July 2019, fell 4.1% by 1623 GMT, while shares in its German partner BioNTech were down 12.8%.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said the logistics of Moderna's vaccine were clearly less onerous although they expect storage requirements for both the vaccines to converge.
Moderna shares were up 9% after hitting a record high earlier on Monday, while shares in British drugmaker AstraZeneca (L:AZN), which is yet to release results from its late-stage vaccine trials, were down 0.9%.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 12:01PM ET</span>","Volkswagen accelerates shift to electric, autonomous era","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is paring back the variety of combustion-engined cars and retooling more factories to build electric vehicles in an effort to keep up with rival Tesla (O:TSLA), the chief executive of the world's largest carmaker said.
German factories in Emden and Hanover will be converted to build electric cars as part of a 73 billion euros ($86 billion) investment plan to ramp up development of zero-emission and self-driving cars, the company said on Monday.
""Our business so far has been running valuable brands. To increase brand value, driving margins,"" Herbert Diess explained in a call with investors and analysts on Monday. ""We have to be seen as a tech company.""
On top of focussing on achieving economies of scale in electric and combustion engine components, Volkswagen is seeking to also gain expertise in software programming, so it can build and develop intelligent self-driving vehicles. 
""Yes, it is going to be a race with Tesla,"" Diess said.
""They are also ramping up fast. We have more different body styles, and when it comes to an established dealership network, we should have an advantage over Tesla,"" Diess said.
Policymakers have clamped down on exhaust emissions, forcing carmakers to accelerate the development of low-emission technology or face a penalty of 95 euros for each gram of excess CO2 they emit in Europe. 
The Volkswagen factory in Hanover will be retooled to build the all-electric VW ID.BUZZ microbus, as well as large premium-branded electric sports utility vehicles for Audi, Bentley and Porsche, which will share common vehicle underpinnings. 
""The rationale was keeping those cars together in one manufacturing site,"" Diess explained. 
The VW factory in Emden will be retooled to build electric cars and production of the combustion-engined VW Passat sedan will be shifted to a factory in Bratislava, Slovakia where VW will also build the next generation Skoda Superb.
SUVs SALES PAY FOR CLEANER TECH
Low end Volkswagen variants will see their prices increased or be struck from the lineup altogether, Diess said, adding that European policymaker proposals for further tightening emissions rules are effectively putting combustion engines at risk.
""So long as you have to burn coal to make electric vehicles' run it doesn’t make any sense,"" Diess said, commenting about the need for burning fossil fuels to generate power for the electricity grid.
""It would make a lot more sense to postpone those targets because those engines are really clean now,"" Diess said of his wish to see combustion engined cars on sale for longer.
Volkswagen needs the profits from combustion engined sports utility vehicles to generate the cash for investing in cleaner technologies, he said. 
Shifting the Golf segment of passenger cars to becoming electric will take up to a decade, the carmaker said. It has also forced managers to question the need for some of the more exotic niche brands.
VW is legally separating its Lamborghini supercar and Ducati motorbike brands, confirming an earlier Reuters report, as the German automaker seeks to streamline its operations and focus on mass-producting electric cars.
""We are working on our Italian legal structure,"" Diess said, referring to the creation of a separate legal entity for housing the Lamborghini, Ducati and the Italdesign design studio.
Luxury brands which owe their attractiveness in large part due to high horsepower high-cylinder combustion engines, may not fit in to the era of intelligent, networked vehicles which provide on-demand mobility, Diess said.
""Are those really valuable in the new world, we don’t know yet,"" Diess said. 
The CEO said on Monday that Volkswagen would miss its CO2 compliance target this year by ""a gram or so"" but would meet emissions goals for 2021 thanks to a mass production push of electric vehicles. 

He saw business recovering next year, with the company planning for a return to pre-COVID crisis levels in 2022, he added.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>","Exclusive: EU eyes COVID vaccine deal with Moderna at less than $25 per dose, says source","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission wants to reach a deal with  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) for the supply of millions of doses of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate for a price below $25 per dose, an EU official involved in the talks said.
Moderna said on Monday its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19, based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, becoming the second developer to report results that far exceeded expectations, after  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and BioNTech (O:BNTX) said last week their vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective.
The EU has been in talks with Moderna for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine at least since July, an internal EU document seen by Reuters shows. Reuters first reported the negotiations in July.
A deal might be reached in the coming days, the senior official involved in the talks said, adding that discussions were mostly focusing on the legal wording of the contract, but faced no major hurdles on issues such as price or liability.
The price being negotiated was below $25 per dose, said the official, who declined to be more specific and asked for anonymity as the talks were confidential.
Moderna was not immediately available to comment.
The United States paid Moderna $15 per dose to secure 100 million vaccines in a $1.5 billion deal in August. That was on top of $1 billion in funding for Moderna's vaccine, effectively bringing the combined price to $25, according to the publicly released terms of the deal.
Washington has an option to buy another 400 million doses for an undisclosed price.
Moderna's vaccine is administered with a two-shot course. 
NEW DEALS 'COMING SOON'
EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said on Twitter that Moderna's results were ""encouraging"" and that new EU deals with vaccine makers were to ""come soon"".
""Negotiations with the company are ongoing. We have not yet concluded or signed a contract,"" Kyriakides told EU lawmakers in a regular hearing on Monday.
A spokesman for the Commission did not respond to questions on price and the timing of a possible deal with Moderna.
On Aug. 24 the Commission, which conducts talks with vaccine makers on behalf of EU states, said preliminary talks with Moderna had been concluded with the aim of signing a contract for the supply of 80 million doses of its vaccine, with the option of buying another 80 million.
Last week, the Commission reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech on the supply of their potential COVID-19 vaccine hours after the companies announced their positive results, EU officials said, adding that the timing was a coincidence.
The formal signing of that contract is expected later this week.
An official told Reuters the EU had agreed to pay less than $19.50 per shot to Pfizer and BioNTech, adding that partly reflected the financial support given by the EU and Germany for the drug's development. 
The EU has also struck supply deals with AstraZeneca (L:AZN), Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) for their experimental COVID-19 vaccines. 

It announced on Monday a new deal with German biotech firm CureVac (DE:5CV).

The top U.S. home improvement chain said it would offer $56 in cash for each share of HD Supply, a near 25% premium to the stock's last close. HD Supply's shares jumped 24.5% on the news. 
With the deal, Home depot is looking to expand its reach into building utility and maintenance products, betting that the economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic will force swathes of Americans to look for affordable housing.
""With a bolstered sales force and enhanced supply chain, we have no doubt Home Depot will be a more formidable player in the$55 billion maintenance, repair and operations market for years to come,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts wrote.
Home Depot, which sold HD Supply in 2007 for $8.5 billion to Bain Capital,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, said it will fund the buy back through a combination of cash and debt. 
HD Supply, one of the largest distributors of appliances, plumbing, and electrical equipment in North America with over 500,000 customers, is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2021, Home Depot said. 
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC served as financial adviser to Home Depot on the deal, which is expected to close in its fourth fiscal quarter. The company will report third-quarter results on Tuesday.

Investing.com -- Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) dropped 10% after the company said it delayed an upcoming space flight.
Virgin cited operations restrictions resulting from new guidelines from the New Mexico Department of Health to disrupt the spread of the Covid-19 virus in the state. The flight had been scheduled for Nov. 19-23. 
It was to be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, and to include revenue-generating payloads as part of the NASA flight opportunities program.
In its earnings report earlier this month, the company said it would reopen ticket sales in 2021 after Sir Richard Branson’s flight. Virgin reported a third quarter loss per share of 34 cents, worse than the expected 26 cents, on sales of $1 million, which was lower than the expected $1.07 million, according to data tracked by Investing.com. The net loss of $77 million compared to a $63 million net loss in the second quarter. Administrative and research and developments expenses were higher for the period.

""We are not in any discussion or consideration of changing the capital structure in our partner companies. We are moving ahead with many projects,"" Ashwani Gupta said in an interview at the Reuters Automotive Summit teleconference. 
He spoke after Bloomberg News reported earlier, citing unidentified sources, that Nissan was considering selling its 34% stake in Mitsubishi Motor to help it cope with the slump in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Such a deal would fundamentally reshape a three-way alliance that includes France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) built by Carlos Ghosn, former chairman of the alliance. The partnership was plunged into uncertainty when Ghosn was arrested in 2018 on financial misconduct charges, which he denies.
At Monday's closing price in Tokyo, Nissan's stake in Mitsubishi Motors was worth 102.2 billion yen ($975.8 million).
Nissan shares rose 5% on the Bloomberg report, while Mitsubishi Motors, which said it would continue to collaborate with its alliance partner, gained 3%. 
Nissan, which is 43% owned by Renault, last week cut its operating loss forecast for the year to March by 28%, helped by a rebound in demand, especially in China. 
Mitsubishi Motors, Japan’s No.6 automaker, expects to post an operating loss of 140 billion yen for its business year.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",Support for MAX brand wavers as Boeing jet nears green light,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tracy Rucinski
SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is set to win approval for its grounded 737 MAX this week, but chinks are appearing in the brand as the most traumatic chapter in the jetmaker's history overshadows the planes' original billing of superlative performance.
When it returns to the skies next month as expected after a nearly two-year safety review, the ""MAX"" name will still be officially in place. Some airlines, however, have begun to soft-pedal references to the aircraft following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
Industry sources familiar with the branding say the name will likely be phased out over time as a strategy unfolds among airlines to de-emphasize the ""MAX"" label in favor of the formal names assigned to each variant, like ""737-7"" or ""737-8.""
""You will see the MAX name used less frequently,"" one of the sources told Reuters. Another person involved in discussions over the marketing predicted the MAX name would gradually fade in coming years.
Boeing declined to comment.
The wavering support for the brand could be a setback for the company, which had unusually advertised a name as well as a model number, and urged airlines to ""Think MAX."" It also shows a potential sore point with airlines, who had invested promotional dollars in a name now seen as tarnished.
Brand Finance last year estimated the MAX's problems had wiped $7.5 billion off the value of Boeing's corporate image.
Anticipating this week's approval,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) plans to relaunch commercial MAX flights on Dec. 29 from Miami to New York City. But while passengers will see the MAX name on booking systems, it will not appear on safety cards visible in seat pockets, people familiar with the change told Reuters.
""We changed the Boeing 737 safety cards to simplify the cards and ensure the correct card is placed on each aircraft,"" an American spokeswoman said, confirming the move. ""This approach is consistent with other fleet types where we do not have different safety cards for sub-fleets,"" she added.
American has vowed to be transparent with customers about the MAX and will offer other travel options if they don't want to fly the aircraft.
Originally conceived in 2011, the word ""MAX"" was only ever a marketing title for the latest 737. Removing it from the cards has no impact on safety. But the cabin is where airlines define their brand, planning every visual cue, and virtually nothing there happens by chance, airline marketing experts say.
Doubts over the name surfaced in August when a news release on a MAX order from Poland's Enter Air referred to it as the ""737-8.""
Last week,  Air Canada  (TO:AC) used the same designation in a news release on quarterly earnings, with ""MAX"" appearing only in footnotes - a change from the year-ago format. An Air Canada spokeswoman said the airline uses the term ""interchangeably.""
While it is keeping the name, Boeing allows airlines to decide how they want to market the MAX. Even before the crashes, Ireland's Ryanair Holdings PLC (I:RYA) had decided to refer to its specially designed version as the ""Gamechanger"" rather than ""MAX"".
""If Boeing's customers want it dropped, it will be dropped,"" a third source said, adding that some key ""customers are saying the name MAX is tainted."" 
HIGH VISIBILITY
Pressures on the once-unstoppable brand name for Boeing's fastest-selling jet highlight a delicate problem for airlines.
In the near-term, they must restore public trust in the aircraft, which calls for transparency about which plane is being used, something U.S. operators have pledged to enforce.
But the name has also drawn high-profile scepticism.
In April 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted, ""I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name."" 
In January 2020, the chairman of  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL), an influential buyer, said the ""damaged"" brand should be dropped.
Changing the name of a tarnished brand has been a well-proven strategy for companies seeking to move past crises.
""Some people will remember and give you grief in the short term, but you've broken the connection,"" said Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. ""Someone getting on the plane four years from now won't remember 'MAX.'"" 
JET NICKNAMES 
The MAX's branding woes are all the more tricky for Boeing, as naming civilian jets is the exception rather than the rule.
While official nicknames are common for military jets like the F/A-18 ""Super Hornet,"" Boeing only gave its first nickname to a civilian jet with its 787 ""Dreamliner"" about a decade ago. 
But for the MAX, it needed to pack a bigger punch in an all-out battle for market share against European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
In 2011, Boeing abandoned plans for an all-new jet and launched a quicker 737 MAX upgrade after being blindsided by a huge Airbus sale to American Airlines, the company now reopening MAX flights.
Boeing marketers came up with a name that ""ticked numerous boxes: max performance, max capacity, max range,"" said a person familiar with the discussions. 
A promotional Boeing video using camera angles to give the impression of a vertical take-off - tagged ""Flown by Boeing test pilots. Do not attempt"" - underscored the superlative claims.

""It was short and effective,"" the person familiar with the discussions said of the name. ""The problem,"" he added, ""is that in a negative context it has been very effective too.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks eyed a fresh record high on Monday as signs of economic recovery in Asia, strong corporate earnings and additional positive data about a COVID-19 vaccine boosted investor sentiment.
U.S. stock futures pointed to a stronger open on Wall Street, up 1.2%, extending gains after pharma company  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said its prospective vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing the illness which has ravaged economies across the globe.
That news helped the MSCI World Index of global shares to extend gains, rising by 0.6% to just shy of a record high hit briefly this month, building on strong overnight gains in Asia's leading markets and a stronger open for most European bourses.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had hit its highest level since launching in 1987 as Japan pulled out of recession, China posted better-than-expected industrial output data and the region signed the largest ever trade deal.
Taking their lead, European indices also set daily highs after the Moderna news, with Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) up 1.7% and the pan-Europe STOXX Europe 600 (STOXX) up 1.4%.
""The markets get the new trading week off to a solid start, which is encouraging given all the excitement generated in the last seven days by news of vaccine breakthroughs,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
""Solid and steady gains are arguably just what investors need after a very volatile period.""
The announcement by Moderna followed similarly positive news a week ago from rival  Pfizer  (N:PFE). 
The prospect of an end to economy-sapping COVID lockdowns also helped oil prices strengthen, with Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices up around 3%, while gold turned negative to trade down 0.7%.
European government bond yields rose on the Moderna news, with Germany's benchmark 10-year yields up 2 basis points on the day, while the gap between Italy and Germany's yields fell to the lowest since the second quarter of 2018.
After languishing for much of the day, the dollar perked up to trade marginally stronger against a basket of currencies, albeit kept in check by fresh data over the weekend showing a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases.
Looking ahead, a slew of U.S. Federal Reserve speakers are set to comment this week, beginning with Vice Chair Richard Clarida at 1900 GMT.
While rising cases of the coronavirus were a risk,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists urged investors to ""keep the faith"" in their 2021 outlook note.
""We think this global recovery is sustainable, synchronous and supported by policy, following much of the 'normal' post-recession playbook. Overweight equities and credit against cash and government bonds, and sell dollars.""
For stocks, the analysts see earnings-per-share growth of between 25% and 30% across regions, with double-digit total returns through the end of 2021 that should helped power the S&P 500 to 3,900 points from its current 3,585 points.
BREXIT
Besides the virus, Brexit trade talks were chief among European investors' concerns on Monday, with hopes for a breakthrough ebbing slightly to leave sterling weaker against the dollar and the euro. 
The British pound gave up early gains to edge lower against the dollar , changing hands at 1.3180 per dollar, and against the euro as well. The pound last stood at 89.78 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3). 
While the departure of hardline adviser Dominic Cummings from Downing Street is seen as a positive, perhaps allowing more British concessions, Britain's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost said on Twitter that talks ""may not succeed"".

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",Spain's BBVA exits U.S. in $11.6 billion deal with PNC,"By Greg Roumeliotis, David French and Jesús Aguado
MADRID/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) is to sell its U.S. business to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (N:PNC) for $11.6 billion in cash in one of the biggest global bank deals this year, which sees yet another European lender retreat from the United States.
The sale will further consolidate the U.S. banking sector and prompted speculation BBVA could use the cash to buy up a rival bank in its domestic market. 
This is the second-largest U.S. banking deal since the 2008 financial crisis and creates an American bank with nearly $560 billion of assets and a presence in two dozen states.
The move underscores how a loosening of financial regulations and lowering of corporate taxes under President Donald Trump has emboldened regional lenders to pursue scale through dealmaking, as they compete with bigger players such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC).
PNC and BBVA had been in talks about a deal for the last few weeks, and decided to press on after the U.S. elections because they believe the regulatory environment will not change with Democrat Joe Biden as president and the Republicans likely controlling the Senate, sources familiar with the matter said.
Other European lenders such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)  and HSBC (L:HSBA) have also been downsizing their U.S. operations.
For BBVA, the transaction represents an unwinding of its $9.6 billion acquisition in 2007 of Compass Bancshares Inc, which it turned into its U.S. subsidiary.
BBVA decided to retreat from the U.S. market after a poor performance there weighed on its stock, the sources said. The stock was down 36% year-to-date until Friday.
""It makes sense to divest in the U.S. because others could do better, we also believe we can grow in places where we could do better,"" BBVA chairman Carlos Torres told analysts in a call. 
Investors had been growing impatient with BBVA's efforts to tackle its U.S. problems after the Spanish lender took a $1.5 billion writedown last year in its fourth-quarter earnings, blaming low interest rates and declining growth.
However, BBVA will still handle some wholesale banking from New York and maintain its brokerage business there.
DEAL IN SPAIN?
Shares in BBVA jumped almost 15.6% to 3.6710 euros, while shares in Spain's Sabadell (MC:SABE) rose 15.73% to 0.380 euros as the market bet BBVA could use part of the proceeds from the sale to buy its smaller Spanish rival, which has a market capitalization of around 1.8 billion euros.
""The sale now frees up capital to reinvest in existing markets, Sabadell in Spain would bring significant synergy potential in Spain, and/or to improve shareholder remuneration (BBVA admits that it will consider share buy-backs),"" Spanish broker Alantra said in a research note.
In September, two sources told Reuters that Sabadell had held informal talks about a possible tie-up, including with BBVA.
Torres told analysts the U.S. deal would allow BBVA to better deploy capital in its existing core market and improve its franchises, without giving names. He also said the bank would analyse M&A opportunities if they arise.
Sabadell declined to comment on any M&A strategies. 
BBVA's U.S. sale, expected to close in mid 2021, will increase the bank's common equity tier one ratio, a key measure of financial strength, by 300 basis points, giving it a proforma capital ratio of 14.46%.
BBVA executives told analysts the deal would also boost its capacity to increase payouts to shareholders, including a potential ""sizeable"" share buyback, and would have a 580 million euro ($687 million) positive impact on its net profit.
PNC said it expected the deal to add about 21% to its earnings in 2022.

The deal comes about six months after PNC sold its 22.4% stake in mutual fund giant BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) for $14.2 billion. PNC booked after-tax gains of $4.3 billion on the sale, which it will use to fund the deal with BBVA as it seeks to expand its footprint in the southwest of the United States, the sources said.

The European Medicines Agency's human medicines committee has started a ""rolling review"" of Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate and is evaluating the first batch of data, the regulator said.
Rolling reviews allow drug companies to submit applications for COVID-19 medicinal products before development work is concluded and prior to the availability of complete supporting documentation, aimed at speeding up any approval process. 
In October, Moderna had said it would apply for real-time reviews of its vaccine in Europe. 
EMA's announcement comes a week after Switzerland began a real-time review of data from Moderna's vaccine candidate.

Moderna said earlier this month that it has enough data for a first interim analysis of its late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",U.S. approval for 737 MAX return nears as challenges remain for Boeing,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After a standoff with global regulators, management turmoil and a massive safety review,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is set to win U.S. approval on Wednesday to resume flights of its grounded 737 MAX. 
But the largest U.S. airplane maker faces headwinds from the coronavirus and new European tariffs as it scrambles to return the best-selling jet to service.
Reuters first reported on Nov. 9 that the FAA was in the final stages of reviewing proposed MAX changes and was set to lift its grounding order as early as Wednesday.
The FAA decision comes as other global regulators also move closer to decisions on allowing the plane to resume flights.
A group of relatives of MAX crash victims and some U.S. House Democrats have urged the FAA to disclose key supporting data in its examination of the plane.
The FAA is requiring new training to deal with a key safety system called MCAS tied to the two fatal crashes that killed 346 people and led to the plane's grounding in March 2019. It is also requiring new safeguards to MCAS and other software changes.
Last month, FAA Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell, who made the U.S. decision to ground the plane, told Reuters he had ""absolutely no doubt in my mind that it will be as safe as, or safer than, any airplane in service today.""
In December, Boeing's board forced out prior chief executive Dennis Muilenburg after he received a rebuke from FAA Administrator Steve Dickson. At the time, the FAA said Boeing was pursuing an unrealistic schedule for the return to service.
On Oct. 28, Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told CNBC the MAX review was nearing the finish line. ""I am very proud of that airplane,"" Calhoun said. ""It is a remarkable machine and as safe as anything in the air."" 
Last week, in a long-running transatlantic subsidy spat, the European Union imposed tariffs on up to $4 billion of annual U.S. imports, including Boeing jets.
Leasing companies warned the tariffs would hamper the reintegration of the MAX in Europe, a key market. Ireland’s Ryanair said it would expect Boeing to absorb the cost of the tariffs, which mirror U.S. duties on imports of Airbus jets and other European goods.
Following the FAA green light, airlines must complete software updates and fresh pilot training, a process that will take at least 30 days, before planes can return to the skies.
The FAA said it would not delegate its authority to issue airworthiness certificates and export certificates for the 450 737 MAX airplanes built since the grounding, and plans in-person, individual inspections.
Those could take a year or more to complete.

Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), the world's largest MAX operator, has said it would take several months to comply with the FAA requirements and it does not plan to schedule flights on the aircraft until the second quarter of 2021.

1380,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 06:03AM ET</span>",StockBeat: BBVA Faces a Pleasant Dilemma After PNC Buys U.S. Assets,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- BBVA’s decision to sell its U.S. assets to PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) looks like a win-win transaction, but the Spanish bank looks to have the better side of it.
The 9.7 billion ($11.6 billion) price that BBVA (MC:BBVA) has squeezed out of PNC is something that no bank analyst thought likely. According to slides put out by BBVA on Monday, the average value attached to the franchise – with over $100 billion in assets – was 3.8 billion euros, and no-one valued it higher than 6 billion.
The actual price is equivalent to 45% of BBVA’s market value as of Friday’s close.
You can read that whichever way you want: BBVA would argue that the deal just shows that its shares were trading at an unjustified discount because of the well-documented problems of sub-zero interest rates in the euro zone, and the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic has hit Spain harder than many other European economies.
Cynics would argue back that the deal is actually a decent reflection of market realities, and that the bank’s core franchises in Spain has been deeply scarred by the pandemic, while its operations in Brazil, Mexico and Turkey all face challenges of varying severity (again, many of them pandemic-related).
Certainly, it’s hard to see much European bank M&A taking place at a multiple of nearly 20 times earnings.  Even in the U.S., that would have been more difficult without the sharp steepening in the yield curve since Pfizer’s vaccine announcement. But in the euro zone, where the European Central Bank is preparing to stamp down heavily on any sign of life in long-term term interest rates, BBVA has very little chance of restoring its lending margins any time soon.
This isn’t to say the 15% rise in BBVA’s share price on Monday isn’t justified. The deal adds nearly 300 basis points to BBVA’s core tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, to 14.46%. That positions it very nicely for any cyclical recovery next year.  
The question is – how best to deploy the excess capital?
The rise of over 15% in Banco de Sabadell's (OTC:BNDSY) share price on Monday shows how the Spanish market thinks it will be spent. Sabadell is an obvious takeover target for its lack of scale, and the recent Caixabank-Bankia merger has made domestic scale a more pressing issue for BBVA.
Theoretically, buying Sabadell should add value: before this morning’s rise, its shares were trading at only 11% of book value, according to Investing.com data. Even after the rally, there is an obvious opportunity to buy at a huge discount to what Sabadell could be worth in a healthier economic environment.
But would that be the best deal for BBVA shareholders? The bank was at pains to stress that it is keen to increase distributions to shareholders, “with a sizeable buyback as an attractive option at current share prices” (BBVA’s own shares only trade at 0.36x book, after all).
The trouble with a buyback is that it can only happen once European banking supervisors have lifted their ban on payouts, and it is no secret that European banking supervisors put a higher priority on avoiding bank failures on their watch than on seeing shareholders get paid.  Expect them to lean on BBVA to clean up Sabadell first."

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday, hovering near nine-month highs, as strong China data and hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine renewed bets for a swifter economic recovery, while Spanish lender BBVA surged on a deal to sell its U.S. business.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.7% by 1030 GMT, with banks (SX7P) and travel stocks (SXTP) gaining the most.
BBVA (MC:BBVA) surged 16.45% to an eight-month high after PNC Financial Services Group (N:PNC) said it would buy its U.S. business for $11.6 billion in cash.
China's factory output rose faster than expected in October and retail sales surged, as a recovery in the world's second-largest economy from its COVID-19 slump gathered momentum.
""Solid and steady gains are arguably just what investors need after a very volatile period, with the catalyst for the latest move for equities being more positive noises on vaccines,"" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said in a note.
The benchmark STOXX 600 has gained nearly 40% from its March lows, but has underperformed its U.S. peers this year as a recent spike in coronavirus cases across Europe overshadowed optimism around a new vaccine.
Although Europe's bank stocks outperformed other major sectors last week, their performance is the second worst this year as lenders grapple with rock-bottom interest rates amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos asked Euro zone banks on Monday to keep using their capital buffers to absorb losses without holding back credit to the real economy, which, he said, needs time to rebound from a pandemic-induced recession.
Overall, quarterly results for STOXX 600 companies have been better than expected, with 68% of those that have reported results so far beating earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
In company news,  Vodafone  Group (L:VOD), the world's second-largest mobile operator, gained 3.1% after it said it was increasingly confident about its full-year performance following a ""resilient"" first-half, despite underlying momentum being obscured by the impact of COVID-19.

Nissan shares rose 5% on the news. Mitsubishi Motors was up 3%.
""There are no plans to change the capital structure with Mitsubishi,"" a Nissan company spokeswoman told Reuters in an emailed statement. A Mitsubishi Motors spokesman said the same, adding the company would continue to collaborate within the alliance.
Renault did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Nissan, struggling to recover from the pandemic-induced downturn, could sell its stake to a Mitsubishi group company such as Mitsubishi Corp (T:8058), which already owns a fifth of Mitsubishi Motors, Bloomberg said.
Such a deal would fundamentally alter a three-way partnership built by Carlos Ghosn, former chairman of the alliance, which plunged into confusion when he was arrested in 2018 on charges of financial misconduct.
Ghosn had wanted a full merger of Renault and Nissan, which was shelved, according to Reuters sources, as the companies decided to fix the troubled alliance. The pandemic has, however, compounded problems and made a recovery hard.
Nissan, which is 43% owned by Renault, last week cut its operating loss forecast for the year to March by 28%, helped by a rebound in demand, especially in China. Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's No.6 automaker, expects to post an operating loss of 140 billion yen for the business year.
Both companies are cutting production levels and costs in a bid to return to profitability.

DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) said on Monday it had hired banks for a multi-tranche U.S. dollar-denominated bond issuance, as the world's largest oil company seeks cash amid lower oil prices.
Gulf issuers have show no sign of slowing this year's blitz of issues on international debt markets as they work to plug finances hit by weaker oil prices and the coronavirus crisis.
Issuances from the region so far this year have already shot through 2019's record, again surpassing $100 billion.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Citi, HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and NCB Capital were hired to arrange investor calls starting on Monday before the planned transaction, Aramco said in a bourse filing.
Other banks involved in the deal include BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), BOC International, BofA Securities, Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY), First Abu Dhabi Bank, Mizuho, MUFG, SMBC Nikko and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), a document issued by one of the banks on the deal showed.
The oil giant, which made its debut in the international debt markets last year by raising $12 billion after receiving more than $100 billion in orders, did not detail the size of the latest proposed issuance.
It planned a benchmark multi-tranche offering consisting of tranches for three, five, 10, 30 and/or 50 years, subject to market conditions, the document said. Benchmark bonds are generally at least $500 million per tranche. 
""The backdrop is supportive,"" said a debt banker on the deal, citing a $1 billion Islamic bond issuance last week from Dubai Islamic Bank, which achieved record low yields.
Aramco needs cash to pay $37.5 billion in dividends for the second half of 2020 and to fund its $69.1 billion acquisition of 70% of Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC), paid by installments until 2028. It raised a $10 billion loan this year.
SAUDI RISK
""In a world searching for yield there should be no shortage of demand. But persistent low oil prices and the threat that poses to long-term cash generation should be reflected in pricing,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer.
Ratings agency Fitch revised its outlook last week on Aramco to negative from stable, a day after similar action on the sovereign of Saudi Arabia, which holds a controlling stake in the oil giant. The government's finances are heavily reliant on the hydrocarbon industry.
""This reflects the influence the state exerts on the company through strategic direction, taxation and dividends, as well as regulating the level of production in line with OPEC commitments,"" Fitch said.
Aramco's outstanding U.S. dollar-denominated bonds due in 2029 were trading at 2.05% on Monday, a slightly higher yield than Saudi government paper with a similar maturity, Refinitiv data showed. 
A bond prospectus, seen by Reuters, detailed risks for investors, including the COVID-19 virus and the Saudi government's decisions on oil production and spare capacity.
""Saudi Aramco's costs of complying with such decisions, may not maximise returns for Saudi Aramco,"" the prospectus said, citing possible restrictions on its oil output.

Aramco reported a 44.6% drop in third-quarter net profit this month as the pandemic continued to choke demand and weigh on crude prices.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, boosted by positive corporate news while strong economic data from Japan and China fueled optimism of a global recovery. 
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.7%.
BBVA (MC:BBVA) stock soared over 15% after Reuters reported that PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) is nearing an all-cash deal to buy the U.S. business of the Spanish lender for more than $10 billion. That's nearly half of the bank's market capitalization as of Friday's close. The whole European banking sector has gained as a result, with Banco de Sabadell rising 10% on speculation that BBVA will use the money to bulk up in its home market.
Additionally, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) stock rose 3.1% after the U.K. telecommunications group said it was increasingly confident about its full-year performance after a ""resilient"" first half in the face of disruption from the pandemic.
Earlier Monday, Japan’s economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter, growing by an annualized 21.4%, pulling the world's third-largest economy out of recession. China also reported better-than-expected industrial output numbers as well as signs its important retail sector was recovering. 
A weekend trade deal also fostered hopes of a fuller recovery from the Covid shock for at least the Asia-Pacific regional economy, with 15 Asia-Pacific economies - including China and Japan, but not the United States - agreeing to reduce future tariffs.
Still, the coronavirus pandemic continues to cause pain throughout much of the northern hemisphere, with the number of coronavirus cases in the United States, for example, crossing the 11-million mark on Sunday. Case numbers have risen by 2 million in only two weeks.
In Europe, Germany must live with “considerable restrictions” against the spread of Covid-19 for at least four to five months, the country’s economy minister Peter Altmaier warned on Sunday.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is self-isolating after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19. He had been admitted to intensive care earlier this year with the virus.
Oil prices pushed higher Monday, as traders look ahead to the upcoming meeting of the world’s top producers for a further extension of supply curbs to counter the hit to demand from the surge in coronavirus infections.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, including Russia, also known as OPEC+, has been cutting production by about 7.7 million barrels per day to support prices. It had planned to increase output by 2 million barrels per day from January, but this move is increasingly seen as unlikely to happen.
OPEC+ is due to hold a ministerial committee meeting on Tuesday which could recommend changes to production quotas when all the ministers meet on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.4% higher at $41.08 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2% to $43.64.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,891.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1869.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",Clearing houses face tougher crisis management scrutiny,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Global regulators have tightened their scrutiny of whether clearing houses hold enough capital and cash to avoid calling on taxpayers in a crisis, according to new guidelines published on Monday by the Financial Stability Board (FSB).
However, a key demand from a group of major global banks and investors that clearing houses themselves should take on more of the financial burden of any market losses has been kicked down the road.
The FSB, which coordinates financial rules for the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said the recent market turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic had demonstrated the benefits effective clearing brings to markets.
Clearing houses are already required to have default funds to ensure a trade is completed even if one side of a transaction goes bust, and the fund must be big enough to cope with its two biggest members failing.
The new guidance also now sets out how the default fund must be replenished after covering losses.
But the shift to central clearing of derivatives to improve transparency in markets since the financial crisis a decade ago has further increased the systemic importance of clearing houses and more work was needed, the FSB said.
Such work next year will consider rules on the use, composition and amount of financial resources clearers should have if they find themselves on the brink of collapse and need ""resolving"", or closing down, it said.
""This would include assessing whether any new types of pre-funded resources would be necessary to enhance central counterparty resolvability,"" the FSB said.
Earlier this year, nine global banks and investment management companies said clearing houses needed to have more of their own capital at risk as an incentive to limit risky trading.
The group also wants a bigger say in how clearing houses are run as they worry that they, as members, will end up plugging the losses if clearers are not properly resourced.
However, clearers argue that it is members such as banks that create the risk and therefore they should be contributing to the clearers default fund.

Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) nudged up the target range for adjusted core earnings to between 14.4 billion euros and 14.6 billion euros for its 2021 financial year, compared to 14.5 billion euros for the previous year. 
For the six months to the end of September, its adjusted earnings fell by 1.9% to 7.0 billion euros on a 2.3% drop in group revenue to 21.4 billion euros, as the pandemic impacted roaming revenue and handset sales.
Chief Executive Nick Read said the results underlined ""increased confidence"" in the outlook and demonstrated progress in increasing customer loyalty, growing its fixed broadband base and delivering 5G efficiently through network sharing.
The slight upgrade to the outlook compared to a previous forecast for full-year core earnings to be ""flat to slightly down"" on the previous year, and analysts were forecasting on average 14.37 billion euros.

Vodafone also confirmed its full-year free cashflow guidance of at least 5 billion euros before spectrum and restructuring costs on Monday.

Abu Dhabi does not allow non-residents to enter the emirate at its airport, and has not said when that coronavirus-related restriction would be lifted.
Neighbouring Dubai allows foreign visitors to enter.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",Investors tell European firms to reveal 'missing' climate costs in their accounts,"By Matthew Green and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are pushing major European companies to make sure the ""missing"" costs of climate change are properly reflected in their financial statements, a move that could wipe billions of dollars off the value of sectors from energy to aviation.
The European and U.S. investors, who manage $9 trillion in assets, have sent 36 carbon-heavy companies a document https://www.iigcc.org/download/investor-expectations-for-paris-aligned-accounts/?wpdmdl=4001&masterkey=5fabc4d15595d setting out how they should account for the likely impact of the 2015 Paris climate accord on their future profits. 
The investors suspect that existing balance sheets rest on assumptions over variables such as oil prices, carbon taxes, and the lifespan of fossil fuel assets that are incompatible with a shift to net-zero carbon emissions under the Paris deal. 
JPM Morgan Asset Management (part of  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM)), DWS (DE:DWSG), Fidelity International and M&G Investments (L:MNG) were among 38 asset managers to back the document, according to a copy of an accompanying letter https://www.iigcc.org/download/iigcc-letter-to-european-companies-on-paris-aligned-accounts/?wpdmdl=4006&masterkey=5fabc9c5af24f shared with Reuters by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, an industry coalition.
In a statement published on Monday, the investors called on the companies to ""address missing climate change costs in financial accounts"".
""Either we get serious and start shifting capital flows towards activities aligned with the Paris Agreement, or we continue to talk about it,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at London-based asset manager Sarasin & Partners, who wrote the 23-page investor expectations document.
""Paris-aligned accounts are amongst the most important changes that will drive system-wide capital redeployment,"" Landell-Mills said.
Among the companies the investors wrote to were Germany's E.ON (DE:EONGn) and Uniper (DE:UN01), Spain's  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) and  Endesa  (MC:ELE), France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP), Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV) and London-listed  Anglo American  (L:AAL). 
When contacted for comment, the companies variously referred Reuters to existing commitments on sustainability and climate risk disclosure, emphasised they welcomed investor engagement, and said they needed time to study the requirements.
ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS 
The campaign builds on a previous initiative led by Landell-Mills and an initial core of investors to challenge European oil majors and their auditors over their accounting assumptions in light of the Paris deal.
Landell-Mills said that engagement was vindicated in June when British major  BP  (L:BP) said it would write off up to $17.5 billion from the value of its assets after revising down its long-term oil and gas price forecasts. Anglo-Dutch rival Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) booked smaller impairments.
Regulators have increasingly been encouraging companies to make voluntary disclosures of how they expect climate change to affect their businesses, and some countries, including Britain and New Zealand, are making these mandatory.
But the investors say that accountants and auditors may be failing in their existing legal duties to factor in foreseeable risks linked to both the prospect of rapid decarbonisation and physical impacts from climate change, meaning companies may be overstating their capital.
""Too many company accounts are leaving out material climate-related impacts, and this is not just putting shareholder capital at risk; it could have catastrophic consequences for our planet,"" according to the investors' document.
The document said investors could exert leverage on the issue by engaging directly with audit committees and company boards, by voting out directors and auditors, and by divesting shares.

Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at the governance advisory arm of Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), among the asset managers backing the campaign, said investors would review 2020 accounts for ""clear evidence"" of a response from both board directors and auditors.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Monday, as strong economic data from Japan and China fueled optimism of a global recovery even despite the increasing strain on health systems in Europe and the U.S.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, but CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%. 
Japan’s economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter, data showed on Monday. It grew by 5% on the quarter, better than the 4.4% growth expected, and by an annualized 21.4%, pulling the world's third-largest economy out of recession. 
Adding to the positive tone were better-than-expected industrial output numbers from China, as well as signs its important retail sector was recovering. 
A weekend trade deal also fostered hopes of a fuller recovery from the Covid shock for at least the Asia-Pacific regional economy, with 15 Asia-Pacific economies - including China and Japan, but not the United States - agreeing to reduce future tariffs.
Influential investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), in an outlook for 2021, recommended that investors overweight equities and corporate bonds, citing an expected “V-shaped” economic recovery, greater clarity on Covid-19 vaccines and continued policy support.
Still, the coronavirus pandemic continues to cause pain throughout much of the northern hemisphere, with the number of coronavirus cases in the United States, for example, crossing the 11-million mark on Sunday. Case numbers have risen by 2 million in only two weeks.
In Europe, Germany must live with “considerable restrictions” against the spread of Covid-19 for at least four to five months, the country’s economy minister Peter Altmaier warned on Sunday.

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 01:06AM ET</span>","Walmart sells majority stake in Seiyu, nearly exiting Japan","By Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) is selling a majority stake in Japanese supermarket chain Seiyu to investment firm KKR (N:KKR) and e-commerce company Rakuten (T:4755) for over $1 billion, after years of struggling to make money amid stiff competition.
The deal, which values Seiyu at 172.5 billion yen ($1.65 billion), comes after on-off speculation about the U.S. retail giant looking to exit Japan. It is well below the 300-500 billion yen it reportedly sought a few years ago. 
KKR will buy 65% of Seiyu while Rakuten, which already has an online venture with the chain, will acquire a 20% stake. Walmart will retain 15%, the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.
The world's biggest retailer first entered the Japanese market in 2002 by buying a 6% stake in Seiyu, and gradually built up its stake before a full takeover in 2008.
But it has struggled in Japan, like other foreign entrants such as  Tesco  PLC (L:TSCO) and  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR) who were lured by the high spending power of Japanese consumers but were frustrated by tough competition.
Some analysts said Walmart, while failing to make much money in Japan, had done better than other foreign retailers considering it saved money-losing Seiyu from bankruptcy by cutting costs and improving private brand sales.
""Walmart was always going to struggle, because they had to turn around the business and also they needed to grow volume to really have a viable share in the Japanese market and the only way to do that was through more acquisitions, which it wasn't willing to spend money on,"" said Roy Larke who specialises in Japan's retail industry at JapaneseConsuming. 
LATEST DIVESTITURE
The Seiyu deal is the latest divestiture of underperforming assets by Walmart, following its exits in Britain and Argentina, as it struggled to compete with nimble local rivals. In Asia, it pulled out of South Korea in 2006 and shifted focus in China to expanding members-only warehouse chain Sam's Club as competition from online marketplaces such as  Alibaba  (N:BABA) intensified. Walmart is expanding in India, though, with its $16 billion purchase of ecommerce provider Flipkart. 
Japanese media reported two years ago that Walmart was seeking to sell Seiyu, which operates around 330 supermarkets, for around 300 billion to 500 billion yen. Sources said at the time that potential buyers balked at the price.
Addressing reports that it was looking to leave Japan, Walmart announced last year that it aimed to list Seiyu and retain a majority stake in the business.
But Monday's announcement also comes as Seiyu is starting to show signs of improvement, with its relatively early start in e-commerce finally yielding results, helped by a 2018 partnership with Rakuten. 
Walmart Japan, mainly the Seiyu business, booked a net profit of 47 million yen in 2019 after reporting losses in most previous years. Seiyu told Reuters earlier this year that the coronavirus pandemic had bolstered interest in online grocery shopping in Japan. 
Large Japanese supermarkets such as Aeon Co Ltd (T:8267) and Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd's (T:3382) Ito-Yokado have been stepping up their investments in e-commerce as Japanese consumers, long wary of buying fresh fish and produce online, are starting to use online grocery services.
For Rakuten, the deal with Seiyu helps it fight back against rival Amazon (O:AMZN), which recently stepped up its online grocery business by tying up with supermarket chain  Life Corp  (T:8194).

""We look forward to accelerating digital transformation of Seiyu brick and mortar retail, and further merging the best of offline and online retail,"" Kazunori Takeda, Rakuten's group executive vice president, said in a statement.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Monday morning in Asia, starting the week on a positive note in the region over the signing of the world’s largest regional free-trade agreement.
Fifteen countries signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade deal on Sunday, the final day of the 37th Asean Summit which was hosted by Vietnam virtually due to the COVID-19 virus.
The countries include China, Japan South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and the ten 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, together encompassing nearly a third of the world’s population and gross domestic product, or 2.2 billion people with a combined GDP of $26.2 trillion.
“(The) agreement ... signals that Asia keeps pushing ahead with trade liberalization even as other regions have become more skeptical,” HSBC economists Frederic Neumann and Shanella Rajanayagam said in a note.
“As such, it may reinforce a trend that’s been already underway for decades: that the global center of economic gravity keeps pushing relentlessly to the East,” the note added.
India was conspicuously missing from the list of countries. However, the deal raided hopes for the recovery of trade hit by U.S.-China tensions.
However, recent moves by U.S. President Donald Trump have increased U.S.-China tensions, with more moves such as sanctions or trade restrictions against even more Chinese companies, government entities or officials reportedly under consideration.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.77% by 11:6 PM ET (3:16 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.24%. Data released earlier in the day showed that China’s industrial production rose 6.9% year-on-year in October, above the 6.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but remaining on par with September’s reading.
Meanwhiles retail sales grew 4.3% year-on-year in October, down from the forecast 4.9% but up from September’s growth of 3.3%. The unemployment rate fell to 5.3% from September’s 5.4%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.63%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 1.23%. The bourse saw a short pause in trading shortly after its market opened, with market data issues currently under investigation by the operator.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.81% and South Korea’s KOSPI soared 1.96%.
Global stocks rebounded back to pre-COVID-19 highs over hopes that a vaccine would become available soon. However, the ever-increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases worldwide tempered that enthusiasm.
The number of global COVID-19 cases passed the 54 million mark as of Nov. 16, with over 11 million cases in the U.S. alone, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Germany must live with “considerable restrictions” against the spread of COVID-19 for at least the next four to five months, the country’s economy minister Peter Altmaier warned on Sunday.
Some investors remained positive despite the numbers.
“We do see a positive stream of news going forward … the market is looking forward towards eventual reopenings, real yields probably bottoming out, and cyclical and value stocks doing better, I think that’s a momentum that will be carried through at least over the next 3 to 6 months if not longer,” Sage Capital Pty chief investment officer Sean Fenton told Bloomberg."

The agreed discount comes as the two companies settled a legal dispute over the transaction, which Simon had previously threatened to walk away from, citing the hit to the industry from COVID-19.
Under the revised terms, Simon will pay $2.65 billion for the 80% stake in the Taubman Realty Group (TRG), cutting its offer price to $43 per share in cash from $52.50 originally announced in February.
The Taubman family will sell about one-third of its ownership interest at the transaction price, leaving them with a 20% stake in TRG, the companies added. 
The companies said they also have settled their pending litigation in a Michigan court over the merger and the companies expect the deal to close later this year or early next year.
Simon, which runs shopping chains such as the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York, said in June it was abandoning the deal.
Simon said at that time the coronavirus outbreak had ""disproportionately hurt"" Taubman's malls given their location in densely populated metropolitan areas and reliance on tourism.
Online shopping growth had already slashed foot traffic at brick-and-mortar retail stores and the pandemic has only accelerated that trend.
Simon also said Taubman did not cut costs to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

Taubman had said Simon's termination of the deal was without merit and filed a lawsuit rejecting Simon's allegations.

Huachen, owned by the government of Liaoning province, defaulted on a 1-billion-yuan ($151.88 million) bond last month, joining a growing number of delinquent state firms in a development that hit investor confidence and roiled China's credit bond market. 
Huachen faces the prospect of restructuring after Gezhi Automobile Technology Co filed an application to the Shenyang Intermediate People's Court for restructuring of Huachen, Hong Kong-listed Brilliance Auto (HK:1114) said in an exchange filing on Sunday. It remains uncertain whether the restructuring application will be accepted by the court, it said. 
Bondholders see a bankruptcy restructuring by Huachen to be unfavourable as they will likely end up getting little out of the process.
Huachen's bankruptcy would have little impact on the operation of Brilliance but could upset plans for an expected privatisation, Daiwa Capital Markets said in a note to clients. 
A Huachen representative declined to comment.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>","Australia's Qantas celebrates subdued 100th birthday, looks to post-COVID future","By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN), the world's third-oldest airline, on Monday marked its 100th birthday during its toughest year yet due to the coronavirus pandemic but is looking to the future with optimism, its chief executive said. 
""Qantas every decade has literally reinvented itself,"" Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in a recorded message. ""That is why it has survived as long as it has.""
The airline, founded in Australia's outback as Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Ltd (Qantas) in 1920, is the world's third-oldest operating carrier behind Dutch airline KLM (PA:AIRF) and Colombia's Avianca Holdings SA (CN:AVT_p).
Qantas' centenary will include a 100-minute low-level flyover of Sydney's famous harbour at sunset on Monday evening for 100 employees as well as frequent flyers. 
At the start of the year, the airline had been in a strong financial position and was expecting to order up to 12 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350 jets for routes including the world's longest-ever non-stop flights between Sydney and London.
It has since announced cuts to nearly 30% of its workforce and grounded the bulk of its fleet. It doesn't expect a return to most international travel until the second half of 2021 as Australia's borders remain largely closed.
The domestic market outlook is brighter as state borders begin to reopen, with the airline expecting to return to as much as 50% of normal capacity by Christmas.
Joyce said he was also optimistic the airline's plans for non-stop Sydney-London flights would be back on the table as its financial position improved.
""We think the business case for that is going to be even better in a post-COVID world,"" he said. 
The airline has one of the world's best safety records, highlighted in the 1988 film Rain Man, where an autistic character played by Dustin Hoffman says ""Qantas never crashed"". 

That is not entirely accurate given some accidents in its earlier years, but the Australian airline has not had a fatal crash since 1951, before it began flying jets.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Drugmakers offer Canada C$1 billion to scrap some pending pricing rules,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - The pharmaceutical industry has made a last-ditch C$1 billion ($761 million) proposal to the Canadian government in hopes of fending off parts of a drug pricing crackdown set to go into effect on Jan. 1, according to industry documents reviewed by Reuters.
The remaining regulations would still reduce drugmakers' revenue by at least C$19.8 billion ($15.1 billion) over 10 years, according to an industry estimate.
If other costly reforms are shelved, the industry is willing to spend C$1 billion over the same period to boost local manufacturing and commercialization, and on new programs to improve access to drugs for rare diseases.
The government has argued that Canada's patented drug prices are too high, trailing only the United States and Switzerland, and that other countries with lower prices enjoy similar access to prescription medicines.
Innovative Medicines Canada (IMC), the industry's lobby group in Canada, met with Minister of Health Patty Hajdu on Oct. 16, and submitted a written proposal the following week, but has not yet heard back, IMC President Pamela Fralick said.
""We have come forward with some considerable options for government to consider, and there just does not seem to be that interest,"" Fralick said in an interview. ""We felt it was time to let Canadians know what the government is, in fact, passing up.""
In a statement, the health minister's office said the government will always consider proposals ""about different ways to achieve the Government's objectives,"" but also noted that ""no amendments to the regulations are currently in development."" 
""The position of the Government of Canada remains unchanged — Canada has among the highest patented medicine prices in the world, and these high prices negatively affect the ability of patients to access new medicines,"" said the statement.
Reuters reported in February 2019 that the industry had offered to give up C$8.6 billion in revenue over 10 years to head off the pricing reform plan.
The industry has since backed down on one part of the plan, which will change the comparison countries Canada's Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) uses as a benchmark to set some maximum prices. The PMPRB will drop the United States and Switzerland from its comparisons, and add nations with lower prices.
But the regulations also empower the PMPRB to consider the cost-effectiveness of new drugs, and their potential impact on government budgets, an approach the industry has fought for years.
Drugmakers and some patient groups argue that price reductions, and the uncertainty associated with the complex cost-benefit analysis that will be required for some new medicines, will make pharmaceutical companies less likely to launch new drugs in Canada's relatively small market.
While Canadian sales are not material to most global drugmakers, the new regulations could inspire similar reforms in other countries, or more directly affect foreign prices. Many countries set drug prices based in part on those in other countries, so price cuts could ripple across the globe.
The United States, the world's biggest prescription drug market, is a notable exception, with unregulated drug pricing.
That could change. The Trump administration had floated a plan that would take prices in other countries into consideration, although nothing has come of it. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's platform similarly promised a new review board that would base payments by the government's Medicare health plan partly on prices in other countries.
IMC did not offer much detail on how a rare disease program could work, but said it could improve ""access and sustainability."" Drugs for rare diseases are particularly costly.
In some other countries, like Scotland, specially negotiated programs bring expensive rare disease drugs to market at a discount or with spending capped, giving drugmakers more time to prove their worth.

In a statement on Saturday, Gulfport said it has secured $262.5 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its existing lenders under its revolving credit facility, including $105 million in new money that will be available upon court approval.
Weak demand due to the coronavirus pandemic and a price war between major oil producers resulted in a historic plunge in oil prices.
As part of the restructuring plan, Gulfport said it expected to eliminate about $1.25 billion in funded debt and significantly reduce annual cash interest expense.
Gulfport had interest payments on its debt due on Oct. 15, Nov. 1 and Nov. 15.
Gulfport said it also received a commitment from existing lenders to provide $580 million in exit financing upon emergence from Chapter 11.
As of Sept. 30, the company had total debt of about $2.5 billion, according to a filing with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.
The company said it would also issue $550 million of new senior unsecured notes under the restructuring agreement to existing unsecured creditors of certain Gulfport subsidiaries.
Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Jackson Walker LLP served as legal co-counsel and Alvarez & Marsal was restructuring adviser to the company.

1408,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 14, 2020 08:07AM ET</span>","Used Car Disruptor Joining Carvana, Vroom in Bid to Move Industry Online","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- We sell clothes online on consignment, so why not cars? Enter CarLotz, among the newest disruptors in the digital used car world, which has seen demand boom in times of Covid-19.
The fast-growing, already nearly trillion-dollar market for used cars is a fragmented one, with thousands of dealers of all sizes, and the top 100 representing just 6% of the total. Richmond, Virginia-based CarLotz is seeing a wealth of opportunity to fast-forward the industry into the digital age -- though it is also betting on physical locations. It is poised to go public via a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company to fund its ambitious growth plans. 
CarLotz says it's unique in selling vehicles on consignment online from individuals who might previously have used Craigslist, corporations and auctions. 
""We're the only guys who are disrupting the whole supply chain,"" said Chief Executive Officer Michael Bor in a video interview. Expectations for future performance are high, and CarLotz is not alone in its mission.
The company sees 2020's estimated revenue of $110 million booming to as much as $1.7 billion in 2023, and unit sales jumping from just over 6,000 to over 80,000 in that time period. Annual profit, estimated at $12 million in 2020, could rise to as much as $250 million in 2023, the company said in a statement. 
While that may seem aggressive, rival Carvana’s first reported revenue after going public in 2017 totaled $159 million. In its most recent quarterly report,  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA) reported sales of $1.54 billion.
“It does sound like a big dollar amount but it's consistent with what we're seeing is possible in this sector,” Bor said. 
CarLotz's reverse merger with Acamar Partners's Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp Class A (NASDAQ:ACAM), and a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, for a total of $436 million, minus expenses, will put $321 million on its balance sheet. That will help CarLotz expand from eight locations in five states -- it intends to open three to four new locations each quarter for the next several years.  
The industry's jump in sales will have to overcome pressure on individual car prices. Rival Vroom (NASDAQ:VRM) saw increased demand in the third quarter, with ecommerce unit sales up 59% and overall unit sales rising 15%. The company reported results earlier this week. Despite the good news,  Vroom  shares tumbled 13% because the average online selling price of its vehicles tumbled in the third quarter to $24,248 from $31,370. 
Carvana, another competitor, also saw demand increase, with retail units sold in the third quarter up 39% from the same period in 2019. But Carvana also saw a dip in the average selling price of retail units in the third quarter, to $20,013 from $20,059. 
CarLotz's growth plan assumes a slight increase in the average selling price, from $16,054 to $17,250 between 2020 and 2022, representing a 3.7% compound annual growth rate. That average is 7% lower than the increase recorded between 2017 and 2019, according to CarLotz.
CarLotz nets a better price for its sellers with professional merchandizing, Bor said. In fact, CarLotz’s corporate vehicle sourcing partners earn on average about $1,000 more through CarLotz than by selling at wholesale, according to a company presentation.  
The used car market has definite potential and CarLotz could be ready for take off. Looking at its competitors, however, shows these stories have very different endings. Carvana saw shares more than double in 2020. Vroom, however, which went public in June, saw a spike in shares in September, only to tumble more than 50% since then.
Despite a growing market, it's not necessarily an easy one.

1409,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 14, 2020 08:03AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Amazon,"By Liz Moyer and Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Amazon’s position in e-commerce makes it a clear winner among retailers in the pandemic era. Last month, it reported a 37% gain in third quarter revenue, to $96.1 billion and profit of $6.3 billion.
That amounted to whopping earnings per share of $12.37, up from $4.23 a share the year earlier. Analysts had been expecting EPS of $7.41. That’s how big of a surprise the third quarter was.
But can Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) maintain this momentum, especially given the stay-at-home era will eventually end, and people will start visiting malls and movie theaters once again.
Investing.com's Liz Moyer argues that Amazon has plenty of room to grow, while Geoffrey Smith says these gains are unsustainable. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
Shares of the Seattle-based online retailing juggernaut are up 68% this year. 
The consensus outlook for the whole year has EPS coming in at $34.91, up from $23.01 for 2019, a gain of around 52%. Revenue for 2020 is seen coming just over $379 billion, up 35% from last year.
Amazon has been aggressively spending on its infrastructure during the pandemic, setting aside $10 billion for the second through fourth quarters.
“The company does not want to be seen as benefiting too much from the pandemic,” VentureBeat recently wrote, noting its $5.2 billion in quarterly profit in the second quarter was the largest ever in its 26-year history and that it broke that record again in the third quarter.
It’s using the money to build out its fulfillment network, adding network capacity to meet higher demand from stuck-at-home consumers. It hired more people to run its fulfillment network, adding 250,000 permanent full-time and part-time workers in the third quarter and another 100,000 in October.
Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky acknowledged the company’s capital spending on a recent conference call. “This has been a big year for capital investments, “ he said. “We expect to grow our fulfillment and logistics network square footage by approximately 50 percent this year.”
That doesn’t mean all the concerns about fulfillment have been addressed. Obviously the pandemic has seen restrictions on warehouse space and slower parcel delivery, which is problematic going into the holiday season. 
“We'll all be stretched and it's advantageous to the customer and private companies for people to order early this year. But regardless of the order pattern, we're gonna do our best to get the usual excellent service to our customers on pre-COVID levels,” the CFO told analysts last month.
Analysts see more growth from here, though Amazon is one of the most high-priced stocks. The average price target is north of $3,800, implying a 12-month return of 23%. 
Deutsche Bank analysts said even before the earnings report that they remain bullish on the stock, seeing elevated growth as shoppers stick to online gift buying. Considering the severe problem with growing coronavirus cases around the country just weeks before the holidays, that may be an understatement.
The Bear Case 
The bear case for Amazon rests to a large part on the fact that what the coronavirus has given, the pharmaceutical industry will take away. The pandemic may have accelerated a long-term shift toward remote working and shopping, but much of that will unwind the minute that people feel that they can go to the office, the mall and the movies safely. 
The North American business, its most important one, was growing at a rate of 24% a year ago. In the third quarter of 2020, that rate had surged to 39%. That is unsustainable. Mean reversion will kick in and next year's quarterly figures will have some very tough comparables. The stock trades at 91x trailing earnings. While not unusual in the context of a company that has consistently pursued growth over profit, that implies a growth rate that it will struggle to sustain, given that its main business has already reached globally systemic scale.
The market is also failing to price in the regulatory risks that loom ahead. The abusive practices detailed in the EU's new antitrust charges look ominously like the same ones Amazon has repeatedly denied using in Congress. The risk is not only that Amazon is proved to be abusing a dominant position, but having lied about it too.. 
More broadly, it's becoming increasingly clear that the peak power of big Internet platforms is -if not already behind us - then approaching very quickly (the crushing of Ant Group's value by China is an example of the same phenomenon). The U.S. hasn't faced such a concentration of economic power in private hands since Teddy Roosevelt's day. At a time of massive unemployment and rising inequality - a phenomenon of which Amazon's founder is the most egregious example - the super-profits of the FAANGS are politically unsustainable. The day of reckoning may be put off by a Congress divided against itself, but it will not be put off forever.
Europe's governments in particular, having lost the taxes of all those stores bankrupted by Amazon over the last two decades, have already developed plans to tax Amazon and its peers on their sales, rather than their profits which are routinely magicked away to jurisdictions where the burden is lightest. Amazon's provision for income taxes in the last quarter was a paltry 8.5% of its pretax profit.  Faced with a monthly deficit currently running at $284 billion, the new U.S. administration may find it more expedient to join in soaking the super-profits of the FAANGS (and those who have invested in them), rather than defend them.
The latest lockdown measures will sauce the current quarter's profit nicely, but it may well be downhill from there."

1411,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 09:40PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Stock investors cast wary eye on yield rally,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Treasury yields rally to multi-month highs, some investors are gauging how a more sustained rise could impact equity markets.
Yields on the 10-year Treasury, which move inversely to bond prices, rose to a seven-month high of 0.97% in the past week on hopes that breakthroughs in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine would eventually translate to a boost in economic growth. 
That's still low, by historical standards: yields are a full point below their levels at the start of January and below their 5-year average of 2.05%, according to Refinitiv data. The Federal Reserve has pledged to keep interest rates near historic lows for years to come in its bid to support growth, and past rallies in yields have faded in recent years. 
Expectations that a vaccine against the coronavirus could fuel a broad economic revival, however, have also spurred bets that yields could continue edging higher. That could potentially weaken the case for holding shares that have become expensive during the S&P 500’s 58% rally from its lows of the year. 
""If growth turns out better than anybody thought, the bad news is that the Fed might not have as much control over the extended curve,"" said Ralph Segall, chief investment officer at firm Segall, Bryant & Hamill. ""That would probably cause stocks to pause.""
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) this week forecast Treasury yields will hit 1.3% by the end of next year and 1.7% by 2022. They also raised their forecast for the S&P to 4,100 by the middle of next year, a roughly 16% gain from recent levels.
For now, analysts believe yields have some way to go before they become an obstacle to further stock gains. 
The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed by an average of 1.37% a month during rising rate environments when the yield 10-year Treasury remained at 3% or below, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at research firm CFRA. 
The S&P 500 gained an average of 0.53% a month with yields above 3%, he said. 
How quickly yields rise also matters, said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors. 
A gradual increase as the economy improves allows companies time to roll over or refinance debt, while a sharp jump higher is more likely to shock the market, she said. 
Technology stocks, which have led the market higher this year, could be the first sector to feel the weight of higher rates, said Segall. 
Rates moving above 1.5% ""would suggest that growth was better than anybody thought"" and pull investors into more cyclical areas of the market while potentially dimming the allure of tech-related names, he said. 
Investors next week will have their eyes on earnings reports and forecasts from U.S. retailers to gauge how consumer demand is faring in the worst public health crisis in decades. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a seven-month low last week, while consumer prices remained unchanged. 
At the same time, Treasury yields are far from eclipsing the average 2.07% dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks. 
Should yields grind higher, ""a lot of investors would still see dividend payers as attractive because their yields are so much higher"" than those offered by bonds while also offering capital gains, said Bill McMahon, chief investment officer for active strategies at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Investment Management. 
Plenty of investors believe rates are unlikely to rise much further. 
An upward trend in rates will not likely be sustained until there are signs that the pandemic is being contained, either through falling infection rates or the widespread availability of vaccines, said Margie Patel, senior portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management.

Until case counts fall, 10-year Treasuries are likely to remain in a trading range below 1.1%, she said.

Google is pressing for two in-house attorneys to have access to the confidential data while the Justice Department and state attorneys general involved in the lawsuit have disagreed, Google said in a court filing on Friday.
Google stated it needed the information to prepare an effective defense. It offered to ensure that any confidential information would be made available solely to two in-house attorneys at the offices of Google's outside counsel or in another secure manner, adding that it would promptly report any disclosure.
The government said in a separate filing that allowing Google's staff attorneys to review ""strategic plans related to rival voice assistants, and other commercially sensitive information"" was dangerous because they could misuse the information to squash potential competition. 
The government also said that highly confidential files in the last big technology antitrust case, which involved  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) about 20 years ago, were only available to the company's outside counsel.

DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Friday it was recalling 68,677 electric cars worldwide that pose a fire risk after five reported fires and two minor injuries.
The recall is for 2017-2019 model year Chevrolet Bolt EVs with high voltage batteries produced at LG Chem Ltd's (KS:051910) Ochang, South Korean facility.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) last month opened a preliminary investigation into the Bolt EVs after reports of three Bolts catching fire. 
GM said the vehicles pose a fire risk when charged to full, or nearly full capacity. The Detroit automaker said it had developed software that will limit vehicle charging to 90% of full capacity to mitigate the risk, while it determines the appropriate final repair.
""We're working together around the clock to deploy a final remedy as soon as possible after the first of the year,"" Jesse Ortega, executive chief engineer for the Chevrolet Bolt EV, told reporters on a conference call. 
LG Chem said in a statement; ""We will cooperate with GM and sincerely proceed with an investigation to identify the exact cause of fire."" 
NHTSA said Bolt owners ""should park their cars outside and away from homes until their vehicles have been repaired, due to a new recall for the risk of fire.""
The recall includes 50,932 U.S. Bolt vehicles. 
Smoke inhalation injuries were reported in a March 2019 incident in Belmont, Massachusetts. A Bolt caught fire in the driveway and the owner said strong fumes permeated the home during a three-hour fire requiring professional cleaning. The owners also reported they suffered headaches from contact with the smoke.
Dealerships will update the vehicle's battery software beginning next week.
Other electric vehicles have faced fire risk recalls.
Last month,  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) issued a recall for nearly 77,000 Kona EVs worldwide, saying possible defects in battery cells increased the risk of a short circuit or fire.
The affected vehicles in Hyundai's recall also use LG Chem battery cells, produced in the supplier's factory in Nanjing, China.

LG Chem denied any cell defects but said it was working with Hyundai.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) will inspect all its U.S. restaurants to ensure compliance with safety standards as coronavirus cases surge again and ""COVID fatigue"" sets in, according to an internal note seen by Reuters on Friday.
""It is apparent we are entering what many predicted would be the most difficult period of the pandemic,"" said the note, from McDonald's Chief Field Officer Charlie Strong and two U.S. franchisees who lead internal relations with the corporation.
The so-called ""safety reaffirmation visits"" were developed jointly with franchisees, the note said, and should be concluded by Dec. 31. The company may conduct follow-up visits where necessary. 
Company-owned stores will also be examined, McDonald's said.
The pandemic prompted widespread changes in how restaurants conduct business, with many relying more on drive-thru, carry-out and delivery.
U.S. sales at most restaurants plunged in April as coronavirus restrictions became widespread. Most big chains, including McDonald's, have seen steady recovery since then.
McDonald's owners were also urged in the note to ensure that drive-thrus contain equipment that allows customers to use credit cards without having to hand them to cashiers, and that staff inside are separated by protective panels when social distancing is not possible.
In a separate blog post on Friday, McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said the burger chain would soon convene industry roundtables to share key lessons learned.

""McDonald’s success — just like the success of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), or any other U.S.-based business — depends on all of us getting back to some version of normal as quickly as possible,"" he wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher on Friday with upbeat earnings reports helping to drive optimism about the economy along with hopes for successful COVID-19 vaccines even as investors monitored a surge in virus cases and restrictions around the country.
After a volatile trading week where the market was whipsawed between hopes and fears around the virus, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after its quarterly report showed a work-from-home driven surge in demand.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co also rose as its rapidly growing streaming video business, and a partial recovery at its theme parks tempered its quarterly loss.
""At least for today it looks like sentiment regarding the potential for vaccines combined with very strong earnings announcements from a number of companies has investors hopeful that the economy can continue to recover,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 378.85 points, or 1.3%, to 29,459.02, the S&P 500 gained 46.99 points, or 1.33%, to 3,584 and the Nasdaq Composite added 113.97 points, or 0.97%, to 11,823.55.
Friday's outperformance of more economically sensitive sectors including energy, and industrials over growth sectors like technology was a clear indication of ""optimism around the economy getting back on its footing,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. 
The three major U.S. stock indexes had fallen on Thursday as more than a dozen U.S. states reported a doubling of new COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks, with Chicago's mayor issuing a month-long stay-at-home advisory.
But a senior adviser to President-elect Joe Biden said there were no plans for nationwide lockdowns next year and instead talked about restrictions for specific regions when the virus spread is bad there. 
State Street's Arone said the aversion to a full lockdown likely cheered up some investors. But he was concerned that investor optimism may be overdone, particularly as Fed officials have been warning about the potential damage rising virus cases could do to the economy without a fresh economic stimulus package in sight.
""The market is underestimating some of the impact that rising cases and no stimulus will have on the economy and earnings and they're over estimating the potential timeline and breadth of a vaccine distribution,"" Arone said.
""In the spring folks were bracing for the worst and the worst didn't happen. Now they're expecting the best and they may be a little too rosy.""
Positive data from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine study earlier this week had prompted a rotation into the cyclical sectors, boosting the S&P 500 and Dow.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq, however, underperformed as investors booked profits in technology stocks, which have benefited from a stay-at-home environment.
Globalt's Martin also pointed to hopes for news of more coronavirus vaccine progress, after  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc said earlier this week that it had enough data for a first interim analysis of its late-stage trial.
With third-quarter reports released from about 90% of S&P 500 companies Refinitiv IBES estimates now show profits falling 7.8% from last year compared with an Oct. 1 expectation for a 21.4% slump.
Meanwhile, Biden's victory in the battleground state of Arizona expanded his electoral vote margin, but the official transition remains in limbo as President Donald Trump refuses to concede.

Value stocks, which include mostly cyclical sectors such as banks and energy, outperformed the growth index, which is largely comprised of tech companies.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>","U.S. states race to buy ultra cold vaccine freezers, fueling supply worries","By Lisa Baertlein and Carl O'Donnell
LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. states, cities, and hospitals are scrambling to buy ultra-cold freezers that can safely store  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) COVID-19 vaccine, ignoring advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to hold off.
The push reveals a lack of infrastructure to support a super cold vaccine campaign, including equipment to store millions of doses of Pfizer's vaccine at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46°F).
Some specialty freezer makers warn of months-long waits for units.
It also marks widespread wariness of the advice from the CDC, which on Aug. 26 urged healthcare providers not to purchase ultra low temperature (ULT) freezers, saying it was working on solutions for Pfizer's ""very complex storage and handling requirements."" 
A CDC spokeswoman on Thursday said the agency expects the first vaccine doses will be in limited quantities and rapidly deployed, reducing the need to store them in specialized freezers.
But the news on Monday that initial results from a pivotal trial of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech (F:22UAy) showed it to be more than 90% effective has turned attention to eventual shipping and storage logistics.
That has thrown a spotlight on makers of the niche freezers, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (N:TMO), Luxembourg's B Medical Systems, Helmer Scientific and Stirling Ultracold, who are adding labor and expanding capacity.
""I would estimate that a third of states are purchasing ultra cold storage equipment,"" said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a nonprofit representing state and local public health officials who handle vaccines.
The specialized freezers required by Pfizer's vaccine can cost $5,000 to $15,000.
 Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) is close to releasing efficacy results for its similar vaccine, which requires an easier to accommodate storage temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4°F).
At least half a dozen states, including California, Rhode Island and New Mexico, said in published comments to the CDC that they expect to face challenges due to limited supplies of ULT freezers. A similar number told Reuters or said in public filings that they are purchasing units in anticipation of the vaccine rollout. 
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear on Thursday called for federal funding for cold storage and said he hopes other vaccines with less onerous storage requirements get approved.
ON BACK ORDER
Earlier this year, due to lack of a coordinated federal response to the pandemic, states were forced to compete against each other for everything from protective N95 masks for healthcare workers to ventilators and testing equipment.
While demand for ULT freezers is climbing, it has not entered the early pandemic's ventilator panic phase where ""we had lead times of 18 months,"" said Rebecca Gayden, who oversees sourcing of freezers and other capital equipment at Vizient, a purchasing group used by more than 5,000 not-for-profit health systems and affiliates. 
Northwell Health, New York state's largest hospital system, said it has leased around 20 ultra cold freezers for the Pfizer vaccine, and that manufacturers now had waiting lists.
Thermo Fisher said it built up inventory ahead of demand, and is unaffected by capacity crunches.
Some smaller manufacturers, however, acknowledged issues due to the surge in demand. Indiana-based Helmer Scientific said production of new orders has pushed into next year. 
Ohio's Stirling Ultracold, which sold a 6,000-dose portable, cooler-sized ULT to North Dakota as well as large freezers for  United Parcel  Service Inc's (N:UPS) freezer farms, said delivery waits could now extend up to two months.
George Gerhardt, emergency preparedness program representative for North Dakota, where the virus is now running rampant, said his state started shopping for freezers this summer. ""If we wait till the last day, everybody's going to want one,"" Gerhardt said at the time, before purchasing 10 ULT units. 
The Wyoming Department of Health was not so lucky. Its ULT freezer is on ""back order"" until late December, said public information officer Kim Deti.
Cities and states are searching university labs, hospitals and other facilities for available ULT freezer space.
Philadelphia is spending about $19,000 on two B Medical freezers scheduled to be installed later this month, and is working with local healthcare systems to secure additional capacity.
Pfizer's vaccine could get regulatory approval within weeks with distribution to begin almost immediately.
It will be transported in dry ice-filled, suitcase-sized containers that can only be opened twice a day and last a maximum of two weeks. Dry ice has also been offered as a potential solution for nations without access to ULT storage in vaccination centers.
""Waste is a major concern,"" said Soumi Saha, vice president of advocacy at Premier Inc, which coordinates purchases for thousands of U.S. hospitals and health systems. ""Do you turn a patient away because you can't open it a third time that day?""

Dow component Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reported a narrower-than-expected loss as well as subscriber numbers that topped Wall Street expectations, sending its shares more than 2% higher.
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), meanwhile, beat Wall Street estimates as the work from home trend continued to boost product demand. Its shares rose 7%.
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) rose about 4% after rolling out better-than-expected guidance as the return of major sports boosted customer engagement and quarterly results.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were about unchanged on the day, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded higher.
The move higher in the broader market comes in the wake of concerns about the impact on the economy of growing restrictions to curb the surge in cases as New York City is reportedly looking to shut schools as early as next week.
Cases in the U.S. surged above a record 160,000 cases on Thursday, while hospitalizations climbed to a record 67,096, according to the Covid Tracking Project.  
In other news, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) hit a record high, up 2%, after the company said its venture capital arm would be folded back into the business to focus on strategic investments.
Nio (NYSE:NIO), meanwhile, fell nearly 8% after short-seller fund Citron Research suggested it was time to take profit on the stock, citing competition from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s decision to cut its price on the Model Y in China and an investor base that is unlikely to have staying power.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission charged former  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) CEO John Stumpf and retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt with misleading investors, the watchdog announced Friday.
The agency claimed that the former executives misled investors about the widespread sales practice problems at the bank. Stumpf agreed to pay a $2.5 million penalty to settle the charges, while the SEC will litigate fraud charges against Tolstedt in court.
A lawyer for Stumpf did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Tolstedt said she was an ""honest and conscientious executive,"" and the SEC charges are ""unfair and unfounded.""
The new charges mark the latest in a long-running set of legal and regulatory woes for the bank and its former leadership, after the firm was embroiled in a massive scandal over the creation of fake accounts by employees. In February, the bank agreed to pay $3 billion to settle a joint probe by the SEC and Justice Department.
Stumpf and Tolstedt have faced individual sanctions as well. Stumpf was barred from the banking industry and fined $17.5 million by a banking regulator in January, and Tolstedt is facing a $25 million fine which she is fighting in court.

In the latest charges, the SEC said the pair misled investors about the health of their sales practices, and they should have known about deep-seated issues within the bank.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Analysis: Battered value bulls wary as vaccine news fuels cheap stock surge,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A long period of underperformance for value stocks has frustrated Mike Mullaney, whose firm's investing style is ""all value, all the time."" 
One low point came when Mullaney noticed competing funds in the value space buying up big technology and other momentum stocks - regarded as the antithesis of value - to juice their performance.
""To say it’s been a tough slog is an understatement,"" said Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, which manages over $60 billion.
Long-suffering value specialists received some vindication this week after Pfizer’s breakthrough in developing a COVID-19 vaccine ignited a rally in shares of energy firms, banks, industrials and other members of the value universe - commonly defined as stocks that trade at discounts to their projected intrinsic worth.
As of Thursday's close, the Russell 1000 value index (RLV) was on track to outperform its growth counterpart (RLG) by the biggest weekly margin since 2001. It was fueled by hopes that a coronavirus vaccine will end global shutdowns and travel restrictions that battered vast segments of the economy this year. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), UBS Global Wealth Management, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) are among the big banks saying the value rally has more room to run.
Yet while surges in value stocks have heralded major U.S. economic revivals, the group has also seen false dawns over the years, with rallies fading as investors return to flashier tech-related names that powered markets during the past decade. 
This time, hopes of a value renaissance are colliding with a coronavirus resurgence that is forcing fresh lockdowns in the United States and abroad, making it difficult for even the most ardent value bulls to call a definitive shift. 
“It’s very possible you may have seen the trough in value relative to growth, and the vaccine has caused that,"" said Brent Fredberg, director, investments at value manager Brandes Investment Partners. ""But not necessarily.""
(GRAPHIC: U.S. growth stock funds vs value funds - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/VALUE/rlgpdakqqvo/chart.png) 
The strategy of scooping up cheap stocks has a broad following and counts Warren Buffett as its most prominent disciple. 
But the Russell value index has beaten its growth counterpart in only two of the past 12 years, as the U.S. economy's slow post-crisis growth and low interest rates weighed on financials and other value shares while raising the allure of tech. 
Since the market bottomed during the financial crisis in March 2009, the Russell growth index has climbed over 640% - more than doubling the gain for the value index.
Being a value manager ""has taken a lot of discipline and a lot of patience over the last decade-plus,"" said Burns McKinney, a portfolio manager in U.S. value equities at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors.
However, he added, ""No style stays out of favor forever.”
(GRAPHIC: Finding value - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/VALUE/jbyvrerbjpe/chart.png) 
The performance divergence has been particularly acute this year, with strength in stay-at-home stocks fueling a 28% rise for the Russell growth index against a nearly 7% drop for the value index.
In October, the $10 billion AJO quantitative value fund announced it was shutting, citing the longest ""drought"" on record in value.
Some investors, however, have pointed to signs a long-awaited turnaround may have arrived. 
Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group note the energy, industrial, financials and materials sectors all gained 10% or more in 10 trading days between Oct. 28 and Nov. 11. 
Past periods of similar performance ""all came either late in a recession or very early in an expansion,"" according to Bespoke.
""When you get that exceptional growth coming back into the economy, investors will start looking for value,"" Mullaney said. ""They’ll start looking for, 'Where can I buy some cheap assets?'"" 
At the same time, the valuation spread between growth and value based on forward price-to-earnings ratios reached its biggest gap on record in September. 
Similar valuation ""extremes"" occurred in 2000, just before a multi-year run of value outperformance, said Brandes' Fredberg.
Wary value veterans are watching a number of factors. They include how long it will take to distribute a vaccine widely, if the breakthrough reduces incentives for lawmakers to provide fiscal stimulus and whether some shifts to a stay-at-home economy will be permanent, said Drew Weitz, portfolio manager at Weitz Investment Management.

Whether the vaccine news is “the catalyst that creates the handoff from traditional growth to value, remains to be seen,” Weitz said.

(Reuters) - A senior General Motors Co (N:GM) executive said on Friday the No. 1 U.S. automaker and its suppliers need to avoid letting their guard down as COVID-19 cases continue to rise, adding that he is constantly worried about the human suffering and economic hardships wrought by the pandemic. 
""I just worry about everybody, I really do,"" GM President Mark Reuss told a Reuters Events broadcast. ""I worry about that every day and every night.
""I'm so worried about it because it's accelerating and it's not being contained."" 
The coronavirus pandemic forced major U.S. automakers to shutter their plants for nearly two months in the spring to slow the spread of cases. 
Detroit's automakers and the United Auto Workers union hammered out work practices that have for the most part kept the pandemic from slowing production since then.
""I think the industry in general and General Motors has done a good job in our plants,"" Reuss said. ""But I really worry about people, the death, the suffering and the unemployment that goes along with this pandemic.""
Reuss praised the automaker's supplier base for their diligence in keeping to new standards set during the pandemic to keep it from affecting production. 

""But I worry that in places that are very different from the United States, Canada or Mexico, that a relaxation of some of these (practices) would hurt the supply chain and have us not be able to run our plants,"" he said. ""I know everybody is doing the best they can but we have to keep that up.""

DUESSELDORF/BERLIN (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) is considering carving out its steel division to seek state aid from Germany's economic stabilisation fund in a bid to rescue the ailing business, a senior policymaker said on Friday.
Andreas Pinkwart, economy minister of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state and where Thyssenkrupp is based, said talks with the conglomerate over state aid were ongoing and that various options were being discussed.
""At the moment we're seeing that the company and also the labour representatives are leaning towards carving out steel and putting it under the WSF (economic stabilisation fund),"" Pinkwart said in a state parliament session.
He said the scenario was being examined by Germany's Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.
A spokeswoman for the Economy Ministry confirmed talks with Thyssenkrupp and the state of NRW, saying Altmaier had made clear his willingness to provide funds to help the steel sector in its shift towards climate-neutral production.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.
The conglomerate is looking for ways to fix its loss-making steel unit and has not ruled out seeking state aid or selling a majority of the business to a rival. Britain's Liberty Steel has made a non-binding offer for the business.
Labour union IG Metall is piling pressure on the government to bail out Germany's largest steelmaker, whose operating loss likely stood at 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in 2019/20.
Juergen Kerner, chief treasurer of IG Metall and Thyssenkrupp's deputy supervisory board chairman, said the government needed to take a stake of significantly more than 25% in the business.

A person familiar with the matter said that state aid talks with Thyssenkrupp were at an early stage. So far, five aid requests worth 6.58 billion euros have been granted by the WSF.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>","DoorDash shows surge in revenue growth, profitable quarter in IPO filing","By Anirban Sen and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - DoorDash Inc showed a surge in revenue growth in 2020 and reported a quarterly profit for the first time in its IPO filing on Friday, as the U.S. food delivery startup prepares for what is set to be one of the year's most high-profile market debuts.
The move to go public by DoorDash, which competes with Uber Eats, GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB) and Postmates Inc, follows a surge in demand for food delivery services during the COVID-19 lockdowns earlier this year.
In its IPO filing, DoorDash reported revenue of $1.92 billion for the first nine months of 2020, up more than three times from the same period a year earlier. The company reported a profit of $23 million for the first time in its history during the second quarter of 2020.
DoorDash, however, said the sudden surge in business activity this year had revealed ""material weakness"" in its financial reporting, such as inadequate accounting processes and lack of technical expertise.
In response the company said it is hiring additional accounting, engineering and business intelligence personnel, as well as conducting a review.
The startup currently has about $1.6 billion of cash and a $300 million credit facility, that will increase to $400 million after the IPO.
During the past year, SoftBank-backed DoorDash brought down its cash burn rates significantly. Net loss narrowed to $149 million for the first nine months of 2020, from $533 million during the same period a year earlier.
DoorDash, however, warned that its current pace of growth driven by lockdowns may not be sustainable, saying it expects ""growth rates in revenue, total orders, and marketplace (revenue) to decline in future periods"".
IPO FRENZY
DoorDash's filing kicks off a frenetic period for U.S. capital markets, with several high-profile names including home rental giant Airbnb, e-commerce firm Wish and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin's lending startup Affirm lined up for stock market debuts in December.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Instacart had picked  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) to lead its IPO, which could value the U.S. grocery delivery app at around $30 billion.
Silicon Valley-based Doordash, which plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 'DASH', had confidentially filed for an IPO in February, following the likes of ride-hailing firms  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), which went public last year.
DoorDash's move to go public also comes after voters in trend-setting California backed a ballot proposal by Uber and its allies that cemented the status of app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers as independent contractors and not employees.
Victory in the ballot contest allows Uber, Lyft and other consumer internet allies to set the employment terms of the gig economy that they helped create.
DoorDash, the largest U.S. third-party delivery company for restaurants, has till date raised about $3 billion and was valued at roughly $16 billion after its most recent funding round in June, according to data platform PitchBook.

Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for DoorDash's IPO.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish lenders, including Santander (MC:SAN), are increasing cost-cutting measures to cope with the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, ultra-low interest rates in the euro zone and a shift by customers towards online banking.
On Friday, two sources with knowledge of the matter said that Santander was planning to cut 4,000 jobs, or around 14% of its total workforce in its home market, and close up to 1,000 branches, around 32% of its branch offices in Spain.
At the end of September, the bank had 28,797 employees, including at its company headquarters on the outskirts of Madrid, and 3,110 branches across the country.
The sources said another 1,000 staff would move on to different jobs within its Spanish branches.
Santander declined to comment.
Though the number of branches since the financial crisis in 2008 has nearly halved, Spain is one of the countries with the highest number of branches per 100,000 adults in the world, at nearly 50, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Banks across Europe have been deepening cost cuts on stand-alone basis or through tie-ups.
Caixabank's (MC:CABK) agreed 4.3 billion euro ($5.08 billion) acquisition of its rival  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) is also expected to lead to thousands of job cuts. 
Pressure from ultra low interest rates and a change in consumer habits is also driving changes in the industry.
At Santander, almost half the sales during 2020 have been done on digital channels, a trend which has been accelerated by the pandemic. 
According to one of the sources, in two years transactions done in branches could halve.
At the end of October, Santander earmarked an extra 1 billion euros in cost savings in Europe by 2022, and said it was planning to reduce staff in Spain, Portugal, Britain and Poland..
That was on top of 1 billion euros in savings the group was planning in Europe by 2020.

Among other Spanish lenders, Sabadell (MC:SABE), the country's fifth-biggest in terms of assets, is planning to reduce costs at home, while speeding up a cost-cutting plan at its British arm TSB.

Investing.com -- U.S. st0ck markets opened higher on Friday as some solid earnings reports helped investors to look through a disturbing surge in Covid-19 cases and look ahead to the time when vaccines will be widely available to bring the pandemic under control.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 218 points, or 0.8%, at 29,298 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.8% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.9%. 
The broad move higher was in sharp contrast to the pattern for much of this week, which started with cyclicals and old-economy names benefiting at the expense of tech and growth stocks on Monday in response to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s announcement that its experimental vaccine for Covid-19 was over 90% effective. That rotation reversed over the rest of the week as markets absorbed both the challenges in getting vaccines distributed and the worsening current situation. The U.S. posted over 153,000 new cases on Thursday, a new record, while the seven-day average death rate rose to over 1,000 for the first time since August. 
Strategists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) argued however that the year ahead still looks bright for equities, as a receding Covid-19 pandemic allows for a rebound in corporate earnings.
""We expect to see a continued rotation of leadership in the markets supported by stronger growth, steeper yield curves and higher commodity prices,"" analysts led by Peter Oppenheimer said in a note to clients. While they tried not to sound too bearish on tech and growth stocks, they noted that ""record valuation spreads and an inflection point in growth and bond yields point to a period of outperformance of Cyclical and Value areas of the markets,""
Among the early movers, networking gear maker Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock rose 7.0% on the back of better-than-expected results for its fiscal first quarter and the promise that it would snap a year-long streak of falling revenues in the current quarter.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), which like Cisco reported earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, also rose, albeit by a more modest 2.3%, after its quarterly numbers were rescued by a strong performance from its Disney+ streaming unit. Lower box office revenues and capacity-constrained theme parks still made for a second straight quarterly loss, however.
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) stock rose 7.0% after the sport betting company said its monthly users passed the 1 million mark for the first time in the last quarter. 
There was little reaction to data released earlier showing that producer prices had increased more rapidly than expected in October, with most of the increase coming through food prices. The producer price index rose 0.3% on the month, but the core PPI that excludes food and energy rose only 0.1%. The Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for November meanwhile fell for the first time in three months.
Other notable gainers were the ADRs of Chinese makers of electric vehicles, in the wake of new policy goals set by Beijing that seeks to ban the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles from 2035.
Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Nio (NYSE:NIO) ADRs both gained 11%, to be up 43% and 29% respectively for the week. Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI)ADRs rose 20% to be up 47% for the week. Some of the money flowing into those stocks appears to have come from Tesla holders. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock on course to end the week down 5.0%."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said he has had no contact with President-elect Joe Biden's coronavirus transition team and sees no reason to quit to join that effort when there is so much to do now to fight the surging pandemic.
""I stay in my lane. I'm not a politician. I do public health things,"" he said in an interview on Thursday ahead of next week's Reuters Total Health conference.
Since January, Fauci has served on President Donald Trump's White House Coronavirus Task Force, a position that has frequently put him at odds with the president, who has sought to downplay the pandemic and focused instead on opening the economy.
""There's absolutely no reason and no sense at all for me to stop doing something in the middle of a pandemic that is playing a major role in helping us get out of the pandemic,"" Fauci said.
His advice for the president-elect, he said, is ""exactly the same"" as what he is recommending now - social distancing, avoiding crowds, wearing masks, washing hands. ""Public health principles don't change from one month to another or from one administration to another.""
Fauci has served six administrations and came to prominence fighting the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan.
His ""day job"" is developing vaccines and therapeutics as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, work that is starting to bear fruit.
On Monday,  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) announced that their experimental coronavirus vaccine was more than 90% effective - significantly higher than most experts had anticipated.
 Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA), a company developing a similar vaccine with support from the White House's Operation Warp Speed program, is expected to report results from their late-stage vaccine trial in the next week or so.
Both vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, an entirely new rapid vaccine platform that uses synthetic genes to trigger an immune response. Older methods typically use some form of inactivated or killed virus particles.
""It was a home run for the Pfizer product, more than 90% - close to 95% - effective. I have every reason to believe that the Moderna product is going to be similar,"" Fauci said.
""It's an almost identical platform to the Pfizer vaccine, so I would not be surprised at all if it was highly effective,"" Fauci added. 
The next big question about mRNA technology is safety. Fauci took as a good sign the fact that neither the Pfizer trial, which has enrolled more than 43,000 people so far, nor the Moderna trial, which involves 30,000, had to pause to investigate safety issues. 
""That's really good news,"" he said. People in both trials will be followed for two years to make sure there are no long-term side effects. Barring that, ""I think that the mRNA platform is here to stay,"" he predicted.
In spite of the high bar set by the Pfizer vaccine so far, Fauci said he believes there is still ""plenty of room for multiple vaccines, even though there may be a modest degree of difference in total efficacy.""

CHICAGO/LISBON (Reuters) - When rumors first began to circulate that the UK would go back into lockdown, Leanne Barnes despaired as bread and toilet roll flew off the shelves again at her local supermarket. But to her surprise, shelves were back to being fully stocked within a few days.
Barnes stocked her pantry last time around with a few additional comfort foods - macaroni cheese, ravioli, soup and spaghetti. But as of last week, she said she felt no urge to stockpile goods.
So far, consumers haven't returned to the sort of panic buying frenzy that sent packaged-food manufacturers scrambling earlier this year.
At the same time, major food companies – including  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB), Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) and McCormick & Co (N:MKC) – told Reuters or have said publicly that they have taken measures like changing their production, packaging or pricing so retailers can keep shelves stocked. 
Their steps include expanding manufacturing, hiring more workers, re-routing products from restaurants to grocery stores, and turning to bigger pack sizes. Many of their moves came at a high financial cost.
Economists say shoppers realize they can’t afford to overspend, and therefore, aren’t likely to make binge purchases.
Consumers are more likely to hold back from stockpiling goods - even with significant price-promotions on offer – because the economy is weak and they want to conserve financial resources, according to Benny Mantin, director of the Luxembourg Centre of Logistics and Supply Chain Management.
A Reuters analysis of a basket of goods shows shoppers are buying far less in the United States and Europe than they did earlier this year at the start of the first round of lockdowns.
(Click here for graphics on consumer spending patterns in the United States https://tmsnrt.rs/2IvYJkk, Germany https://tmsnrt.rs/3lDqtCl and the United Kingdom https://tmsnrt.rs/36yzbew.)
Yet for consumer companies, the financial consequences of quickly ramping up production have been severe.
Beyond Meat’s (O:BYND) third-quarter sales growth slowed and the company on Monday posted a $19.3 million net loss, partly due to higher expenses from retooling its supply chain to meet grocery demand earlier this year, and what it described as less “retail stockpiling” during the quarter.
Spice maker McCormick's costs have shot up in the last two quarters and are expected by Refinitiv to rise even more in the current one. 
“I'd say that today, our supply chain is so much more resilient than it was at the beginning of the year,” McCormick's Chief Executive Lawrence Kurzius told Reuters in October.
Kurzius said the company has had to de-prioritize products like some gluten-free spices in favor of popular comfort ingredients like pumpkin-pie spice and taco seasoning. “I'm not trying to tempt fate by saying that, but I think McCormick, as well as our industry as a whole, is in a much better place.”
Next month, Prego pasta sauce owner Campbell Soup is expected to report an increase in operating expenses, its first in five quarters, according to Refinitiv. Campbell - which has sacrificed some products to focus on more popular ones, such as chicken or tomato soup - spent more on sanitation and labor in its most recent quarter and invested $40 million in a new Goldfish cracker plant in September. 
Campbell CEO Mark Clouse told Reuters the company has upped outsourcing of production of soup and some snacks to third-party manufacturers – or “co-packers” - to meet any unexpected demand quickly.
“There will be enough soup for the winter,” he said. “You’ll see a shelf that feels fuller than what you might have seen back in March as we’ve worked closely with retailers to make sure we get assortments right.”
Other companies grappling with higher manufacturing costs include Procter & Gamble (N:PG), which has been making Charmin products at record levels this year and has hired more workers to keep lines running 24/7. 
Rival Kimberly-Clark (N:KMB), the world’s biggest toilet paper maker, is also seeing higher manufacturing and distribution costs, while Clorox (N:CLX) said this month that it is “investing significantly” in third-party suppliers and getting products to retailers faster.
Companies including Kraft Heinz are also running factories 24/7 and making bigger, more affordable pack sizes of products. 
“Affordability is a rising concern, which should be a benefit to those companies that are fast to adapt,” said Miguel Patricio, CEO of Kraft Heinz which is seeing more demand for 12-pack Mac & Cheese and bigger bottles of ketchup.
Patricio told Reuters Kraft Heinz has increased U.S. third-party manufacturing by 20%, and its own production by 20-25%. Kellogg (NYSE:K) said the company has plans to invest in “significant capacity” as it enters 2021.

McCormick’s Kurzius said it, too, struck more deals with co-packers, changed factory shifts to run 24/7 and hired 400 U.S. manufacturing workers to increase capacity. “We've added the equivalent of a whole new manufacturing center to meet this year’s surge in demand,” Kurzius said.

In Europe, too, the number of hospitalisations are now higher than at the peak of the first wave and officials said measures to control infections must continue.
In a sign of the air of caution surrounding the continent, Spanish central bank governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos and European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel said although the prospect of an effective vaccine was a relief, the euro zone was still set to suffer from new curbs on economic activity to combat a rise in infections.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that progress in developing a coronavirus vaccine was welcome news but near-term economic risks remain, underscoring the likely need for additional government stimulus.
World stocks are up 1.4% for the week, however. They reached record highs on Monday when pharma giant  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) announced its vaccine had been effective in 90% of cases during trials. Russia followed up by reporting its vaccine trial, too, had shown promise.
European markets lost 0.1% to 0.7% on Friday, but the STOXX pan-regional index is set for a second week of big gains. It's up 5% so far this week as the vaccine news induces more investors to buy shares in banks and travel firms.
Earlier, Chinese blue-chips lost 1% after the Trump administration said it would ban U.S. investments in firms linked to the Chinese military. A series of high-profile bond defaults by state-owned enterprises also weighed. 
Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.57%.
Some investors saw the pullback as a buying opportunity.
""My view is this is the dark just before dawn,"" said Michael Frazis, portfolio manager at Frazis Capital Partners in Sydney.
""You've got the second wave of coronavirus, new sets of shutdowns, clear problems around the world, travel dropping off again ... But at the same time, we have the strongest possible evidence that we do have a vaccine.""
STIMULUS 
One sticking point for markets has been the inability of U.S. lawmakers to agree an adequate spending package. The need for this stimulus was highlighted by Thursday data showing a slower pace of jobs recovery and weak inflation.
While Democrats in Congress urged negotiations over a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus plan, top Republicans rejected that as too expensive.
U.S. Treasury yields slid further, with 10-year yields slightly lower at 0.88%, well off the seven-and-a-half month high of 0.98% hit on Monday. 
The yield curve, a gauge of growth and inflation expectations, has flattened, too.
""That got a further nudge from the softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data for October which were released yesterday, and which tally with a weaker economic reality,"" ING Bank analysts said, referring to the snapback in bond yields.
The cautious tone taken by European policymakers supported the perception that progress on the vaccine will not stop central banks from delivering more stimulus.
Germany's 10-year yield slipped 1.5 bps at -0.54%, moving off this week's two-month highs.

Oil prices remained on track for a second week of gains, but the COVID-19 surge and higher U.S. crude stockpiles pushed Brent futures 0.9% lower to $43.17 a barrel.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 08:21AM ET</span>",U.S. life insurers face questions about risk after Fed report,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. life insurers face questions about their ability to cover a sudden rush of claims after the Federal Reserve highlighted liquidity and leverage risks in a report this week.
Issues the Fed focused on are not new: Life insurers have for years been stocking up on assets that are hard to sell and adding debt that expires relatively quickly to boost investment returns, which have been hit by low interest rates.
The Fed noted that life insurers are more leveraged and face a bigger liquidity gap between illiquid assets and liquid liabilities than they have since the 2007-09 financial crisis. Based on assets to equity, life insurers appear riskier than property and casualty insurers, banks and broker-dealers, the Fed said.
When the Fed highlights an industry in its biannual financial stability report, investors and analysts take notice. That is especially true now, as the industry frets about whether President-elect Joe Biden could slap the ""systemically important financial institution"" (SIFI) label on them once again.
Being a SIFI means a company's failure threatens the economy, and therefore warrants tighter regulation. MetLife Inc (N:MET), Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) and American International Group Inc (N:AIG) got that designation removed in recent years after shrinking and de-risking their balance sheets and, in MetLife's case, suing the government.
Though insurance executives recently assured Wall Street that their capital and liquidity levels are solid under regulatory requirements, the Fed's conclusions are hard to ignore, analysts said.
""From the vantage point of having to dispose of something quickly, it might be a little more challenging,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Andrew Kligerman. ""But these companies are doing a fine job of matching the duration of assets and liabilities.""
Credit analysts noted that life insurers have more capital than before the financial crisis and have increased their cash liquidity by borrowing and by reducing dividends and share buybacks this year in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Life insurers take premiums from customers and invest them to generate income. When interest rates are low, it becomes harder to do that with safe, liquid investments like Treasury bonds.
Over the past decade, the industry has weighted more of its investments in long-term and less easily sold assets like corporate bonds, commercial real estate and alternative assets to generate more income. At the same time, life insurers have boosted borrowing from short-term funding sources, like Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which are cheaper than other types of loans, to earn additional income.
That imbalance could harm life insurers' ability to handle sudden claims, according to the Fed, but analysts said the companies are handling their balance sheets prudently.
""They're utilizing their balance sheets to augment their investment returns. That's appropriate,"" said Rosemarie Mirabella of AM Best, a credit rating agency focused on insurers.
The Fed report put life insurers alongside hedge funds as having elevated leverage. It included a chart showing a measure of leverage at life insurers being nearly four times that of property and casualty insurers, based on assets to equity.
Another set of charts showed life insurers having 35% of assets in ""illiquid, risky"" investments, while short-term funding sources took up a bigger chunk of their liabilities.

Even so, analysts were reassured by third-quarter results that showed major U.S. life insurers having adequate financial measures.

1438,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Home Prices Are In a Bubble. Full Stop.,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Rapidly rising housing prices in the U.S. has led to talk of another housing bubble like the one that helped trigger the financial crisis a little more than a decade ago. Consider that the Case-Shiller National Home Price index has gained in excess of 6% per year on average since January 2012, while net rental income has barely kept up with inflation, increasing just less than 2% per year. The result is that home prices seem as overvalued as they were in the spring of 2005, nine months before the peak.
One way to measure home valuations is with a cyclically adjusted price to earnings (CAPE) ratio developed by Yale University professor and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller for stocks  The concept can be applied to a broad swath of assets by dividing the current price of an asset by the average annual inflation-adjusted earnings(3) over the prior 10 years. 
Stock valuations soared in the late 1990s, only to crash from 2000 – 2002, tread water for six years, then tumble again in 2008. Home valuations ignored the 2000 equity crash, but shared the 2008 crash. Since then the two have increased roughly in line, but with home prices starting from a higher level. As a result, equity valuations are still well below peak values, but home prices are approaching the historic highs.
Much of the focus on the housing market lately has centered on the short-term environment, with the low inventory of homes cited for rising prices and a jump in rental vacancy rates driving rents lower. But if the concern is the possibility of major economic disruption—rather than just whether houses are good investments at current prices— the focus should be on long-term macroeconomics. Sure, real estate prices always drift up or down, and differ by location and type of home. A bubble in housing requires widespread overvaluation over years, which is what we have witnessed.
Home valuations are worrisome, but for different reasons than 2006. One minor point of comfort is the run-up from 1996 – 2006 displayed a classic bubble pattern of accelerating price increases near the peak. The increase in valuations since 2012 has been linear, with no sign of steepening.
A bigger difference is illustrated in the chart below, showing the CAPE ratio for housing versus 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields (these correlate with mortgage rates, but are a better predictor of home prices statistically). In both 1996 – 2002 (grey dots) and 2014 – 2020 (white dots) home values linearly decreased with interest rates, at about an 8% decline in valuations for every 100 basis-point increase in yields. This is in line with longer history. But during the 2003 – 2013 bubble and crash (blue dots), there was a much steeper relation in the opposite direction—higher home values associated with higher yields.
The reason for the reversal during the housing bubble was capital rushing into mortgages via structured investment products, insulating home buyers from paying higher rates. More than half of new mortgages were adjustable with low teaser rates divorced from economic reality. Today, less than 10% of new mortgages have adjustable rates, according to data from  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). In 2005, investors were pushing mortgage originators to prod home buyers into paying higher prices by providing them with easy access to funds. This was not a price increase driven by demand for housing. The bubble popped for financial reasons, not housing reasons, and—unlike previous waves of mortgage defaults—it brought much of the financial system down with it.
Today’s high valuations can be explained by low interest rates, as has been the usual pattern in the past. That might lead one to expect a typical correction, where housing prices deflate over a few years with differences among regions. Many homeowners are hurt in places where prices were especially high, and also in places with especially bad economic problems, but nationally diversified mortgage securities follow historic trends and financial institutions deal with losses seamlessly. Homeowners who can wait out the decline will see valuations increase above their purchase prices in five years or so.
The bad news is all previous history came at higher mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell below 3% for the first time in August 2020, and rates are close to the lowest possible levels given the credit risk and costs of writing mortgages. It’s one thing to be a peak valuation, it’s another to be at peak valuation with no discernable upside.
It’s implausible that housing prices can go up from here without large increases in rents, which require increases in demand for housing. That’s an unlikely outcome in a recession. If the recession continues, where will new demand come from? If it ends, interest rates go up, pushing housing prices down.
The good news is this is not a disaster market. There’s no evidence home price declines could threaten the financial system, nor create mass economic distress as we saw after 2007. No doubt there remain plenty of bargains in regions with robust economies where prices have not overheated. The bad news is there’s a lot more downside than upside for average homebuyers, and some of them are very likely to suffer in 2021.
(1) One interpretation of CAPE is how many years it takes to earn your purchase price back, adjusted for inflation, assuming earnings increase with inflation.
(2) Earnings for public companies come from their financial reports. “Earnings” for home buying consist of the net rental income—rent minus expenses—received by a landlord or the monthly savings of a homeowner relative to a renter. In the latter case we include expenses like property taxes, maintenance and insurance, but not mortgage payments, which are a financing cost. The home price CAPEs given here are my calculations from Consumer Expenditure Surveys and Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.
(3) One caution is the S&P500 CAPE is based on clear published values, but “earnings” from home ownership have to be estimated from survey data. Everyone agrees on the S&P500 CAPE, but different analysts come up with different CAPEs for housing. Nevertheless, I think the relative values are reliable—the home price CAPEs might be over or underestimated relative to stocks, but the 2020 values should be consistent with the 2006 values. Another caution is that real estate data is smoothed and lagged. If we better home price and cost data, the housing CAPE would look more jagged like the S&P 500 CAPE.

1439,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>","Dow Futures Rise 194 Pts; Disney, Cisco Earnings Impress","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening firmly higher Friday, rebounding after Thursday’s losses, helped by some positive corporate earnings while the country continues to struggle with record-high numbers of coronavirus cases.
The United States recorded over 159,000 cases on Thursday, a new record. This has prompted major cities, like Boston, New York, and Chicago, to announce new restrictions and curfews to try and stem the rise.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell noted Thursday, in a panel discussion, that the economy was still in difficulty even given the optimism surrounding the development of a potential vaccine by U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
At 7:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), the Dow Futures contract rose 194 points, or 0.7%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.7%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 80 points, or 0.7%. 
On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1%, or 317 points, the S&P 500closed down 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7%, the worst trading day for these cash indices so far in November.
Helping the tone Friday were some strong earnings, released after the close Thursday. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) soared in after hours trading on an upbeat revenue forecast for the current period, while Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) also jumped as it reported a smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter loss, benefiting from a surge in streaming subscribers.
The earnings news continues Friday, albeit slowly, with sports betting operator DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) offering up third quarter earnings before the open. Its shares are up almost 300% year-to-date.
Financial data company Factset reported last week that with the majority of companies in the S&P 500 having already reported, 86% have recorded a positive EPS surprise. This would mark the highest percentage of S&P 500 companies reporting a positive EPS surprise since the company began tracking this metric in 2008. 
Economic data Friday centers around October’s producer prices and the University of Michigan's preliminary look at consumer sentiment for November.
Oil prices weakened Friday, weighed by a surprise jump in U.S. crude stockpiles as coronavirus infections continued to rise at an alarming pace, prompting a tightening of restrictions.
American crude inventories rose by 4.28 million barrels last week, compared with an expected fall of just under one million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration released Thursday. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $40.49 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.2% to $4.02. Both contracts are still up close to 9% this week.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,880.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1813.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Analysis: Surprise defaults may slow global stampede into China bonds,"By Tom Westbrook and Scott Murdoch
SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A smattering of high-profile Chinese debt defaults this week may give bullish foreign investors pause and likely dampen the debt sales outlook, bankers and analysts said, as a bond market selloff revived worries about flaky government support.
State-owned miner Yongcheng Coal and Electricity Holding Group surprised investors and sparked a regulatory probe by defaulting this week on debt obligations just three weeks after it raised a billion yuan ($151 million).
That follows, among other wobbles, stress at property developer China  Evergrande  (HK:3333), a trading halt in Tsinghua Unigroup bonds after a debt warning, and the high-profile default last month of BMW partner Huachen Automotive Group.
Spooked traders dumped local debt and sold banking stocks exposed to it on Friday and analysts said the spillover could take some of the heat out of a headlong rush into Chinese debt.
""It just shows market confidence in government support is very shaky, and people are a bit more unsure now, more so than at the beginning of the year,"" said Judy Kwok-Cheung, a fixed income analyst in Hong Kong at the Bank of Singapore.
""We're still trying to gauge how much support is there still and which kind of entities they will support. We're really watching the market closely now to see who the government will support and who they won't.""
Investors have dived into to both sovereign and corporate Chinese debt this year. Some global investors have been particularly bullish on company paper as Chinese firms have paid better yields than similarly-rated U.S. or European debt, even as China has led the global COVID-19 recovery.
Yet, as the rebound has slowed and proven uneven, previously cast-aside risks about high debt loads, fickle cash flows and confusion over the level of state backing have resurfaced.
""When the dust has settled ... I think this kind of weakness is exposed again, and that's why you see more default cases,"" said Ivan Chung, associate managing director, corporate finance, at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) in Hong Kong.
PRIMARY PAUSE
Market wobbles together with a government push to de-leverage debt-laden property developers are also likely to keep a lid on primary issuance in the remainder of an already lean year.
Chinese high-yield bonds, mostly sold by developers, accounted for 5.4% of the global high-yield market for the year so far, Refinitiv data shows, the smallest proportion since 2017.
""Is the surfacing of credit stress a concern? Definitely it is,"" said Clifford Lee, global head of fixed income at Singapore's DBS Bank. It would not freeze the market for now, he said, but issuers are hunkering down.
""The thinking is that (issuers) are in better shape and are able to access cash, so ... should not be facing a cash strain in a rush,"" said another debt banker in Hong Kong, who requested anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to media.
To be sure, $40 billion in Chinese high-yield dollar bonds have been issued this year and some investors will welcome both a shakeout and regulatory scrutiny to strengthen the market.
But the latest clutch of defaults, which Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) noted are bigger and include more state-owned enterprises than last year, highlights that close attention is needed to avoid being caught in the credit cleanup.
""China property high-yield continues to be one of our favored sectors,"" said Goldman analysts Kenneth Ho and Chakki Ting in a note. ""But managing idiosyncratic risks is likely to be key.""

1442,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",StockBeat: TFW You and Covid-19 Both Want a Lockdown-Free Christmas,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- What price Christmas?
The unspoken – and in some cases explicit – aim of many measures enacted in Europe in recent weeks was to ensure that families could hold their traditional Christmas and New Year rituals free from the oppressive hand of lockdown and social distancing.
But the continent is in a race against time: while there are signs that infection curves are falling, or at least flattening, in most major markets, governments are refusing to be drawn into a premature relaxation of restrictions.
The trouble is that what governments and electorates wish for - a restriction-free Christmas and new year - is also what the virus itself most desires.
The uncomfortable reality is that most people’s idea of the holiday season in Europe is a glorified sequence of superspreader events: the office party, shopping in crowded malls, the seasonal drinking, the big family get-together and, not least, church services. The possibilities for infection are beyond counting.
Governments have been here before. Earlier in the year, they moved heaven and earth to let the summer tourist season take place as close to normally as possible, knowing that public consent to the lockdowns of spring was limited, and anxious to give people hope in a return to normal life.
However, those efforts largely unravelled as the virus immediately began to spread through crowded planes, bars and tourist attractions. The result of that is the second wave now spreading through Europe.
Whether governments now indulge the public’s desire for freedom or keep the restrictions in place could have a significant impact on many European companies: drinks companies will surely suffer, whether distillers like  Diageo  (LON:DGE) and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) or soft drinks specialists like Fevertree (LON:FEVR) and Coca Cola’s European bottling operation HBC (LON:CCH).
Brewers and pub and restaurant operators like Marston’s (LON:MARS) will face particular challenges: Christmas drinks and lunches will be cancelled, not postponed, and while you might still give a loved one a bottle of champagne or whisky for Christmas, you probably aren’t going to give them a six-pack of Heineken (OTC:HEINY) or Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY). At least, we hope you’re not.
For the supermarkets and foot retailers too, scaled-down Christmas dinners are bad news. Less footfall will continue to mean fewer impulse purchases.
However, this need not translate 1-for-1 into lower overall spending, and this is the important point, given that some 20% of retail sales come in the six weeks before Christmas.
Logically, the money saved on all of the above can be redirected to other spending: a slightly better piece of jewellery, (Pandora (OTC:PANDY) and Richemont (SIX:CFR)), classier chocolate selections (Lindt & Spruengli AG (SIX:LISN), Hotel Chocolat (LON:HOTC)) or other higher-value consumer durables. Corporate reports from the second quarter showed a recognizable pattern of indulgence on small luxuries, and the urge to make up for a Christmas spoiled in some respects by lockdowns will surely find its way into expressing itself.  
The holiday season is sure to be different, but for stocks it isn’t predestined to be a washout."

""The legal actions initiated today form part of Nissan's policy of holding Ghosn accountable for the harm and financial losses incurred by the company due to (his) misconduct,"" Nissan said in a statement.
Ghosn, who also ran French carmaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), has been in Lebanon since January after fleeing Japan before he was due to stand trial. He denies any wrongdoing. 
Prosecutors, who arrested Ghosn two years ago, have charged him with hiding 9.3 billion yen ($88.6 million) in compensation, enriching himself at Nissan's expense through $5 million payments to a Middle East car dealership and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to the automaker's books.
The ""Nissan civil lawsuit is an extension to the extremely unreasonable internal investigation with sinister intent by a portion of Nissan’s senior management and the unreasonable arrests and indictments by the public prosecutors,"" Ghosn said in an emailed statement.
Ghosn, who has said he was removed from Nissan to thwart any merger with Renault, which already owns 43% of the Japanese carmaker, was represented in the Yokohama court by lawyers. 
The civil proceeding got underway as the criminal trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly, who is accused of helping Ghosn hide his earnings, continued at a court in Tokyo.
Kelly, who has lived in Japan since his release on bail almost two years ago, also denies any wrongdoing. Nissan, which is also a defendant in that trial, has pleaded guilty. If found guilty, Kelly could face up to ten years in prison and a 10 million yen fine. The conviction rate in Japan is around 99%. 

Nissan is drawing back from the business expansion undertaken under Ghosn. On Thursday, it trimmed its full-year operating loss forecast as a rebound in auto demand in China and elsewhere helped boost sales.

Sources close to the matter told Reuters this week that Europe's largest tour operator was in talks with the German government on up to 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in state aid because two earlier bailouts have proved insufficient.
""At the moment we cannot and must not exclude any option, not even that we need additional loans,"" Chief Executive Friedrich Joussen told German magazine Der Spiegel in an interview published on Friday. 
""Nor can we rule out the possibility of raising new equity or selling parts of the company at an appropriate time.""
The Hanover-based group's revenue collapsed in its third quarter, tumbling by 98% because of coronavirus travel restrictions. It has cut costs by 70% and has already called on 3 billion euros of government support in one form or another. 
TUI had assets that would be of interest to investors, such as hotels and real estate, Joussen said. 
""We could bundle part of that in property funds, thus rising hidden reserves,"" he said, adding that there will be no emergency sales.
The CEO said he has great hopes that business can recover quickly once a COVID-19 vaccine is available.
U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and German partner BioNTech (O:BNTX) on Monday released data showing that their vaccine was 90% effective in a large clinical trial, lifting hopes that inoculations could start early next year.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.3% after jumping earlier this week on optimism around a working COVID-19 vaccine. The index has gained about 12% in the past two weeks, also buoyed by hopes of calmer global trade under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden.
""For all the optimism about a successful vaccine, the reality is that a possible candidate was never likely to be able to stop what is currently playing out across Europe in terms of a sharp rise in coronavirus infections and hospitalisations,"" said Michael Hewson, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn said it was too early to say whether restrictions imposed last week would need to be extended beyond November, while French Prime Minister Jean Castex said there would be no easing for at least two weeks.
German shares (GDAXI) dropped 0.2%, while France's CAC 40 index (FCHI) was flat after having risen to an eight-month high earlier this week.
Despite rallying more than 40% since a coronavirus-driven crash in March, the STOXX 600 is down about 7% this year on concerns that the second round of lockdowns would threaten a nascent economic recovery. The U.S. S&P 500, in contrast, has risen 9.5% so far in 2020.
With the euro zone likely heading back into recession this quarter, the European Central Bank has already said it would provide more stimulus in December.

1447,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 04:09AM ET</span>",Biden Will Need to Talk Tech and Tax to Fix Ties With Europe,"(Bloomberg) -- From NATO to climate change, the relationship between the U.S. and Europe is in dire need of a reboot after four years of President Donald Trump’s abrasive “America First” policies.
Technology—covering 5G networks, digital taxation, privacy rules, cross border data flows and more—may not be the most obvious place to start fixing a transatlantic security alliance formed before the dawn of the Internet. But as Joe Biden heads to the White House, it’s arguably the most urgent, if difficult.
The spread of Covid-19 has underscored as never before the dominant role tech companies will play in driving future economic growth, determining the balance of power with China and filling the gaping holes that the pandemic has torn in government budgets either side of the Atlantic.
The U.S. struggle to persuade European governments to follow its lead with blanket bans on Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. from 5G networks drew headlines, yet other tech disputes—over how to regulate intercontinental data transfers, or who gets to tax the overseas profits of U.S. tech giants—are just as consequential. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). became the latest target this week of European Union competition regulators.
If they’re to meet a rising challenge from China, the Americans and Europeans need to cooperate, set common standards and resolve their tax and other differences, according to Bruce Stokes, director of a transatlantic task force set up by the German Marshall Fund, a think tank based in Washington and Brussels.
“This is the next big crisis in transatlantic relations,” Stokes said. “To be successful in this future technological environment you need brains, money and market, and alone neither the U.S. nor Europe has enough brains, money and market to compete with the Chinese going forward.”
Take the distribution of tech company users, the source of big-data streams so valuable that some have called them the crude oil of the future. Only 235 million, or fewer than 10% of Facebook’s approximately 2.74 billion monthly active users are in the U.S., making international markets essential to the company’s data pool. By contrast, well over 90% of WeChat’s roughly 1.2 billion users live in China.
“If the Teslas of the world are not working with Europe they will have a big market that will disappear,” said Lise Fuhr, director general of the European Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association. “It is still a big, well-educated and diverse market that’s hard to ignore.”
Even so, tech has become a major point of transatlantic division. The Trump administration twice walked away from talks aimed at creating new international rules for setting taxes on trade in digital services, while at the same time threatening a trade war if France, the U.K. or others followed through with plans to set their own.
Finding a new legal framework for transatlantic data transfers is even more urgent, according to Jean-Marc Leclerc, vice-chair of the American Chamber of Commerce in the EU’s Digital Economy Committee.
The European Court of Justice in July struck down the 2015 U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework for data transfers, in a case that turned on whether the agreement protected the privacy rights of Facebook’s 400 million-plus European users when the company moved their data to servers in the U.S., where protections are weaker. The answer was no.
“It’s extremely important for us,” said Leclerc. “Most of the economy relies on data flows these days, so we are trying to help both sets of governments to find a long-term solution.”
Hitting a transatlantic reset can’t happen until at least January, when Biden is sworn in, and then it won’t be easy. For one thing, there’s no snapback to a time before Trump, especially amid growing calls for so-called “digital sovereignty” in Europe that would reduce dependence on the U.S.
With the exception of 5G and digital tax, the Trump administration didn’t pay much attention to tech in its dealings with the EU for the last four years, but Europe did. The EU prepared new regulations including a Digital Services Act that could impact U.S. companies and further complicate the relationship, according to Fran Burwell, a fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.
Biden will take time to get a team and strategy in place and is likely to be more attentive to the concerns of America’s big tech companies than was Trump. His ability to cut international deals also could be limited by a Senate that’s expected to remain in Republican control. All of which could create the temptation to focus on more traditional transatlantic areas for cooperation.
“They need to be talking right away, because the European train is moving,” Burwell said of leaders in Brussels and Washington. “These digital issues are not a technical backwater anymore. We are talking about the resilience of our systems.”
Biden has made it clear that he sees restoring alliances as a priority. Meanwhile, “companies on both sides are already working together and governments at a less senior level are already working together,” said James Lewis, a former U.S. official at the departments of State and Commerce who now runs the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington.
One example, according to Lewis, is OpenRAN, a telecoms project to broaden access to the Internet being led by U.S., Japanese and European companies. “It’s the reaction to China that will drive them together,” he said.
Still, the U.S. penchant for imposing sanctions even on allies began before Trump and is seen in Europe as a long-term threat to its sovereignty over banking, trade and foreign policy. The dominance of American tech companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon has added to this sense of over-dependence.
In response, the EU started a European Cloud Initiative designed to “secure Europe’s place in the global data-driven economy.” A report by the Brussels-based European Council of Foreign Relations proposed the creation of 11 new tools to strengthen Europe’s economic sovereignty, including a digital currency to obscure the visibility of European financial transactions to the U.S., and an export bank to help European companies trade without fear of U.S. sanctions.
“These are not instruments that you would like to use,’’ but they’ve become necessary, Carl Bildt, Sweden’s former prime minister, said at the report’s publication in October. “I would declare a digital emergency for Europe if I see how we are lagging behind the Americans and the Chinese.”"

Investing.com - European stock markets largely weakened Friday, as optimism surrounding a potential Covid vaccine dissipates in the face of increasing numbers of coronavirus infections and the prospect of more economic pain.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.6%, while the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%. 
The United States has reported fresh daily records for new Covid-19 case hospitalizations this week, and the news in Europe is - at least in parts - equally grim. 
The U.K. reported 33,470 new cases on Thursday, the highest daily total to date, while Italy and Germany are struggling to flatten their infection curves. However, there have been clear successes in bringing down infection rates in Spain, the Low Countries and especially Ireland.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde cautioned Thursday that the region’s economy still faced difficult times despite U.S. pharma giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) reporting strong efficacy numbers earlier this week for the potential Covid vaccine it is developing, alongside Germany's BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX).
""From a huge river of uncertainty, we see the other side now,"" Lagarde said in a panel discussion. ""But I don't want to be exuberant about this vaccination because there is still uncertainty"" about the production and distribution of the vaccine.
Investors will look at the latest iteration of the third-quarter European growth figures later in the session, after the first estimate showed seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 12.7% in the euro area and by 12.1% in the EU, compared with the previous quarter.
In corporate news, EDF (PA:EDF) stock fell 0.4% after the French power group posted a decline in third-quarter revenue as the pandemic sapped electricity demand.
French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) also noted a drop in operating income and revenue in the third quarter as it took a hit from the pandemic, but its stock rose 3.8%.
Oil prices weakened Friday, weighed by a surprise jump in U.S. crude stockpiles as coronavirus infections continued to rise at an alarming pace, prompting a tightening of restrictions on economic and social lift from California to Chicago and New York. The governors of Ohio, Iowa and Utah - all Republicans - all issued mask-wearing mandates.
American crude inventories rose by 4.28 million barrels, compared with an expected fall of just under one million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration on Thursday. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $40.55 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $43.07. Both contracts are still up close to 9% this week after the jump inspired by the Pfizer vaccine news earlier in the week.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,878.00/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1816.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hong Kong plans new 'code of conduct' for equity and debt deals - sources,"By Scott Murdoch and Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's markets regulator plans to unveil new guidelines for investment banks working on equity and debt offerings that will include a framework for how they charge clients, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has asked banks to give feedback on several aspects of how transactions work by Friday, the sources said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media.
While the SFC has several sets of guidelines governing how banks and brokers handle transactions, it is seeking to frame a detailed code of conduct for capital raisings for the first time as part of recent efforts to tighten supervision.
As part of the latest move, the regulator wants to create a proper framework setting out how and when the fees investment banks charge for managing equity and debt issuances, should be calculated, two sources with direct knowledge said.
Remuneration for banks can depend on various performance measures including how a company stock trades after listing.
The SFC is also considering whether underwriting syndicates should be finalised earlier to limit banks not involved in a deal from pitching shares to investors in an attempt to get a role, said the two sources with direct knowledge.
The SFC declined to comment. 
The market has been hit by a string of scandals involving investment banks and companies in the last couple of years, and as Hong Kong looks to burnish its credentials as a global fundraising hub. 
Companies have raised $36 billion in Hong Kong in initial public offerings (IPOs) and secondary listings so far this year, according to Refinitiv data, ranking its exchange second globally behind Nasdaq.
Hong Kong is also a regional debt issuance hub. 
However, regulators are concerned about possible loopholes in the fundraising processes. The SFC said last year it was conducting a review into book-building - how banks take in orders for equity or bond deals and allocate them to investors.
It was not clear whether the code of conduct was linked to the review. 
The SFC is also considering adjusting rules for allocating shares to cornerstone investors, a Hong Kong phenomenon where large investors can receive a guaranteed tranche of shares in an IPO and hold them for at least six months, the sources said. 
The proposals have received a mixed reception. 
""If I could find out how much fees we're earning 24 hours after pricing that would be much better than waiting for up to three months like we do now in some cases,"" said one of the sources, a debt banker. 
However, they were less welcoming of other parts of the proposals, fearing they would undermine competitiveness.

A Hong Kong capital markets lawyer with direct knowledge of the matter said implementing a code of conduct ""absolutely adds to the burden"" of carrying out ECM (equity capital market) deals in Hong Kong.

1450,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 03:09AM ET</span>",South Korea Sounds Alarm on Stock Market Bubble Amid Retail Boom,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea issued a warning over signs of a bubble in the nation’s stock market, one of the world’s top performers this year amid a record surge in retail investing spurred by easy money and pandemic free time.
“It’s true that signs of an unstable bubble have been seen in the stock market under the current excessive liquidity situation,” said Kim Sang-jo, the country’s chief policy secretary, at a parliamentary hearing Friday. “Individual investors with a lack of investment knowledge could suffer losses in the future.”
His comment followed remarks by ruling party lawmaker Hong Sungkook on the recent performance of Ssangyong Cement Industrial Co.’s preferred shares, which rallied 137% in October, even after the firm announced plans to delist them through a buyback that concludes today. Trading in the company’s common stock has been halted since Wednesday, when the preference shares stopped trading.
The KOSPI benchmark equity gauge is up 13% this year, surging more than 70% from its March low, with local retail traders pouring record amounts into the $1.8 trillion stock market. Now accounting for about 65% of total daily Kospi trading value, this host of millennial investors has shown a penchant for risky trades including microcaps and preferred stock, which generally pay higher dividends than common shares but lack the latter’s voting rights.
This isn’t the first time that officials have warned about the impact of speculative trading. The Korea Exchange cautioned in June about the strong gains in thinly-traded issues with market caps of about $50 million.
The lawmaker Hong, the former chief executive officer of Seoul brokerage Mirae Asset Daewoo Co., expressed concern that retail investors flocking to the market could be exploited by speculators who try to manipulate preferred shares.
“There are so many preferred stocks in Korea that are extremely expensive relative to their common stocks -- some of them trade at 50 times more,” Hong said. “Retail investors who joined the stock market this year seem to have very shallow knowledge of finance. If interest rates remain low like now, this kind of irrational pricing could distort the entire stock market.”

""Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD,"" Musk said in a tweet, possibly referring to Becton Dickinson and Co's (N:BDX) rapid antigen test.
Musk, who took rapid antigen tests on Thursday, said he was also awaiting results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests from different labs.
When asked by a Twitter user if he showed any symptoms, Musk said he had symptoms of a ""typical cold"". 
""Nothing unusual so far,"" Musk added.
Becton Dickinson, which is one of the major suppliers of COVID-19 antigen tests, said in September it was investigating reports from U.S. nursing homes that its rapid coronavirus testing equipment was producing false-positive results.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it was alerting clinical laboratory staff and healthcare providers that false positive results can occur with COVID-19 antigen tests.
Musk had previously criticized coronavirus-related restrictions and lockdowns, referring to those as ""fascist"" and an infringement on individual liberty.

Becton Dickinson did not respond to a request for comment late on Thursday.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>",Daimler to revamp China plant to make Actros trucks as sales surge,"By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and its China commercial vehicle partner Beiqi  Foton Motor  Co (SS:600166) plan to invest 2.75 billion yuan ($415.32 million) to build Mercedes-Benz-branded Actros heavy trucks for the first time in China, a document showed.
The partners plan to revamp plants at their joint venture Beijing Foton Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Automotive (BFDA) in China's capital Beijing and add a production line, giving the plant a capacity of 50,000 Actros trucks a year, according to the construction document posted on the venture's website. 
A source familiar with the matter said the companies plan to embark on the revamp next year. 
Foton had no comment and Daimler did not immediately respond to Reuters queries about the project.
Shares in Foton jumped by their maximum 10% daily limit and were headed for their best day since Oct. 13 after the Reuters report. 
All Mercedes-Benz trucks currently sold in China are imported and priced significantly higher than the venture's domestically made Auman trucks.
The truck joint venture sold 111,788 Auman trucks, which have Daimler's technology input, in the first 10 months this year, up 55% from same period last year. 
Reuters reported the expansion plan in August last year. Sources familiar with the matter later said the progress was slow, citing product and supply chain planning, regulation approvals and the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Daimler said in 2016 it planned to make Actros trucks in China by the end of the decade but has not since publicly given updates.
Daimler, which has a passenger car joint venture with Foton's parent BAIC Group [BEJINS.UL], sold around 700,000 passenger cars in China last year. Its chief executive said last month China will remain Mercedes-Benz's biggest growth market in the next decade and it will adjust production locations to capture shifts in demand.
Overall truck sales in China, the world's biggest auto market, jumped 24% between January and October to 3.87 million units, driven by government investment in infrastructure and as buyers upgraded to comply with tougher emissions rules.
But the market is largely dominated by local companies including FAW's Jiefang (SZ:000800), Dongfeng Motor (HK:0489) and  Sinotruk  (HK:3808), which offer more price-competitive products.
International truck makers including MAN SE (DE:MANG) and Volvo trucks have engine partnerships with local companies.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 11:05PM ET</span>",U.S. government appeals order blocking TikTok ban from taking effect,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said it had appealed a Pennsylvania judge's Oct. 30 order that blocked the government from imposing restrictions on Chinese-owned short video sharing app TikTok that were set to take effect on Thursday.
The Commerce Department's August order would have barred transactions with TikTok, which its owner ByteDance had warned would effectively prohibit TikTok's use in the United States.
The White House did not appear to be a in a rush to implement an Aug. 14 divestiture order that directed ByteDance to sell TikTok by Thursday.
There were no immediate efforts by the Trump administration to enforce that order, even though it was not clear whether the government would formally grant a request by ByteDance to extend the sale deadline. 
The Commerce Department said Nov. 1 it would comply with Judge Wendy Beetlestone's order blocking the ban, but said it would ""vigorously defend"" its actions.
TikTok did not immediately comment on the government's appeal to the U.S. Third Circuit.
Beetlestone enjoined the agency from barring data hosting within the United States for TikTok, content delivery services and other technical transactions.
President Donald Trump's administration contends that TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China's government. TikTok denies the allegations.
Beetlestone wrote the ""government’s own descriptions of the national security threat posed by the TikTok app are phrased in the hypothetical.""
On Sept. 27, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued a preliminary injunction in a suit brought by ByteDance that stopped Commerce from ordering Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) app stores to remove TikTok for download by new users. That order had been set to take effect later that day.
The U.S. Treasury Department said on Wednesday it wanted a resolution of national security concerns it has raised about TikTok before a Thursday divestiture deadline. A Treasury spokeswoman had no comment on Thursday.
ByteDance has been in talks for a deal with Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) to shift TikTok's U.S. assets into a new entity called TikTok Global. It said on Tuesday it had requested a 30-day extension of the divestiture deadline to finalize terms. Trump said in September the deal had his ""blessing.""
ByteDance on Tuesday filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington challenging the Aug. 14 divestiture order, which gave the Justice Department power to enforce the demanded sale. A Justice Department spokeswoman on Thursday declined to comment.

ByteDance said a fourth proposal submitted on Friday sought to address U.S. security concerns ""by creating a new entity, wholly owned by Oracle, Walmart and existing U.S. investors in ByteDance, that would be responsible for handling TikTok's U.S. user data and content moderation.""

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly down on Friday morning in Asia, following the lead set by European and U.S. shares overnight, as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on and hopes dim for a quick ending.
Worries over logistical issues in mass-producing and transporting vaccines, as well as the ever-increasing number of cases in Europe and the U.S. are sparking fears that more countries will re-impose lockdowns, overshadowing the slew of positive news from vaccine developers.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (F:22UAy) announced positive results for their candidate BNT-162b2 on Monday, Russia said on Wednesday that its Sputnik V vaccine candidate showed 92% efficacy, and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) said on the same day that the accumulation of data for a first analysis of its vaccine mRNA-1273 is complete, with an announcement on the vaccine's efficacy expected by the end of the month.
With New York City already preparing for the possibility of school closures and Chicago urging residents to stay at home, some investors were bracing for a few more months of hardship.
“We’re experiencing a bit of exhaustion for the market as we focus on the troubling near-term COVID-19 trends and the potential for a few tough months ahead,” StoneX global market strategist Yousef Abbasi told Bloomberg.
Uncertainty over the latest U.S. stimulus measures also remains, with President Donald Trump leaving the revival of negotiations with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid down 1% by 11:01 PM ET (3:015 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.14%, reversing some earlier gains.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.33%. Australia-China relations soured further after China blamed Australia for the mounting tensions. “For some time, Australia has been violating basic norms governing international relations and made erroneous words and deeds on issues concerning China’s core interests, including those related to Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan, and blatantly interfered in China’s internal affairs,"" Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Thursday. In response, Australia said that it will seek to resolve the differences through diplomatic and other official channels.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.23%. The city recorded 23 COVID-19 cases on Thursday, the most since Sep. 20, prompting worries of a fourth wave. Kindergartens were also shut for two weeks due to nearly 180 cases of upper respiratory tract infections. Hong Kong's Legislative Council also remains in limbo as all its opposition lawmakers resigned over a new patriotism requirement implemented by Beijing earlier in the week. The requirement initially saw four lawmakers disqualified from their seats.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.82% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.75%. Tensions between China and the U.S. also rose after Trump signed an executive order prohibiting U.S. investment in Chinese firms determined to be owned or controlled by the Chinese military, with China “increasingly exploiting” U.S. capital for “the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses,” the order said.
Meanwhile, China is due to join 14 other Asia-Pacific nations in signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement on Nov. 15, the final day of the 37th ASEAN Summit.
Investors were further reminded of the risks to economic recovery at another event, after central bank heads sounded a warning note during Thursday’s European Central Bank (ECB)’s “Central Banks in a Shifting World” forum.
“We do see the economy continuing on a solid path of recovery, but the main risk we see to that is clearly the further spread of the disease here in the U.S. ... the next few months could be challenging,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a panel discussion alongside ECB President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey.
“From a huge river of uncertainty, we see the other side now,” Lagarde said. “But I don’t want to be exuberant about this vaccination because there is still uncertainty” over its production and distribution, she quickly added."

(Reuters) - Instacart has picked  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) to lead its initial public offering (IPO), which could come early next year and value the U.S. grocery delivery app at around $30 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
Instacart was valued at $17.7 billion last month, when it raised $200 million in a private fundraising round. Were the IPO to push Instacart's valuation to close to $30 billion, it would underscore the rapid growth of its business as more consumers turn to it to shop for groceries during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The San Francisco-based company is accelerating its IPO plans after voters in California backed a ballot proposal last week that upheld the status of app-based delivery drivers as independent contractors. This was a boost for the likes of Instacart and  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), which rely on people to work independently and not as employees.
The sources requested anonymity because the IPO preparations are confidential. Instacart and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Instacart has been expanding its delivery business to non-grocery goods, serving customers of major stores such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT), beauty product retailer Sephora and convenience store 7-Eleven. 
Launched in 2012 and led by its co-founder Apoorva Mehta, Instacart's order volumes have surged as much as 500% this year, as consumers shopped online during the coronavirus outbreak.
Instacart's investors include venture capital firms Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and D1 Capital Partners, according to PitchBook data.

Several Silicon Valley unicorns are preparing for their stock market debut in the next few weeks, including home-rental startup Airbnb Inc, online retailer Wish Inc and food-delivery service DoorDash Inc.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Top official on U.S. election cybersecurity tells associates he expects to be fired,"By Christopher Bing, Joseph Menn and Raphael Satter
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Top U.S. cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs, who worked on protecting the election from hackers but drew the ire of the Trump White House over efforts to debunk disinformation, has told associates he expects to be fired, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Krebs, who heads the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), did not return messages seeking comment. CISA and the White House declined comment.
Separately, Bryan Ware, assistant director for cybersecurity at CISA, confirmed to Reuters that he had handed in his resignation on Thursday. Ware did not provide details, but a U.S. official familiar with his matter said the White House asked for Ware's resignation earlier this week. 
The departure is part of the churn in the administration since Republican President Donald Trump was defeated by Democrat Joe Biden in last week's election, raising concerns about the transition to the president-elect who would take office on Jan. 20. Trump, who has yet to concede and has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud, fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper and has installed loyalists in top positions at the Pentagon.
Krebs has drawn praise from both Democrats and Republicans for his handling of the election, which generally ran smoothly despite persistent fears that foreign hackers might try to undermine the vote.
But he drew the ire of the Trump White House over a website run by CISA dubbed ""Rumor Control"" which debunks misinformation about the election, according to the three people familiar with the matter. 
White House officials have asked for content to be edited or removed which pushed back against numerous false claims about the election, including that Democrats are behind a mass election fraud scheme. CISA officials have chosen not to delete accurate information.
In particular, one person said, the White House was angry about a CISA post rejecting a conspiracy theory that falsely claims an intelligence agency supercomputer and program, purportedly named Hammer and Scorecard, could have flipped votes nationally. No such system exists, according to Krebs, election security experts and former U.S. officials. 
On Twitter, U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, wrote: ""Chris Krebs has done a great job protecting our elections. He is one of the few people in this Administration respected by everyone on both sides of the aisle. There is no possible justification to remove him from office. None."" 
Krebs has steadily shot down rumors of fraud in recent days, including retweeting leading election security expert Matt Blaze, who for years has warned of specific vulnerabilities in election gear, when the professor wrote that ""no serious evidence has yet been found or presented that suggests that the 2020 election outcome in any state has been altered through technical exploitation.""

Gregory Crabb, chief information security officer for the U.S. Postal Service, which was also under pressure over misinformation about mail-in ballots, said: ""From my view on the election frontlines, Krebs was a great partner and deserves accolades for his work.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. auto safety regulator said on Thursday it identified the 18th U.S. death tied to a Takata air bag inflator rupture after the review of a recent BMW crash.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had concluded a Takata air bag inflator rupture during a September crash in Arizona had led to fatal injuries of the driver.
This was the first reported Takata death in a BMW vehicle after 15 U.S. deaths in those of Honda Motor Co and two in Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co vehicles since 2009.
BMW said its ""engineers will work closely with federal investigators to inspect the vehicle and to understand the details of the incident.""
The German automaker added it had ""been working diligently to identify and contact owners of these older vehicles equipped with recalled Takata airbags.""
The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of about 63 million inflators. Worldwide, about 100 million inflators by 19 major automakers were recalled.
More than 290 U.S. injuries are also tied to faulty Takata inflators and at least 27 deaths worldwide. The issues especially affects older vehicles with long-term exposure to hot, humid conditions. A number of the deaths have occurred in Arizona.
Millions of unrepaired air bags remain in cars on U.S. roads.
NHTSA said in a statement Thursday the ""incident underscores the importance of replacing every recalled Takata air bag. When notified of a safety defect, we urge vehicle owners to immediately contact their automaker’s local dealer to schedule a free repair.""

Investing.com - Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) fell 1.3$ in after-hours trading Thursday after the data analytics company raised its annual guidance for the year but reported a wider-than-expected third-quarter loss on higher costs.
The company maintained its 30% revenue growth for next year, but raised its revenue guidance for 2020 to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, up 44% year-over-year, while adjusted operating income is expected to be $130 million to $136 million.
In the third quarter, Palantir widened its loss to 94 cents share from 42 cents as revenue was up 52% to $289.4 million year-over-year. That compared with analysts estimates for a loss of 3 cents on revenue of $279.1 million. 
The jump in revenue was led by new contract wins and higher average revenue per customer, though was offset by higher marketing and R&D costs. 
 New contracts in third quarter include U.S. Army ($91 million), National Institutes of Health ($36 million), and $300 million renewal with aerospace customer, the company said.
Average revenue per customer through the first nine months of 2020 was $5.8 million, up 38% on the year.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company maintained its forecasts on revenue of between $299 million and $301 million and adjusted operating profit of $44-to-$50 million.
The company made its debut on New York Stock Exchange debut on Wednesday, after years of speculation, via a direct listing and without the usual razzmatazz surrounding a traditional IPO. "

Investing.com - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) reported Thursday fourth-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates, as well as strong demand for its streaming services.
Walt Disney shares gained 7.21% in after-hours trade following the report.
Walt Disney announced earnings  per share of $-0.2 on revenue of $14.71B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $-0.73 on revenue of $14.15B.
Walt Disney shares are down 6% from the beginning of the year, still down 11.71% from its 52 week high of $153.41 set on November 26, 2019. They are under-performing the Dow Jones which is up 1.9% from the start of the year.
The narrower-than-expected loss comes as its theme parks business churned out results that were not as bad as feared following the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Parks, experiences and products revenue for the quarter decreased 61% to $2.58 billion, compared with estimates for $2.23 billion.
""The most significant impact was at the Parks, Experiences and Products segment where since the second quarter of the fiscal year, our parks and resorts have been closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity and our cruise ship sailings have been suspended,"" Disney said in a statement.
Studio entertainment revenue for the quarter decreased 52% to $1.6 billion, while direct-to-consumer & international revenues for the quarter increased 41% to $4.85 billion.
The company's streaming service Disney+ racked up 73 million users in the quarter, topping estimates for 65.5 million, while ESPN subscribers of 10.3 million topped estimates of 9.2 million.
The ongoing strength in its streaming business has validated the company's move to double down on content following its announcement last month to streamline the organization.
""The real bright spot has been our direct-to-consumer business, which is key to the future of our company, and on this anniversary of the launch of Disney+ we’re pleased to report that, as of the end of the fourth quarter, the service had more than 73 million paid subscribers – far surpassing our expectations in just its first year,"" the company said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) worker who protested conditions at his New York City fulfillment center sued the retailer on Thursday, accusing it of discrimination for firing him and for putting Black and Hispanic workers at heightened risk of contracting COVID-19.
In a proposed class action filed in Brooklyn federal court, Christian Smalls alleged Amazon failed to provide needed protective gear to its ""predominantly minority"" workforce, subjecting them to inferior working conditions than its mainly white managers.
Citing a leaked memo from Amazon's general counsel to Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, Smalls also said Amazon fired him after concluding that as a Black man he was a ""weak spokesman"" for workers.
He also said Amazon tried to drum up public support by making him the ""face"" of workers criticizing its pandemic response.
The complaint seeks unspecified damages for Black and Hispanic workers at the Staten Island facility.
Amazon fired Smalls on March 30, saying he joined a protest at the Staten Island facility despite being on paid quarantine, after had having close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.
It fired at least three other workers critical of its pandemic response in April, citing various alleged workplace violations.
New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote to Amazon later in April, expressing ""serious concern"" it was trying to silence critics of its health and safety measures.
In a statement on Thursday, Amazon spokeswoman Lisa Levandowski said Amazon's focus on customers ""is central to our work in diversity and inclusion,"" and that Smalls was fired for putting others' health and safety at risk.
The Seattle-based company has benefited from the pandemic as consumers shopped online more often.
Amazon has said it expects to invest $10 billion this year on COVID-19 initiatives to deliver products and keep employees safe, including by distributing masks to workers and employing disinfectant spraying and temperature checks worldwide.
On Oct. 1, Amazon said 19,816 of its 1.37 million front-line U.S. workers between Mar. 1 and Sept. 19 had tested positive or were presumed positive for the coronavirus.
It said that was 42% fewer than if the infection rate had mirrored the rate for the general population.
Last week, a Brooklyn federal judge dismissed a separate lawsuit accusing Amazon of creating a public nuisance at the Staten Island facility.

The case is Smalls v Amazon Inc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 20-05492.

Investing.com – The Dow fell Thursday as a wave of red washed over stocks linked to the economic recovery on worries about the impact of the further restrictions in the U.S. amid a record surge in coronavirus cases.
As the U.S. witnessed a record-high 145,835 cases Wednesday, parts of the country are re-imposing economy-sapping restrictions to curb the virus. The threat of renewed lockdown measures has triggered investor jitters about the impact to the pace of the recovery.
""Although the lockdowns that were widespread over the spring don't seem likely to repeat, we expect that many local governments will quickly enact policies that attempt to limit the spread at the expense of promoting economic activity which could lead to a new round of layoffs,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note following the jobless claims report released Thursday.
In the week ended Nov. 7, 709,000 people filed for unemployment insurance, down 48,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised 757,000, and better than the expected 730,000 claims expected.
Major cities in the U.S. including Boston, New York, and Chicago have recently announced restrictions and curfews on hospitality to stem the jump in cases.  
Adding to the worries about further lockdown measures, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the economy will be challenged in the next several months by the resurgence in the virus.
Energy, meanwhile, led the rout in value stocks as an unexpected build in U.S. crude weekly stockpiles exacerbated the selling.
Crude oil inventories rose 4.3 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. The expectation was for a draw of 913,000 barrels.
Materials and financials also came under pressure, with the latter taking a blow from retreating bank stocks following a surge earlier this week on positive vaccine news.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were down 1%.
Tech, which a day earlier had offset losses in value stocks, was on the backfoot. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended in the red.

Forty-three are based in the Americas, with 13 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, three in the Asia-Pacific region and one in Bengaluru. Sixteen of the new partners are women, it said. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon has said he wants to move faster to increase diversity among the bank’s senior ranks. Goldman has set some of the most aggressive and specific goals among the big banks, requiring that more Black, Latino and female professionals be interviewed and hired for jobs at the bank. The bank interviews at least two diverse candidates for any senior job opening. Despite that, Solomon has said the bank is not increasing diversity fast enough. Goldman's partnership ranks have nearly doubled since the bank went public in 1999, but have shrunk over the last decade as part of a strategy to make the Wall Street bank less top-heavy. Under Solomon, who took over as the bank's chief executive officer in 2018, that trend has continued.  
Goldman named 69 new partners two years ago during Solomon's first year in the role.

(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU) is gradually removing seat blocks set up on its flights early in the pandemic, with all available seats up for sale after the holiday travel season, the budget carrier said on Thursday.
The decision, announced in a memo to employees, follows a growing number of studies including from the Harvard School of Public Health and the U.S. Department of Defense that validate the safety of the aircraft cabin, it said.
""Studies like the recent report from Harvard researchers confirm that the layers of protection we have in place make the aircraft as safe or substantially safer than other more common settings, like grocery shopping or indoor dining,"" JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty said. 
The New York-based carrier will limit its onboard capacity to 85% between Dec. 2 and Jan. 7, up from the current 70% cap, allowing it to tap into extra demand over the holiday travel season while still providing extra space on planes.
Starting Jan. 8, in the low season, all seats will be available for sale, it said.
Low-cost rival Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) recently said it would stop blocking seats in December, putting it on par with larger rivals American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) which do not have any seating caps.

Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) has said it will continue restricting seating capacity through at least Jan. 6.

The decision to stop what would have been the world's largest ever IPO, came days after the fintech giant's billionaire founder Jack Ma launched a public attack on the country's financial watchdogs and banks.
President Xi ordered Chinese regulators to investigate and effectively shut down Ant's stock market flotation, the report said https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556?mod=hp_lead_pos4.
Ant Group did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. The Information Office of the State Council, China's cabinet, could not be reached immediately for comment. 
Ma had told a summit in Shanghai on Oct. 24 that the regulatory system was stifling innovation and must be reformed to fuel growth. Earlier this month, Reuters reported the speech set off a chain of events that torpedoed the listing of Ant.
Soon after Ma's scathing speech, state regulators started compiling reports including one on how Ant had used digital financial products like Huabei, a virtual credit card service, to encourage poor and young people to build up debt. 
The general office of the State Council compiled a report on public sentiment about Ma's speech and submitted it to senior leaders including President Xi, Reuters had reported.

Investing.com – The Dow fell Thursday, as value stocks fell further into the red on fears further restrictions to curb the record surge in coronavirus cases will undermine the economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%, or 437 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.92%.
As the U.S. witnessed a record-high 145,835 cases Wednesday, parts of the country are re-imposing economy-sapping restrictions to curb the virus. The threat of renewed lockdown measures has triggered investor jitters about the impact to the pace of the recovery.
""Although the lockdowns that were widespread over the Spring don't seem likely to repeat, we expect that many local governments will quickly enact policies that attempt to limit the spread at the expense of promoting economic activity which could lead to a new round of layoffs,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note following the jobless claims report released Thursday.
In the week ended Nov. 7, 709,000 people filed for unemployment insurance, down 48,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised 757,000, and better than the expected 730,000 claims expected.
Major cities in the U.S. including Boston, New York, and Chicago have recently announced restrictions and curfews on hospitality to stem the jump in cases.  
Energy led the rout in value stocks as an unexpected build in U.S. crude weekly stockpiles exacerbated the selling.
Crude oil inventories rose 4.3 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. The expectation was for a draw of 913,000 barrels.
As well as energy, materials, and financials also came under pressure, with the latter taking a blow from retreating bank stocks following a surge earlier this week on positive vaccine news.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were down 2%.
Tech, which a day earlier had offset losses in value stocks, was on the backfoot. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded lower.
In other news,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stoked hopes that preliminary data for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate could be released soon after it topped the number of coronavirus cases needed in its late-stage vaccine study to submit the preliminary data to an independent review board. Its shares rose more than 4%."

LONDON/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - European private equity fund EQT (NYSE:EQT) is holding preliminary talks with KPN NV (AS:KPN) over a possible takeover bid that could value the largest Dutch telecommunications company at about $13 billion, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
EQT has approached both KPN's management and the Dutch government in recent weeks to discuss a possible deal, the source said.
The buyout fund, founded in Sweden in 1994 and led by Chief Executive Christian Sinding, is working with JPMorgan (N:JPM) on a possible deal, the source said, but negotiations are still at an early stage and no deal is certain.
KPN's top investor America Movil (MX:AMXL), which owns 16% of the Dutch firm, has not been informed of the discussions, which were first reported by Bloomberg, the source added.
EQT and KPN declined to comment while America Movil was not immediately available.
KPN shares rose almost 6.5% on Thursday to 2.64 euros.
On October 28, KPN boss Joost Farwerck told reporters during the company's third-quarter results that KPN was not planning on being bought but remained open to interest.
""If somebody comes along with an interesting proposal, we can always listen, but we're not focused on it,"" he said.
KPN, which has a market value of 11 billion euros, competes with VodafoneZiggo and T-Mobile in the highly concentrated Dutch market and has suffered a decade-long decline in sales. Farwerck has said he does not expect a quick revival.
EQT owns the Netherlands' second-largest fibre optic network, DeltaFiber, and may use it as a vehicle to buy parts of KPN's fibre business and extract some synergies, or cost efficiencies, if an outright takeover fails to win the blessing of Dutch government officials, the source said.
In May, the Dutch government passed a law that allows it to block takeovers of companies in the telecommunications sector that it deems to be not in the interest of national security.
""Any deal for KPN needs to be friendly. EQT will never go hostile,"" the source said.
The Netherlands' Economic Affairs ministry, which oversees KPN, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

An attempt to buy KPN for 8 euros per share in 2013, by America Movil, floundered on KPN's poison pill defences, which are still in place.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) on Thursday cautioned that the recent surge in COVID-19 cases may have a negative impact on travel over the winter holidays, a period the sector had hoped would see improved bookings.
The United States on Wednesday reported new COVID-19 infections reached an all-time daily high for a second day in a row and the number of people hospitalized also surged to the highest ever during the pandemic.
""With the U.S. hitting a grim milestone of 10 million positive cases and outbreaks in Europe and other parts of the world, all signs point to a challenging winter ahead,"" Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo.
The U.S. Transportation Department said the country's airlines carried 65% fewer passengers in September versus the same month last year, the smallest decrease since March. Airlines say travel demand in November remains down 65%.
Airlines are making a renewed push for $25 billion in assistance after a $25 billion program of mostly cash grants for payroll approved by Congress in March expired on Sept. 30.
American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) last month furloughed 32,000 workers.
Talks between House and Senate committees overseeing airlines to hammer out language on more airline payroll assistance have resumed over the last week, but prospects for any immediate measure remain hazy.
""The situation in the industry is still dire,"" said Airlines for America Chief Executive Nick Calio, noting that the U.S. industry is losing about $180 million a day. He said airlines were hopeful that the current Congress would act before the end of the year.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) has said increasing vaccine availability through 2021 would help slow the industry's revenue decline to 47% in the first half of 2021 and to 19% by the end of next year versus pre-crisis levels.
""We have an operating plan next year that we believe we really should get all the aircraft up by the middle of the year,"" American Airlines CFO Derek Kerr said on Thursday, adding he expects the airline to stop burning cash some time in 2021.
""Now if we don't, what we'll do is not bring the planes up and we won't bring back the furloughs,"" he told an industry conference.
Low-cost carrier Southwest said an improvement in revenues had been losing steam in recent weeks, prompting caution about December trends.
""While the company expected the (Nov. 3 U.S.) election to impact trends, it is unclear whether the softness in booking trends is also a direct result of the recent rise in COVID-19 cases,"" Southwest said. ""The company remains cautious in this uncertain revenue environment."" 

The COVID-19 pandemic brought travel to a near halt earlier in the year, forcing airlines to scale back operations and seek government aid.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States should increase enforcement of antitrust laws as part of a general attack on social ills, Bill Baer, who is on President-elect Joe Biden's transition team for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Thursday.
Baer pointed to multi-year battles that the FTC had to fight a series of hospital mergers as well as its ongoing battle against brand name pharmaceutical companies settling patent litigation by paying generic companies to delay entering the market, so-called pay-for-delay deals. The healthcare industry is one that has seen dizzying price increases.
""We should care too about under enforcement because it's led to growing concentration in many markets, think agriculture, telecom, wireless, travel, pharma and beer,"" he said at an American Bar Association conference.
Two Democratic FTC commissioners, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Slaughter, have focused on healthcare but lost many fights in the past three years. They dissented on approving health-related deals, including AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)'s acquisition of Allergan (NYSE:AGN) and Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL)'s acquisition of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s Upjohn.
Biden's antitrust officials, who likely will not be named for months, will press on with the Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, or may expand it, experts have agreed. [nL1N2HB0EX] They will also stay the course with a potential FTC lawsuit against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and antitrust probes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), experts said.
Other antitrust experts on the Biden transition team include Big Tech critic Gene Kimmelman of Public Knowledge, who is on the Justice Department team, and Sarah Miller, of the American Economic Liberties Project, on Treasury.
Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat whose House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel wrote a massive report on Big Tech, said Thursday that he planned to work with Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican, to draw up antitrust legislation.

“We do see the economy continuing on a solid path of recovery, but the main risk we see to that is clearly the further spread of the disease here in the United States,” Powell said Thursday during a panel discussion at a virtual conference hosted by the European Central Bank. “With the virus now spreading, the next few months could be challenging.”
Fed officials made no changes to their policy stance last week at a meeting following the U.S. election, sticking with near-zero interest rates and bond purchases of $120 billion per month.
But the prospect of a divided government raised by the election results has dimmed expectations for additional aggressive fiscal stimulus. That may lead the U.S. central bank to tweak its bond-buying program in the coming months, in a bid to offer the economy further support.
Fed officials next meet Dec. 15-16.
BOE, ECB
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde echoed Powell’s caution on the vaccine. Bailey said it is “encouraging” and he hopes it will reduce uncertainty, but “we’re not there yet.”
His ECB counterpart said while it’s becoming possible to see past the coronavirus, “I don’t want to be exuberant.”
In the U.S., President-elect Joe Biden’s Democrats are pushing for a more ambitious spending program than Republicans, who could retain control of the Senate if they win at least one of two January run-off elections in Georgia.
The U.S. economy has generally rebounded faster than forecasters anticipated in recent months following the collapse in employment caused by the coronavirus pandemic in March and April. The unemployment rate fell by a full percentage point to 6.9% in October, monthly jobs data published by the Labor Department on Nov. 6 showed.
But the country is experiencing another wave of coronavirus outbreaks that has already sent new cases and hospitalizations to record highs, a development which threatens to slow or reverse the progress made since April.
“My sense is that we will need to do more, and Congress may need to do more as well on fiscal policy,” Powell said.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",The top contenders to run Biden's financial agencies,"By Pete Schroeder, Michelle Price and Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's team has tapped a mix of progressives and centrist policy experts, including former derivatives market regulator Gary Gensler, to work on a transition plan for financial industry oversight. 
Here is how staffing could shake out at some of the key financial regulators, according to nearly two dozen lobbyists, officials and policy experts in Democratic circles. 
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB)
The CFPB director is a critical role for progressives such as Senator Elizabeth Warren who believe the agency can help tackle wealth inequality and racial injustice. A June Supreme Court ruling handed Biden the power to fire Republican President Donald Trump's CFPB director, Kathy Kraninger, and many policy experts expect him to quickly replace her after he takes office on Jan. 20. 
Potential candidates for the role include Warren's protégée, U.S. Representative Katie Porter; Federal Trade Commissioner Rohit Chopra; Bharat Ramamurti, Warren's former aide who sits on a pandemic congressional oversight panel; and Patrice Ficklin, the CFPB's fair lending director who has been at the agency since its inception in 2011. 
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
Biden is also expected to quickly staff up the SEC, which under Chair Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee, has pursued many rule changes opposed by Democrats and investor advocates. 
Clayton, whose role is based in Washington, has said he wants to return home to New York and is expected to resign well before his term ends in June. That would position senior Democratic SEC Commissioner Allison Lee as acting chair until a new chair is sworn in. 
Progressives are keen on former Democratic SEC Commissioner Kara Stein for chair, although Rob Jackson, also a former Democratic commissioner who currently teaches at New York University School of Law, is preferred by moderates. Gensler is also a contender, the sources said. 
BANKING REGULATORS 
There will be a handful of banking regulator roles to fill, with the first likely to be comptroller of the currency. That is because current Comptroller Brian Brooks is serving in an acting capacity, allowing Biden to replace him quickly. Amy Friend, formerly senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel at the agency under Obama, is seen as a leading candidate.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chair Jelena McWilliams cannot be removed by Biden and has said she wants to serve out her term, which ends in 2023. But Biden can still tilt the agency's five-seat board, which passes rules via majority vote, by quickly appointing the heads of the CFPB and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency who always hold seats on the FDIC board too. Obama-era holdover and former FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg already has a seat. 
If McWilliams resigns, Michael Barr, professor at the University of Michigan Law School and former Obama administration Treasury official is seen as a contender for that or another banking slot, as is Graham (NYSE:GHM) Steele, a director at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and former Federal Reserve staffer. Barr is advising the transition team.
COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC)
Current Republican CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert is expected to resign from the chairman's role, putting senior Democratic Commissioner Rostin Behnam in line for acting chair. But the sources said Dan Berkovitz, the other Democratic CFTC commissioner and formerly general counsel to Gensler when he led the agency, is the front-runner for the permanent chairman's role. 
FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY (FHFA)
The FHFA is led by libertarian Mark Calabria who has said he is committed to overhauling the country's housing finance market before his term ends in 2024. He is unlikely to resign, the sources said, and cannot currently be fired. That could change, however, pending a Supreme Court challenge to the agency's structure, which could find the director can be removed. 
If so, Biden, for whom affordable housing is a key policy, is likely to replace him. Potential contenders for his job include Eric Stein, who was special adviser to Democratic FHFA Director Mel Watt from 2014 to 2019, and Diane Yentel, chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Stein is also advising the transition team.

All those named above, or their representatives, declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment, other than Ficklin and Clayton. While Ficklin would not comment on whether she was in contention for a role, she said she would be honored to serve. A spokeswoman for Clayton said there are a number of items on his agenda ""that he intends to move forward in the upcoming months.""

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Thyssenkrupp could change tack and keep hydrogen champion Uhde - sources,"By Tom Käckenhoff and Christoph Steitz
DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Embattled conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) is reviewing ways to keep its electrolysis unit Uhde as demand for large-scale production of hydrogen is expected to increase, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers (TKUCE) is currently part of Thyssenkrupp's Plant Technology division, which makes equipment for mining, chemicals and fertiliser plants and has been put up for sale.
A 66-34 joint venture of Thyssenkrupp and Italy's De Nora, TKUCE is the world's largest supplier of chlor-alkali membrane technologies needed to produce hydrogen.
The business will now likely be retained to help Thyssenkrupp build a strategy around hydrogen, the people said, citing plans by the European Union to push production of the fuel via renewables.
Thyssenkrupp, which will publish annual results on Nov. 19, declined to comment.
TKUCE could fetch a valuation of more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in a strategic deal or initial public offering ""as long as a constructive growth case can be struck"",  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has said.
TKUCE holds roughly half of the global market, where it competes with Japan's Asahi Kasei (25%), China's Bluestar Beijing Chemical Machinery (19%) and Britain's chemicals group Ineos (6%).
Deutsche Bank in August said it was ""surprised"" that Thyssenkrupp had transferred TKUCE to its Multi-Tracks division, which comprises businesses for which the conglomerate sees no sustainable future prospects within the group.
""Given likely significant investments into hydrogen capabilities over the next few decades in order to meet climate targets and facilitate the energy transition, we believe that this asset could develop significant strategic value,"" it said.
TKUCE gets contracts worth more than 40 million tonnes of chlorine a year for both chlor-alkali and hydrochloric acid electrolysis plants.
While views differ over whether the hype around hydrogen is real, Germany has dedicated 9 billion euros to help create a national hydrogen industry, with firms such as RWE and E.ON pinning hopes on the technology.
One of the people said that potential suitors for Plant Technology were asked to submit bids by the end of November after the sales process, run by Citi, was delayed due to the coronavirus crisis.
Interest for parts of the unit is expected to come from Denmark's FLSmidth and Sweden's Sandvik, sources have said.

Investing.com --   Vroom  (NASDAQ:VRM) dropped 9% even with demand and revenue growing.
Unit sales prices dropped in the third quarter and aren't expected to recover for the rest of the year. Logistics costs also rose in the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, the average ecommerce selling price per unit is estimated to be between $24,500 to $25,500. In the third quarter, the average ecommerce selling price dropped to $24,248 from $31,370. 
Ecommerce unit sales and revenue for the fourth quarter are expected to rise 25% from the third quarter, and 74% from a year earlier at the middle of the guidance range of 10,500 to 11,500.
Revenue for the fourth quarter is estimated at between $372 million and $414 million with a loss of between 41 cents and 35 cents per share. 
Vroom's third quarter loss per share of 31 cents beat the expected 36-cent loss on sales of $340 million, versus the estimated $311 million.
Following the less-than-stellar outlook, Vroom got a handful of price target cuts from Baird to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
Baird analyst Colin Sebastian nonetheless maintained his outperform rating on Vroom.

Calvey, a prominent investor and founder of private equity group Baring Vostok, was detained along with other fund executives in early 2019 after state investigators accused them of embezzlement related to mid-sized lender Vostochny.
Calvey, who denied the accusations, was supposed to be under house arrest until Nov. 13.
He plans to return to work with Baring Vostok in the near future, Interfax quoted him as saying on Thursday.

1496,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens Mostly Lower, Tech Outperforms; Nasdaq Up 0.2%","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Thursday, unwinding a move earlier in the week out of tech and growth stocks and into cyclicals as the market took a more sober view of the obstacles to a Covid-19 vaccine becoming widely available.
The likely difficulties in manufacturing, storing and transporting hundreds of millions of vaccine doses point to significant capacity bottlenecks if and when the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine – or others -  are approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration over the coming weeks and months.
That leaves the economy still exposed in the short run to setbacks from the coronavirus, a point illustrated again on Thursday by another week of over 700,000 initial claims for jobless benefits. That came after the U.S. posted a record high for new infections on Wednesday at over 144,000, while also breaking the previous record for hospital admissions. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 173 points, or 0.6%, at 29,224 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.5% while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%, as money flowed back into stocks that have done well from the many disruptions caused by the pandemic.
Among the early winners was  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock, which rose 5.7% after the biotech company said it is on track to report early data from a late-stage trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine later this month, and could file for U.S. emergency use authorization in December. Moderna's experimental drug, like  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s, is based on so-called messenger RNA (mRNA), leading many to conclude that it will show the same effectiveness.
Another winner was home-improvement stock RH (NYSE:RH), which rose another 4.5% on expectations of fresh lockdown measures to control the virus' spread. Such measures skewed household spending toward home improvement earlier in the year.
For the most part, the moves seen on Thursday were corrective, only partially retracing those seen earlier in the week, when the Pfizer announcement triggered a sharp repricing of risk related to the public health outlook. As such, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock was down 4.8% but was still up 8.8% on the week. :Likewise  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) stock were all down by between 1.5% and 2.5%, but likewise were still up by between 8% and 11% from a week ago, helped by the sharp rise in bond yields that will expand their lending margins.

The new car will feature the same specifications as the 4WD SF90 Stradale released last year, with a 780 horse power 8-cylinder combustion engine integrated with two front-mounted electric motors adding an extra 220 horse power, plus a retractable hard top.
One hundred kilos heavier than the Stradale, the Spider will cost 473,000 euros ($558,000) in Italy, outpricing the 430,000 euro Stradale at the top of Ferrari's price range for series-production cars.
First deliveries are expected in the second quarter of next year, in Europe.
""We consider the SF90 our range supercar,"" Chief Commercial and Marketing Officer Enrico Galliera said during a web presentation.
""We don't see any competitors on the market at the moment,"" he said, adding the SF90 would also attract owners of powerful V12 sport cars.
As well as a top speed of 340 km per hour, the plug-in hybrid SF90 can deliver 25 kilometres of silent electric-only power, allowing drivers to leave home quietly and pass through city centres without producing emissions. 
So far, the COVID-19 pandemic has not delayed Ferrari's ambitious plans to roll out new models, with the SF90 Spider coming two months after the Portofino M, a makeover of Ferrari's top selling grand tourer (GT).
It keeps a pledge to unveil two new cars this year, after a record five in 2019, including SF90 Stradale, Ferrari's first hybrid in series-production.
The SF90 Spider is the eighth new model out of the 15 Ferrari promised in its 2018-2022 plan.
The carmaker, controlled by Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, has pledged that 60% of vehicle sales will be hybrid by 2022.
A fully-electric Ferrari car, however, is not expected until after 2025, as the battery technology requires more development and the group needs to prepare customers more used to roaring engines than a quiet drive.
""For the time being we don't consider electric technology suitable for Ferrari's needs, it will be for sure in the future, but not now,"" Galliera said
In an earnings call on Nov. 3, Camilleri said he didn't see Ferrari ever being a 100% electric carmaker. ""And certainly not in my lifetime will it reach even 50%,"" he added.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent's blockbuster game and solid advertising drove an 89% rise in quarterly profit at the Chinese gaming and social media group, helping it to beat forecasts on Thursday.
With its flagship game Honour of Kings reporting a record 100 million daily active users in the first 10 months of 2020, Tencent, the world's largest gaming firm by revenue, has benefited from growth of paying users for video games.
Tencent said on Thursday its profit was 38.5 billion yuan ($5.8 billion) for the three months through September. That was ahead of an analyst average estimate of 30.81 billion yuan, data from Refinitiv showed. Revenue rose 29% to 125.4 billion yuan.
The Chinese group, which celebrated its 22nd birthday on Wednesday has a solid pipeline of new games waiting to be released, including a testing launch of a mobile version of League of Legends in Asia last month.
Tencent reported a return to normal in advertising activity after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with rapid growth in sectors such as education, internet services and e-commerce.
Its shares closed up 4.72%, against a 0.22% decline in the Hang Seng index, rebounding from a 7% drop on Wednesday when investors dumped shares in Chinese tech companies following publication of draft anti-monopoly rules.
These wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off the value of some tech giants including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).
Tencent President Martin Lau told in a post-results call that the draft anti-trust regulations are not new or unique to China, adding that as tech companies get bigger the new regulations reflect the new reality. 
Beijing is still supportive of the industry and Tencent will work with the regulators to ensure compliance, he added.
""For games, which are essentially individual products rather than a platform, I think they are less of a focus,"" Lau said.
China has also issued draft rules to boost the oversight of online micro-lending, a sector Tencent is also involved in the through WeBank, which derailed Ant Group's blockbuster IPO.
Lau said there will not be a lot of changes in Tencent's fintech strategy as a result of the proposed micro-lending rules and its business is in compliance with regulations.

Tencent said revenue from its cloud and other business services, a potential future growth engine, grew more slowly as a result of the lingering impact of the pandemic, with delays in areas such as project deployment and new contract sign-ups.

Airlines pay Rolls-Royce based on how many hours its engines fly, so the company's finances have come under increasing pressure after COVID-19 stopped travel earlier this year.
The equity raise unlocks new debt options for the company including 2 billion pounds from a bond issued in October and a bank loan worth 1 billion pounds, as part of a total 5 billion pound liquidity package.
The overwhelming majority of shareholders backed the equity raise, but the results showed there were some dissenters to the issue from what is one of Britain's best known industrial names, with 6% of the new shares issued not initially taken up. 
The company said in a statement that 10 underwriting banks including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) had successfully procured subscribers for the rest of the shares.
Chief Executive Warren East Rolls-Royce can ride out COVID-19 with the new liquidity package and by cutting 1.3 billion pounds in costs, axing 9,000 jobs and closing factories to adjust to lower demand from airline customers that fly with the firm's engines on Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s and Airbus 350s.
Shares in the company traded down 8% at 90 pence at 1240 GMT. In the rump placing, the new shares were sold at a price of 90 pence per share, the company said. 
The stock has had a rollercoaster week. Boosted by news of a vaccine, the shares rocketed by over 90% at one stage on Monday, but closed down 10% on Wednesday. They have lost 61% of their value in the year to date.

Overall, incentives at the end of this year, which include cash bonuses and equity awards, will generally decline, marking the second consecutive year of mostly smaller awards, the study shows.
Retail and commercial bankers will be the hardest hit, with their year-end incentive payments expected to decline at least 25% to 30% compared with last year, while investment banking advisors can expect to see their payments decline by as much as 15% to 20%.
Payments to asset management, hedge funds and private equity staff can expects payouts to be down 5% to 10% from the year before.
""The pandemic is wreaking havoc on many parts of the U.S. economy this year, and the financial services industry is no exception,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of the firm that did the report.
However, while retail and commercial bankers and workers at asset managements firms have seen declines, fixed income and equities traders have benefited from volatile markets driving trading activity.
Workers in fixed-income sales & trading are expected to see bonuses increase by at least 40% to 45% while equities sales and trading staff can expect payouts to increase by 20% to 25%.
""Fixed-income pros will be rewarded handsomely as uncertainty and high volatility contributed to record trading,"" said Johnson.

Johnson anticipates the pandemic will continue to hurt the financial services sector, overall, in 2021, but perhaps to a lesser degree than in 2020. Staff cuts are expected in the first half of the year, he said. Early projections suggest modest salary increases and flat-to-slightly increased bonuses.

The Cboe Volatility Index -- or VIX -- has dropped 16 points since late October to about 24, as expectations for market gyrations ebbed following the U.S. election and news of a promising coronavirus vaccine. The VIX remains above its lifetime 19.5 average amid risks such as the still-escalating pandemic and U.S. transition to power.
Still, the VIX looks ready to go below 20, which “would be a major risk-on signal,” Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, wrote in a note Wednesday, adding the move may also lead to “risk-on investment leverage.”
The slide in the VIX could even set up a scenario where volatility-focused funds buy stocks, potentially fueling gains. At the same time, some analysts have cautioned that the recent rally has gone too far.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists led by Phanikiran Naraparaju remain comparatively sanguine, writing in a note Thursday that “we expect realized volatility to resume the grind lower, typical of this stage in ‘early-cycle’ environments.” They recommend selling volatility to position for the cyclical decline.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Deutsche Telekom chief says market undervalues its growth story,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) raised its full-year guidance on Thursday after forecast-beating results that CEO Tim Hoettges said demonstrated that the market is undervaluing the growth story at the transatlantic telecoms group.
Another set of strong results from its T-Mobile unit has driven up shares in the recently merged U.S. business, eroding the residual value the market puts on the group's European operations spanning a dozen countries.
After subtracting its 43% stake in the U.S. carrier - worth $67 billion at Wednesday's closing price - the value of the non-U.S. business has shrunk to $18 billion. 
Hoettges told reporters that Deutsche Telekom's shares had been dragged down by its struggling rivals and a ""desolate"" European market, adding that it was the only European player showing significant growth.
""The good will show through in the end and will be reflected in our share price,"" he said.
Deutsche Telekom shares rose 0.5% to 15.05 euros in morning trade, bringing this year's gains to 4%. T-Mobile shares, meanwhile, have jumped 60%, fuelled by enthusiasm over strong execution of its $23 billion takeover of Sprint.
Hoettges emphasised Deutsche's lead over its competitors in rolling out its German 5G network, adding that geopolitical risks from its reliance on Chinese vendor Huawei are manageable.
DE-RISKING
He said it is hoped that a proposed IT security law being considered in Berlin will create legal clarity soon on assessing the suitability of foreign vendors.
Deutsche Telekom also plans to de-risk by supporting new open technology standards for network gear. 
""We are taking steps to reduce our dependence on Asian suppliers,"" Hoettges said.
The group raised its forecast for 2020 core profit to 35 billion euros ($41.2 billion) after a 49.6% rise in the third quarter. Profit rose 10% on an organic basis after adjusting for the U.S. merger.
Despite the telecoms strength, Deutsche's troubled IT services unit, T-Systems, has seen incoming orders decline by 25% during the coronavirus crisis.
Finance chief Christian Illek said that reduced IT spending by the automotive and airline industries would necessitate additional restructuring at T-Systems on top of its ongoing three-year turnaround plan.
There were also headwinds from a weaker dollar and lower roaming revenue, while merger-related costs in the United States dented cashflow. Group net debt rose to 124.5 billion euros in the quarter after the extension of a U.S. leasing deal.
Illek said leverage including leases was still on track for a target range of 2.25 to 2.75 times within three years, down from 2.9 times.

Deutsche management also confirmed plans to propose an unchanged annual divided of 0.60 euros.

The new forecast, which brings it into line with analysts' estimates, comes as Nissan pursues a turnaround drive that is reversing the rapid expansion led by ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn. The company is cutting production and its vehicle line-up by a fifth, and slashing costs by $2.9 billion over three years.
""We are confident we are on track"" with restructuring plans, Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta told a briefing. He said global car sales volume in September was on a par with last year.
In July-September, Nissan's second quarter, it sold 390,000 cars in China, 4% more than the same period last year. The world's biggest auto market grew by 12.8% in September. 
Nissan's sales fell elsewhere in annual terms, but showed a recovery from the pandemic-ravaged previous quarter, with North America up 35.1% quarter-on-quarter to 300,000 vehicles.
That rebound is benefiting other carmakers too, including local competitors  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co. , which have pushed ahead of Nissan in China and are, for now, also better positioned to tap a North America recovery. 
AGING LINE UP
Nissan, Japan's third-largest automaker, is striving to recover from the scandal surrounding the ousting of Ghosn on financial misconduct allegations, which he denies.
But it has been hobbled by an ageing model line-up as drivers' tastes in North America shift to sport-utility vehicles and large pickups.
Toyota and Honda last week both more than doubled their full-year operating profit forecasts to 2.47 trillion yen and 420 billion yen respectively. 
Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said on Thursday the company had to restore the faith of suppliers and dealers.
""I am committed to building models that embody Nissan-ness,"" he said, without elaborating.
Nissan, Gupta said, was on track to launch six new models in North America within 20 months, including electric cars and models that feature its latest autonomous driving technology.
The company, which has slashed its poorly-performing U.S. fleet business, cut overall inventories by a quarter during the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier, he added.
The maker of the Leaf, the world's first mass-produced electric vehicle, will try to lure consumers in China with nine new models planned over the next five years as demand there increases for mid-sized and large luxury vehicles. 
Amid the pandemic, Nissan said it was also changing the way it sells cars with a shift to online sales, which now account for around a third of sales in China.
ROSIER NUMBERS
Nissan's new prediction for a full-year operating loss of 340 billion yen compares with the 470 billion yen loss it forecast three months ago.
For the second quarter, it posted a 4.83 billion yen loss compared with a 30 billion yen profit last year. But that was much less than the 80.6 billion yen loss forecast on average in a Refinitiv poll of five analysts.
Nissan is 43% owned by  Renault  (PA:RENA) and its second-quarter loss will have a negative impact of 30 million euros ($35 million) on the French carmaker's third-quarter net income. 
Nissan, once viewed as a symbol of Japanese manufacturing prowess, raised its forecast for full-year global vehicles sales to 4.165 million units from 4.13 million units, although that still represents a decline from the previous year.
To weather the coronavirus downturn, Nissan said it had issued $8 billion and 2 billion euros in debt, and had a 2 trillion yen credit line with lenders.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Thursday, with tech stocks outperforming ahead of key inflation and unemployment data, while corporate earnings continue.
At 07:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract fell 179 points, or 0.6%, while S&P 500 futures traded 8 points, or 0.3%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 40 points, or 0.3%. 
Wall Street has bounced strongly this week, helped in no small part  Pfizer  's (NYSE:PFE) news of a successful trial of its Covid-19 vaccine. However, the rotation that followed in favor of cyclical stocks looks to have ended, at least for now, as tech stocks have started to regain favor amid a worrying rise in Covid-19 cases. 
The United States reported over 142,000 new infections on Wednesday, an all-time daily high for a second day in a row, while the number of people hospitalized with the virus climbed almost 65,000, the highest ever during the pandemic. 
New York imposed a new round of social distancing restrictions on Wednesday, in an attempt to protect a state that was hit hard in the early stages of the U.S. outbreak.
This news puts the focus on  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) after the biotech company said on Wednesday it was on track to report early data from a late-stage trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine later this month.
There are also earnings due from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), with its theme park and cruise businesses roiled by Covid-related interruptions, and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which has stumbled this year on weak demand from carriers and small- and mid-sized business customers.
Also of interest Thursday will be key economic data. The October consumer price index is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and is seen rising 0.1%, less than the 0.2% increase the previous month. Initial jobless claims are seen at 735,000, an improvement from the 751,000 filed the week before, while continuing jobless claims are expected to be 6.9 million.
Oil prices consolidated Thursday, after recent strong gains as the International Energy Agency cut forecasts for global oil demand by 1.2 million barrels a day amid new lockdown measures.
Traders are also now looking for the major oil producers, a group known as OPEC+, to maintain supply curbs. These producers meet at the end of the month to discuss a supply increase of 2 million barrels per day scheduled for January, amid growing expectation that the move will be postponed. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's crude oil supply data, due later in the day, will also be of interest.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $41.27 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.4% to $43.61. Both contracts are up more than 12% this week.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,869.00/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1810.

1508,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Burberry Exudes Confidence With Greater Pricing Power,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Nothing expresses confidence quite like putting your prices up in the middle of a global pandemic, which explains why  Burberry  shares hit a five-month high on Wednesday despite posting a set of results where most of the numbers still had minus signs in front of them,
The British luxury fashion group, known for its distinctive checked patterns, said it will reduce the extent of markdowns it offers in response to seeing a strong rebound in sales in the last three months. That will create a revenue “headwind” in the short term but offers the prospect of fatter margins in the medium term.
By 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), Burberry (LON:BRBY) stock was up 3.3%, holding on to most of its early gains on a day when caution returned to European markets in general, against a backdrop of still-high Covid-19 infection rates and public health measures that contributed to a surprise drop in October industrial production in both the U.K. and the euro zone.
“We are encouraged by our overall recovery and the strong response to our brand and product, particularly among new and younger customers,” said chief executive Marco Gobbetti in a statement.
The last six words of that statement will be music to the ears of investors, given the constant risk of luxury brands becoming too closely associated with a particular age bracket.  
The group appeared particularly pleased with the performance of its leather products, a relatively new focus for it. Sales there were up in year-on-year terms even though group sales were down 25% in the six months through September (the travel-dependent wholesale division faring worst).
Burberry’s success was particularly notable in the U.S., where comparable store sales were up by over 20% on the year in the three months through September, with full price channels outperforming. Even accounting for some pent-up demand from store reopenings in the summer, that looks impressive.
Whether that momentum can be sustained may be in doubt, with the rapidly-spreading coronavirus again posing a threat to non-essential stores. However, that threat is nowhere near as great in Asia, the other main source of its profits.
There, comparable store sales were up 10% on the year, with strong growth in mainland China and Korea more than offsetting lost sales in Hong Kong (due to protests) and Australia (due to the seasonal surge in Covid-19.
Mainland China “has enjoyed good double-digit sales growth in full price channels since May,” the company added.
The earnings are consistent with a broader pattern of luxury sales rebounding vigorously through the summer, but the company is still not sounding the all-clear: with the fresh wave of lockdowns expected to hit sales again in the key holiday season (10% of its stores are currently closed). However, a sharp rise in digital sales in the first half suggests that that channel is capable of compensating adequately.
Even so, the group said it won’t reconsider its dividend policy – currently suspended – until the end of its fiscal year in March. Burberry’s confidence is good. Its lack of over-confidence may be even better in the long run."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares were on course on Thursday to end their longest winning streak in over a year, one that has lifted them more than 10%, as the post-U.S. election and coronavirus vaccine bull run paused.
Europe's main markets opened down 0.7% and Wall Street futures fell. For the first time in November, MSCI's 49-country world index was in the red. Asia had finished flat.
Big Tech had rebounded on Wednesday as investors switched back to winners like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). In Europe, investors returned to safe-haven government bonds. 
""What we don't really agree with is that you need to rotate out of tech into value stocks,"" said Willem Sels, chief market strategist at HSBC Private Bank, referring to stocks that do well in normal circumstances when economies are open.
""We don't think either that a recovery (helped by a vaccine) would lead to a sustained sell-off in U.S. Treasuries. The Fed has signalled it is on hold,"" he added.
In the currency market, the euro was near $1.18, in the middle of the $1.16-$1.20 range it's been in since late July. Sterling was down 0.5% amid more Brexit uncertainty and as data showed the UK economy losing speed again.

The New Zealand dollar soared for a second session to a 19-month high as investors unwound bets on the introduction of negative interest rates.
The kiwi got an added boost after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Assistant Governor Christian Hawkesby said the economy required less stimulus than it did in August.
""The weakness in broad USD (dollar) and reflationary momentum in equities, which we saw on the back of the U.S. election and improvements in the vaccine situation, seem to be fading across FX and equities,"" said Christin Tuxen, Head of FX Research at Danske Bank. 
HOLD GOLD
Global oil benchmark Brent snapped three consecutive days of gains to dip to $43.46 a barrel, although it remained near a two-month high. 
Traders were tempering expectations of an early release of a COVID-19 vaccine. The International Energy Agency also raised doubts on Thursday about a quick recovery in demand, amid surging infections in Europe and the United States.
Most of Europe's main economies are already grappling with a wave of infections and new social restrictions. New York also ordered bars and restaurants to start closing early on Wednesday after U.S. cases hit records.
Until the timing of the availability of a vaccine becomes clearer, oil prices ""downside could turn out to be limited, but serious upside potential is unlikely to develop in the immediate future,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also revised its demand forecast on Wednesday, saying global oil demand will recover more slowly in 2021 than previously expected because of rising coronavirus cases.
Safe-haven gold edged up. Spot gold rose 0.4% to $1,872 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures were 0.3% higher.

""We still have some gold,"" HSBC's Sels said. ""With Europe still in lockdown and some political risks remaining, you can't put all your chips on one colour.""

(Reuters) - European shares retreated from eight-month highs on Thursday as surging coronavirus infections raised doubts about a quicker economic rebound and overshadowed several upbeat quarterly earnings reports.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 0.6%, taking some shine off gains of more than 13% this month that had set it on course for its best monthly performance ever.
The banking index (SX7P) led sectoral declines following its best three-day winning streak since the global financial crisis in 2009, while travel stocks (SXTP) fell 0.7% after surging earlier in the week on hopes of a working COVID-19 vaccine.
""This is a calibration of, not capitulation from, the 'vaccine trades' theme that is getting warmed up,"" analysts at Mizuho Bank said.
""Markets are re-assessing given (the mass availability of a vaccine) may take months, while second/third wave resurgence in Europe and the United States is hitting hospitalisations and invoking the re-imposition of restrictions.""
France on Wednesday overtook Russia as the worst affected country in Europe, while Italy surpassed the 1-million infections mark to become one of the top 10 worst-affected countries globally.
The benchmark STOXX 600 has gained more than 40% since a coronavirus-driven crash in March, but it has lagged the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 on fears of a longer road back to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity.
Data on Thursday showed Britain's economy grew by a slower-than-expected 1.1% in September from August even before the latest restrictions on businesses. London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) fell 0.8% after posting eight straight days of gains. (L)
""We expect the latest lockdowns to leave the size of the UK economy some 15% below pre-virus levels, as of November,"" said ING economist James Smith.
""Importantly, this is not quite as stark as was the case back in March/April when the economy slid by 25%. This time, fewer sectors are shut, while arguably businesses are more geared up for the lockdown.""
In company news, German engineering group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) shed 4.4% even as it reported better-than-expected profit at its industrial business.
Zurich Insurance Group (S:ZURN) rose 0.8% as it said its new life insurance business picked up in the third quarter, while Italy's top insurer Generali (MI:GASI) lost 0.8% after saying it would not pay the second tranche of the dividend on 2019 results this year.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, as investors take some profits after this week’s strong gains, mindful of the fact that the timeframe for getting effective vaccines distributed still leaves the Covid-19 virus plenty of time to hurt the economy still further.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde cautioned Wednesday over expecting too much too soon from a Covid-19 vaccine.
“While the latest news on a vaccine looks encouraging, we could still face recurring cycles of accelerating viral spread and tightening restrictions until widespread immunity is achieved,” Lagarde said at the ECB Forum on Central Banking.
Economic data Thursday showed the U.K. economy grew by 15.5% in the July-September quarter, a rebound of sorts from the record-breaking fall of 19.8% between April and June. However, growth slowed to 1.1% in September, from August’s 2.1%, suggesting more tough times to come.

DUBAI (Reuters) - State-owned Emirates said on Thursday that Dubai would help it through the coronavirus crisis after losses of $3.4 billion tipped the airline's holding company into its first half-year loss in more than thirty years.
Emirates said global travel restrictions meant revenue dropped by 75% to $3.2 billion as passenger traffic fell by 95% to 1.5 million in the six months to the end of September.
""We have been able to tap on our own strong cash reserves, and through our shareholder and the broader financial community, we continue to ensure we have access to sufficient funding to sustain the business and see us through this challenging period,"" Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum said.
The Dubai government would support the airline on its recovery path, said Sheikh Ahmed, who is also a senior member of Dubai's ruling family and holds senior positions in government.
Emirates temporarily suspended most of its flights at the height of the pandemic, which has decimated global travel.
The airline filled just 38.6%% of the seats on offer, though saw high demand for freight due to limited availability of air cargo services globally due to the drop in passenger flights.
Emirates, which a year ago reported a $235 million half-year profit, received $2 billion in state assistance from the Dubai government between April and September this year, which the airline said was an equity investment. 
The airline's entire operation is dependent on international demand as it does not operate domestic flights. 
Emirates Group, which includes the airline and other aviation and travel assets, saw revenue plunge 74% to $3.7 billion and made a loss of $3.8 billion.
The last time Emirates airline reported a loss was for the financial year 1987-88, and that was primarily due to the costs of its start-up operations, a spokeswoman said.
The number of Group employees had reduced 24% between April and September to 81,334, it said, without disclosing the number of airline staff.

Sources have told Reuters that thousands of airline employees, including pilots and flight attendants, have lost their jobs at Emirates this year.

Global stock markets have soared this week following the positive news from U.S. pharmaceutical giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) over the Covid-19 vaccine it is developing, in conjunction with German partner Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX). 
However, some of this optimism is starting to wane as investors take stock of the logistical challenges of mass-producing and transporting the vaccine as well as the number of Covid-19 cases throughout Europe showing no signs of slowing down.

In corporate news, Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) raised its earnings guidance as its reported forecast-beating third-quarter results, lifted by outperformance at its recently-merged U.S. unit T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS).
German engineering group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) also reported better-than-expected profit at its industrial business. In the U.K., luxury fashion group Burberry said it would push its prices up after its sales nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels in its fiscal second quarter, while insurer and asset manager Legal & General announced a new five-year dividend growth policy.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday, buoyed by news of a potential coronavirus vaccine and signs of falling U.S. crude inventories.
Traders are also now looking for the major oil producers, a group known as OPEC+, to maintain supply curbs. OPEC+ meets at the end of the month to discuss a supply increase of 2 million barrels per day scheduled for January, amid growing expectation that the move will be postponed. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's crude oil supply data, due later in the day, will also be of interest.

ZURICH (Reuters) - German engineering group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) on Thursday reported better-than-expected profit at its industrial business in the final set of results overseen by long-standing Chief Executive Joe Kaeser.
The trains to factory software-maker said it expected market conditions to improve next year as the global economy made a cautious recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Although an improvement, the recovery in company and government spending on machinery and systems will lag behind the recovery in gross domestic product, the company said.
""While we anticipate that important customer industries for Siemens will continue to face challenges related to the pandemic and industry-specific structural changes ... we expect improved conditions particularly for our high-margin shortcycle businesses in the second half of fiscal 2021,"" the Munich company said.
For the three months to the end of September, Siemens posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) of 2.64 billion euros ($3.11 billion), beating analyst forecasts for 1.98 billion euros in a company-gathered poll. 
Group revenue of 15.31 billion euros missed forecasts for 15.50 billion euros, although orders of 15.56 billion euros were better than expected. Both figures were lower than a year earlier as demand was hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Kaeser described the performance as a ""strong finish to a remarkable year,"" while in its outlook Siemens said it expected a moderate increase in net income in 2021 from the 4.2 billion euros posted in 2020 as the world economy recovers.
The results were the final earnings under Kaeser, who has spent 40 years at Siemens and has reshaped the company during his seven year stint as CEO. 
Although he will remain CEO until the company's shareholder meeting in Feb. 2021, Kaeser's successor - deputy CEO Roland Busch - took over the operational running of the business in October.
During Kaeser's tenure Siemens has transformed into a more technology-focused concern, moving away from a sprawling light bulb to gas turbine conglomerate to focus on smart buildings and factory automation as well as its mobility division, which makes trains and rail signaling.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 02:05AM ET</span>","Uniqlo revives Jil Sander tie-up in post-pandemic, upmarket push","By Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO (Reuters) - Baggy pants and oversized t-shirts helped spare Japanese fashion brand Uniqlo from the steep coronavirus-led fall in sales that hit rival fashion chains such as H&M and Zara.
Now, Uniqlo founder and CEO Tadashi Yanai has shifted his sights to post-pandemic consumer spending, and he's betting that the world's third-biggest clothing chain will need to sell more than comfortable roomwear and 2,900 yen ($27.50) down vests to achieve his dream of making it No. 1.
On Friday, Uniqlo will begin selling a new collection that revives a popular tie-up with German minimalist designer Jil Sander, with looks and prices beyond the store's usual lineup.
Dubbed ""+J"", the partnership comes over a decade after Uniqlo's first collaboration with Sander helped to bolster the fashion credentials of the Japanese chain best known at the time for its cheap and colourful fleece jackets.
The latest +J collection includes tailored blazers, cashmere-wool blended coats, and Supima cotton dress shirts for both sexes, mostly in black, navy, burgundy and white. 
The shift upmarket will give Uniqlo a new sales avenue but is not without risk, coming at a time when Japan, the chain's biggest single market, is stuck in recession with consumers worried about a prolonged pandemic.
The new collection's wool-cashmere blend coats, at 22,900 yen, rank among the highest-priced items in Uniqlo history.
Few other Uniqlo items currently cost over 20,000 yen, with a padded parka from Uniqlo U, a relatively fashion-forward collection directed by French designer Christophe LeMaire, now on sale for under 6,000 yen.
HIGH PRICE TAGS
On Twitter, many Uniqlo fans expressed excitement about the return of its collaboration with Sanders, a design legend, but just as many lamented the high price tags.
""It's very difficult to move upmarket. People have a very, very strong opinion about what prices they want to pay when it comes to Uniqlo and those prices are out of that range,"" said Mike Allen, an analyst covering Japanese retailers at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
Some analysts also cited unsuccessful attempts by other casual brands that have tried to go upmarket, including J.Crew, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. A shift towards a higher price bracket is often blamed by analysts for hastening J.Crew's decline.
But many see little other choice for Uniqlo as competition intensifies, including from previously unknown names like Chinese online brand Shein that have emerged in a now-recovered China market.
In Japan, Workman (T:7564), previously a favourite of construction and factory workers, is moving into general fashion. Globally, Uniqlo also faces tough competition from outdoor and sports brands such as North Face and  Nike  (N:NKE).
Surveys have found that Uniqlo clothes already make up at least one out of 10 items in the average Japanese wardrobe.
""It's going to be difficult to expand market share further, so they need another channel, and that's higher-priced merchandise,"" Jefferies' Allen said.
THE L-WORD
Nicole Fall, the founder of consultancy Asian Consumer Intelligence, said the new collection was well-timed as people want to appear professional when they return to their offices, ""particularly as unemployment creeps up and further retrenchment exercises are carried out.""
A focus on quality over low prices was also in line with the industry's post-pandemic shift away from fast fashion, she added.
""The business model cannot sustain low volume and low prices but it can evolve to fewer pieces at a slightly higher price point, particularly if the items are associated with the prestige Jil Sander name,"" Fall said.
Yanai, while maintaining his ambition of making Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing (T:9983) the world's biggest clothing company, has recently been telling investors that the company wants to focus on clothes made to last, with innovative fabrics and attention to details like zippers and buttons, rather than churning out high volumes of on-trend items. 
In an interview with Wallpaper, Sander, who no longer runs the eponymous brand she founded, described +J as a ""shop window for Uniqlo to show what level of luxury the company can achieve.""
But Uniqlo executives deny they're aiming for luxury. 

""What we want to provide is something authentic, something crafted to perfection... and offer it not just to a certain segment but to everyone,"" said Yukihiro Katsuta, head of Uniqlo's R&D.

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) has poached  Barclays ' insurance banker Marguerite Bion to win more business from Europe's biggest insurers as industry consolidation heats up amid anaemic profitability and tightening regulation.
Bion, who started her career at  Citigroup  (N:C) in 2001 and spent the last decade at Barclays (L:BARC), will join Goldman in February as a London-based managing director in its EMEA financial institution group (FIG), reporting to European FIG head Dirk Lievens, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
French-born Bion has advised continental European insurers, including the likes of France's AXA (PA:AXAF), Switzerland's Zurich Insurance Group (S:ZURN) and Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) on a variety of deals and will continue overseeing their M&A plans in her new role at Goldman.
Her appointment comes amid a flurry of transactions in the insurance industry as low interest rates and weak profits are pressuring companies to seek domestic deal synergies while hunting for growth abroad.
Goldman Sachs is currently advising British insurer RSA (L:RSA) on a 7.2 billion pound takeover approach from a consortium of Canadian insurer Intact Financial and Danish insurer Tryg.

Bion will mainly focus on French and European insurance accounts, building on Goldman's recent advisory work for the likes of AXA which appointed the Wall Street bank to sell its Central and Eastern European business to Austrian insurer Uniqa in February.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Positive data on an experimental COVID-19 vaccine has improved the outlook for high-yield credit, especially for companies slammed by the coronavirus pandemic, said Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO).
Ivascyn also told Reuters in an interview that prospects for a split U.S. Congress after last week's election has dampened stimulus prospects, making it more likely Treasury yields will remain range-bound despite a recent rally.
While rising coronavirus cases should make for a ""bumpy next several weeks or months, help is on the way,"" Ivascyn said, referring to developments like  Pfizer 's (N:PFE) announcement Monday that initial trial results indicated its vaccine was more than 90% effective.
""If you look through this period of uncertainty, you get to a place where we think risk assets can perform reasonably well."" 
Airlines, hospitality, travel and gaming are among sectors Ivascyn said he finds attractive, particularly if there is progress early next year on containing the virus. 
Two days after the vaccine announcement, spreads of the riskiest U.S. corporate bonds over Treasuries on Wednesday remained near their narrowest since February. (MERH0A0) 
Ivascyn noted that companies in pandemic-hit sectors have had to offer investors attractive collateral packages and covenants on bonds in order to raise new debt. 
While a vaccine is good news for corporate credit, the confidence it could spark in the U.S. economy lowers the chances of lawmakers passing a large stimulus package. And without a significant increase in new debt offered by the U.S. Treasury, ""we're a little bit more constructive on rates remaining range-bound,"" Ivascyn said. 
Ivascyn expects inflation to remain subdued without a flood of new Treasury supply. Longer-dated Treasury bonds are particularly sensitive to inflation expectations and therefore likely to remain anchored in that scenario, producing a flatter yield curve.
Pfizer's announcement sent the benchmark 10-year yield (US10YT=RR) to its highest since March, edging close to 1%. The yield curve steepened sharply. 

Vaccine progress, however, will not significantly affect Federal Reserve policy plans, said Ivascyn, who expects interest rates to be held near zero for several years, accompanied by quantitative easing.

Chinese airlines will need 8,600 new airplanes through 2039, 6.3% higher than Boeing's previous prediction of 8,090 planes last year. Those would be worth $1.4 trillion based on list prices, the U.S. planemaker said in a statement. 
In October, Boeing cut its 20-year forecast for global airplane demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""While COVID-19 has severely impacted every passenger market worldwide, China's fundamental growth drivers remain resilient and robust,"" said Richard Wynne, managing director, China Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. 
""Not only has China's recovery from COVID-19 outpaced the rest of the world, but also continued government investments toward improving and expanding its transportation infrastructure, large regional traffic flows, and a flourishing domestic market mean this region of the world will thrive.”
China's domestic aviation market has rebounded to pre-COVID levels but as international travel remains effectively shut down, Chinese airlines have been pushing back deliveries.
Boeing and its European rival, Airbus SE (PA:AIR), have been jostling to increase market share in China, but they also face rising competition from state-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC).
COMAC has been steadily delivering its regional ARJ21 to customers throughout the pandemic and its narrowbody C919, which is still in flight testing phase, is expected to obtain an airworthiness certificate from China's aviation regulator next year. 
The regulator has declined to lay out a timeline for the return of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX even though the United States is expected to approve its return to the skies as early as next week.

Boeing projected a need for 6,450 new single-aisle airplanes over the next 20 years, while China's widebody fleet will require 1,590 new planes, accounting for 18% of the total deliveries, which fell from a year ago due to anticipation of a slower recovery in global long-haul traffic.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly down on Thursday morning, with a global stocks rally coming to a halt as optimism over the quick availability of a COVID-19 vaccine wanes.
The positive results from  Pfizer  Inc's (NYSE:PFE) vaccine candidate BNT-162b2 that it is co-developing with BioNTech (F:22UAy), announced earlier in the week, sent global stocks soaring on hopes for a cure and subsequent economic recovery. However, investors took stock of the logistical challenges of mass-producing and transporting the vaccine, the increasing number of global COVID-19 cases and indications of an overheated equities market.
The 10% surge seen in global equities this month could be at risk as the Northern Hemisphere enters the winter season and the risk of an explosion of cases due to the colder weather. There are worries that more countries could implement tougher measures to curb the virus’ spread, with countries such as France, Germany, the U.K. and several U.S. states already re-implementing lockdowns.
“In the near term, the resurgence of the virus is beginning to create new worries … it looks like this will end up being a W-shaped recovery,” Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc chief economist Torsten Slok told Bloomberg.
However, countering the gloom was positive news from the developers of other COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Russia said on Wednesday that its Sputnik V vaccine candidate showed 92% efficacy, with 20 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported among the volunteers who took part in the placebo-controlled phase III trial. In the U.S.,  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) said on the same day that the accumulation of data for a first analysis of its vaccine mRNA-1273 is complete and expects to have an announcement on the vaccine's efficacy by the end of the month.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.16% by 11:28 PM ET (3:28 AM GMT). The National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC)’s Wednesday resolution disqualifying any lawmakers in Hong Kong's Legislative Council deemed insufficiently patriotic, without going through the city’s courts, increased U.S.-China tensions. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien warned that the U.S. would “continue to utilize all the powers granted” under various laws and “identify and sanction those responsible for extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom,” after four opposition legislators were immediately de-seated and the remaining fifteen opposition legislators resigned en-masse via a joint press briefing later in the day.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.23% while the ShenzhenComponent was up 0.76%. Chinese tech stocks are still digesting a $290 billion wipeout following the State Administration for Market Regulation’s issuance on Tuesday of draft regulations aimed at rooting out monopolistic practices in the internet industry.
Meanwhile,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding (HK:9988) posted sales of CNY498.2 billion ($75.25 billion) by the end of the day on Wednesday for its annual Singles’ Day shopping extravaganza, surpassing the previous year’s $38 billion total. The company smashed the previous year’s total despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the gloom over the draft regulations coming a day before the event.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.46% while South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.37%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.54%.
Elsewhere, central bankers including European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at the online “Central Banks in a Shifting World” forum later in the day.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Sony  Corp (T:6758)'s PlayStation 5 (PS5) console launched in core markets on Thursday to intense interest online, but with first day real-world sales limited to pre-order pick-ups due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has driven a boom in gaming demand.
Sony (NYSE:SNE) has made launch sales online only to maintain social distancing, calling for consumers to ""be safe, stay home, and place your order online"".
The next-generation console, which retails for $500 or $400 without a disk-drive, was sold out on major retailing sites in Japan with some conducting lotteries to distribute limited stock.
On Japan's top flea market platform from Mercari Inc, consoles were selling for more than $900.
Pent-up demand for the PS5, which offers cutting-edge graphics, faster load times and a new controller with immersive feedback, has been exacerbated by the pandemic, which has seen consumers flock to gaming but has strained supply chains.

Investing.com – The Dow ended lower Wednesday, as weakness in value stocks offset strength in technology amid signs of further restrictions in parts of the U.S. to curb the spread of Covid-19.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.08%, or 23 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 2.01%.
Weakness in value stocks weighed on the broader market as the recent wave of positive vaccine news faded on further signs of coronavirus-led restrictions in the U.S. Gov.

1527,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 03:56PM ET</span>","Consumer Prices, Disney, Cisco: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Tech investors swooped in Wednesday to buy the dip, pushing the NASDAQ Composite higher and letting some of the steam out of a post-election run-up for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
It was a reversal of a trend seen in the last few days, boosted by Monday’s news that a coronavirus vaccine finally may be right around the corner. 
Optimism about a vaccine has helped markets overcome worries about record-high new Covid-19 cases and rising hospitalizations. Some localities have had to reverse reopening plans to stop the rapidly escalating spread of the virus.
With lawmakers now back in Washington for a lame duck session, attention will turn to whether an agreement can be reached on a new stimulus package -- and how much it should be. The threat of massive new shutdowns may help Democrats make the case that more financial aid to individuals, businesses and local governments is better.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Economic data puts focus on the progress of reopenings
Data on consumer prices comes out Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The consumer price index for October is seen rising 0.1%, which would be less than the 0.2% increase the previous month. From last year, the CPI is seen rising 1.3% compared to the 1.4% gain in September.
Unemployment is also in view with the weekly release of claims data at the same time as the inflation data. Initial jobless claims are seen at 735,000, which would be an improvement over 751,000 filed the week before. Continuing jobless claims are expected to be 6.9 million, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
An important measure of oil demand will also come out at 11:00 AM ET (1500 GMT). The Energy Information Administration’s crude oil inventory report is expected to show a draw of 913,000 barrels. Earlier this week, the industry’s own report showed a bigger-than-expected draw of 5.1 million barrels.
2.  Disney  earnings: A tale of two companies
The Hollywood giant has been pulled every which way by Covid-related business interruptions. Its theme park and cruise businesses are reeling from closures and limited occupancy reopenings. Its movie and television production has been stymied by similar interruptions. But its streaming operations are seen benefiting from stay-at-home consumers, though it might be too early for that.
Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is seen reporting a loss of 73 cents a share on revenue of $14 billion. 
3. Cisco seen with lower results on weak demand
The networking giant has stumbled this year on weak demand from carriers and small- and mid-sized business customers, which make up about one-third of its business. The company is forecasting a 9% to 11% decline in results for the quarter ended in October, about the same as the one that ended in July.
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) is seen reporting per-share profit of 70 cents on revenue of $11.8 billion.

1528,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Trump Makes Last Push to Speed Up Chicken Lines Despite Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) -- Coronavirus cases are rising, but the Trump administration is making its last push to allow chicken slaughterhouses to speed up production lines, potentially threatening social distancing crucial to keeping workers safe.
Three days after President Donald Trump lost his re-election bid, the U.S. Department of Agriculture submitted a proposal to raise the maximum line speed by 25% to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. That’s typically the last step before a proposed regulation is published.
The move risks bringing back a wave of coronavirus infections that shut several meat plants earlier this year just as the winter kicks in and cases surge across the U.S. Critics also say it’s a lame-duck payoff to poultry producers that have been long-time supporters of Trump, who is fighting to keep office. It’s unclear if a final rule could be issued before President-elect Joe Biden takes over.
“They are racing through a rule that could very seriously endanger workers and consumers,” said Deborah Berkowitz, a former senior Labor Department official in the Obama administration. “This is the political payback to the poultry industry for being very close and supporting the administration.”
The Obama-Biden administration rejected proposals to allow faster processing lines at chicken plants after two years of study, said Berkowitz, who was chief of staff and a senior policy adviser for the Occupational Safety & Health Administration. Democratic presidential primary candidates Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris also backed legislation to prohibit USDA from granting line-speed waivers.
A USDA spokesman said the agency has been gathering data and assessing the ability of chicken plants to maintain process controls for years and that this proposal was already on the regulatory agenda this spring, before the elections. He also highlighted that line speeds apply to the evisceration process, which is mainly done by machines and not people.
In a notice on the OMB website, the agency said the change would allow poultry processors “to slaughter birds more efficiently while continuing to ensure food safety and effective online carcass inspection.”
Meat and poultry workers have been especially hard hit by the pandemic, with at least 19,800 infected or exposed to the virus and at least 128 deaths, according to the the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. Faster line speeds could mean more workers at factories at one time and also increase employee injuries, said Marc Perrone, president of the union, which represents more than 250,000 meatpacking and food processing workers.
“Slower line speeds protect workers from injuries and ensure safe social distancing to stop the spread of virus,” he said. “With poultry line speeds already moving at a breathtaking pace, any effort to increase these speeds is a direct threat to worker safety.”
The Trump administration has already used executive authority to loosen meat processing regulations. Last year, the USDA eliminated maximum line speeds for hog slaughterhouses. The department has also issued waivers to permit individual poultry plants to operate at line speeds above the current federal maximum of 140 chickens bird per minute.
“The modernized system has been studied, debated, and reviewed in depth for 20+ years to assure its effectiveness in further modernizing chicken inspection while improving food safety and protecting workers,” said Tom Super, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council, an industry association.
The USDA spokesman added injuries are dropping among poultry-processing workers. The reported injury and illness rate dropped to 3.2 per 100 full-time workers in 2019, down from 4.2 per 100 full time workers in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
There’s also a period of public comment and review that’s typically required after the publication of a proposed rule, which means it may not be approved before Trump steps down.
Berkowitz, who is now at the National Employment Law Project, pointed to the political support for Trump from industry giants, while Perrone urged Biden to reverse the proposed Trump regulation if it is issued before the Democrat takes office.
The USDA in April authorized a record amount of line-speed waivers in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that sickened thousands of workers at poultry plants, hitting chicken production. The waivers are being challenged in court by unions as “arbitrary and capricious” use of regulatory authority. The proposed rule change would eliminate the need for waivers.

Investing.com – The Dow gave up gains Wednesday, on weakness in value stocks amid signs of further restrictions in parts of the U.S. to curb the spread of Covid-19.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.18%, or 54 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.57%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.75%.
Weakness in value stocks weighed on the broader market as the vaccine optimism jolt to value stocks appeared to run out of steam amid further signs of coronavirus-led restrictions in the U.S. Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered bars and restaurants licensed by the State Liquor Authority to close their indoor areas at 10 p.m, while gyms must also shut at 10PM.
Industrials, materials, and financials were in the red as U.S. coronavirus hospitalizations surpassed 60,000 for the first time Tuesday, the COVID Tracking Project reported Wednesday.


Bargain-seeking investors swooped in to scoop up big tech, with the Fab 5 leading the broader market higher.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose, with the latter up nearly 3%.
Apple announced three new Mac computers late-Tuesday, powered by its M1 chip instead of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors, marking the end of its 15-year relationship with the chipmaker.
In other news, Chinese tech stocks including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) face scrutiny as the Chinese government looks to clampdown on the monopoly power of big tech.
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which ended 10% lower overnight Asia, pared gains after a positive start to the U.S. session on news that its sales event, known as Singles' Day, generated record sales of more than $74 billion.
Still, Wall Street continues to tout further gains for the broader market on hopes a rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine will likely add steel to the global economy, while a divided Congress would dim the odds of president-elect Joe Biden's unfriendly market policies such as tax hikes winning the backing of lawmakers.
Goldman Sachs raised its 2020 outlook for the S&P 500 index to 3,700 from a previous estimate of 3,600. Assuming a Republican-controlled Senate, there would be ""little scope for major legislative changes,"" and the recent vaccine news is a ""positive event that will allow society to gradually normalize during 2021,"" the bank said.
The prospect of a dividend Congress was boosted after Republican Senator Dan Sullivan won re-election in Alaska, extending the GOP lead to 50-48.
In other news, LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) said it expects to become EBITDA profitable by the fourth quarter of next year after reporting quarterly revenue that topped Wall Street estimates, sending its shares up 1.5%."
1531,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Lame-Duck Trump Has Potential to Upset Markets With Final Acts,"(Bloomberg) -- Though the most scrutinized Twitter feed in finance is on track to lose much of its power on Jan. 20, that still leaves about 10 weeks for President Donald Trump to roil markets.
After President-elect Joe Biden’s win is certified, Trump will enter the so-called lame duck phase of his presidency with a capacity for disruption that is formidable. Any number of executive decisions might leave investors on tenterhooks. Already, he’s ousted his defense chief and remade the leadership at the Pentagon.
Disputes with China spanning commerce, technology and human rights, the trade spat with Europe, and the upcoming deadline on U.S. government funding in December all offer the potential for market-moving action. The current Congress remains in place through the end of the year. Earlier this week, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said the Trump administration is “not finished yet” with getting tough on China.
“An aggrieved and outgoing President Trump may not be in a very cooperative mood, resulting in a shutdown-standoff that could bruise an already ailing U.S. economy burdened with an ongoing pandemic,” wrote Gabrielle Debinski of GZERO Media, a subsidiary of the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy. “The upcoming lame-duck session could be more tumultuous than ever.”
Investors only have to go back to October to see how a barrage of unilateral presidential action can shake markets. U.S. stocks slid and Treasuries surged after Trump tweeted that he had decided to halt stimulus talks.
Pricing in futures markets -- where January contracts on the Cboe Volatility Index are trading above both December and February levels -- suggests traders are braced for the possibility of a heightened period of turbulence.
China Trade
Trade with China is the most obviously vulnerable area for global markets, not least because Trump blames the country for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. that likely aided his electoral defeat. Asia investors spent much of 2018 anxiously awaiting pronouncements from the president on trade. Trump can bypass Congress and raise or lower tariffs on a variety of goods and services.
The forced de-listing of Chinese firms from U.S. stock exchanges is another potential market-moving step to target Beijing -- one that has been mulled by the administration from some time. This week, the U.S. imposed sanctions on four more officials accused of undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy.
Meanwhile, the European Union’s imposition of tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. goods starting Tuesday is an escalation of a dispute over illegal aid to aircraft manufacturers Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), and has the potential to spark a retaliation that would impact the region’s markets.
The Swamp
Domestic political maneuvers and presidential pardons are a traditional feature of lame-duck periods of departing American leaders, and one that on the face of it shouldn’t have much market impact.
But Mark Tinker, a former Axa SA strategist and founder of Market Thinking Ltd., raises the possibility that an attempt to settle scores with political insiders might lead to some disruption.
“One intriguing suggestion is that between now and inauguration, Trump, with little to lose, could simply de-classify large amounts of documents pertaining to the activities of what he has always referred to as ‘The Swamp,’” Tinker wrote in a note Tuesday. “Whether the markets are prepared for that remains to be seen.”
Trump is still tweeting that he will end up winning the Nov. 3 election. But some commentators expect the president will step down without causing havoc once his terms runs out.
“I’m assuming that when the time comes, Donald Trump will leave the White House peaceably,” Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research Inc., wrote in a note to clients Monday.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",Federal judge dismisses some claims by Apple in fight against Epic Games: Bloomberg News,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in California late on Tuesday dismissed some of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s counterclaims against Epic Games, Bloomberg News reported, narrowing the scope of a dispute that has seen the online game maker's ""Fortnite"" game removed from the iPhone maker's App Store.
Apple and Epic have been in a legal battle since August, when the maker of the popular game launched its own in-app payment system to circumvent what it called Apple's monopolistic practices.
Epic in October had filed a motion in advance of Tuesday's hearing, seeking the dismissal of Apple's counterclaims of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and conversion, where in Apple had asked for lost App Store fees and other monetary damages.
Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) threw out those claims and limited Apple's allegations to its breach of contract counterclaims against Epic.
A judge in October had ruled that Apple could bar Epic's ""Fortnite"" game from its App Store but must not harm Epic's developer tools business, including the ""Unreal Engine"" software, which is used by hundreds of other video games.
""This is a high-stakes breach of contract case and an antitrust case and that's all in my view,"" Judge Gonzalez Rogers told lawyers, according to Bloomberg News.
""You can't just say it's independently wrongful,"" Bloomberg quoted https://bloom.bg/3pgZDlx the judge as saying to a lawyer for Apple, referring to Epic's conduct. ""You actually have to have facts,"" the judge said, adding that the rest of the breach-of-contract case moves forward.
Apple and Epic did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. The iPhone maker told Bloomberg that it disagreed with the judge's decision on Tuesday, adding that it was clear that Epic breached its contract with the company.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",How the U.S. stock market has treated new presidents,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden is likely to start his term faced with the worst public health crisis in decades and an economy still reeling from a sharp coronavirus-led contraction earlier this year.
U.S. stocks, however, have surged in recent days, fueled by ebbing election uncertainty and hopes that a vaccine against COVID-19 will eventually help to curb paralyzing lockdowns and travel restrictions and bring life back to normal.
Here’s a look at how the markets have fared following previous presidential elections, as well as how stocks have performed in a new president’s first few months on the job. 
POST-ELECTION WEEK
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 performance over first five trading days after election - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xklvybkzgpg/chart.png)
Dissipating election uncertainty and positive data from a late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial boosted the S&P 500 a little over 5% in the first five trading days since the Nov. 3 vote, the index’s best post-election week performance in at least four decades. 
THE IN-BETWEEN TIME
(GRAPHIC: Stock market from Election Day to inauguration - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ELECTION/yzdpxamygvx/chart.png)
Looking at the stretch between Election Day and the presidential inauguration, the market's surge in the months ahead of President Donald Trump's inauguration stands out. 
The S&P 500 rose 5.8% with Trump as President-elect, stoked by bets that his promised tax cuts would boost growth and inflation.
Former President Barack Obama, on the other hand, was first elected as the U.S. economy was spiraling down into the Great Financial Crisis, accounting in part for the S&P 500's decline of 15.5% between his election victory on Nov 4, 2008 and his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009.
While Biden’s interregnum period is off to a good start, investors see plenty of risks ahead. Those include a second wave of COVID-19 sparking fresh lockdowns throughout the United States, political uncertainty over Trump’s efforts to challenge election results, and Senate runoffs in Georgia scheduled for January that could give Democrats greater sway over that chamber. 
THE FIRST 100 DAYS
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 - First 100 days - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ELECTION/nmopaybgqpa/chart.png)
Stocks have typically given a warm welcome to new presidents, although it's hard to tell whether that performance has been spurred by the arrival of a new chief executive or simply a reflection of the market's tendency to trend higher over time. 
The S&P 500 has risen in the first 100 calendar days of eight out of the last 10 presidential terms. But it has also gone higher in that period roughly 75% of the time in the last forty years, regardless of whether a new president had just been inaugurated.
FED SUPPORT
(GRAPHIC: Fed's helping hand - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqargkvx/Pasted%20image%201604609874686.png)

The Federal Reserve will likely continue providing major support for markets at the start of Biden’s presidency, as it has for most of 2020. The central bank’s pledge to keep doling out stimulus to the economy has boosted investor confidence this year, and the Fed’s balance sheet is expected to grow to $9.1 trillion by Dec 2021, a recent Reuters poll showed.

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 01:11PM ET</span>","Alibaba's Singles Day sales top $74 billion, planned rules hit shares","By Josh Horwitz
HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) sales for its post-COVID-19 Singles' Day shopping extravaganza hit $74 billion, a haul that was overshadowed by a 10% drop in its shares on Wednesday after China published draft anti-trust rules aimed at internet platforms.
The world's biggest sales event - eclipsing Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States - spanned 11 days this year, and brought sellers on AliBaba's platforms 21 times as many orders by value as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s two-day global Prime Day last month.
Such is its size that its performance is widely considered indicative of China's post-virus economic recovery.
Alibaba rivals JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc as well as firms such as Douyin - the Chinese version of Beijing ByteDance Technology Co Ltd's TikTok - also held Singles' Day events.
""Because of COVID-19, many Chinese cannot go overseas,"" Vice President Liu Bo told reporters. ""This actually stimulates online consumption.""
Alibaba gave shoppers more time to shop this year, setting primary discount days for Nov. 1 through Nov. 3 as well as the usual Nov. 11, and is calculating gross merchandise volume (GMV) over all 11 days.
GMV hit 498.2 billion yuan ($74.1 billion) Alibaba said, as lockdown-weary consumers splashed out on as many as 16 million discounted goods at the event. 
JD.com, which started promotions on Nov. 1, said it generated 271.5 billion yuan in trade over the same period.
The performance provided little relief for Alibaba investors as they focused on the proposed anti-monopoly rules that could increase scrutiny on e-commerce marketplaces and payment services. 
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Hong Kong-listed shares closed 9.8% down, in line with other Chinese tech giants. The group lost about 10% of its market value last week when regulators scuppered the listing of fintech affiliate Ant Group. 
Its New York-listed shares were 1.3% down by 1450 GMT. 
KATY PERRY AND MOBILE GAMES
The event, launched in 2009, is usually a glitzy, single-day affair with live performances. Last year, it clocked record GMV of $38.4 billion. This year, U.S. singer Katy Perry appeared at Alibaba's gala, albeit via livestream.
As well as offering straightforward price cuts, the event allowed shoppers across Alibaba's platforms to play mobile games for deals, combine purchases across shops and place orders in the sale's early hours to get the best offers.
Over 340 firms, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), L'Oreal SA and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], exceeded 100 million yuan in sales, with 13 brands recording GMV above 1 billion yuan, Alibaba said.
Analysts also expect this year to be a boon for luxury brands, as consumers accustomed to going overseas for high-end goods have been thwarted by coronavirus border closures.
But many shoppers had modest budgets.

A poll of Singles' Day spending by Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Entertainment found just 4% of 191,000 respondents planned to splurge over 10,000 yuan, versus 43% who aimed to spend less than 1,000 yuan.

Lufthansa warned last week it would burn through more cash in the fourth quarter than in the third and that further restructuring measures would weigh on its results as it struggles to cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lufthansa and its subsidiaries Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian and Brussels Airlines are slashing their schedules, fleet and staff, with air travel not expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels before 2025. It aims to reduce 22,000 full-time jobs.
Lufthansa said 24,000 ground staff would forgo their usual Christmas bonus in 2020 and 2021 as well as vacation bonuses until the end of 2021, while the company will also cut the amount it tops up government payments to staff working short-time.
Together these measures will cut personnel costs by up to half in 2021, depending on the total hours worked.
In return, Lufthansa promised not to make forced layoffs in 2021, while offering partial retirement and voluntary redundancy programmes. It will continue talks on long-term cuts in labour costs from Jan. 1, 2022 when government compensation ends.

Verdi said its members still had to vote on the deal.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Sanctions on Russia gas pipeline included in annual U.S. defense bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sanctions that could hinder one of Moscow's most important projects in Europe, the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, have been included in the annual U.S. defense policy bill, two congressional aides said on Wednesday.
The sanctions in the compromise National Defense Authorization Act between lawmakers in the House and Senate would penalize companies facilitating the construction of the pipeline, including ships helping operations to lay pipelines or moving rock formations on the sea bed. 
The sanctions also target companies providing insurance or secondary insurance for its construction and certification for the pipeline in Denmark. The bill would become law only after being passed by both chambers in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump.
The $11 billion Nord Stream 2, led by Russia's state energy company Gazprom (MM:GAZP), would double its existing pipeline capacity to take gas undersea to Europe via Germany. It would bypass Ukraine, which depends on lucrative transit fees. 
Gazprom and Germany say Nord Stream 2 is purely a commercial project. Gas demand in Germany is growing as it cuts dependence on nuclear and coal power. 
The Trump administration and lawmakers from both parties believe the pipeline would strengthen President Vladimir Putin's economic and political influence over Europe. The Trump administration also supports boosting exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
The sanctions backers hope the measures will prevent Gazprom from using the Akademik Cherskiy, a Russian pipe-laying vessel, to finish a final 99 mile (160 km) stretch of the project in Danish waters. 
The agreement, first reported by Bloomberg, includes language from an earlier bill spearheaded by Senators Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Ted Cruz, a Republican.
Nord Stream 2 spokesperson Jens Mueller said the company had yet to evaluate details of the draft bill but that the Cruz-Shaheen legislation would directly or indirectly hit about 120 companies from more than 12 European countries. 
""It is up to governments and the European Commission to protect European companies from illegal extraterritorial sanctions,"" Mueller said. 

The bill also includes a provision from Representative Eliot Engel, a Democrat and the leader of House Foreign Affairs, requiring allies to be notified before imposition of sanctions. Engel has opposed the project but has said that sanctions could leave Russia ""off the hook"" while hitting European companies helping the project.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>",Wall Street is not overly worried Trump can overturn election,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock investors have expressed concerns that President Donald Trump's effort to contest the U.S. election without evidence could roil markets temporarily, but few appeared seriously worried that challenges to the results will succeed. 
Ahead of the election, analysts had said a key risk to financial market stability was the possibility that Trump would contest the result if he lost, or refuse to leave office.
Still, even as that scenario has been playing out, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index is up approximately 6% since Election Day. Sectors that were expected to outperform under President-elect Joe Biden are surging, such as cannabis stocks and clean energy. Private prison stocks have dropped by 8% or more, reflecting Biden's proposal to end federal use of private facilities. 
""The market believes that the Biden victory is unlikely to be overturned,"" said Maneesh Deshpande, head of equity derivatives at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
He said the market's performance is consistent with Wall Street's preference for a clear winner rather than a drawn-out legal fight similar to the 2000 election. Then, the outcome was up in the air for five weeks until the U.S. Supreme Court decided Florida must end its recount, handing the election to George W. Bush. 
That year, the S&P 500 fell 7.8% between Election Day and year end, according to data from CFRA Research, as post-election turmoil fed the volatility around the bursting of the late 1990s tech bubble.
Despite the market's performance, some remain concerned that Trump and several U.S. Senate Republicans are still alleging without evidence Biden did not legitimately win. 
Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in a note Monday said she worried about how the actual transfer of power to the President-elect work and ""When (and WILL) Republicans and Trump concede?""
""With the markets exuberant today I worry about the coming days, weeks and months,"" Silverman said. 
Overall, Refinitiv data show that options markets are pricing in a jump in volatility in January consistent with a handoff of power to a Biden Administration, and are not reflecting a spike over the next few weeks that a drawn-out election court contest would bring. 
Market expectations of volatility are higher in late December to early January, around when Georgia's Jan. 5 run-off election for its two U.S. Senate seats, which will decide whether Biden's Democrats can gain majority control of that chamber. 
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service, in a note on Tuesday, warned that ongoing legal challenges to Biden's projected victory could unsettle markets and stir social tensions, which could have a material impact on the U.S. recovery. 
Still, Moody's said its assumption was that ""U.S. institutions will eventually resolve these issues without causing any meaningful, enduring credit impact."" 
Biden cleared the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency on Saturday after four days of ballot counting with wins in battleground states including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Biden leads in two of the four states yet to be called, and overall is ahead by more than 4.4 million ballots in the popular vote with more ballots in solidly-Democratic states such as California yet to be counted.
Trump has yet to concede, breaking with longstanding tradition, and has so far blocked millions of dollars of funding to Biden's transition, and hindered its ability to meet with officials at intelligence agencies and other departments.
Those efforts are unlikely to affect the market's positioning for a Biden presidency, said Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co.
""I don't think Trump conceding has any impact on what the market thinks is going to happen,"" said Villere, adding there is ""nothing that anyone can say"" to prevent Biden from assuming the presidency in January. 
Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, said investors are less worried about Trump's ability to block the election results than about the chance that Georgia voters will hand control of the Senate to Biden's Democrats on Jan. 5. 

""The story of the start of November was everyone feeling good that the world wasn't ending,"" McMillan said. ""The story for the rest of the month is likely to be how investors start worrying again.""

Investing.com --  MercadoLibre  (NASDAQ:MELI), one of South America's biggest companies and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rival, is up 8% after getting permission to operate as a financial institution in Brazil.
The Brazilian central bank gave its approval on Monday, allowing MercadoLibre to expand further into the credit market. The Buenos Aires-based company has operated Mercado Credito, a loan platform, for account holders of Mercado Pago, its fintech payment segment. 
Shares of MercadoLibre hit a record last week, weeks after getting a 400 million-real ($74.2 million) loan meant to bolster Mercado Pago’s working-capital portfolio aimed at small businesses and entrepreneurs in Brazil, Bloomberg reported.   
About 70% of Brazilians have bank accounts, according to 2017 data from Statista, and the banking industry is ripe for disruption, with high fees and interest rates, and painfully bureaucratic processes.  
MercadoLibre is one of Amazon's biggest competitors in Latin America, and particularly in Brazil, where the Argentine company had a head start. Amazon started pushing into Brazil in earnest in 2017 after selling books for a few years. 
On Monday, Amazon said it will open three new distribution centers in Brazil as e-commerce sales have taken off during the Covid-19 pandemic. Revenue in Brazil jumped 47% in the first six months of 2020, the most in 20 years, according to Ebit and Nielsen.

The comments come days after  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results and that it expects to file for U.S. emergency authorization this month.

 Moderna  Inc's (O:MRNA) experimental vaccine, which is on track to report early data from a late-stage trial later this month, also uses mRNA technology and needs to be stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F).

Investing.com --  Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) dropped after a big earnings miss. 
Third quarter earnings per share of 48 cents missed the estimate of 96 cents on sales of $1.06 billion, lower than the expected $1.12 billion, according to data compiled by Investing.com. That compares to EPS of $1.77 on sales of $1.42 billion a year earlier.

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 10:41AM ET</span>",Portugal's shoemakers switch from fancy to comfy to survive pandemic,"By Catarina Demony and Miguel Pereira
FELGUEIRAS, Portugal (Reuters) - Weddings were postponed, cocktail parties cancelled and work events replaced by video calls. With social gatherings severely curtailed due to the coronavirus pandemic, people have been buying far fewer shoes.
That has hit Portugal's footwear industry hard, because it specialises in high-end leather shoes - normally reserved for big occasions and formal work settings - and most are exported.
""There are no nightclubs, no couples going out ... all of this means cuts in certain products,"" said Joao Maia, general manager of Portugal's footwear association APICCAPS.
Some companies have switched to making more comfortable footwear for use around the house or in the supermarket. A few have added masks and other safety equipment to their production lines.
But the changes won't make up for all of the losses. Between January and August this year, exports from Portugal - Europe's third largest footwear producer after Italy and Spain - slumped around 17% from the same period in 2019.
Portugal exports more than 90% of its shoes and the sector has grown around 50% during the past decade, earning 1.7 billion euros last year after a 2017 peak of 1.9 billion euros.
Manufacturers are having to adapt to survive.
Paulo Martins, a partner at male shoe brand Ambitious, said that during the first lockdown his company started focusing on shoes for staying home or gardening.
""People who used to dress up and put on more formal shoes are now working from home and ... want a more comfortable product,"" Martins said at his factory in northern Portugal, where most of the country's nearly 1,500 shoe firms are located.
""Preferences are changing and that will have major repercussions on our business.""
'SCARY' TIMES
Others, like ToWorkFor, made even more radical changes.
The company, which specialises in safety shoes for the construction industry and other sectors, transformed one of its production lines to make face masks and is developing other products.
""The pandemic opened our horizons,"" said Orlando Andrade, head of marketing at ToWorkFor.
""If something positive came out of this pandemic, it is that it made us look at reality in a different way, see potential where we didn't see it before because we were in our comfort zone.""
Despite the innovation and flexibility, producers expect to see their order books shrink.
""The volume of orders that we have now will not be enough to withstand the entire production period,"" said Martins.
He also has to cope with an increase in staff sick days due to the pandemic, which could force the company to close one of its two shoe production lines.
Luxury shoe designer Luis Onofre, whose creations have been worn by celebrities including Naomi Watts and Paris Hilton, said many of his clients cancelled their orders when the pandemic hit.
""Maybe people got used to being at home a little more,"" Onofre told Reuters in his showroom, as workers assembled high heeled shoes in the factory below where the smell of leather and glue lingered in the air.
He described the pandemic as a ""scary period"" for the luxury shoe business.
Shoe brands like Onofre's mainly rely on fairs abroad to sell products to clients, but most have been cancelled. And, with less clientele than usual, 70% of factories opted to stop production between March and May, according to APICCAPS.

""It will be extremely difficult for the fashion industry because during the summer shopkeepers practically didn't sell,"" Onofre said. ""They are overstocked. If this goes on and they accumulate more it could be the end of many companies.""

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Europe to pay less than U.S. for Pfizer vaccine under initial deal: source,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has struck a deal to initially pay less for  Pfizer 's (N:PFE) COVID-19 vaccine candidate than the United States, an EU official told Reuters as the bloc announced on Wednesday it had secured an agreement for up to 300 million doses.
The experimental drug, developed in conjunction with Germany's BioNTech (DE:22UAy), is the frontrunner in a global race to produce a vaccine, with interim data released on Monday showing it was more than 90% effective at protecting people from COVID-19 in a large-scale clinical trial..
Under the EU deal, 27 European countries could buy 200 million doses, and have an option to purchase another 100 million.
The bloc will pay less than $19.50 per shot, a senior EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers told Reuters, adding that partly reflected the financial support given by the EU and Germany for the drug's development.
The official requested anonymity as the terms of the agreement are confidential.
The United States agreed to pay $19.50 per shot for 100 million doses, a smaller volume than the EU. But it has an option to buy a further 500 million under terms to be negotiated separately, and the price it will pay is unclear.
BioNTech signalled this week that order size would impact the per-dose price in the developed world and said it would differentiate pricing between countries or regions for its potential vaccine.
The EU official said the EU had agreed a price that was closer to $20 than to $10 but declined to give a precise figure.
Pfizer and BioNTech declined to comment on the pricing. A spokesman for the EU Commission, which negotiates vaccine agreements on behalf of EU states, also declined to comment.
In June, the European Investment Bank, the EU's financial arm, granted a 100-million-euro ($118 million) loan to BioNTech for the development and manufacturing of its COVID-19 vaccine, which was followed in September by another 375-million-euro funding by Germany's research ministry.
""With this fourth contract we are now consolidating an extremely solid vaccine candidate portfolio, most of them in advanced trials phase,"" the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said, announcing the Pfizer deal.
The EU has already signed supply deals with AstraZeneca (L:AZN), Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) for their experimental COVID-19 shots, and is talking with  Moderna  (O:MRNA), CureVac (DE:5CV) and  Novavax  (O:NVAX) to secure their vaccines.
Under the EU's deals with vaccine makers, the bloc offers a non-refundable down payment to companies in exchange for the right to book doses which EU states could buy at a pre-agreed price if the vaccine is approved as effective and safe by the EU drug regulator.
The Commission did not disclose the down payment made to Pfizer and BioNTech.
'NO COPY PASTE' ON LIABILITY TERMS
The prices agreed by the EU in previous deals with vaccine makers have partly been influenced by liability terms, which could cause large additional legal costs if inoculated people developed unexpected conditions because of the shots.
Asked about liability clauses in the Pfizer contract, which have been a bone of contention between EU negotiators and drugmakers, the EU official said conditions were different from those the EU agreed with other companies, and also different from those Pfizer had with the U.S. government.
There was ""no copy paste"" on liability terms from previous contracts, the official said.
French drugmaker Sanofi, which is working with GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) as a partner, has agreed with the EU a price of about 10 euros ($11.8) per dose and did not get any liability waiver, while AstraZeneca would pay claims only up to a certain threshold if something goes wrong with its vaccine in exchange for a price of 2.5 euro per dose, an official told Reuters in September.
Bad side-effects after a vaccine is approved are rare but are considered more likely in this emergency because of the unprecedented speed with which vaccines are being developed.

The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon accuses India's Future of insider trading as it seeks to block Reliance deal,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) has asked India's market regulator to investigate Future Retail Ltd (NS:FRTL) for insider trading, a letter seen by Reuters showed, as it seeks to prevent its business partner from becoming part of rival Reliance's empire.
The U.S. giant has been pressing the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to review Reliance's August deal to buy retail, logistics and other assets from Future Group for $3.4 billion including debt.
Amazon argues it had a 2019 agreement with Future which prevented the Indian group's retail assets from being sold to certain parties including  Reliance Industries  Ltd (NS:RELI), which is led by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani.
The Nov. 8 letter to SEBI alleges Future Retail disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of an injunction granted by a Singapore arbitrator to block the deal.
After the Reuters story was published, a spokesman for Future said the company had communicated with Reliance on the arbitration order for a ""legitimate purpose"" as required by SEBI regulations. It added that Amazon had provided no evidence to back up its allegations of insider trading.
Reliance and SEBI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment on the letter's contents.
The spat is being closely watched as a key test of whether Indian firms, courts and regulators will respect arbitration decisions made in accordance with overseas arbitration rules, and adds to headaches for Amazon in India which is also dealing with antitrust challenges.
The injunction was granted on Sunday Oct. 25 and was reported by media with Amazon issuing a short statement saying it welcomed the decision.
Reliance later that evening said in a stock exchange filing that it had been informed of the arbitration order and would enforce its rights to complete the deal with Future without delay.
It is this Oct. 25 filing which Amazon argues in its 20-page letter that indicates Ambani's group was privy to ""price sensitive"" details of the injunction.
Ambani's group ""was not a party to the arbitration proceedings ... and could have received details related thereto only from FRL (Future Retail) or its Promoters,"" said the letter. 
Future Retail, which has argued that Amazon's agreement last year was only with a separate Future Group unit, issued a statement to the stock exchange on the morning of Oct. 26 saying it was examining the arbitration order and that it believed the order would have to be tested by Indian law.
Future Group, which operates supermarkets and high-end food stores and has more than 1,500 outlets across India, has argued it entered into the deal to sell retail assets to Reliance because its business was severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and it was critical to protect all its stakeholders.

It remains to be seen whether Indian courts and regulators will side with Amazon or Future Retail. Future Retail has asked a New Delhi court for an order to restrain Amazon from approaching Indian regulators to block its deal with Reliance. Hearings on the case began on Tuesday.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher again on Wednesday, still supported by hopes for the early distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine next year and undaunted by record numbers of infections across the country over the last week.
However, the lead was taken by tech stocks, which profited from some bargain-hunting after underperforming heavily in the last two days as investors rotated back into cyclical and financial stocks. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 134 points, or 0.5%, at 29,555 points. The S&P 500 was up a little more than 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.8%.
After two days of high volatility, it was a morning of relatively modest moves for the most popular stocks, with the Veterans' Day holiday and the relative lack of corporate earnings and economic data also helping to keep things quiet. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 1.8%, recovering from its buffeting earlier in the week, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 1.5% on the day it launched its new generation of Mac Books, complete with in-house developed chips for the first time in years.
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) also rebounded moderately, up 3.5% after losing more than 20% since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) inspired hopes to an end of enforced working-from-home on Monday.
 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock rose 6.1% to a five-month high after the ride-hailing company reported a rise in revenue in the third quarter, helped by the easing of coronavirus shutdowns eased in some cities. It also said it was working on developing a new food delivery service. That may concern investors who are pressing the company to deliver a profit, given that Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s much larger food delivery service hasn't been able to make money even when most of the restaurants in New York and California were shut. 
Coty (NYSE:COTY) stock also extended its recent gains on the back of strong quarterly earnings on Monday, which have resulted in a raft of broker upgrades. Analysts at RBC have put a $7 price target on the stock, which still implies over 55% upside from the present level.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock meanwhile rose 1.5%, despite evidence of increased competition down the road as BMW unveiled its iNext all-electric SUV, due for launch next year. Electric vehicles of all stripes are widely expected to be beneficiaries of new environmental regulations when President-elect Joe Biden is confirmed in office in January. "

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - TikTok-owner ByteDance is on track to generate at least 180 billion yuan ($27.2 billion) in advertising revenue in China this year, which will cement its no. 2 spot in China's digital ad market, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
The company's overall revenue goal for 2020 is around $30 billion, Reuters previously reported, so the latest figures mean it is performing in line with its plan. 
While TikTok is what ByteDance is best known for globally, the app contributes little to the Chinese company's revenue overall. It relies on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, for nearly 60% of ad revenue, followed by news aggregator Jinri Toutiao for 20% and long-form video platform Xigua for under 3%, according to one of the sources.
ByteDance declined to comment. 
The group is one of only a few Chinese companies with global reach, but it is currently battling plans to force it to divest TikTok's U.S. operations because of Washington's national security concerns over the data of more than 100 million U.S. users.
STRENGTH AT HOME
ByteDance overtook Baidu (O:BIDU) to become China's second largest digital ad player in the first half of 2019 with 23% ($7.6 billion) of the total digital ad spend in the country, according to consultancy R3, with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group (HK:9988) in first place, raking in $10.9 billion or 33%.
The gap between ByteDance and Alibaba has narrowed this year, according to the second source. Although ByteDance did not disclose ad revenue for 2019, Reuters has reported it generated total revenue of $16 billion last year.
As ByteDance pursues its global ambitions, it is also looking to step up investment in three main areas at home next year - e-commerce, search and longer-form videos, the source said. 
It plans to invest around 10 billion yuan, including the value of traffic and advertising support to partners, on Xigua next year, its longer form video app, with the aim of increasing the number of daily active users to over 100 million, the first source said. 
Douyin's e-commerce platform, one of the fastest-growing sectors within the company, is projected to hit around 150 billion yuan in gross merchandise value (GMV) this year, according to both sources, who declined to be named as the information had not been made public.
The final numbers will be adjusted at the end of the year to take account of key campaigns around events such as year-end sales, which haven't been officially launched yet, the people said. Douyin held its first major shopping festival on Wednesday, in tandem with Alibaba's mega shopping event Singles' Day.
Douyin's rival Kuaishou, which filed for a Hong Kong initial public offering last week, reported total revenue and ecommerce GMV for the first half of this year of 25.3 billion yuan and 109.6 billion yuan respectively. 
In the search arena, ByteDance launched Toutiao Search for the Chinese market last August to take on China's search engine Baidu. It has since hired experts including former Baidu executives to improve its platform's architecture and range of search results.
ByteDance is in talks with investors to raise around $2 billion in a new financing round that will value it at $180 billion after the investment, more than double its valuation in the last fundraising round two years ago, Reuters has reported. 
It is also exploring whether to pursue a standalone public listing for Douyin or list some of its Chinese operations including Douyin and Toutiao as a package in Hong Kong or Shanghai.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>","Late to the game, AB InBev still sees victory in seltzers","By Richa Naidu and Philip Blenkinsop
CHICAGO/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Having missed out on the hottest new alcohol trend in the United States,  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) reckons it can still overhaul rivals by ramping up innovation, marketing and harnessing its top brand, Bud Light.
White Claw and Boston Beer Company's (N:SAM) Truly have built strong leads in the U.S. market for hard seltzers - sparkling water with alcohol and flavouring. 
But AB InBev is growing fast since launching Bud Light Seltzer at the start of the year, and the world's largest brewer believes it can become U.S. market leader over time, by growing at twice the industry average. 
""The winners are not necessarily those that get there first, but the winners are the ones that manage to scale up their initiatives better and bigger,"" U.S. chief marketing officer Marcel Marcondes told Reuters in an interview.
He drew a parallel with light beers, which first appeared around 1970. Anheuser-Busch only launched Bud Light in 1982, but with three other brands and big marketing muscle, it now has more than 60% of the U.S. light beer market.
""That's how we plan to play the game here as well. We were not the first, but we expect to be the largest,"" Marcondes said, adding this would probably take more than a couple of years. 
AB InBev needs its seltzer strategy to work.
The United States is the company's largest market and consumers have been steadily shifting away from Bud Light and stable-mate Budweiser.
AB InBev has seen its overall share of the U.S. market, once some 50%, shrink to 42% last year, according to Euromonitor International. In value terms that was 35%.
Its lagers have lost out to craft beers, whose popularity started surging about a decade ago. Late to the party there too, AB InBev subsequently bought 20 craft brands and says it is now the biggest single player in a fragmented category. 
PROMISING SIGNS
The seltzer market took off in 2016 and sales in stores have roughly doubled each year, even accelerating during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Nielsen data.
AB InBev entered the category in late 2016 by buying SpikedSeltzer, the original hard seltzer dating from 2013. But it was overwhelmed by rivals offering more variety in flavours and packaging, with sleek cross-gender marketing. 
This time will be different, AB InBev believes. 
Jake Kirsch, vice president of innovation at the company's U.S. arm, said it had shed a risk averse approach under which it could take 18-24 months to launch new products.
Now the average time is 5-1/2 months.
After Bud Light Seltzer in January, it launched classic cocktail style Social Club in May, a higher alcohol ""Platinum"" seltzer in September and now a festive season ""Ugly Sweater"" Bud Light Seltzer line, with flavours from ""ginger snap"" to ""peppermint pattie"".
And January will bring a seltzer version of AB InBev's Michelob Ultra, the No. 2 U.S. light beer brand in dollar terms, according to research firm IRI. 
Marcondes said there had been a ""meaningful"" increase in digital marketing, with sponsorships of e-gaming and music, and vouchers for people to try drinks for free. 
The company is also spending $150 million to expand its brewery in Cartersville, Georgia. Rival seltzer makers have suffered from capacity constraints and a shortage of cans.
The signs are promising. 
AB InBev has grown its U.S seltzer market share to 14% from 9% in 2019 and, with the help of Bud Light Seltzer, increased its overall U.S. market share over the summer for the first time since the end of 2012. 
VODKA AND MOUTHWASH? 
Like craft beer, seltzer is not just about volumes, but also margins, as its higher production costs are more than offset by the premium that wealthier young consumers are willing to pay.
But it is a crowded space. The number of brands has leapt from 10 at the start of 2018 to more than 100 now, with White Claw still claiming about half the market.
At a Jewel-Osco supermarket in Chicago, 34-year-old liquor aisle manager Chad said the only thing holding back White Claw sales was its ability to secure and fill cans.
White Claw did not respond to requests for comment for this story. 
Don Lane, vice president of marketing at Truly, which has about a quarter of the U.S. seltzer market, acknowledged the challenge posed by AB InBev.
""However, we are going to stay consistent and play our own game and not try to mimic what they do,"" he told Reuters, adding Truly planned next year to launch hard ice tea and a higher alcohol seltzer.
Trevor Stirling, beverage analyst at Bernstein Research who has written extensively about the seltzer boom, sees AB InBev as more of a strong number two or three in the market, with Michelob Ultra perhaps boosting its share to around 30%.
Much could come down to luck.
White Claw profited when comedian Trevor Wallace posted his parody of a White Claw drinker on YouTube in June 2019, with the catch-phrase: ""Ain't no laws when you're drinkin' Claws.""
Bud Light's ""Ugly Sweater"" launch this month was spotted by hit comedy show Saturday Night Live, which said the ""peppermint pattie"" flavour was akin to vodka and mouthwash.
That created a buzz on social media, and for some a wish to test it.

""I'm always down to try something new, especially if it's a product I already enjoy,"" Erin Tolbert, 23, a digital marketer in Dallas, Texas, said in response to a Reuters message.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>","Markets in V-mode: vaccine hopes, Biden bounce in play","By Ritvik Carvalho and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Joe Biden's U.S. presidential election win and a promising vaccine breakthrough have combined to propel global stock markets to record highs in the last week, upending the virus-led investment strategies that have been in play since March.
From airline shares to commodity currencies, investors have stormed into riskier market segments as the election outcome and the likelihood of a COVID-19 vaccine becoming available by early 2021 have brightened the outlook for the world economy.
Here are seven charts showing the shift in sentiment over the last one week:
1/ A SHADE OF BLUE IN GREEN STOCKS
Global renewable energy stocks have surged as Biden's promise to set a U.S. goal for net-zero emissions by 2050 amplifies the rush sparked by the European Union earlier this year when it earmarked a chunk of is planned spending splurge for green investments. Jointly, green spending could be worth trillions of dollars in coming years.

2/ BIDEN WAVE IN DEVELOPING WORLD 
Biden's victory sent emerging market asset prices - from currencies to stocks - soaring as investors bet on a stabler U.S. trade policy with China, Europe and Latin America. Vaccine news has also encouraged the bulls.

3/ CALMING NERVES
The CBOE's VIX volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", is hovering near August lows as greater clarity on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election induced investors to unwind bets on a jump in volatility.

5/ COMMODITY CURRENCIES
Commodity currencies have been among the week's top gainers. Oil exporting Norway's currency  strengthened nearly 4% over the past week while the Australian dollar  rallied more than 1.5%. Safe havens such as the Japanese yen , Swiss franc  and the U.S. dollar (=USD) are down.

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 08:01AM ET</span>",Analysis: Fear on the wild frontier as riskier stock markets left trailing,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Frontier stocks have trailed bigger emerging markets in recovering from the coronavirus-induced crash as liquidity has dried up and investors beat a hasty retreat.
BMO Global Asset Management shut a $78 million fund and Aberdeen Standard Investments wound up an investment trust, both invested in frontier stocks, in recent months after fellow fund manager Barings took a similar step last year. 
Money managers say assets under management in dedicated frontier funds have tumbled to close to $4 billion from around $15 billion in 2014, when from Nigeria to Lebanon, markets once seen as too risky saw an influx of money, with investors betting on fast-growing economies and idiosyncratic investment stories.
""Flows have been negative for the last three years,"" Fergus Argyle, assistant manager of frontier at Somerset Capital Management, told Reuters.
""On the one hand it's a bit alarming, but on the other hand it's also quite encouraging .. there's a lot of pain in the market already and a lot of capital has left the market and we don't see a significant need for change for sentiment to really improve,"" Argyle added.
The draining of cash reflects disappointment with an asset class that has frequently failed to compensate for the added risk of markets prone to crises or capital controls.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic triggered global market falls in late February, investor disappointment has intensified. 
MSCI's Frontier Markets Index <.dMI7400000PUS>, encompassing a diverse group banded together due to scarce liquidity, lack of size and access restrictions, has fallen 6.3% since late February, while its emerging market equivalent <.dMIEF00000PUS>. has climbed by 10% over the same period. 
Several frontier funds have had even poorer performances. 
Graphic: Mind the gap: Frontier market stocks lag global peers - https://graphics.reuters.com/MARKETS-FRONTIER/ygdvzbywevw/chart.png
In a sign of the risk aversion felt towards frontier stocks, outflows have persisted every month since April 2018, EPFR Global data shows. 
Meanwhile, global emerging market managers have also been selling down benchmark frontier exposure, Steven Holden, director of Copley Fund Research, said. 
A record low of 41% of funds had any frontier exposure at all, with average weights of 0.82% towards the bottom of the 13-year range, he said.
The exit of Kuwait's stocks, accounting for around $100 million of daily trading on the index, from the frontier market benchmark in the coming months is adding to the malaise. 
Kuwait, which at 36% has the largest country weighting, has been reclassified by MSCI to the emerging market benchmark from the end of this month.
""The upgrade (of Kuwait) will have seismic implications on the stability and overall liquidity of the index and on fund performance as passive flows distort fundamentals,"" Bassel Khatoun, managing director, of frontier and MENA, Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity, said.
TRAILING TECH 
Fund managers say the impact of an estimated $12 trillion in stimulus which has been rolled out mainly in advanced economies since the pandemic has drawn investor cash from the frontiers.
While it has helped pump up stock market valuations in the developed world, with some trickling into bigger emerging markets, it has not done so in frontier markets where central banks have far less fiscal firepower.
""At the moment, earnings growth doesn't determine stock market performance because there are so many outside factors such as monetary policy, fiscal policy and other reactions to the virus in terms of lockdowns etc,"" said Dominic Bokor-Ingram, senior portfolio manager of frontier markets at Fiera Capital. 
Company earnings, the normal driver of stock markets, had been less dire in the first half of the year in frontier markets than in emerging or U.S. ones, Bokor-Ingram added.
Frontier markets have suffered in part from a lack of 'stay at home' stocks which have thrived during lockdowns. Vietnam-based  FPT Corp  (HM:FPT) and Morocco's Hightech Payment Systems (CS:HPS) are among the tech names favoured by fund managers, but neither are in the MSCI index.
By contrast, tech stocks make up around a third of the U.S. S&P 500 (SPX), and their rally has lifted the wider market.
""The likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have returns ranging between 30%-70% in share prices,"" said Peter Leger, head of global frontiers markets at Coronation Fund Managers.
""That steals the headlines and people have not been feeling the need to look further afield for returns.""
Graphic: Frontier equity flows still to recover - https://graphics.reuters.com/MARKETS-FRONTIER/qmyvmxngbpr/chart.png
GREEN SHOOTS
Despite the outflows, some fund managers are betting on a turnaround, with a Joe Biden presidency in the United States expected to usher in a more predictable geopolitical climate. 
And if there is no resolution to trade tensions between the U.S. and China, Vietnam and Bangladesh should benefit further.
""We're pretty positive,"" George Birch Reynardson, portfolio manager at Somerset Capital Management, said.
""Frontier stocks today are a trading around 14 times earnings, compared to emerging at 20 times and developed at 28 times. So, there's a big valuation discount, one of the biggest we've seen historically,"" Reynardson said. 
""We'd expect that to start to attract new investments.""
Green shoots may already be sprouting in some markets, with frontier stocks outperforming both emerging and developed markets in the third quarter, Kathrine Husvaeg, senior portfolio manager, Russell Investments, said.

""If there is a vaccine, the return of tourism will provide a boost in recovery for many of these countries,"" she added.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong stock exchange, which missed out on the chance to host Ant Group's record $37 billion listing this month, believed the move to suspend the IPO was the right one and hoped the Chinese fintech giant would come back later, its CEO said on Wednesday.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), which currently ranks fourth in the IPO league table of global exchanges according to Refinitiv, would have jumped to No. 2 if Ant's dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai had gone ahead.
The IPO was thwarted last week when the Shanghai Stock Exchange said it would halt the company's STAR Market listing, prompting Ant to also freeze the Hong Kong leg of the deal.
The market ""needed time to fully absorb regulatory changes,"" Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong bourse, said on an earnings call with the media.
Li did not specify which regulatory changes, but analysts have pointed to a consultation paper issued by the banking watchdogs recommending tightening rules for online micro-lending companies as foreshadowing the regulators' move against Ant.
""When Ant is ready to come back, we stand ready to welcome them back to our market,"" said Li, who steps down as CEO of the bourse at the end of this year. 
HKEX, on Wednesday, reported net profit of HK$3.45 billion ($445 million), a quarterly record, and a 52% rise from a year earlier, lifted by higher trading revenue and listing fees. 
Trading volumes were boosted by a slew of large listings including by New York-listed firms like Netease (HK:9999) and KFC China operator Yum China (HK:9987), as well as record turnover on the stock and bond ""connect"" schemes. 
The development of the ""connects"", which links Hong Kong with the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, and reforms to allow secondary listings are among Li's achievements during his 11 year tenure. 
High on the agenda of Li's successor would be MSCI A share derivatives, ""a long-anticipated missing piece"", said Dennis Lam an equities strategist at DBS. 
Last year, global index publisher MSCI and HEKX said they would launch futures contracts on the MSCI China A Index, an onshore Chinese benchmark, to provide a hedging tool for international investors, but they have not yet launched.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, with gains seen across all sectors as the optimism following the news of a workable vaccine for the Covid-19 virus persists.
At 7:15 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 200 points, or 0.7%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 21 points, or 0.7%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 106 points, or 0.9%. 
Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential election victory, although yet to be confirmed, coupled with  Pfizer  's (NYSE:PFE) news that its Covid-19 vaccine was effective, prompted a repricing on Wall Street this week. Cyclical stocks, which require the economy to perform, have seen strong demand, at the expense of the stay-at-home or tech stocks which had done so well previously.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 11% in November, rising in six of the last seven sessions and closing in on a new record high, while the Nasdaq Composite has fallen for the last two days.
That said, the rotation seems to be coming to an end - at least in the short term - with tech set to post strong gains Wednesday after two days of severe underperformance.
“The background story for markets remains the contrast between vaccine-related hopes and sharply rising infections, while investors stay on the lookout for more hints from President-elect Biden around his plans for virus response, fiscal stimulus and foreign policy,” said ING analyst Francesco Pesole, in a research note.
The United States reported a record number of new Covid-19 cases for the seventh day in a row on Tuesday, while the number of deaths surged to their highest daily count since August and hospital admissions hit an all-time high.
The economic data slate is largely empty Wednesday, as it's the Veterans Day and the Treasury market is closed. The earnings calendar also lacks a standout release, with the main focus being on Lemonade (NYSE:LMND), the online home insurer that went public in July.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, continuing the recent positive tone generated by Pfizer’s vaccine news, and helped further U.S. crude inventories falling by more than expected.
Traders will focus on OPEC’s monthly oil report, which will update the cartel’s supply and demand forecasts.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.6% higher at $42.42 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.4% to $44.67. Both contracts are up more than 10% this week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,875.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1766.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Analysis: Pandemic payment holidays mask wave of European problem debt,"By John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Pandemic payment breaks on European loans totalling billions of euros threaten to undermine efforts by the region's banks to put the coronavirus crisis behind them.
Some of the millions of borrowers who were given repayment holidays by banks and governments across Europe shortly after the outbreak of the pandemic still need relief as a second wave of lockdowns squeezes the economy and puts people out of work.
But the longer their loan repayments are kept on ice, the bigger the potential problem for banks as debts stack up, making them more difficult to tackle.
The European Central Bank's chief supervisor Andrea Enria has warned of a ""huge wave"" of unpaid loans that could top 1.4 trillion euros and has cautioned against postponing writing them off, warning that waiting for loan moratoria to expire could see many borrowers ""unravel at once"".
Although the volume of loans on pause fell sharply over the summer, a Reuters survey and analysis of the latest data available shows that loans totalling about 320 billion euros ($380 billion) were still on a payment holiday at 10 of Europe's biggest banks.
In Ireland, banks started to phase out payment holidays in September, a move Michelle O'Hara, a manager at a charity advising those in debt difficulty, said prompted a call surge.
Pilots, programmers and even horse trainers have joined those on lower pay in seeking advice. ""There are people in difficulty who never anticipated being in trouble,"" O'Hara said.
Personal debt in Europe, whether for houses, white goods or cars, is at a record high, European Union data shows. Although some countries cut back in the past decade, consumers in Britain, France and Germany borrowed roughly one fifth more.
So when payment holidays became widespread during the first wave of coronavirus lockdowns in Europe, lenders prepared for losses, with financial results showing that the 10 have set aside some 45 billion euros to cover the cost of unpaid loans. 
An analysis of loans still on a payment break at ten of Europe's largest banks, Santander (MC:SAN), HSBC (L:HSBA),  Barclays  (L:BARC),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), ING (AS:INGA), Intesa (MI:ISP), UniCredit (MI:CRDI),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), show many thousands are still delaying resuming monthly repayments.
For banks looking to avoid a return to the dark days of the debt crisis a decade ago, there is a delicate balancing act between meeting government requests to go easy on borrowers and not putting their loan books in jeopardy.
""We must ensure that we allow everyone to go through this phase,"" said Philippe Brassac, Chief Executive of France's Credit Agricole, which has about 24 billion euros of loans on payment breaks, pledging to support customers hit by lockdown.
Calculating default risk is complicated and banks take many factors into consideration such as the type of loan, the circumstances of the borrower and the wider economy. 
Banks say they are realistic about judging the risk, while many point to the large numbers of borrowers who have resumed payment after a holiday.
Spain's Santander, which has 39 billion euros of loans on hold, made 9.6 billion euros of provisions for unpaid debt, while Italy's Intesa, with 48 billion euros of loans on moratoria, set aside just 2.7 billion euros this year.
A spokesman for Intesa said customers that took payment holidays were resilient and their exposure to tourism, hard hit by the crisis, was low. Santander declined to comment.
DEFYING GRAVITY? 
Central banks in Germany, which told banks to prepare for the ""worst case"" and Portugal, which cautioned of the risks of winding down economic support measures, are worried that if personal debt problems spiral it could suck in banks too.
""Some banks have more than 20% of their loans on payment holiday. When will gravity kick in? At some point, you have to return to normal business,"" Jerome Legras of Axiom Alternative Investments said. 
In Italy, payment breaks rose to roughly 10% of mortgage loans at the height of the pandemic, while in Britain it reached more than 15%, calculations by the European Datawarehouse, which collects the data for investors, show.
Payment holidays in Portugal reached 12%, it estimated.
Since then, the majority of borrowers have resumed paying. 
HSBC's Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson recently told Reuters he expected a gradual economic improvement, while France's BNP Paribas, which has roughly $1 trillion of credit, said loan losses should tail off next year.
But problems linger. 
""There is a significant amount of distressed debt throughout Europe,"" Ed Sibley, Deputy Governor of the Irish Central Bank said. ""And that distress will increase because of COVID-19.""
A recent study by Ireland's central bank found that although the number of payment breaks had fallen by more than a quarter since June, 9% of Irish loans remain on hold.
It found that hotels and restaurants, among the worst hit by the pandemic, were the most likely to still be on a break.
""For now, job protection measures are in place. But this will start coming to an end,"" said Ernest Urtasun, a Spanish lawmaker in the European Parliament. ""The number of distressed borrowers will explode in the coming months."" 
Banks, however, are hopeful government support, which is being extended around Europe, will help.
""Withdrawing support to companies and the economy ahead of time is the time bomb,"" said Miguel Maya, CEO of Portugal's Millenium bcp. ""We have to give the economy time to breathe.""

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said on Monday that it expected the S&P 500 to hit 4,000 points by early 2021.

1565,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 05:57AM ET</span>",StockBeat: A Widening Light at the End of the Tunnel,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Whisper it quietly, but the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter.
Data from across Europe show that the restrictions brought in to stop the second wave of Covid-19 swamping the continent’s hospital systems are having the desired effect. While that may not be enough to allow a full reopening of the economy any time soon, the flattening of curves for infections and hospital admissions is an unambiguously good sign that proves the virus is no longer out of control.
Google data suggest that the rate of new infections has fallen by over 80% in Ireland since it became the first country to reimpose extensive lockdown measures in the middle of October. There have also been sharp declines in infection rates in Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, three other early actors, while the infection curve is clearly flattening in the U.K.
That good news is being lost in the alarm about rising death rates and hospital admissions across the continent, with France acknowledging that its intensive care units are now close to capacity, with over 93% of available beds occupied by Covid-19 patients. In Germany too, there are record numbers of patients in intensive care, although the more expansive resources of the national health system mean that the capacity issue is nowhere near as pressing.
The capacity of healthcare systems represents a crucial threshold: as soon as people are unable to access healthcare, death rates will spike, triggering a further deterioration in business and consumer confidence (the sharp fall in Germany’s ZEW index on Tuesday was a mild foretaste of that).
The Irish and Belgian experience suggests – fingers crossed – the second wave won’t rise above that threshold.
In the meantime, though, the population – and the hard-pressed hospitality industry in particular – will just have to sweat it out. British pub operator J D  Wetherspoon  (LON:JDW) became the latest to provide a gloomy update of trading conditions on Wednesday, saying like-for-like sales fell by 28% in the 15 weeks through last Sunday.
Wetherspoons’ 758 pubs in England and Ireland are all closed, while those that are still allowed to operate in Wales and Scotland are doing so under “onerous” conditions that is dampening trade badly.
But even this situation is far less acute, from a shareholder’s point of view, than it was in the spring. The company estimates it will burn a mere 14 million pounds this month, out of its 234 million pounds of available liquidity.
As with many others, Wetherspoons has already removed the worst tail risk from its outlook with a capital increase that raised 138 million pounds.  Even if it misses out on the peak Christmas and New Year season, it should be able to hold on until the cavalry arrives in the form of widespread vaccination.
That much is reflected in the five-month high that the stock hit on the back of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine news on Monday. It’s still over 30% below where it was before the February panic, offering plenty of catch-up potential to those willing to wait for the final victory over the virus."

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",European shares extend rally on vaccine cheer,"By Shashank Nayar
(Reuters) - European shares rose for a third straight session on Wednesday as optimism around a COVID-19 vaccine offset concerns about the economic damage from surging coronavirus infections across the continent.
The pan-European STOXX 600 gained 0.5%, building on a 5% rally this week as investors bought into utilities as well as travel-related stocks, a sector that has widely underperformed this year.
Technology stocks, which have tracked a surge in their U.S. counterparts since the coronavirus-driven crash in March, gained 0.7%.
""The U.S. election, talks of fresh European stimulus, and vaccine developments have definitely helped traders to get more confident, but the market is beginning to settle and see if any new short-term risks come up,"" said Keith Temperton, a trader at Forte Securities.
The benchmark STOXX 600 has surged 43% since March, thanks partly to historic global stimulus, but it is still down about 7% on the year as the resurgence in COVID-19 cases threatens a nascent economic recovery. 
By comparison, the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 has risen nearly 10% this year and was propelled to record highs this week after drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said its COVID-19 vaccine was 90% effective.
Spain, which has been among the countries hit hardest by the health crisis, will get the first vaccines in early 2021, while Italy expects to receive an initial 3.4 million shots in January.
Meanwhile, the European third-quarter earnings season has been largely better than expected, with about 68% of the STOXX 600 companies that have reported so far beating estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
E.ON, Germany's largest energy firm, gained 0.3% after it said demand had recovered faster than expected from the coronavirus crisis, while maintaining its 2020 forecast.
German auto supplier Continental slid 4.1% as it warned of further restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter.
European banking stocks reversed early gains to drop 0.7% after Dutch bank ABN Amro said it remained cautious despite reporting a much better-than-expected quarterly profit. Shares of the bank tumbled almost 6%. 
Nordea Bank fell 4.8% after Finnish insurer Sampo said it had sold 4% of the share capital in the bank in an accelerated bookbuild offering to institutional investors.

Among country indexes, German stocks rose 0.2%, while London's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 added 0.3% and 0.3%, respectively.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>","Nissan's prospects brighten as China rebounds, but struggle ahead for weakened car maker","By Tim Kelly
Tokyo (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) could trim its forecast for a full-year loss when it reports quarterly results on Thursday, analyst estimates show, as a recovery in China marks a rare bright spot for the Japanese automaker weakened by scandal and the pandemic.
Nissan's second-quarter results are likely to highlight how it is falling further behind domestic rivals Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267), both of which last week raised their profit estimates thanks partly to an uptick in demand from China, the world's largest auto market.
While China's rebound from the pandemic is proving a boon for Japanese automakers, Nissan is still struggling in North America, where it is hampered by an ageing vehicle line-up.
""A recovery in China is perhaps encouraging, but certainly not a panacea for Nissan's overall troubles. The key to recovery is North America, where the majority of problems stem,"" said Julie Boote, an analyst at Pelham Smithers Associates in London.
Toyota and Honda ""are currently doing even better than Nissan in China; but, most importantly, neither of them have the same issues as Nissan has in North America,"" she said.
Twenty-three analysts surveyed by Refinitiv estimate an average operating loss of 335 billion yen ($3.2 billion) for the full year, 28% less than Nissan forecast in July, as the pandemic raged.
Toyota and Honda both more than doubled their forecasts last week to a 2.47 trillion yen operating profit and 420 billion yen gain respectively.
Vehicle sales in China, the world's biggest auto market, expanded 12.8% year-on-year in September for a sixth straight monthly gain. That recovery shows signs of taking hold in the United States too. 
REVAMP 
But Nissan, the maker of the Leaf, the world's first mass-produced electric vehicle launched a decade ago, is constrained by its line-up. Chinese consumers are seeking mid-sized or large luxury vehicles, while North American drivers are shifting to sports-utility vehicles and large pickups.
Aware of its competitive shortcomings after years of expansion under ousted leader Carlos Ghosn, Nissan has said it would cut production capacity and model numbers by a fifth and slash operating expenses by 300 billion yen over three years - similar to revamps at alliance partners  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211). 
It also plans to launch new cars. 
Chief Executive Makoto Uchida has also announced plans to launch nine new and re-designed electric models in China over the next five years.
Nissan also unveiled the Ariya SUV, its first electric vehicle since the Leaf, with a driving range comparable to models built by Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). It will go on sale outside Japan, including in North America, after the middle of next year.
When measured by output, Nissan at the end of September was a much smaller manufacturer than two years earlier, before Ghosn was arrested and charged with financial wrongdoing in Japan. Ghosn, who subsequently fled to Lebanon, has denied the charges.
It has since fallen behind Honda, with 1.54 million vehicles produced in the six months to September, from 2.62 million two years earlier.
Uchida has pledged to achieve a core operating profit margin above 5% and a sustainable global market share of 6%. Nissan in September said it would issue $8 billion in dollar-denominated debt.
In the second quarter Nissan likely posted an operating loss of 130.6 billion yen according to an average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Stocks gained and bonds dropped on Wednesday as news of a working COVID-19 vaccine outweighed worries over surging infections, fuelling rotation towards cut-price losers from the coronavirus pandemic such as travel stocks. 
The broad Euro STOXX 600 climbed 0.4%, adding to a 5% rally this week and adding to 0.1% gains for Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan. Wall Street futures gauges also climbed, with S&P 500 futures up 0.3%. 
Much of the action was switching between stocks as investors sold coronavirus winners to buy beaten-down equities. 
Travel-related stocks gained 1.1%, while tech companies - which along with U.S. counterparts have surged since the coronavirus-driven crash in March - fell 0.5%.
Bonds also adjusted to the prospect of a post-pandemic world, with the yield on German Bunds, a benchmark for euro zone sovereign debt, rising to their highest for two months at -0.456%. 
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries posted on Tuesday its highest close since March, though U.S. bond markets are shut on Wednesday. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
""The market is not wrong - we know who benefited during COVID, and it was almost inevitable that if COVID comes to an end, you would have a reversal on that,"" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in almost 50 countries, gained 0.1%, putting it not far from its record high touched on Monday.
Investors have pivoted to riskier plays in equities, foreign exchange and bonds after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said on Monday its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed with BioNTech, showed a 90% success rate in preventing infection during trials.
Nearly $2 trillion changed hands on Monday alone, one of the heaviest trading days since the height of the pandemic crisis. Tech stocks, among the major winners in the pandemic, have lost out, as have safe haven currencies like the Japanese yen. 
""You have seen a big rotation which highlighted how skewed positioning was, as people sheltered in the work-from-home plays,"" said Richard Saldanha, a portfolio manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors. 
""For names geared towards so-called normalisation of activity, (the rally) could continue to play out in coming days.""
Oil futures crept to new two-month highs on a sharp draw-down in supplies and anticipation of better demand in a post-pandemic world. 
Brent crude futures climbed more than $1 a barrel to $44.71 a barrel, just below a two-month high touched earlier in the session. 
VACCINATE, ROTATE 
A rotation of sorts is also underway in fixed income markets, as bonds in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand fell while riskier bonds in higher-paying countries like Indonesia held gains.
New Zealand bonds crumbled as traders swiftly re-priced a much lower likelihood of negative rates, lifting the 10-year yield by 14.5 basis points to 0.898%, the steepest one-day rise since panic selling in March.
In currency markets, the kiwi dollar leapt nearly 1% to a 19-month high of $0.6903 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept rates on hold, as expected. 
The euro paused at $1.1820 ahead of a speech from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde at 1300 GMT. 
The dollar fell 0.2% against the Japanese yen, though it steadied against a basket of six major currencies, last trading at 92.741.

1571,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 03:40AM ET</span>",European Stocks Edge Higher; Corporate News in Focus,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Wednesday, with investors largely pausing for breath after this week’s vaccine-inspired gains and focusing more on the corporate news cycle.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.2%.
Global stock markets have responded positively this week to the news from U.S. pharmaceutical giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) that the vaccine it is developing, in conjunction with German partner Biontech  (NASDAQ:BNTX), was more than 90 percent effective at preventing Covid-19. 
In Europe, the DAX and the FTSE 100 indices are around 7% higher, while the CAC 40 has posted gains of over 10%.
“Investors will have a little more confidence that we are moving into an early-stage recovery cycle rather than teetering on the precipice of another double-dip,” said ING analyst Chris Turner, in a research note.
Still, the focus Wednesday has been more on corporate news. Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY) stock soared 7.2% after the Italian-based broadcaster reported a profit in the third quarter, with even advertising revenue rising, despite the pandemic hitting the media sector hard.
 E.On  (DE:EONGn) stock gained 0.5% after the German energy company reported a drop in third-quarter profit, but it also backed its full year outlook, citing a rapid market recovery.
On the flip side, Dutch bank ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) stock dropped 5.7% as the management's cautious outlook outweighed a solid beat on earnings, while German auto supplier Continental (DE:CONG) slid 2.1% as it warned of further restructuring expenses in the current quarter.
Aside from earnings, investors are looking to hear from European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde about the European economic outlook and stimulus prospects in a speech at 1300 GMT.
More than 300,000 people have died of Covid-19 across Europe, prompting many governments in the region to lock down their economies to try and prevent their well-equipped hospitals from collapsing under the strain. Recent measures have slowed the rate of infection growth, and Ireland - the first country to apply them - is already seeing its case numbers fall.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, continuing the recent positive tone generated by Pfizer’s vaccine news, and helped further by an industry report showing that U.S. crude inventories fell by more than expected.
The American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of 5.147 million barrels of crude from last week’s stocks, as opposed to the 900,000-barrel draw expected. Crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.5% higher at $42.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.4% to $44.64. Both contracts are up more than 10% this week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,875.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1795.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",Column: Beware of whiplash in 'normality trade',"(The author is editor-at-large for finance and markets at Reuters News. Any views expressed here are his own.)
By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - For a couple of days at least, there's been a craving for the 'old normal'. But the past is never quite what it seemed. 
The mere glimpse of economic and political 'normality' returning with this week's U.S. election results and COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough prompted a scramble for burnt-out 'value' stocks, bonds and currencies and away from lockdown winners, safe-havens and anti-globalisation plays. 
One stand-out stock trade following Monday's Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine surprise would have been to switch from online meeting firm Zoom (O:ZM) to cinema operator AMC Entertainment (N:AMC) -- for a tidy relative gain of 70% in just hours.
If more restrained in price terms, that sort of move was rife across markets. Banks and energy stocks -- among the biggest losers from months of lockdown, recession and floored borrowing rates -- have surged for two days now, with airline, travel and leisure shares also helping push MSCI's all-country index to new highs. 
In contrast, New York's NYFANG+TM (NYFANG) index -- grouping tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and others -- fell 6% from levels inflated by zero interest rates and locked-down households' reliance on digital services. 
With the gap between value stocks and growth stocks in MSCI's global index at its highest in 20 years, investors have been itching to rotate for a long time. 
And this value play, or normality trade, was not confined to sectors and stocks -- it also played out in demand for bonds of Europe's 'laggards', even those hit hard by the pandemic, UK stocks and sterling, and lower-rated corporate debt.
A flight from safe-haven assets like gold and Swiss francs, or long-term bonds supported by economic gloom and central bank purchases, mirrored those moves.
Even before the vaccine news, Joe Biden's victory over self-styled political and globalisation disrupter Donald Trump had fuelled hopes for 'trade detente' that have recently lifted China's yuan and other emerging market assets. 
The U.S. president-elect's green infrastructure pledge lifted renewable energy stocks, while his scepticism about Brexit is expected to hasten a trade deal between Brussels and London -- another potential tailwind for the long-shunned pound.
But it is the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) news that has really lifted investors.
Consultancy McKinsey reckons vaccine-aided immunity among developed world populations is possible by the second half of 2021, shifting those economies away from their crisis-footing as early as the first quarter.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said the vaccine's efficacy was ""significantly better than the market's base case and risky assets should therefore reprice materially"". It favoured the pound as a stand-out play.
Combining some of the value themes amplifies them. UK banks priced in dollars (FTNMX8350) have jumped almost 14% in their biggest two-day gain in more than a decade. 
But things can quickly get more complicated.

Graphic - Return to 'normalcy'? https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprejogve/normalcy.PNG
BEWARE CROSS-CURRENTS 
Some mega-trends that were already developing have been catalysed by the pandemic and its passing may simply usher in what McKinsey calls the ""next normal"", of further digital transformation, with all the winners and losers that brings.
As Amundi's chief investment officer Pascal Blanque opined just hours before the Pfizer news: ""The idea that the vaccine is the alpha and omega of everything is wrong.""
So reversing investment course either sectorally or geographically may not make sense for long.
More normality will mean a rethink of the monetary and fiscal policies that have kept economies and markets afloat for nine months -- not least those long-duration assets highly sensitive to interest rates, from long-dated government bonds to digital stocks with near-zero future earnings discounts.
Any challenge to the assumption that central banks will keep borrowing costs suppressed for years to keep government debts affordable could destabilise record equity valuations. Rotation may make sense but seismic shifts create risks of their own.
On the other hand, interest rates had been ossifying for years due to low inflation and growth -- themselves in part due to the digital revolution and demographic change. While reflation trades may now seem obvious, it's difficult to make a case for accelerating price growth. 
Biden's election brings promises of higher spending but those could founder if Senate races leave Congress gridlocked in January.
Higher U.S. yields compared to Europe and elsewhere, seen as likely post-election and post-pandemic, could meanwhile fuel a steep dollar recovery that would challenge China and emerging markets even if global trade fears ebb.
And a new vaccine horizon itself could cut across the sort of ""blue sky"" fiscal and monetary policy thinking that many had hoped would lift the world out of the low-growth, low-wage funk it has suffered for much of the past decade.

""A return to normality is not the same as a move to continued fiscal stimulus that could put growth on a higher future path,"" said Oliver Blackbourn, Multi-Asset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 02:55AM ET</span>",Analysis: Japanese stocks catch global investors' eyes as post-COVID growth play,"By Stanley White and Tom Westbrook
TOKYO/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Japan's traditionally overlooked stock market is winning new fans as global investors use the promise of a coronavirus vaccine and a new U.S. administration to hunt for more fairly valued, growth-oriented markets.
The Nikkei stock average (N225), historically an underperformer, has jumped to its highest in almost 3 decades and has become one of the developed world's top performers in the week since Democrat Joe Biden won the Nov. 3 U.S. election.
Investors are betting that a less fractious global trade policy under Biden and a COVID-19 vaccine will lead to a stronger economic rebound and higher bond yields. 
As a result, many investors are now rotating out of ""growth"" stocks that comprise defensive, fast-growing sectors such as technology into those more attuned to fundamental economic strength.
That puts Japan, with its staple of consumer and industrial blue-chips, firmly in their cross-hairs. 
""We feel that Japan is becoming very interesting again,"" said Patrick Ghali, managing partner of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, which is recommending increased allocation.
""It feels like it's the last fundamental place left, if you look at valuations.""
Even before the pandemic, some foreign fund managers were turning optimistic on Japan, which is often avoided because of corporate cash-hoarding and anaemic growth.
Those cash piles now look more attractive, as strong balance sheets spell steady dividends and more acquisitions. 
In August, after years scouring the globe for a big purchase, legendary investor Warren Buffet splashed $6 billion on 5% stakes in each of Japan's old-world trading conglomerates.
""For Japan, you get a developed market, you get the best dividend growth of any developed market and you've also got a market with a big chunk of earnings coming from outside of Japan,"" said Jim McCafferty, joint head of Asia-Pacific equity research at Nomura Securities in Hong Kong.
Shares in Japan's two biggest car manufacturers, Toyota Motor (T:7203) and Honda Motor (T:7267) are at multi-month highs after the firms doubled operating profit forecasts, due to a recovery in demand from China, which highlights an economic decoupling from the West that Nomura's McCafferty says makes Japan appealing.

A YEN FOR THE NIKKEI
The Nikkei hit a high of 25,401.30 this week and is up 55% since its trough in March, getting a big lift after positive results from  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) coronavirus vaccine trial. 
Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities in Tokyo, sees it at 26,000 early next year. Among the more bullish forecasts, Tokyo-based Monex Securities expects an 8.5% rise to 27,500 by March. 
The surge in Japanese stocks this year has stumped many investors because it coincided with the yen's rise  to an eight-month high versus the dollar, showing the market was increasingly less reliant merely on exports.
Graphic - Yen and Nikkei: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzbybjpw/Pasted%20image%201605075092447.png
Japan's government has been pushing companies to improve corporate governance, and the decades-long effort is starting to yield results as boards agree to give investors higher returns.
Dividend yields in Japan are around 2.8%, higher than 2.2% in the United States and on par with the 3.0% dividend yield for many emerging markets, according to  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
""It should be noted that in previous global recessions, the profit recovery for Japanese corporates has always been a 'V' and we wouldn't doubt this time will be different,"" analysts at securities firm Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note last week.

Still, with so much hinging on the recovery from the pandemic, forecasts for the Nikkei are being revised up cautiously and gradually. Any setback in the development of a coronavirus vaccine will knock equities lower, Fujito warns.

""Honda is planning to launch sales of a Honda Legend (luxury sedan) equipped with the newly approved automated driving equipment"" before the end of March 2021, Honda said in a press release.
The race to build self-driving cars is a key technology battleground for automakers, with technology companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) also investing billions of dollars in a field expected to boost car sales. 
Japan's government earlier in the day awarded a safety certification to Honda's autonomous ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" driving technology, which legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.
""Self driving cars are expected to play a big role in helping reduce traffic accidents, provide transportation for the elderly and improve logistics,"" said Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. 
There are six levels of vehicle autonomy, from 0 to 5, ranging from manual cars or those with simple functions such as cruise control to fully self-driving vehicles that would not need steering wheels, or brake and acceleration pedals. 
Level 2 cars, which are currently on public roads, can control their own speed and steering, but must have an alert driver able to take control at all times.

In July, U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) said it was ""very close"" to achieving level 5 autonomous driving.

1577,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Edge Higher; E.ON in Focus,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening slightly higher Wednesday, with investors pausing for breath after this week’s strong gains on the back of coronavirus vaccine hopes.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
Global stock markets have responded positively this week to the news from U.S. pharmaceutical giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) that the vaccine it is developing, in conjunction with German partner Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX), was more than 90 percent effective at preventing Covid-19. 
In Europe, the DAX and the FTSE 100 indices are around 7% higher, while the CAC 40 has posted gains of over 10%.
“Certainly, there is a ray of hope from the vaccine and investors will have a little more confidence that we are moving into an early-stage recovery cycle rather than teetering on the precipice of another double-dip,” said ING analyst Chris Turner, in a research note.
However, as positive as this news is, the drugmakers still have to disclose safety data for their experimental vaccine before seeking regulatory approval, and if passed the rollout to the global population will still take considerable time.
Meanwhile, more than 300,000 people have died of Covid-19 across Europe. With just 10% of the world's population, Europe accounts for almost a quarter of the 1.2 million deaths globally from the disease, prompting governments to lock down their economies to try and prevent their well-equipped hospitals from collapsing under the strain.
With this in mind, investors are looking to hear from European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde about the European economic outlook and stimulus prospects in a speech at 1300 GMT.
In corporate news, E.ON (DE:EONGn) will be in focus after the German energy company reported a drop in third-quarter profit, but it also backed its full year outlook, citing a rapid market recovery.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, continuing the recent positive tone generated by Pfizer’s vaccine news, and helped further by an industry report showing that U.S. crude inventories fell by more than expected.
The American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of 5.147 million barrels of crude from last week’s stocks, as opposed to the 900,000-barrel draw expected. Crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $41.99 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1% to $44.05. Both contracts are up more than 10% this week.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,879.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1827.

At the same time, Dalio, who calls himself a ""chronic bull on China"", also told an online conference that not investing in the rising Asian power is ""very risky"".
Earlier this month, Chinese regulators shocked global investors by suspending the Shanghai-Hong Kong dual-listing by fintech giant Ant, just days before what would have been the world's largest stock market debut.
Dalio brushed aside concerns that the surprise move could dent investor confidence, arguing there's a risk of being too loose on innovation.
""Ant is a whole new concept in terms of banking, and almost could replace or threaten the banking system in China. And it hasn't yet been properly established in terms of regulatory review and the like,"" Dalio told the China Town Hall 2020.
""And it's important to be clear that what we have in China is state capitalism. So the state is going to control those things,"" said Dalio, describing Chinese regulators as ""reasonable, caring, and highly-informed.""
Dalio, whose hedge fund giant is famous for making money during the 2008 financial crisis, said even in the United States regulators struggle to strike the balance between freedom and restrictions, and ""there's always a wrestling match on that.""
After studying rises and declines of reserve currency empires over the last 500 years, Dalio judged that ""China is now evolving into that role"".
""To be absent (from) the Chinese capital markets is very risky,"" Dalio said, adding ""the fundamentals are undermining the U.S. dollar.""
He added that the U.S. is ""creating a lot of debt and printing of a lot of money, which in history was a threat to reserve currencies.""

Dalio, who first visited China 36 years ago, said ""people have accused me of being biased, naive, and in some cases unpatriotic. I think I'm just being objective.""

Investing.com – Hangzhou-based  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding (HK:9988) kicked off its annual Singles’ Day shopping festival on Wednesday, with sales already exceeding CNY372 billion, or $56.27 billion, ass of 12:30 AM ET (4:30 AM GMT). The order rate also hit a record peak of 583,000 per second, the company said.
Consumers are rushing to take advantage of the day of discounted products, with the COVID-19 pandemic largely under control in China. The company launched the event earlier than usual this year, with two primary discount periods taking place from Nov. 1 through Nov. 3 and on Nov. 11. Alibaba will also calculate gross merchandise volume over the full 11-day period starting Nov. 1 and not the usual Nov. 11, 24-hour period.
Other competitors, such as JD (NASDAQ:JD).Com, are also holding their own Single's Day events.
The event comes just one week after Chinese regulators suspended Ant Group’s $37 billion IPO. Alibaba, which owns a third of Ant Group, lost almost $76 billion of its market value following the news.
Chinese tech shares, including those of Alibaba and JD.Com, tumbled after the Communist Party unveiled draft regulations to root out monopolistic practices in the internet industry on Tuesday. Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares dived 8.86% to HK$251 ($32.27) by 1:14 AM ET (5:14 AM GMT).
The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), the country’s antitrust watchdog, is seeking feedback until the end of November on the regulations to curb anti-competitive behavior. These behaviors include collusion on sharing sensitive consumer data, alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals and subsidizing services at below cost to eliminate competitors. The regulations could also require companies that operate a variable interest entity, used by virtually all major Chinese internet companies to attract foreign investment and lists overseas, to apply for specific operating approval.
""I literally gasped when I first read these guidelines. The timing, on the eve of Singles’ Day, the forcefulness and the resolve to remake the tech giants is startling,” Joint-Win Partners securities attorney John Dong told Bloomberg.
Other investors also gave grim forecasts for Chinese tech stocks.
“Beijing’s tightening regulations, including the antitrust laws, are a heavy blow to the technology giants. It’s an additional blow to the shares, when investors are rotating out of the sector into old-economy shares because of the vaccine boost,” with firms such as Tencent and Alibaba likely to face continuous downside pressure, CMB International Securities Ltd strategist Daniel So told Bloomberg.
China will additionally strengthen its anti-monopoly examinations of the fintech sector, Liang Tao, vice chairman of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said earlier in the day."

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, after an earlier surge in global stocks earlier in the week over optimism that a COVID-19 vaccine would be successfully developed and launched.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (F:22UAy) released positive interim phase III results from their COVID-19 vaccine candidate BNT-162b2 on Monday. The results indicated that the vaccine was 90% effective in preventing infection, sending both global shares and hopes for a global economic recovery on an upward path.
“Investors anticipate a lift in economic activity and a swing back to physical businesses, judging by their support for travel, consumer, financial, materials and energy stocks,” CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said in a note.
Stocks in the region saw some gains even as U.S. shares saw losses after vaccines enthusiasm saw investors turn to cyclical stocks associated with economic recovery at the expense of market leaders.
Some investors suggested that this enthusiasm should be curbed, with the development of any vaccine still facing hurdles, such as tests for its efficacy and immunity period as well as delivery logistics, such as how to maintain the extremely cold temperatures that some vaccines need for shipping and storage. Other concerns include uncertainty over whether Congress would pass the latest U.S. stimulus measures, the smooth transition of power from incumbent president Donald Trump to president-elect Joe Biden and a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.
“You still have a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there, and while equities may continue to climb a wall of worry, the stock market is still subject to the rules of gravity,” Boyar Value Group managing director Jonathan Boyar told Bloomberg.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 1.71% by 10:45 PM ET (2:45 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was up 2.9%. Investors will be monitoring Alibaba's (HK:9988) Singles’ Day online shopping event, taking place throughout the day, to gather clues on the Chinese economic recovery.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up by 2.24%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 5.41% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 3.82%. In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.79%.
In the U.S., Trump continues his refusal to concede the presidential election to Biden, continuing legal action against the results. Uncertainty continues over the lack of a smooth transition of power and mixed signals about short-term U.S. policies.
The U.S. saw record 142,907 daily COVID-19 cases on Monday, but Human Services Secretary Alex Azar hinted that a public vaccination campaign could begin by spring 2021. However, Federal Reserve officials also warned that the uptick in cases would slow economic growth and necessitate more targeted government aid.
The campaign shouldn’t stop government stimulus efforts, ANZ Research strategists Liz Kendall and David Croy said in a note. “Policy makers remain vigilant and monetary policy will err towards being very accommodative until a vaccine can be comprehensively rolled out,” their note added.
“The reflation trade continues to work in earnest and the rotation to the unloved areas of the market continues,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a separate note.
Meanwhile, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are due to speak at the online “Central Banks in a Shifting World” ECB forum later in the day. Separately, finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 will hold an extraordinary meeting on Friday to discuss actions to assist poor nations that are struggling to repay their debts."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said on Tuesday he would block the nomination of a senior Trump administration official nominated to a seat on the Federal Communications Commission unless he agreed not to take part in an effort to impose new regulations on social media companies.
U.S. President Donald Trump in May directed the U.S. Commerce Department to file a petition with the FCC seeking to curb legal protections for social media companies.
Nathan Simington, a Commerce Department official, acknowledged at his Senate Commerce committee confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he played a ""minor role"" in drafting the petition. ""I helped with the blocking and tackling,"" Simington said.
Trump has railed against  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and other social media firms, claiming they have not treated him fairly. Before the hearing, via Twitter, he urged speedy action on Simington's nomination.
Trump abruptly pulled his nomination of FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly for a new term in August after O’Rielly questioned whether the FCC had authority to issue new social media regulations. Trump tapped Simington instead.
""You've been sent to the FCC instead of Mr. O'Rielly because he was fired. He stood up to the president. We need the FCC to be independent,"" Blumenthal said.
Blumenthal said because of Simington's role in the petition drafting, he should recuse himself from any regulatory decision.
Simington said it would be ""premature"" to recuse himself and said he would abide by FCC ethics office guidance on the issue.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said on Oct. 15 he would move to set new rules to define protections for social media firms under Section 230, a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users and allows them to remove lawful but objectionable posts. 
Many legal experts and internet companies argue the FCC has no authority to issue regulations under Section 230, while the FCC’s general counsel said Pai has authority. Simington said he agreed that the rulemaking was a good idea.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 06:01PM ET</span>",Europe charges Amazon with using dominance and data to squeeze rivals,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union charged Amazon (O:AMZN) with damaging retail competition, alleging on Tuesday that the U.S. company uses its size, power and data to gain an unfair advantage over smaller merchants that sell on its online platform.
The move by competition chief Margrethe Vestager, the latest European salvo against U.S. tech giants, comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified Amazon's role in the global economy, with online sales soaring in lockdowns. 
The European Commission has been investigating Amazon's position as both a marketplace for merchants and a rival seller, while the firm also faces scrutiny in the United States over its alleged mistreatment of sellers, as well as its dual role. 
The EU regulator looked into how Amazon collects data on competitors that sell on its platform, offering everything from electronics and toys to food and kitchenware. It says that Amazon uses that sensitive information, which shows what is proving popular or not, to better target its own products.
""The use of these data allows Amazon to focus on the sale of the best-selling products and it marginalises third-party sellers and caps their ability to grow,"" European Competition Commissioner Vestager told a news conference.
Vestager, who has a reputation of being one of the world's toughest antitrust enforcers, said that regulators had to ensure that dual-role platforms with market power, such as Amazon, did not distort competition.
Amazon disagreed with the EU assertions.
""Amazon represents less than 1% of the global retail market, and there are larger retailers in every country in which we operate,"" the company said.
A U.S. Congressional antitrust report earlier this year into the alleged abuse of market power by Amazon also raised the concerns highlighted by the EU and is likely to influence the case U.S. regulators bring against the company.
U.S. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and the top antitrust lawmaker in the House, applauded the EU and urged the U.S. Federal Trade Commision to take similar action.
""As we found as part of a 16-month bipartisan investigation, Amazon has monopoly power over sellers on its platform,"" Cicilline said. 
The EU charges are the latest example of how watchdogs around the world, led by Europe, are grappling with the challenges of regulating Big Tech, companies that have achieved dominance in their fields and vast troves of user data.
On Vestager's watch, the EU has imposed large fines on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and other companies. See FACTBOX:
A final EU decision could come next year. Amazon faces being fined up to 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching antitrust rules. However it can avoid a hefty penalty and a finding of wrongdoing by offering concessions to settle.
NEW INVESTIGATION
The EU competition enforcer has been investigating Amazon since July last year after rival traders voiced their grievances. The regulator said the charges related to Amazon's activities in France and Germany, its two biggest markets in Europe and where it is the dominant player. 
The case focuses on its use of merchant data on its platform. Vestager said her officials had trawled 80 million transactions and reviewed 100 million products on Amazon's platform to put the case together. 
The European Commission also opened a new investigation into Amazon on Tuesday, over the possible preferential treatment of its own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon's logistics and delivery services. 
That probe will look into the possible preferential treatment of Amazon's own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon's logistics and delivery services.
Regulators will investigate the criteria the company uses to select winners of its ""buy box"", which allows customers to add items from a specific retailer directly into their shopping carts.

""Its rules should not artificially favour Amazon's own retail offers or advantage the offers of retailers using Amazon's logistics and delivery services,"" Vestager said, citing the importance of e-commerce, an area which has gained importance with the COVID-19 pandemic.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>","House Democrats urge U.S. FTC, FCC to halt work on controversial items","By David Shepardson and Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior Democratic U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday demanded Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai and Federal Trade Commission Chairman (FTC) Joseph Simons halt work on all partisan or controversial items in light of last week’s presidential election results.
""We strongly urge the agency to only pursue consensus and administrative matters that are non-partisan for the remainder of your tenure,"" House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone wrote in letters to the two agencies joined by the subcommittee chairs overseeing the agencies, Representatives Jan Schakowsky and Mike Doyle.
The FTC held a meeting last month to discuss a pending antitrust investigation into  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), but the commission has not decided yet whether to file a complaint, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters at the time. It is not clear what impact the letter may have on the probe.
Pai said last month he would move forward to set new rules to clarify the meaning of a key legal protection for social media companies after a demand by President Donald Trump and over the strong objections of Democrats on the panel.
Trump lost his bid for re-election as media outlets declared former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat, the winner. 
Representatives for Pai and Simons did not immediately comment.
The two Democrats on the five-member FCC called on Pai to abide by the letter. 
""I urge FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to follow this past practice in order to ensure an orderly transition of agency affairs,"" FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said. ""I look forward to continuing to work on the routine and consensus matters currently before the agency.""
Fellow Democratic FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks agreed. ""Our congressional leaders have called for Chairman Pai to respect this precedent, and I expect that he will abide by their request,"" Starks said.

On Jan. 17, 2017, three days before Trump was inaugurated, the two Democrats on the FTC voted to sue chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, accusing it of breaking antitrust law. Republican Maureen Ohlhausen voted against the measure. The other two seats were empty. In September, the FTC filed a motion to rehear the lawsuit it lost on appeal against Qualcomm.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Tuesday introduced a MacBook Air notebook and other machines with its first central processor designed in-house for Macs, a move that will tie its computers and iPhones closer together technologically.
The new chip, called the M1, marks a shift away from  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) technology that has driven the electronic brains of Mac computers for nearly 15 years.
It is a boon for Apple computers, which are overshadowed by the company's iPhone but still rack up tens of billions of dollars in sales per year. Apple hopes developers now will create families of apps that work on both its computers and phones.
The MacBook Air will start at $999, the same as its predecessor, and have up to twice the battery life, Apple said. The M1 will also power the MacBook Pro notebook, which starts at $1299, and its $699 Mac Mini computer, which comes without a monitor.
The new products will be available from next week, executives said.
Shares of Apple were up about 0.2% as the event ended.
Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, estimated Apple will save between $150 and $200 per chip in costs by using its own central processors. ""We didn't see Apple add any expensive features,"" he said. ""They're going with a much higher margin."" 
EFFICIENT AND FAST
In June, Apple said it would begin outfitting Macs with its own chips, building on its decade-long history of designing processors for its iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.
Apple executives said on Tuesday that the M1 was intended to be efficient as well as fast, to improve battery life, and that Apple's newest version of its operating system was tuned to the processor.
""This announcement underscores how important high-performance, custom processor designs will be to leading the next generation of client computing,"" said Jon Carvill, vice president of Nuvia, a data center chip firm founded by former Apple executives. ""We think a similar trend is playing out in the future of the data center as well.""
Apple executives made numerous performance claims against prior generations of Macs and Windows-based laptops, virtually all of which are based on Intel chips, though Apple did not directly name Intel.
""We believe Intel-powered PCs — like those based on 11th Gen Intel Core mobile processors — provide global customers the best experience in the areas they value most, as well as the most open platform for developers, both today and into the future,"" Intel said in a statement.
Apple's phone chips draw on computing architecture technology from UK-based Arm Ltd, manufactured by outside partners such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TW:2330).
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Qualcomm Corp (O:QCOM) have been working together for four years to bring Arm-based Windows laptops to market, with major manufacturers such as  Lenovo Group Ltd  (HK:0992),  Asustek  Computer (TW:2357) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930) offering machines.
But for both Microsoft and Apple, the true test will be software developers. Apple is hoping that the massive group of iPhone developers will embrace the new Macs, which will share a common 64-bit Arm computing architecture with the iPhone and be able to use similar apps.
Apple software chief Craig Federighi said Adobe Inc (O:ADBE) would bring its Photoshop software to the new M1-based Macs early next year.
""The app ecosystem and the battery life are probably the two things people will gravitate to,"" said Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies.

Apple has seen a boom in Mac sales due to the coronavirus pandemic, notching record fiscal fourth quarter Mac sales of $9 billion earlier this month - all of them Intel-based. In June, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple would continue to support those devices for ""years to come"" but did not specify an end-of-life date.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 262 points, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 was down 0.11%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.37%.   
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) extended losses from Monday, dragging down the Nasdaq as investors turned to reopening stocks after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) yesterday announced a promising vaccine candidate against the coronavirus. Amazon was among the biggest drags after the European Union slapped it with an antitrust complaint that sent the online retail giant down more than 3%. That, and a recall of Amazon Ring, the doorbell that apparently can catch fire and burn users. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) bucked the trend, rising ever so slightly after announcing its first chip, the M1.
President-Elect Joe Biden said Tuesday that his transition is underway and nothing is going to stop it, even if President Donald Trump continues to stew in denial. Fellow Republicans are still supporting Trump's attempt to challenge Biden's victory, but their patience may be limited, Reuters reported. Senior aides said the president must produce evidence or exit stage left. Or right, as it were. 
Some travel stocks were higher on vaccine hopes, with TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) up almost 10%. Plane maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose 5% on hopes that its 737 Max will return to the skies before 2021.
Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) gained after announcing a deal to create a shop within a shop at select  Target  (NYSE:TGT) locations in the U.S.     
Cruise lines, on the other hand, were among the biggest losers after Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) reported a worse-than-expected loss and sales that fell far short of estimates. Carnival (NYSE:CUK) fell 13% after announcing a share sale under its previous $1 billion “at-the-market” equity offering program.
Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), which plummeted 20% yesterday on the stay-at-home sell off, increased 5% after announcing a deal with Beyonce. 
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) tanked 17% after reporting miserable third quarter earnings and being unable to fully clear up whether or not it is a partner or rival to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) new McPlant plant-based non-meat product under development.

1587,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>","Veteran's Day, Singles's Day, Lemonade: 3 Things to Watch","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com --  Markets were mixed on Tuesday, with tech stocks weighing on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on about 250 points. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was among the biggest drags after the European Union slapped it with an antitrust complaint that sent the online retail giant down more than 3%. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was an exception, as the iPhone maker traded slightly higher after unveiling new Mac computers featuring its in-house chip, the M1. The Dow's outperformance was due in part to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co., which surged on news the 737 Max's grounding may end as soon as next week.
President-elect Joe Biden said his transition is underway and nothing is going to stop the U.S. transfer of power, even if President Donald Trump continues with the as-yet unconvincing legal challenges.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. U.S. bond markets closed for holiday
It's Veterans Day in the U.S., and thus there are no major economic data releases and the Treasury market is closed. So it's all eyes on equities.
2. Shop Your Blues Away
Sure, it's happening in China, but Singles' Day is a global phenomenon. And  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) trades here. The event racked up a staggering $38 billion of sales last year. Several U.S. merchants will be making their first appearance, part of the largest international presence since the event's inception 11 years ago.
3. Turn Lemons Into...
The earnings calendar is lacking in star quality. One standout is Lemonade Inc (NYSE:LMND), the online home insurer backed by SoftBank Group Corp. that went public in July. Analysts are expecting $14.6 billion in revenue, but a 64-cent per share loss on the earnings front.

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Coronavirus vaccine hope dampens prospects for corporate stay-at-home darlings,"By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - The surge in shares of Netflix (O:NFLX), Zoom (O:ZM) and other of this year's stay-at-home corporate winners has been brought to a sudden halt by promising vaccine data suggesting a possible way out of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The jury was still out on Tuesday, however, as to whether that reverse, sparked by positive data from trials run by U.S. drugs giant  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Germany's BioNtech (DE:22UAy), would last.
Shares in video conferencing network Zoom fell 4% on Tuesday after plunging about 17% a day earlier. But both exercise bike maker Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), which sank more than 20% on Monday, and Netflix, actually gained ground on Tuesday.
Tech heavyweights from Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) to Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN) also suffered but have still mushroomed hugely in value this year. 
""Even if a vaccine proves effective, inoculating a large enough part of the population will take time and leave these segments prone to economic lockdown fallout,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Christoph Rieger. 
The shakiness of moves may have reflected both those doubts about the speed at which a vaccine can be produced and distributed as well as the remaining doubts about whether it will work as a solution in the long-run. 
But there is also the conviction that the pandemic has fundamentally changed business for many of these companies in ways that will not be reversed. 
""Investors are now focused on how the 'new normal' looks ... and how sustainable are the tailwinds for such companies as the direct impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior starts to diminish,"" MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni, said. 
Peloton, which has seen demand for its at-home fitness systems soar due to gym closures, recently posted a 274% jump in quarterly profit for its unit which sells interactive fitness equipment.
An outstanding beneficiary among tech stocks from the shift to work from home is Zoom, whose shares have jumped over 460% this year as corporate firms, schools, and organizations run countless virtual meetings on its video conferencing app.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) have seen a substantial boost to their business but the capital they have available for new investment has soared as a result - potentially giving them more leverage going forward. 
Shares of video game and e-sports related companies, which benefited from long cancellations of traditional sports leagues, tumbled after Pfizer's announcement, with game studios such as Activision Blizzard (O:ATVI) and  Take-Two Interactive  Software (O:TTWO) ending Monday's session lower. 
Gaming peripheral makers such as Turtle Beach (O:HEAR) and Corsair Gaming (O:CRSR) also tumbled on Monday, while U.S. listed shares of game developers and e-sports organizers  Bilibili Inc  (O:BILI) and  Sea Limited  (N:SE) saw their worst day since March.
All, however, are still up between 50% and 350% since March, while Corsair has risen 57% since its initial public offering in September. 
""The market is likely discounting a deceleration of growth for the sector in 2021,"" said Will Hershey, CEO of Roundhill Investments. 

""However, I believe that the growth in gaming due to the pandemic likely increased the trajectory of gaming adoption for years to come.""

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",Options buyers storm U.S. value stocks on vaccine hopes,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Options investors, who helped push technology stocks to record highs with buying sprees earlier this year, are now taking aim at small-cap and other economically sensitive companies, reflecting a broader rotation into value shares on news of an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Demand for call options, used to position for gains in equities, has jumped among several travel and leisure companies whose shares have suffered under months of coronavirus-fueled lockdowns and travel restrictions, including United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL), Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) and  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN), in the past week.
Investors have also rushed to position for further upside in small-cap stocks, whose performance is closely tied to sentiment about the U.S. economy. 
Skew - which measures demand for put options, used to protect against downside, versus calls - has dropped sharply for the small-cap focused iShares Russell 2000 ETF (P:IWM). The drop in skew indicates a pick-up in call buying.
The options activity mirrors recent trading in U.S. stocks, where investors rotated from growth to value shares on Monday after  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective.
The small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) surged 3.7% and the S&P 500 (SPX) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose close to record highs as the vaccine news sparked hopes of a quicker path to a full economic re-opening and recovery. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) fell.
Both U.S. equities and options markets saw surges in trading volume. Options volume posted a record on Monday with more than 48 million contracts traded, according to data from the Options Clearing Corporation.
The rotation continued Tuesday as the Russell 2000 continued to outperform, rising 1.8%. The S&P 500 was little changed, while the Nasdaq fell 1%.
The rotation could spark a rush to call options in travel, leisure and other cyclical names, similar to that seen in August with tech-related names, especially as more individual investors participate, said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

""I think that retail traders ... are 'equal opportunity' in their call exuberance,"" she wrote in an email to Reuters.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",United Airlines returns to New York's JFK after five-year absence,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Tuesday it is returning to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) on Feb. 1, 2021, ending a five-year absence in a move it hopes will tap into pent-up demand for transcontinental travel hit by the pandemic.
The U.S. carrier is re-launching service with daily flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco from JFK, which is also a major hub for international travel and normally one of the country's busiest airports, on a reconfigured Boeing (NYSE:BA) 767-300ER with expanded premium seating. 
Air travel demand has been severely bruised by the COVID-19 crisis and is expected to remain depressed until there is a widely distributed treatment or vaccines, forcing airlines to drastically scale back their flight schedules. 
However, United has found that as people slowly start traveling again, the ones who have taken flights in the midst of the pandemic are more likely to travel again, Chief Communications Officer Josh Earnest said on a call with journalists.
This is allowing the airline to build up a base of customers who are comfortable about air travel, he said, giving it some optimism about an improvement in demand even as it remains ""realistic that we are far below the levels that we experienced just one year ago,"" Earnest said.
On Monday, Chicago-based United said it expects the Thanksgiving holiday week to be its busiest since March and is adding more than 1,400 domestic flights to cater to the surge.
Still, United's overall schedule is only about half of what it was in 2019.
U.S. travel to the New York City area, where United currently operates out of La Guardia and Newark Liberty International, has been particularly hard hit in the pandemic. 

Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Executive Director Rick Cotton said United's return to JFK ""is a clear sign that air travel is returning in New York and across the region.""

1592,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 01:54PM ET</span>",Katy Perry Drafted in as Singles’ Day Aims to Beat $38 Billion Record,"(Bloomberg) --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. kicked off the world’s biggest shopping binge on Wednesday, an annual frenzy of consumption for hundreds of millions of people that this year will also serve as the best barometer so far of China’s post-pandemic recovery.
Sales were off to a brisk start at the opening of a 24-hour sale. The company, one of the world’s biggest online commerce sites, said sales totaled 372.3 billion yuan ($56.3 billion) after just the first 30 minutes on Nov. 11, including revenue from an additional shopping window earlier this month.
Singles’ Day debuted in 2009 and has grown over a decade into a nationwide marathon of frantic bargain-hunting that dwarfs sales events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday in both intensity and size. 2020’s edition features a record number of brand names from Apple to  Nike  betting that -- after months of Covid-enforced abstention -- China’s 400 million-strong middle class is ready to spend on everything from Hainan beach-side vacations to takeaway coupons and electronics.
Alibaba, Asia’s largest company, blew past last year’s record $38 billion at the beginning of the Singles’ Day, as it added three extra days to the annual festival earlier this month after the pandemic forced Chinese consumers -- who already buy about 30% of the nation’s retail purchases online -- to become more reliant on e-commerce. Homebound consumers turned grocery delivery into the industry’s hottest arena, anchoring an unprecedented surge in online activity during the nationwide lockdown. Domestic travel is accelerating, propping up Alibaba businesses such as Fliggy, while a raft of new smartphones launched during the quarter is expected to tap pent-up demand for electronics.
A strong start to this year’s sales fiesta -- also known as “Double 11” -- may bode well for China’s economy, providing further evidence that consumer spending, so far a laggard in the recovery, is strengthening.
“Double 11 has historically served as a very accurate indicator for what’s happening in the following year for retailers, brands as well as consumers,” said Jonathan Cheng, head of China retail at Bain & Co. “For this year, with Covid, it’ll become more important. And if you look at China, which is the first one to be coming out of Covid, it’s gonna be an indicator for other countries as well.”
The brainchild of co-founder Jack Ma and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang, Single’s Day was intended to be an antidote to the sentimentality of Valentine’s Day. It takes its name from the way the day is written numerically as 11/11, which resembles “bare branches,” a local expression for the unattached. Along the way, the company created the world’s largest shopping festival that has helped to propel Alibaba into a Goliath.
It’s also become an annual showcase for Alibaba’s cloud services as well as affiliate Ant Group Co.’s Alipay mobile wallet. A record event would be another feather in the cap for Ant, which could do with a win after tightening regulatory scrutiny that torpedoed its initial public offering last week.
Alibaba’s U.S.-traded shares were down 6.9% at 12:34 p.m. in New York.
Livestream Gala
In a nod to the pandemic, Alibaba scaled back on live events this year and is instead relying on increased online promotions such as celebrity livestreams to draw hundreds of millions of shoppers to its e-commerce platforms. Popstar Katy Perry is scheduled to appear at an online event Tuesday, four years after she pulled out from Alibaba’s annual live extravaganza to mark the shopping festival. Alongside the usual 24-hour sales period on Wednesday, 2020’s event featured an additional window for consumers to make purchases from Nov. 1-3.
Shoppers can purchase heavily discounted goods like cosmetics, clothing and groceries from its Taobao and Tmall platforms and have them shipped via the company’s Cainiao logistics service, and book flights to domestic tourist hotspots on the Fliggy travel website. Kaola -- purchased from NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. last year -- is participating for the first time, offering goods from 89 countries to consumers.
Foreign consumer brands have long relied on Alibaba to gain access to the Chinese middle class. That’s especially true this year, given how most economies elsewhere are grappling with a resurgence in the pandemic. During the first 111 minutes of sales on Nov. 1, Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). were among 100 brands that reported 100 million yuan ($15 million) in transactions. And Estee Lauder’s flagship store on Alibaba’s Tmall platform was the first to surpass 1 billion yuan in sales, the e-commerce company said. International hotel groups Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc. and Accor SA (OTC:ACCYY) also passed the 1 billion yuan transaction mark for the first time.

Sales Discounts
Expectations are high for Alibaba. Revenue in the September quarter grew at the slowest on record for the period, with customers putting off purchases on its Taobao and Tmall platforms in anticipation of deep bargains ahead. “The performance of Singles Day might be a more important benchmark to look at, rather than the third quarter result,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch.
As with previous years, Alibaba and its e-commerce rivals rolled out ever-larger promotions to entice consumers. Over the entire Single’s Day event, merchants could end up forking over a record 30 billion yuan in discounts and subsidies to goose sales across Tmall and Taobao alone, CLSA Ltd. analysts led by Elinor Leung estimated.
Those discounts may be the key to enticing consumers, which have only just started to loosen their purse-strings, to keep spending. China’s retail sales climbed 3.3% in September from a year ago and growth may have accelerated to 5% in October, as travel and other consumption picked up during the golden week holiday at the start of the month.
But overall retail sales are still down for the year -- shrinking about 7% in the first nine months from the same period in 2019 -- and it remains to be seen if strong spending during national holidays and one-off shopping events like Singles’ Day will translate into a sustained recovery. Private consumption accounted for no more than 0.5 percentage point of GDP growth in the third quarter and a full recovery in consumer confidence may only come in 2021, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group economist Xing Zhaopeng.
“Singles’ Day should see spending higher than a year ago but keep in mind retail sales were growing at 8% before Covid-19,” said Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. “If Singles’ Day is much better than expected, we should watch sales activity closely in December to see if this is a genuine pick-up or consumers are simply stocking up and staying cautious.”

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) lost another 12 orders for its grounded 737 MAX jetliner in October, and delivered 13 aircraft to customers, down from the 20 jets delivered in the same month a year ago, company data showed on Tuesday.
For the second straight month, the closely watched monthly snapshot revealed 787 Dreamliner quality flaws and the coronavirus pandemic kept hampering Boeing's efforts to develop an alternative cash cow to the 737 MAX.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) appeared about a week away from lifting a March 2019 safety ban, although the pandemic kept hammering demand for jets from Boeing and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR).
Airbus sold 11 jets last month and booked 72 jet deliveries, easing concerns over a cash-depleting overhang of unwanted jets.
The European Union's decision to impose tariffs of 15% on Boeing planes this week could hobble its jet deliveries in Europe.
Boeing said it lost orders for four 737 MAX jets from China Development Bank Financial Leasing Co, one from Czech Airlines owner Smartwings, three from Oman Air, and four from an undisclosed buyer or buyers.
Canceled MAX orders, including those where buyers converted to a different model, was 448 jets - and 460 for all jets across Boeing's portfolio, Boeing said. 
For 2020 through October, the number of MAX orders canceled, or removed from Boeing's official backlog when it applies stricter accounting standards, stood at 1,043 aircraft. 
For deliveries - a key metric since customers hand over most of the money at the time they pick up new aircraft - Boeing handed over 13 twin-aisle jets in October, compared to 20 a year earlier and 10 in September. 
That brings total deliveries to 111 aircraft in the 10 months through October 2020, down from 321 for the same period a year ago. 
The October delivery tally included one P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, one 747 and three 767 freighters to  United Parcel  Service (N:UPS), two 777 freighters to China Cargo Airlines, one 777 to German logistics company DHL, and one 777-300ER to Dubai-headquartered Novus Aviation Capital, Boeing said. 

Boeing also delivered four 787s in October: one 787-8 to American Airlines (O:AAL), one 787-9 to Leasing giant AerCap, one 787-10 to Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways, and one 787-10 Saudi Arabian Airlines.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 12:16PM ET</span>","BioNTech to price vaccine below market rates, differentiate between regions","By Ludwig Burger
Frankfurt - BioNTech, first in the race to produce evidence of a working COVID-19 vaccine, is planning to price the two-shot regimen below ""typical market rates"" and would differentiate pricing between countries or regions.
Speaking at a Financial Times online event, the German biotech firm's strategy head Ryan Richardson said the price tag of the vaccine, which is co-developed with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and which has yet to win regulatory approval, would reflect the financial risks that its private-sector investors have incurred.
""We've tried to pursue a balanced approach that recognises that innovation requires capital and investment so we plan to price our vaccine well below typical market rates reflecting the situation that we're in and with the goal to insure broad-based access around the world,"" Richardson said at the FT event.
""I expect there to be differential pricing in certain regions of the world,"" he added, declining to elaborate on the different price tags.
The vaccine was on Monday shown to be 90% effective, based on preliminary trial results, a key milestone in the war against a virus that has killed over a million people and battered the world's economy. 
In July Pfizer had agreed with the U.S. government the supply of 100 million doses of its potential vaccine at a price of $39 for a two-dose immunisation, or $19.5 per dose, with the option to sell another 500 million doses under conditions to be negotiated separately. 
The European Commission will discuss on Wednesday the adoption of a supply contract with Pfizer and BioNTech. The bloc earlier this week said a contract for up to 300 million doses was close to being signed, without providing financial terms. 
Richardson also said that the two partners' goal to supply 1.3 billion doses in 2021 would be the result of a ramping-up efforts well into the second half of next year.
While there would be ""significant supply"" during the first half, scaling up output would continue throughout 2021.
BioNTech's strategy chief stressed that, even though the German group had received public-sector backing, the risks taken by its investors would merit some financial rewards from a future vaccine.
""We incurred considerable financial risk. We have raised capital in the capital market,"" he said.
Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), said at the FT event that the Pfizer and BioNTech project was the only one among the 10 leading vaccine developers that had not received ""substantial public sector financing"". 

In June the European Investment Bank, the EU's financial arm, awarded BioNTech 100 million euros in debt financing for its COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacturing.
Germany's research ministry in September granted BioNTech 375 million euros, subject to meeting certain milestones, also to ramp up vaccine development and production.

A bankruptcy judge late Monday approved a deal to rescue the 118-year-old retailer, avoiding a total liquidation and saving what could be as many as 60,000 jobs.
The multiple-pronged rescue involves the sale of the now slimmed-down retailer for $1.75 billion to mall operators Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY), meanwhile lenders agreed to forgive $1 billion in debt in exchange for 160 properties and six distribution centers.
J.C. Penney was just one of more than two dozen retailers pushed into bankruptcy this year after the global health crisis forced shopkeepers to shut their doors for weeks..leaving them starved for cash and unable to pay the rent.
But J.C. Penney's troubles started long ago after it failed to adapt to the rise of online shopping.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",Nearly $2 trillion traded on COVID-19 vaccine news,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - News of a breakthrough in the race to find a COVID-19 vaccine sparked one of the heaviest trading days since the height of the pandemic crisis, according to early data analysed by Reuters, with nearly $2 trillion changing hands on Monday. 
Traders stampeded to the riskier plays in equities, foreign exchange and bond markets after  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) released positive data on its vaccine trial, while rotating out of safe havens such as technology stocks, Japanese yen  and top-rated bonds. 
""Volumes (are) also surging as programmes and baskets go to work to either correct portfolio balances or address margin calls,"" said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Securities, highlighting a jump in volumes in the airlines and banking sectors.
In the United States, nearly $500 billion worth of trades went through stock markets on Monday, one of the busiest days since March, when coronavirus lockdown fears rattled financial markets. Europe saw $120 billion traded, according to Refinitiv data.
Value stocks, typically companies that are more sensitive to economic cycles, notched their best one-day performance against their growth-focused peers ever in the United States after Monday's news of an effective vaccine against the coronavirus.
A similar trend was noticed in the bond and currency markets where volumes matched the panic trading seen during the depths of the market mayhem in March and double that of April when the coronavirus pandemic slammed into markets.
Total turnover for the 33 currency pairs on CLS, a major settler of trades in the currency markets, totalled $627 billion on Monday. Average daily turnover was $707 billion in March and $380 billion in April.
Bond market turnover also jumped. Nearly 170,000 contracts changed hands on the popular front-month German bund futures contracts , 1.5 times this year's average, according to Refinitiv data. 
Total turnover on German government bonds on Monday totalled nearly 9 billion euros ($10.63 billion), more than the average since the start of October, according to data from Marketaxess, a major trading platform.
""Turnover was about three times the 30-day average daily volumes in cash and very active in the futures space,"" said Jimmy Conway, head of EMEA equity trading strategy at Citibank.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>","Ford to add jobs to boost output of electric F-150, add electric van","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Tuesday it plans to hire 350 more U.S. workers to expand production capacity for its electric F-150 pickup truck in Michigan and add assembly of electric commercial vans at a plant near Kansas City, Missouri.
The company said it also will add a second vehicle at the Mexican factory that is already set to build the Mustang Mach-E electric sport utility vehicle. Ford did not disclose how many people would be hired to build the additional vehicle in Mexico, which would ""share a similar electrifed platform"" as the Mach-E.
Ford will invest $150 million to add production of electric vehicle motors and transaxles at a transmission factory in suburban Detroit, retaining 225 jobs.
The automaker's latest electric vehicle investments are part of an $11.5 billion plan mapped out through 2022. Ford has promised the United Auto Workers union that it will invest $6 billion in U.S. factories to build electric vehicles. 
Ford will increase production capacity for an electric version of its F-150 large pickup by 50% from its original plans, adding another 200 permanent jobs at a complex near its headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. Those jobs would be on top of 300 jobs previously promised for the electric F-150 line. 
The electric F-150, scheduled to go on sale in 2022, will compete with electric pickups planned by Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), General Motors Co (N:GM),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) and several startup companies, in a segment that was not on most automakers' product plans just a few years ago. 
Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford's Americas and International Markets groups, said the decision to boost electric F-150 output was taken after the truck's debut in June. 
Based on the response to the work-oriented electric truck from government agencies, commercial fleets and individual buyers, ""we started working on a substantial increase,"" Galhotra said in an interview.
Galhotra did not say how many electric F-150s Ford will be able to build.
Ford will invest $100 million and hire 150 workers to build electric versions of its Transit commercial van, scheduled to go on sale in 2022. The electric Transit will enter a field that is racing from virtually non-existent to crowded as established automakers and startups compete to respond to demand from e-commerce delivery companies for electrically driven and digitally connected vehicles.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Tuesday said it would roll out a new feature in the United States that will allow customers to reserve scheduled rides up to 30 days in advance.
The feature marks an expansion of Uber's traditional on-demand model and adds to previous initiatives that allow passengers to select drivers who accept pets or offer car seats.
Uber is seeing only a slow recovery of its U.S. rides business amid the coronavirus pandemic, with trips in the United States and Canada down 59% in the third quarter compared to last year.
Uber shares on Monday surged on the prospect of a coronavirus vaccine.
Company executives said the new Reserve feature was a response to customer surveys and focus groups that showed a need for an option to book rides in advance for appointments, such as doctor visits.
Uber already offers customers the option to schedule rides, but executives said the new Reserve feature also allows riders to favor specific drivers and provides $50 in Uber credit should a reserved ride not arrive on time. 
Scheduled rides have seen a surge in demand since the beginning of the pandemic in March, said Uber Reserve Product Lead Geoff Tam-Scott.
""On-demand is still going to continue to be our bread and butter... but a lot of riders have told us the appeal of the Reserve experience is create your trip and then don't worry about it,"" Tam-Scott said.
Uber said it will release the feature in more than 20 U.S. cities in the coming weeks, including in New York, Chicago, Miami, Houston and Seattle.
Riders pay an $8 to $12 reservation fee, which is included in the upfront price locked in when booking. Reserve initially is limited to Uber's premium car segments, but will later expand to other price ranges and rural areas.

(Reuters) - Motiv Power Systems, which provides chassis and software systems for medium-duty trucks and buses, said on Tuesday it had received an order for more than 100 electric delivery trucks from Bimbo Bakeries USA, America's largest bakery.
The deal comes after a successful pilot program at the U.S. unit of Mexico's Grupo Bimbo, using Motiv's delivery trucks - which are electrified versions of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's F-59 truck, using batteries provided by BMW.
The deal comes as delivery fleet operators face regulatory pressure in California and other states to buy electric vehicles, while coronavirus lockdowns have fueled a surge in package deliveries.
Motiv currently has 23 delivery trucks in production for Bimbo and will deliver 100 more in 2021, the company said. So far, Motiv has raised $95 million from investors.
Foster City, California-based Motiv has a number of pilot projects under way with a number of other fleets, Chief Executive Matt O'Leary told Reuters.
""This is a sign of the future,"" he said. ""We're on the verge of some major volume orders of EVs.""
There are currently few commercial electric vehicles currently in service, but a growing number of startup and traditional manufacturers including Ford and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plan to bring models to market in the next few years.
In August, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ordered 1,800 electric vans from  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz and has ordered 100,000 vans from startup Rivian.

Investing.com -- Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND)'s getting grilled after reporting miserable earnings and a possible relationship -- or not -- with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).
Shares are tumbling more than 20% after the plant-based burger maker reported a third quarter loss per share of 28 cents per share that compared to the expected earnings per share of 5 cents on sales of $94.4 million, which missed the estimated $132 million, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
The results were ""shockingly weak,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said, according to StreetInsider, lowering the price target to $120 from $240 and reiterating a neutral rating. Analyst Samik Chatterjee warned investors not to buy today's dip, noting the lack of clarity as to whether or not Beyond Meat is actually involved with a McDonald's veggie meat, as well as decelerating growth trends in U.S. retail consumption.
Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh reiterated a perform rating on Beyond Meat after the company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.3 million that fell short of the Street consensus of $13.1 million. A combination of weaker retail and foodservice revenue and sharply lower gross margins contributed to the miss.
""Management commentary suggests impacts related to the pandemic on the foodservice channel and consumer pantry loading contributed to the underperformance in Q3,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh, advising investors to remain on the sidelines, according to StreetInsider.
While a McDonald's partnership remains unclear, Beyond Meat did announce an actual deal with Pizza Hut to serve Beyond Pan Pizzas with Italian sausage and other non-meat meat ingredients.
Beyond Meat shares have been on a roller coaster ride since McDonald's said on Monday it would make the McPlant, a meatless burger. That sent shares of Beyond Meat lower, until Beyond Meat came out and said that it was actually a co-creator with the fast food chain on the McPlant patty. McDonald's hasn't said a peep about it yet.
Last month, Beyond Meat hit a record, rallying more than 150% in 2020. The stock has jumped repeatedly this year as the company has announced new products, including plant-based meatballs and expansion in China. McDonald's had tested a Beyond Meat patty in Canadian stores until April of this year.

The site is one of three plants Alibaba has launched under its manufacturing division, which marks the company's latest foray into the offline world as it seeks to diversify from e-commerce.
Speaking at a media briefing during Alibaba's annual shopping festival, CEO Alain Wu said Alibaba established Xunxi to help China's small merchants respond to consumer demand more quickly.
The division will expand, not by opening more factories but by getting more companies to use its services and by finding out which parts of its technology can be scaled up, Alain Wu, Xunxi's CEO, said.
Together with Taobao, one of Alibaba's main e-commerce sites, Xunwi will serve the ""long tail"" of the apparel industry - which is made up of brands that blossom online but lack access to advanced manufacturing services, Wu said.
""A lot of these small-and-medium-sized brands, their advantage is that they can adapt to changes in the market and meet consumer demand, but their disadvantage is in manufacturing because their technology and skills are limited,"" he said.
As part of its diversification, Alibaba also runs a supermarket chain called Freshippo, launched in January 2016, which has grown to operate more than 100 store fronts.

In addition, it runs a programme to help small convenience stores with product-sourcing and data analytics services and has opened a mall and a hotel in Hangzhou, both of which serve as pilot projects to test its new retail technology.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>","Still no clarity from UK to assess financial market access, says EU","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission is still waiting for Britain to say if it will diverge from European Union rules before Brussels can decide on UK financial market access, a spokesman for the EU executive body said on Tuesday.
Daniel Ferrie, the Commission's financial services spokesman, said Monday's announcement by Britain to grant EU financial firms selective access to the UK provided no further clarity on possible divergence from EU rules going forward.
With less than two months before Britain's full access to the EU ends under post-Brexit transition arrangements on Dec. 31, London's giant financial hub faces being largely cut off from its biggest customer.
Britain's finance minister, Rishi Sunak, said on Monday he would not wait for Brussels to decide on UK access and would instead unilaterally allow EU financial firms to offer selected services to UK customers from January.
The EU is assessing access under its ""equivalence"" system that opens the way for foreign financial firms if their home rules are as robust as those in the 27-nation bloc.
""The Commission’s assessment of the UK’s relevant rules for potential equivalence decisions is ongoing,"" said Ferrie, spokesman for EU financial services chief Mairead McGuinness.
It evaluates whether Britain's future as well as current regulatory frameworks reach the same outcomes as those in the EU, he said.
Britain has indicated it will not apply some EU rules and look to amend capital requirements for insurers.
""The UK Treasury’s statement provides no further clarity on the UK’s possible divergence from EU rules going forward, or about the UK’s future supervisory practices,"" Ferrie said.
The EU has only granted temporary access for derivatives clearing to date.
Expressing frustration with the EU equivalence process, Sunak told parliament on Monday that his team had spent months replying to Brussels even though EU and UK rules are the same.
""We haven't had a single question back from the European Union after sending 2,500 pages of responses over to them,"" he said.
Karel Lannoo, chief executive of Brussels think tank CEPS, said Britain had to stay open to EU financial firms if it wanted to remain a global financial centre.
But Sunak showed on Monday how Britain can move nimbly in financial services when the bloc faces lengthy process and compromises, he said.

""This is a threat for the EU, of which they are not yet aware,"" Lannoo said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Crispin Odey is to step back from running his London-based hedge fund firm as part of an overhaul of the group and instead focus on managing money for clients, the firm said on Tuesday.
Odey, one of Britain's highest-profile hedge fund managers and political donors, recently pleaded not guilty to a charge of indecently assaulting a woman in 1998 and remains on bail, with a trial scheduled for early next year.
As part of the reorganisation, Odey Asset Management (OAM) said it planned to create a new legal entity, Brook Asset Management, and would rename a number of funds under the Brook banner in the coming weeks.
""We have been planning for the next phase of OAM’s development for some time, while always mindful of fostering and maintaining the investment led and performance driven culture, that has driven its success these past three decades,"" said Chief Executive Timothy Pearey.
Crispin Odey would himself run a new fund focused on preserving capital during periods of high inflation, in addition to running his other funds, the company said.
""I am very excited about my new inflation focused Fund, as so few people in the market are thinking this way. This provides great opportunity for investment, which now more than ever demands one’s full attention,"" Odey said.
""The markets will continue to be very testing over the next few months as inflationary factors start to make themselves known.""

Crispin Odey was one of the biggest donors to the successful campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, and donated 10,000 pounds ($12,800) to Boris Johnson during his campaign to become prime minister.

The exuberant response to that news moderated later as the market absorbed the fact that the vaccine’s safety and longevity still need to be proved. In addition, numerous bottlenecks in manufacturing and distribution will have to be overcome before the vaccine can be widely administered.
The U.S. still faces ""a dark winter"", however, President-elect Joe Biden said late Monday, in response to data showing a fourth straight day of new Covid-19 cases topping 100,000. California Governor Gavin Newsom said that some counties would need to reverse their reopening measures, while New York City is registering more new cases than at any time since May. Nationwide hospital admissions are on course to top their spring peak, having breached the 59,000 level on Monday.
Among early movers, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was down 2.6%. That reflected not only the general rotation out of stocks that have done well from the accelerated trend to remote working and online shopping during the pandemic but also the announcement of fresh antitrust charges against it by the EU Commission. 
Beyond Meat  (NASDAQ:BYND) stock was the standout loser, however, sliding 22% after posting a sharp slowdown in sales and a net loss in the third quarter, which led to a barrage of broker downgrades. The situation was made worse by confusion over whether - if at all - the company will be a supplier to the meat-substitute McPlant initiative launched on Monday by McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). The fast-food chain hasn't confirmed Beyond Meat's claims that it will be a key participant.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs meanwhile fell another 7.5% to a seven-week low on reports that the valuation of its finance affiliate Ant Group is likely to be slashed by half when it refiles its IPO prospectus. China has recently instituted new regulations that will substantially raise capital and reserve requirements for the fintech giant.
Among the gainers, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) stock rose 10.6% after announcing a new distribution deal with  Target  (NYSE:TGT), while bank stocks held on to most of Monday's gains on perceptions that the rise in longer-term bond yields over the last week will greatly ease the pressure on their lending margins."

Ulta will have the stores next to Target's own beauty section, as well as on its e-commerce website, starting next year, with plans to expand to more than hundred locations over time.
""We see this as great traffic driver beginning in 2021 and a partnership that could potentially pave the way for future deals with other retailers/vendors,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said.
Sales of beauty products increased more than 20% in the second quarter, doubling their growth in the previous quarter, Target said in August, as people resume spending on non-essential items following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.
Ulta has more than 1,200 outlets, while Target operates nearly 1,900 stores.

Target's shares were up 1.3% at $156.99 in pre-market trading.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets and commodities continued to push higher on Tuesday, after the euphoria of a coronavirus vaccine had sent global equity indexes soaring to an all-time high and halted the bond rally. 
Having surged 4% on Monday on the vaccine breakthrough from U.S. and German drugmakers  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech there was a drop in the pace in Europe, though things were still shuffling forward. (EU)
The pan-European STOXX 600 was up another 0.4%, taking November's rally past 13% and though Wall Street looked set for a slow start, there was a further 2.7% rally in European banks as worries about mass loan defaults and even more negative interest rates continued to ease. (EU)
""We have some consolidation in markets but I don't think it's surprising given the size of the moves yesterday,"" said JP Morgan Asset Management's Hugh Gimber.
""The news we had was clearly a big step forward... it's a big piece of the jigsaw to getting the global economy back on its feet.""
Asian markets had been playing catch-up overnight, having been closed when Monday's news of the vaccine broke, although like Wall Street overnight, they lost momentum by the end of the session. 
Particularly encouraging was that the vaccine's trials had shown it to be more than 90% effective in preventing infection, much higher than expected.
Japan's Nikkei 225 ended up nearly 0.3% after being 1.1% higher in early trading which set a new 29-year high.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.7% higher after trading up as much as 1.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended up 1.1% and Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand gained 5.2%, 4.1% and 3.4% respectively.
World airline stocks, which have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, soared over 8%.
There was weakness in China, though, with the CSI300 Index slipping 0.6%. [.SS]
Analysts attributed the decline to the heavy exposure of China's indices to tech stocks, which came under pressure as investors bet on less consumer reliance on technology if a vaccine leads to an easing of movement restrictions.
U.S. tech had suffered on Monday too,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Jim Reid pointed out. The Nasdaq dropped 1.5%, COVID-19's video chat poster child Zoom fell 17% and sit-on-your-sofa winner Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) slumped 8.6%. (N) The Nasdaq was also set to open lower again later. 
""It was like a big piece of elastic,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Gimber said about moves of COVID-19 winners and losers. ""The further you stretch it the sharper it reverts, and the news of the vaccine was the catalyst for that reversion yesterday.""

GAME CHANGER 
The vaccine optimism was shared across all major asset classes. Oil prices were edging higher again in London trading after posting the biggest one-day percentage gain in five months on Monday.
The overnight rise had prompted some traders to take profit. In contrast to Pfizer and BioNTech's news, Brazil's health regulator suspended trials for China's Sinovac vaccine after adverse side effects had emerged.
While stocks have also rallied on the assumption that Democrat Joe Biden would be the next U.S. president, the top Republican in U.S. Congress on Monday did not acknowledge Biden as president-elect, raising concerns about a rough transition of power. 
""No surprises but it's essentially a rotation ... what was bought in the last eight months is now being sold and what was sold is being bought,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) global markets director Elizabeth Tian said.
Early on Tuesday, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga had instructed his cabinet to design a fresh stimulus package as well..
In the currency markets, the yen strengthened as much 0.4% to 104.96 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3230, up 0.5% on the day.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar edged up 0.1% versus the greenback at $0.7279, while Turkey's lira gave back nearly 2% of the 5.7% surge it saw on Monday after the country's top economic chiefs were replaced. 
The vaccine news had also sent long-dated U.S. Treasury yields skyrocketing on Monday in their biggest one-day jump since March. The yield curve, an indication of risk appetite, hit its steepest level since March.
Bonds had their biggest selloff since recoiling from March peaks. The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. government debt, which rises when prices fall, jumped 10.3 basis points on Monday and held above 0.9% on Tuesday at 0.9099%.
In Europe, German Bund yields were near their highest in a month too, [GVD/EUR] and Brent oil futures rose 9 cents, or 0.2%, to $42.49 after their 8% vault the previous session. [O/R]
""OPEC+ will now feel confident that a solution is actually on the horizon which will cure the oil markets current demand problem. It is not a pie in the sky, it is real and the solution is on its way,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB.

The faux meat maker's shares surged nearly 90% over the last year, as the company emerged as one of the leaders of a plant-based meat trend that has had fast-food chains falling over themselves in a rush to get the veggie products on their menus.
However, Beyond Meat said on Monday COVID-19 restrictions were cutting sales at many of the restaurants and food-service joints it supplies, while initial stocking up of its plant-based burgers and sausages at grocery stores had tapered down, leading to a surprise quarterly loss.
""We are struck by the degree to which third quarter revenues came in shy of the Street (it has been a long time since a food company missed like this) and our crystal ball into Beyond Meat's near-term fortunes is cloudier than ever,"" J.P.Morgan analysts said.
J.P.Morgan was not the only brokerage rethinking its forecasts for the company, as at least eight brokerages cut their price targets on the company's stock.
There was some confusion around Beyond Meat's involvement with McDonald's new ""McPlant"" product line, which was announced on Monday.
Beyond Meat said it had co-created the patty used in McPlant, but could not provide any further details, leaving analysts puzzled as to how much Beyond Meat could earn from the tie up.

""Lack of clarity around potential McDonald's deal adds insult to injury,"" Berenberg analysts said, adding that it was also weighing on the company's shares.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Tuesday, continuing Monday’s divergence in sector performance as markets reprice on the back of Pfizer’s positive news about its Covid-19 virus vaccine.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 231 points, or 0.8%, while S&P 500 Futures traded largely flat, and Nasdaq 100 Futures were off 169 points, or 1.4%. 
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 834 points, or 3%, higher, the S&P 500 gained 1.2%, but the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5%. This was the first time in 30 years that the Dow had climbed 3% but the Nasdaq had fallen.
Cyclical stocks led the market advance on Monday after pharmaceutical giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) announced its experimental vaccine, made in conjunction with German partner Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX), was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19. These gains are set to continue Tuesday. 
Also helping was the news that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized emergency use of Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) experimental Covid-19 antibody treatment.
Investors also look set to continue to dump the stocks that had previously benefited strongly during the coronavirus pandemic, such as the tech giants and stay-at-home plays Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The U.S. has just topped 10 million cases of Covid-19, just 10 days after reaching the 9 million mark amid a record surge in daily infections and hospitalizations.
“We are still facing restrictions through the winter and infection rates may still rise, but the market can now see an end to the crisis and there should be plenty of stimuli in 2021,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “All in all, it seems that 'normality' can reverse back earlier than expected.” 
The main economic release Tuesday is the Federal Reserve’s favorite gauge of the employment market, with JOLTs hiring data (job openings and labor turnover) due at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
Job growth was stronger than expected in October, with the unemployment rate falling to 6.9%, but some industries are still struggling with bringing employees back to work after business shutdowns.
Oil prices continued to push higher Tuesday, with traders looking to the American Petroleum Institute’s weekly oil inventory estimate, at around 4:30 PM ET, after last week’s report indicated a draw of more than 8 million barrels the previous week. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $40.72 a barrel, after jumping 8.5% the previous session, while the international benchmark Brent contract was up 1.2% at $42.93, after climbing 7.5% higher.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.2% to $1,876.05/oz, after falling more than 5% Monday as investors rushed into riskier instruments, like stocks, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1801.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",Norwegian Air could grind to a halt early next year without cash boost,"By Terje Solsvik and Laurence Frost
OSLO/PARIS (Reuters) - Norwegian Air's (OL:NORR) cash crisis could force the debt-laden budget airline to halt operations early next year, the company warned as it issued another plea for rescue funding after reporting quarterly results on Tuesday
The rapid expansion of the pioneer in low-fare transatlantic flights has left it with heavy debts and its problems have been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now serving domestic routes only, with six of its 140 aircraft flying.
""Norwegian is dependent on additional working capital in order to continue operating through the first quarter of 2021 and beyond,"" the carrier said.
The company held cash and cash equivalents of 3.4 billion crowns ($376 million) at the end of September, down from 4.98 billion crowns three months earlier.
Its latest plea comes after Norway's government on Monday rejected calls for more state support for the airline, the shares of which have lost 99% of their value since January, saying it would be too risky.
Following that rejection, the company said late on Monday that it would furlough 1,600 more staff, leaving only 600 people still working out its 10,000 before the pandemic.
In a further sign that Norwegian is running out of time, the board representative of its biggest shareholder - leasing company AerCap Holdings (N:AER) - resigned on Tuesday. 
Anton Joiner was Norwegian Air's deputy chairman of the board and had been elected in June. The airline did not disclose the reason for his resignation and an AerCap spokeswoman had no immediate comment. 
AerCap owned 13.4% stake of the airline at the end of September. 
'LIKELY COLLAPSE'
After Oslo's aid refusal, the grim quarterly numbers point to a likely collapse, said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska. ""It's not a pretty picture.""
Roeska also said that credit from the airline's suppliers is likely to dry up rapidly.
""This could cause a liquidity crunch in the very near term and we see few ways out for the group,"" he added.
Despite such pessimistic assesments, the company said that funding could potentially come from debt refinancing, a sale of aircraft and other assets, a conversion of debt to equity or from its owners.
However, aircraft leasing companies that own more than half of the airline after swapping earlier debts for equity are unlikely to put in any new cash, a source close to one of the firms said.
""Norwegian was a credit red light for lessors even before COVID,"" said the source, adding that they joined the rescue initially because liquidation would have saved only a few cents on each dollar owed and it would have had to sell aircraft in a market that was strained even before the coronavirus crisis.
""Norwegian was getting a friendly ear because it would have meant a glut of 787s,"" the source said. ""But that's become nearly irrelevant. 787s, 737s, A320s - they're all on the ground now.""
The company's third-quarter operating loss stood at 2.8 billion crowns, down from a 3 billion crown profit in the same period last year, with overall debt and liabilities of 66.8 billion crowns.

With only six of its 140 aircraft now operating, down from 21 last month, most of its short-haul planes are grounded alongside its entire fleet of 37 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliners.

(Reuters) - Pizza Hut on Tuesday launched two pizzas with plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat's (O:BYND) sausage in the United States and the United Kingdom for a limited time, taking advantage of the consumer craze for plant-based meat options during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The chain, owned by U.S.-based Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM), is jumping on the substitute meat bandwagon as more people search out healthier snacks and comfort foods. 
For Beyond Meat, the deal marks another feather in its cap and comes a day after it announced it had co-created the patty for McDonald's (N:MCD) new ""McPlant"" line of faux meat products that will debut in 2021.
Pizza Hut said it would offer Beyond meat's faux meat sausages as a 1-topping option on the Beyond Italian Sausage Pizza and as a special recipe in another pizza, The Great Beyond Pizza, across U.S. stores and some Pizza Hut Express stores from Nov. 10, until supplies last. 
In the United Kingdom, it will be offered at three outlets in London for only three weeks as well as in some locations in Luton and Liverpool, adding that the pizzas will be available only through delivery and takeaway in both countries. 
Consumers have been craving more plant-based meat alternatives. Retailers and large fast food chains have been answering the call, stocking freezers with several brands and adding options on menus. 
Pizza Hut's deal with Beyond Meat is three months after it ran trials with Beyond Sausage pizzas at five locations in Puerto Rico and tested its first-ever burger offerings through the Beyond Burger in China this past June. 

On Monday, Beyond Meat reported quarterly sales grew at its slowest pace since it went public in 2019, as shoppers eased off on buying burgers, sausages and meatballs at stores, having stocked up earlier in the year.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas (DE:ADSGn) expects sales to fall in the last three months of the year as coronavirus lockdowns return in Europe and despite forecasting a return to growth in China and strong demand for running gear and products designed by singer Beyonce. 
Third-quarter sales fell by a currency-neutral 3% to 5.96 billion euros ($7.05 billion), while operating profit fell 12% to 794 million euros, ahead of average analyst forecasts for 5.91 billion and 723 million euros respectively.
Adidas expects a similar level of sales decline in the fourth quarter as long as more than 90% of its stores stay open and shopper numbers are not hit too much by new lockdowns. About 93% of its global stores are currently open, but only 60% in Europe.
The German sportswear firm said it expects a fourth-quarter operating profit of between 100 million and 200 million euros, lower than most analysts were expecting.
""While at the beginning of the quarter we were on track for growth in Q4, a worsening of the pandemic in many regions of the world is again requiring our patience and support,"" Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said in a statement.
Adidas shares, which jumped on Monday on a COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough, traded down 5.55% at 1032 GMT.
""The short-term outlook appears less constructive given the current shape of demand and a rebuild in costs,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst James Grzinic wrote in a note.
Rorsted declined to comment on a recent magazine report that Adidas might sell its struggling Reebok brand, pointing only to a new five-year strategy he plans to present on March 10. Reebok sales fell 7% in the quarter. 
Adidas predicted a return to growth in greater China in the fourth quarter, even though the year-ago period was strong, with Rorsted saying he was upbeat for the country's annual Singles' Day ecommerce shopping event on Wednesday.
Sales of Ultraboost running shoes are strong as more people go jogging during the pandemic, while collections Adidas is releasing with Beyonce are also in high demand.
Ecommerce sales jumped 51%, with two-thirds of online sales in Europe and the United States coming through its loyalty programme, which now has 150 million members.
Adidas said it had replaced a loan from Germany's state-backed bank KfW with a 1.5 billion euro syndicated loan from partner banks, which finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer said might mean it could pay a dividend for 2020.

1626,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Landsec, Unibail Prove There's Life Left in Landlords","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Few sectors have been hit as hard by the pandemic as commercial landlords, so anyone looking for a sharp rebound from distressed levels may want to cast an eye on the news out of two of Europe’s biggest this Tuesday morning.
WFD Unibail Rodamco  (AS:URW) stock rose 24% and U.K.-based Landsec (LON:LAND) rose 7.5% after news releases that – though different in nature – both pointed to a brighter future.
For Unibail, the issue is relatively simple. The management had wanted to raise fresh capital to see it through the crisis. Unibail went into this year still burdened by its debt-financed acquisition of Westfield in 2017. Shareholders led by French tycoon Xavier Niel felt that management should instead raise more funds through asset sales, specifically, through the sale of Westfield shopping malls in the U.S.  
At a shareholder meeting on Monday, enough shareholders swung behind Niel and his allies to block the share issue and remove the dilution risk.
That vote is one of the first concrete consequences of the announcement from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Biontech on Monday about the effectiveness of their Covid-19 vaccine (which will be distributed first in the U.S.).  Faster vaccine availability means a faster return of consumer confidence, which means management should find it easier to raise the money it needs by selling Westfield malls in the U.S.
With Landsec, the issue is more nuanced. The company is the biggest owner of offices in London, which account for over two-thirds of its portfolio. Its more modern assets have sailed through the crisis reasonably comfortably. After a dip in the second quarter, rent collection was back at 99% in the three months through September.
But the company acknowledges it’s going to have to “reimagine” many of its older offices, acknowledging that the old model of cramming workers into the smallest space possible is no longer a viable model.
“As we emerge from the pandemic, the way employers and people seek to use office space will change as greater levels of remote working become the norm,” chief executive Mark Allan said in a statement Tuesday. “Many of the trends of recent years - the importance of sustainability, greater levels of flexibility, the role of the workplace in a health and wellbeing context - will accelerate.”
Allan has already said he will look at repurposing some assets as housing, always a safe bet in a market as structurally under-supplied as London.
To be sure, this is going to cost Landsec a lot of money. Like Unibail, Landsec will need to find someone to pay up for disposable assets in a market where the long-term damage of Covid-19 is still far from clear.
However, the company is confident that it has the money to do both that and resume payouts to shareholders. It will pay 12 pence a share for the first six months of the current fiscal year, a yield equivalent to 3.5% at the current price (Unibail is also still paying dividends but anything above 250 million euros this year will be paid out in the form of shares).
Given its London focus, Landsec is exposed heavily to a high-impact Brexit transition that hits the financial services industry. However, having lost over half its value since the 2016 referendum, that seems firmly priced in.
More interestingly, and in defiance of much commentary about the future of work after the coronavirus,  Landsec still believes in the Big City as a concept in the post-pandemic era.  
“While Covid-19 has instilled a fear of densely populated areas in the near term, it is also increasingly highlighting people's desire to come together, the challenges and limitations that emerge when they can't and the significant network effects of mixing commerce, arts, science and power in one place. Cities, and London in particular, have bounced back from many such crises in the past and will do so again.”
Despite bouncing 35% in the last two weeks alone, the shares still appear to offer a cheap entry point for anyone willing to buy into that vision.

Commercial jet revenue was the hardest hit, falling to $177 million from $408 million a year ago as the pandemic ravaged commercial travel. 
But the executive jets division, which some analysts believed would be a bright spot as the ultra rich would spend to travel in isolation, also fell significantly. Executive jets revenue fell to $212 million from $363 million a year ago. 
Its defense division, however, managed to grow its revenue on higher deliveries of military planes. Still, Embraer's defense division remains a smaller business segment than making civilian planes. 
The company said it burned through $567 million in cash during the quarter.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday approved a deal to rescue J.C. Penney Co Inc from bankruptcy proceedings precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic, averting a liquidation that would have put the beleaguered department store chain out of business and jeopardized tens of thousands of jobs. 
The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas approved the deal, which will allow the 118-year-old retailer to emerge from bankruptcy before the upcoming holiday season, the company said in a statement. The rescue deal is expected to save approximately 60,000 jobs.
The transaction contains multiple parts. Lenders led by H/2 Capital Partners will forgive $1 billion in debt in exchange for 160 properties and six distribution centers. Mall operators Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY) will acquire the company's slimmed-down retail operations for $1.75 billion in cash and debt.
The sale approval comes a week after J.C. Penney's lawyers announced a settlement with nearly all of its creditor groups that locked in support for the sale and marked a turning point in a bankruptcy case that has been marked by inter-lender fighting. However, a group of equity holders – whose investments will be wiped out – remained opposed to the deal.
J.C. Penney filed for bankruptcy in May with nearly $5 billion in debt. The company was one of several retailers, including J. Crew Group Inc, Neiman Marcus Group and Brooks Brothers that sought Chapter 11 protection amid the coronavirus pandemic.

James Cash Penney launched the company in 1902, opening the first store in Wyoming. J.C. Penney went public in 1929 and over the next several decades became ubiquitous across the United States. The business began to stumble in recent years as online commerce took a toll on traditional brick-and-mortar retail.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Dealers in India for Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) said on Tuesday they are exploring legal action against the iconic American motorcycle brand after it effectively abandoned the market as part of a broader restructuring plan.
The dealers have hired leading Indian law firm AZB & Partners to review their paperwork with Harley-Davidson and suggest if there is a legal remedy, Rishi Aggarwal, a dealer for the motorcycle company, told reporters. 
""Harley has to compensate us for our losses. That is the only bone of contention. AZB is studying the case,"" he said during a press conference organised by The Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) in India. 
Harley-Davidson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Harley-Davidson in September said it would discontinue its sales and manufacturing operations in India in a move it said would involve $75 million in restructuring costs, some 70 redundancies and the closure of its Bawal plant in northern India. 

In October it entered a distribution deal with India's  Hero MotoCorp  (NS:HROM). Hero will also develop premium motorcycles to sell under the Harley brand.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>","U.S. to see more Chinese listings as Biden will make art of deal easier, advisors say","By Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese companies' stock market listings in the United States reached a six-year high in 2020 and advisors expect the trend to accelerate in the year ahead in expectation of a stable regulatory regime under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden. 
Twenty six initial public offerings (IPOs) of Chinese firms worth $10.6 billion have been completed in the United States so far in 2020, up from the $3.4 billion worth of deals last year, according to Refinitiv data.
The volume this year is already the highest since 2014 when there was $29 billion worth of Chinese IPOs in the United States led by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd's $25 billion listing, the data shows.
While Biden, set to take office on Jan. 20, is not expected to make major changes to Washington's tough stance on China-led investment, bankers and lawyers believe policy and regulatory stability could return following four turbulent years of the Trump administration.
""We won't be waking up in the middle of the night anymore to a Trump tweet that can ruin a deal,"" said a Hong Kong capital markets lawyer, who could not be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.
Analysts have said Biden would take a more measured approach to Chinese tech threats but was unlikely to unwind President Donald Trump's unilateral curbs on Chinese firms such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and Bytedance.
Capital markets consultancy Kapronasia founder Zennon Kapron said while technology would remain a sensitive topic the appetite of Chinese tech firms, particularly fintech, to float in the United States could increase if relations improved.
The shelving by regulators of Ant Group's planned $37 billion IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong earlier this month, he said, could prompt Chinese tech companies to look abroad.
""It seems that the new U.S. administration may take a hard, but measured approach to U.S.-China relations,"" Kapron said.
""This move may create renewed interest due to the lack of clarity on the specific reasons that the Ant Group IPO was delayed.""
Among the prospective issuers, Chinese beauty company Yatsen Holding Ltd has filed to list on the New York Stock Exchange and is looking to go public before the end of the year.
Another a draw card for an overseas listing is that regulation of financial technology companies in the United States is generally seen as lighter compared to China and Hong Kong, according to advisors working in the sector.
But the threat of Chinese companies being delisted for not meeting U.S. auditing standards will persist with a Biden administration, with no indication the proposed rules will change.
Prospects of a higher valuation on the world's deepest stock market and access to a larger investor base, however, makes the risk of eventual delisting manageable, advisers said.

""Predictability is the biggest asset for IPO activity,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management Chief Asian Market Strategist Tai Hui.

(Reuters) - European shares hovered at eight-month highs on Tuesday on optimism around signs of a breakthrough in developing a COVID-19 vaccine, although concerns about the depth of the economic damage from the pandemic capped gains.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was flat after rallying 4% in the previous session as U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said its COVID-19 vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech SE (O:BNTX), was more than 90% effective in preventing the infection.
""The results of the Pfizer study are certainly welcome news, however, one swallow does not make a summer and there still remains some way to go before life can return to any semblance of normal,"" said Michael Hewson, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
European shares have already surged 11% this month as investors also cheered the possibility of calmer global trade under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, but strict lockdowns to contain surging coronavirus cases have threatened a nascent economic recovery at home.
Data on Tuesday showed British employers made a record number of staff redundant in the third quarter and the jobless rate jumped. London's export-laden FTSE 100 (FTSE) was up 0.6% by 0835 GMT.
Italy's bourse (FTMIB) added 0.1% a day after posting its best day since March. The country is ramping up business restrictions in Tuscany and four other regions to rein in the second wave of the pandemic.
Banking (SX7P), travel and leisure (SXTP), and energy (SXEP) stocks were among the biggest gainers in morning trading after clocking gains of more than 7% on Monday.
""Even if a vaccine proves effective, inoculating a large enough part of the population will take time and leave these segments prone to economic lockdown fallout,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Christoph Rieger said.
Investor attention has also been on Brexit trade talks with Britain's transition period set to expire by the end of the year. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered a heavy defeat in parliament's upper chamber on Monday over proposed laws which would allow him to breach the exit treaty.
Focus later in the day will be on a reading of the German investor sentiment for November. Economists expect sentiment to have ticked lower following a bigger-than-expected slump in October.
In company news, shares of shopping mall owner Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (AS:URW) surged 28.4% to the top of the STOXX 600 after its shareholders voted against a planned 3.5 billion euro ($4.15 billion) rights issue.

Investing.com - European stock markets largely edged higher Tuesday, continuing Monday’s coronavirus vaccine-inspired optimism, helped by some positive corporate news.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7%, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index climbed 0.4%.
On Monday, the DAX rose nearly 5%, the CAC 40 jumped 7.6% and the FTSE 100 climbed 4.7% after U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said its Covid-19 vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, was more than 90% effective in preventing the infection. 
Banking, travel and leisure and energy stocks continued to post gains Tuesday, after strongly outperforming on Monday.
Specifically, aero engine maker Rolls Royce (LON:RR) leaped another 20% to a five-month high, on expectations of a faster pick-up in air travel. Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock climbed 2.2% after the troubled airline launched an offering for around 525 million euros ($620.97 million) of senior unsecured convertible bonds due in 2025.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) stock rose 1.2% after the company announced it was in talks with the German government over an aid package for its struggling steel unit worth at least 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion).
But, sportswear firm Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) stock fell 3.6% even as it said it expects sales to return to growth in China in the fourth quarter.
As welcome as the news of the vaccine is, it doesn’t change “the near-term fact that the global economy faces a challenging winter,” said ING analysts, in a research note. 
“Renewed lockdowns across the eurozone are likely to shave roughly 2% off GDP in the fourth quarter, according to our latest forecasts, while the risk of further restrictions in the U.S. will put a considerable brake on activity.”
The economic news remains challenging. British employers made a record number of staff redundant in the third quarter while France's unemployment rate rose to its highest level in two years. Eyes will next focus on the important German ZEW economic sentiment index later in the session, and it’s expected to show a sharp decline in November.
Oil prices steadied Tuesday, after Monday’s sharp gains on the back of the vaccine news. With the number of coronavirus cases continuing to rise in Europe and parts of the U.S., and some lockdown measures in place, the short term picture for crude demand remains challenging.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $40.64 a barrel, after jumping 8.5% the previous session, while the international benchmark Brent contract was 1% higher at $42.84, after climbing 7.5% higher.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.7% to $1,885.90/oz, after falling more than 5% Monday as investors rushed into riskier instruments, like stocks, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1835."
1634,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>",Westfield owner Unibail's shareholders reject rights issue,"By Sarah Morland
(Reuters) - Shareholders of Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW) (AS:URW) have voted against a planned 3.5 billion euro ($4.15 billion) rights issue, the shopping mall owner said on Tuesday.
The rejection follows vehement opposition from a consortium led by French billionaire Xavier Niel and Leon Bressler, the company's former CEO.
""We will need to study all possible alternatives to rapidly strengthen the group's financial structure,"" Chief Executive Christophe Cuvillier said on a call.
He added that a majority of shareholders supported the capital increase but the votes fell short of the two thirds required.
Shareholders also approved three supervisory board appointments put forward by the rebel consortium - namely Niel, Bressler and Catalan businesswoman Susana Gallardo. 
Unibail, Europe's biggest property owner, announced the capital increase in September as part of a broader restructuring. Cuvillier said the group still planned to implement the plan's other measures.
He added that a possible first COVID-19 global vaccine could help the group significantly - notably boosting sales opportunities in the United States - but did not change the necessity of shoring up the group's balance sheet. 
Retailers have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many forced to close during government-enforced lockdowns. Mall owners have also had to help tenants with rent relief. 
The consortium had argued that Unibail did not need the rights issue to meet its financial obligations up to 2023 and that it would destroy the group's share value.
It blamed URW's heavy debt on its 2017 acquisition of Westfield, which is mainly focused on the United States and Britain.
While management had proposed billions of euros in European assets disposals, the consortium called for Unibail to refocus on Europe and sell off its U.S. real estate.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely lower Tuesday, handing back some of Monday’s outsized gains, as investors become more cautious after the early euphoria over the initial trial results of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.7%.

The gains on Wall Street were equally strong initially, with the exception of the Nasdaq Composite, which is filled with stocks that have benefitted from the stay-at-home trade. However, late selling ate into the gains of the other main U.S. indices, amid caution over the time scale and the scope of the production of the vaccine. This has translated into losses in Europe Tuesday.
As welcome as the news of the vaccine is, it doesn’t change “the near-term fact that the global economy faces a challenging winter,” said ING analysts, in a research note.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 01:25AM ET</span>","Analysis: Vaccine news may weaken need for U.S. stimulus, but help still needed - investors","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An apparent breakthrough in a coronavirus vaccine weakens the case for another large U.S. fiscal stimulus bill, but relief is still needed for struggling businesses to create a bridge for the economy, investors said.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s announcement that its vaccine was more than 90% effective in tests come as Senate Republicans and House Democrats are in a standoff over the health of the economy and investors are closely watching any movement over talks. 
Democrats have pushed for a $2 trillion package, with support for state and local governments that are facing steep layoffs, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pushed back, arguing Congress should enact a smaller coronavirus stimulus package highly targeted at the pandemic's effects.
""You have to assume in general that whatever level stimulus you would have received will probably be less because policy makers will say that the economy will mend,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. Equity Strategist for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
The vaccine news came after the United States became the first country to cross more than 10 million coronavirus cases on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally. 
New Jersey joined some other U.S. Northeast states on Monday by reimposing economic restrictions such as closing indoor dining by 10 p.m.
Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz (DE:ALVG), the corporate parent of PIMCO, cautioned that stimulus relief was still required to minimize the pandemic's economic and social effects. The ""inclination is to argue that the fiscal support is no longer needed. That would be wrong,"" he tweeted.
Talks for another stimulus bill will likely be affected by polls for two open U.S. Senate seats at play in the Jan. 5 run-off elections in Georgia, said Esty Dwek, head of global macro strategy at Natixis Investment Managers, who cautioned that the U.S. economy remains weak.
""Even with a vaccine we need stimulus,"" she said, adding that the risk is that any further relief bills will ""be about politics and not about need.""
LESS DEPENDENT ON STIMULUS
While another stimulus bill would likely extend the market rally, the lack of a relief package now will not sink stocks or investor sentiment as much as before Pfizer's news, said Lamar Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co.
""The downside risk of what does a world looks like in a no-stimulus scenario is frankly less disastrous to the market than it was yesterday,"" he said. ""We now appear to have blue skies ahead if all of this is as positive as it looks.""
As investors moved into riskier assets on Monday, stocks hit record peaks while benchmark 10-year Treasury rates jumped to their highest since March, when the U.S. economy froze under lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus.
Expectations for an imminent vaccine will likely push interest rates higher as investors price in an economic rebound next year, said Jabaz Mathai, head of U.S. rates strategy at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), wrote in a note Monday. ""Nevertheless, a stimulus package would be ideal to create a bridge for the economy.""
Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, said a vaccine reduced the need for a stimulus but said if it was not available to the general public until March or April, ""we might need something to bridge that.""
Markets could continue to rally even if new stimulus is pushed to next year, said Anwiti Bahuguna, head of multi-asset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle. A stimulus bill will now likely range from $500 billion to $1 trillion, rather than the $2 trillion plus that Democrats had been pushing for, she added.
""People were rightly staying away from certain sectors"" like hotels and travel, she said. The market's broad rally Monday ""implies that rotation trade is on.""

Scientists, public health officials and investors welcomed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test as a watershed moment that could help turn the tide of the pandemic if the full trial results pan out. However, mass roll-outs, which needs regulatory approval, will not happen this year and several vaccines are seen as necessary to meet massive global needs.
Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) said they had found no serious safety concerns yet and expected to seek U.S. emergency use authorization this month, raising the chance of a regulatory decision as soon as December.
If granted, the companies estimate they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.
""Today is a great day for science and humanity,"" said Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla, noting the data milestone comes with ""infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen.""
Experts said they wanted to see the full trial data, but the preliminary results looked encouraging.
""This news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general,"" said Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford.
There are still many questions, such as how effective the vaccine is by ethnicity or age and how long immunity may last.
""But the bottom line is, as a vaccine it's more than 90% effective, which is extraordinary,"" top U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN.
Pfizer expects to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for people aged 16 to 85. To do so, it will need two months of follow-up safety data to assure no side effects crop up. That is expected to be available in the third week of November.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said it would take several weeks for U.S. regulators to receive and process the data before a potential approval.
MARKETS SURGE
The prospect of a vaccine electrified world markets with the S&P 500 and Dow hitting record highs. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said on Monday it expected the S&P 500 index to hit 4,000 points by early 2021 and called Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine and called Pfizer Inc's PFE.N COVID-19 vaccine update ""one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years.""
Stock of theme park and film company Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) rose 12% and movie chain operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings was up 51%. Shares in companies that have thrived during lockdowns, such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and conferencing platform Zoom Video (O:ZM) tumbled. Gun stocks sold off on higher hopes for a return to normal and a lack of civil unrest.
Pfizer shares jumped more than 8% to their highest since July last year, while BioNTech's stock hit a record high. Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan forecast the vaccine may generate sales in excess of $8.5 billion for Pfizer in 2020-2021 alone.
Shares of other vaccine developers in the final stage of testing also rose with Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) up nearly 4% and  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA), whose vaccine uses a similar technology as the Pfizer shot, up more than 8%. Britain's AstraZeneca (L:AZN), however, fell 2%.
Moderna is expected to report results from its large-scale trial later this month. ""It's likely that we're going to have more than one vaccine that's effective,"" Fauci said.
William Schaffner, infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, called the Pfizer results better than most anticipated. ""The study isn't completed yet, but nonetheless the data look very solid."" 
U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed the test results, and the market boost: ""STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!"" he tweeted.
President-elect Joe Biden said the news was excellent but did not change the fact that face masks, social distancing and other health measures would be needed well into next year.
The World Health Organization called the results very positive but warned there was a funding gap of $4.5 billion that could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries.
There are other challenges as well that could affect less affluent countries. The Pfizer vaccine must be shipped and stored at an extremely cold temperature, which requires necessary infrastructure. Even many U.S. hospitals lack these super cold storage units, which may impact when and where the vaccine becomes available in many U.S. rural areas as well.
That highlights the need for more traditional vaccines in development, such as J&J's candidate.
'NEAR ECSTATIC'
Still, there was cause for jubilation.
""I'm near ecstatic,"" Bill Gruber, one of Pfizer's top vaccine scientists, said in an interview. ""This is a great day for public health and for the potential to get us all out of the circumstances we're now in.""
Between 55% and 65% of the population will need to be vaccinated to break the dynamic of the spread of COVID-19, said Germany's health minister Jens Spahn, adding that he did not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021.
The European Union said on Monday it would soon sign a contract for up to 300 million doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
The companies have a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year. They did not receive research funding from the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program.
The drugmakers have also reached supply agreements with the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.
The interim analysis, conducted after 94 participants in the trial developed COVID-19, examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo. 
Pfizer did not provide that detail, but over 90% effective implies that no more than 8 of the 94 had received the vaccine, administered in two shots about three weeks apart.
The efficacy rate, which could drop once full results are available, is well above the 50% effectiveness required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine.
Shortly after Pfizer's announcement, Russia said its Sputnik V vaccine was also more than 90% effective, based on data collated from inoculations of the public.
MORE DATA NEEDED
To confirm the efficacy rate, Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases among volunteers. Bourla told CNBC on Monday that could be before the end of November.
Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain's University of Warwick, noted that the data may show the vaccine keeps people from getting sick but not necessarily from becoming infected. ""And the subtlety there ... is if you're infected then you can still transmit the virus.""
Dozens of drugmakers and research groups around the globe have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which on Sunday exceeded 50 million cases since the new coronavirus first emerged late last year in China. 
The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. The technology is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles.

The Trump administration has said it will have enough vaccine doses for all of the 330 million U.S. residents who want it by the middle of 2021.

Uber announced in July that it would buy Postmates for $2.65 billion in an all-stock deal after its bid to acquire rival Grubhub Inc fell apart over regulatory and other concerns.
The ride-hailing company disclosed in a regulatory filing in September that the Justice Department was also scrutinizing its plan to buy Postmates over antitrust worries.
The agency's move put the deal on hold until both companies complied with the government's request for more details to receive an approval.
The deal would aid Uber in expanding its food delivery market share and significantly increase the business of supplying everyday goods at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has pummeled its core ride-hailing service.

The Justice Department, Uber and Postmates did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

1645,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Up Over Positive Pfizer Vaccine News,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, following European and U.S. shares’ strong overnight performance after positive news about the development of a COVID-19 vaccine also lifted hope for the global economic recovery.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)’s vaccine candidate, which is being co-developed with Germany’s BioNTech (F:22UAy), was more than 90% effective in preventing infection. The claim is backed by results from the first 94 people to be infected with COVID-19 in Pfizer's large-scale clinical trial.
The news saw airline, tourism and travel stocks in the region climb higher earlier in the session, with Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Limited (HK:0293)’ Hong Kong shares up 14.9%, Japan Airlines (T:9201) soaring 7.6% higher and ANA Holdings (T:9202) jumping 16.4%.
“The clearing of the election fog has permitted underlying market fundamentals to come back into focus and the most recent vaccine news suggests a ‘return to normality’ should be coming sooner rather than later … all the chips are starting to line up, and market sentiment may be in the early stages of a burst of positive energy,” Principal Global Investors chief strategist Seema Shah told Bloomberg.
“Markets will remain on the lookout for more promising vaccine data in addition to news of a fiscal reboot,” PineBridge Investments portfolio manager Mary Nicola told Reuters, agreeing with Shah.
Despite the global enthusiasm over the news, other investors cautioned that vaccine availability and the ‘return to normality’ could still take time. Pfizer has yet to test the vaccine for efficacy and length of immunity provided.
“Given more tests are needed, then the approval process, manufacturing and distribution would mean the vaccine, if truly effective, is still months away from mass deployment,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management chief Asia market strategist Tai Hui told Reuters.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.12% by 11:36 PM ET (3:36 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.79%. In contrast to the news from Pfizer,  Sinovac Biotech  Ltd (NASDAQ:SVA)’s final stage trials in Brazil for its own vaccine candidate Coronavac have been halted due to a serious adverse event that occurred on Oct. 29.
On the China data front, figures for October’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) disappointed. CPI grew 0.5% year-on-year, against the forecast 0.8% and September’s 1.7%, while contracting 0.3% month-on-month, against the forecast and September’s 0.2% growth. The PPI contracted 2.1% year-on-year, against the forecast and September’s respective contractions of 2.0% and 2.1%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.90%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.66%. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga instructed his cabinet to design a fresh stimulus package earlier in the day to boost the economy and mitigate the ongoing economic impact from COVID-19.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.02% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.59%."

(Reuters) - South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co is supercharging its product portfolio next year with the introduction of several new SUVs, while looking even farther out to the launch of its first urban air taxis toward the end of the decade, the company's top U.S. executive said on Monday.
""We are all-in on autonomous vehicles,"" as well as electric vehicles, said Jose Munoz, president and CEO and Hyundai Motor North America, at an Automotive Press Association teleconference.
His remarks come at a time when investment in robo-taxis has slowed, even as the global pandemic has spurred interest in personally-owned vehicles, especially trucks and SUVs.
Hyundai hopes to tap that interest next year with the all-new Santa Cruz, a compact utility vehicle with a pickup bed, and the Ioniq 5 crossover, the first in a series of new all-electric models.
Early next year, the redesigned Tucson compact crossover goes into production at Hyundai's Montgomery, Alabama plant, which also will begin building the Santa Cruz in late spring as part of a $410 million expansion.
Munoz said Hyundai will work with the new Biden administration to develop infrastructure to support battery electric and hydrogen electric vehicles.
He seemed most excited by Hyundai's work with Motional - its $4 billion self-driving technology joint venture with Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) PLC - and its partnership with Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) on urban air taxis, which Munoz predicted would be in operation at such major U.S. airports as LAX in Los Angeles and JFK in New York ""by 2028, maybe earlier.""
Hyundai already is developing ""flying devices"" powered by electric motors and batteries that can transport five to six passengers from highly congested urban and suburban centers to those airports, Munoz said.

""We see a lot of opportunity ahead of us in autonomous vehicles,"" including air taxis, he said.

1647,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 10:20PM ET</span>","Pfizer, BioNTech initial vaccine results impress, but scientists remain cautious","By Julie Steenhuysen and Kate Kelland
CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday said initial trial results for  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine far outpaced their expectations for protection against a completely new disease, but that many questions remain unanswered.
The drugmakers said their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, based on data from the first 94 people in the trial to become infected with the coronavirus.
The efficacy rate means that the overwhelming majority of infections occurred among people who received a placebo rather than the vaccine.
The 44,000-volunteer study was initially designed for a first interim analysis of whether the vaccine was working after 32 participants developed COVID-19.
Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer's senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said in an interview the companies changed the study plan after discussions with U.S. regulators and ultimately ended up with data on 94 people.
""It gives you more power and more confidence,"" said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. ""When you triple the numbers and you get a large difference between them, it's much more likely to be real.""
Others cautioned that many questions remain, including whether the vaccine can prevent severe disease or complications, how long it will protect against infection and how well it will work in the elderly. 
They noted that required safety data will not be available until later this month. In addition, Pfizer and BioNTech have yet to submit their data for peer review by other scientists, a key step in determining the quality of the results. 
'REALLY ENCOURAGING' BUT EARLY
""These are really encouraging but they are the earliest of results possible,"" said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
The full study is designed to show the vaccine is effective after 164 people fall ill. Pfizer said that may happen in the first or second week of December, when a panel of outside advisors to the Food and Drug Administration reviews the study results and decides whether to recommend authorizing its use.
Gruber said he did not yet have a breakdown of how many of the first 94 infections occurred among Black or Latino participants, two communities hit hard by the disease. He also did he know exactly how many elderly people in the trial got sick. Older people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19
So far, none of the 94 people in the initial analysis developed severe COVID-19. The FDA initially had requested that the interim data include at least five severe cases, but recently relaxed that requirement, Gruber said. 
""If a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,"" said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University.
Gruber expects there will be some cases of severe disease before the trial ends.
""Bottom line is we're going to have to use the data we have and the high efficacy to give us confidence that we're going to prevent severe infection,"" he said.
Scientists also want to understand whether the Pfizer vaccine fully prevents people from getting infected with the new coronavirus - a huge advantage in reducing transmission - or if it simply reduces the degree to which they become ill.
""Ideally, we want to be able to completely protect from infection, but I think we all accept that these so-called first generation vaccines are more likely to prevent disease,"" said Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain's University of Warwick. ""And the subtlety there, which is important, is if you're infected then you can still transmit the virus.""
Pfizer intends to seek a broad approval for individuals aged 16 to 85, but the FDA and an advisory group to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would make decisions about who should be first in line to get the initial doses, which will be scarce.

If Pfizer wins emergency use authorization, Gruber said the company feels ethically bound to inform eligible trial participants who received a placebo that they are not protected against infection, and to offer them the vaccine in hopes of keeping them from dropping out of the trial.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 10:20PM ET</span>","Disneyland furloughs more workers, citing 'limbo' on reopening","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) said on Monday it was furloughing additional workers from its Disneyland theme park in Southern California, because it still does not know when the state will allow it to reopen because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The number of furloughs, which include executive, salaried and hourly workers, was not known. It comes on top of the 28,000 employees who were laid off in September, mostly across Disney's U.S. theme parks, in California and Florida.
The furloughs was announced in a memo to staff from Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock that was seen by Reuters. Disneyland, located in Anaheim, has been closed since mid-March.
California health authorities in October dashed hopes of the reopening of large theme parks anytime soon, saying that cannot happen until a county's COVID-19 risk level falls to the lowest of the state's four tiers regarding coronavirus spread and infections. 
""The recently released state guidelines put us in limbo regarding a reopening timeline in the foreseeable future,"" Potrock's memo said.
As a result, Disney was ""in the untenable situation of having to institute additional furloughs for our executive, salaried and hourly cast,"" he said.
The furloughed employees will be able to maintain health insurance, and Potrock said he hoped to get them back to work once Disneyland eventually reopens.
Disney's theme parks in Florida and those outside the U.S. reopened earlier this year without seeing new major coronavirus outbreaks but with strict social distancing, testing and mask use.

Disneyland Paris was forced to close again late last month when France imposed a new lockdown to fight a second wave of coronavirus cases. The company's theme parks in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo remain open.

The Kuala Lumpur-based power company is working with an adviser on its planned restructuring, and aims to finish the process as soon as the first half of next year, the people said. Upon completion, the plan is for a listing by introduction of the generation business, where investors would be given shares in the unit in proportion to their existing holdings in Tenaga, the people said.
Deliberations are at an early stage and there is no certainty the deal will proceed, said the people, asking not to be identified as the process is private. A representative for Tenaga said the company is not working on any groundwork for a listing, as its current focus is to drive operational efficiency for the generation unit.
Shares in Tenaga rose as much as 6.2% on Tuesday, their biggest advance since April 17. The rise outpaced the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index’s uptick of as much as 2.1%.
Tenaga counts state-owned sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd. and pension fund the Employees Provident Fund among its largest owners. The power utility won approval from shareholders in a special meeting in February to reorganize its power generation and distribution businesses into separate holding companies, according to a stock exchange filing.
The move is aimed at preparing for upcoming reforms in the electricity supply industry in Malaysia, the company said in a statement. The power generation unit’s earnings before interest and taxes in 2018 was 1.6 billion ringgit ($389 million), according to the statement. It is targeting 2.6 billion ringgit in 2025.
The power company would be following Malaysian conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd. which listed its property and plantation units by introduction in 2017.
Tenaga, which has a market value of about 59.3 billion ringgit, owns 47 plants in peninsular Malaysia with a total domestic generating capacity of 10,617 megawatts, according to its 2019 annual report. It also has a presence in the U.K., Kuwait, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India and Indonesia.

1650,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>",These Charts Show the Euphoria the Vaccine News Created,"(Bloomberg) -- A wave of euphoria surged through global financial markets Monday after a study showed a vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) protects most people from Covid-19.
Investors stampeded out of haven assets like the yen and Treasuries and rushed into securities most exposed to an economic recovery. The outsized moves reflected pent up hope that a return to normal lies in the not-so-distant future, even as experts cautioned the road to a vaccine will not be a short one.
“Trading the beginning of a pandemic, in some ways, is easier than trading a vaccine to address the virus,” said Jim Vogel of FHN Financial. “The next story chapters are obscure and harder to time. For the first day of the news, the reaction in the bond market looks appropriate, while equities appear slightly ahead of themselves.”
Here’s a look at the major moves:
Value Surge
Investor euphoria over the potential breakthrough sent the world’s cheaper stocks surging the most on record relative to their faster-growing peers. The MSCI All-Country World Value Index jumped 3.7% on Monday, while its growth counterpart fell 0.7% as investors rotated out of defensive technology names and into shares depressed by the economic impact of lockdowns. Buying cheap stocks -- a strategy that has repeatedly failed investors -- is likely to show “greater staying power” this time, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. quantitative strategist Marko Kolanovic.
Haven Dump
A global rush out of haven assets after the positive vaccine news sent the yen tumbling by the most since March on Monday. The Japanese currency fell almost 2% against the greenback in heavy volume, weakening past the 105 level. The move was a rapid reversal for the yen, which had reached close to 103 per dollar on Friday amid uncertainty over the U.S. election result.
Retail Rush
The euphoria was most evident in stocks favored by retail traders, such as cruise operators and airlines. A Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) basket of retail favorites closed up over 4%. So overwhelming was retail’s celebration Monday that brokerages from  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. to TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) Holding Corp. faced technical difficulties.
Steady Volatility
With volatility already falling in the aftermath of the U.S. election, Monday’s dramatic risk-on move saw the Cboe Volatility Index halt its decline. The VIX edged higher, bringing to an end a five-day streak of losses.
Junk Jump
Already buoyed by Joe Biden’s presidential victory, U.S. junk bond yields plunged to a record low on Monday. The average yield for the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. corporate high-yield index sank to 4.56%, dropping below the previous record of 4.83% set in June 2014.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 09:20PM ET</span>",Vans owner VF Corp to buy streetwear brand Supreme for about $2.1 billion,"By Aishwarya Venugopal and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - VF Corp (N:VFC) said on Monday it would pay $2.1 billion to buy streetwear apparel company Supreme, adding another popular brand to the Vans shoe maker's roster.
VF Corp, which also houses brands such as The North Face and Timberland, said it would make an additional payment of up to $300 million, subject to satisfaction of certain post-deal closing milestones.
Shares of VF Corp surged about 13% to $78.94 in afternoon trading.
It said current investors  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and New York-based private equity firm Goode Partners were selling their stakes in Supreme, founded by American-British businessman James Jebbia in 1994.
Known for its red box logo with ""Supreme"" written in white, the brand has gained a following among ""hypebeasts,"" or fans of the streetwear style, with product launches of everything from hoodies to burner phones selling out in minutes and people lining up outside its 12 stores worldwide for hours.
Perceived scarcity has helped Supreme to acquire a cachet among young people and allowed it to charge far higher prices than other streetwear brands like VF's Vans and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
""This scarcity, novelty and strong social influence model supports meaningful pricing power resulting best in class profitability,"" VF Corp Chief Executive Steve Rendle said.
VF Corp estimated the broader streetwear market to be a roughly $50 billion global opportunity and that Supreme was at the epicenter of this market, he said.
VF Corp executive said its deal with Supreme will help bolster its e-commerce business, which has become more urgent for apparel and footwear makers due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Supreme, which has collaborated with many prominent fashion names including Louis Vuitton as well as Nike, Levi and Vans, gets over 60% of its revenue from the online business.
The deal, which is expected to be completed late in 2020, is anticipated to contribute at least $500 million of revenue and adjusted earnings per share of 20 cents in fiscal 2022.
Supreme does not provide group sales or profit figures but its UK-based European arm is obliged to publish annual accounts and these have showed rapid growth and industry-leading margins in recent years.
In the year to the end of January 2019, Supreme's European business racked up revenue of 100 million pounds ($130 million) despite having just two stores and a profit margin, before interest expenses, of 44% - a multiple of the margins earned by other streetwear brands like Vans, Abercrombie & Fitch or even luxury brands like Gucci, company filings show.
Analysts have wondered whether Supreme will be able to maintain its premium pricing as its products become more ubiquitous, but were more sanguine after Monday's announcement.

""Supreme is a strong streetwear brand .... and while the brand has built its appeal on scarcity, we believe the market will be excited at the margin and growth profile and its contribution to VFC,"" Bernstein analyst Jaime Merriman said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Global stocks and oil jumped and Treasuries sold off on Monday as progress in the development of a coronavirus vaccine lifted investor confidence in a world economic recovery.
""Preliminary trials have caused markets to come alive, not that they needed much encouragement,"" Chris Weston, Pepperstone's Melbourne-based head of research, wrote in a note Monday.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said its COVID-19 vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), was more than 90% effective in preventing infection, marking the first successful results from a large-scale clinical trial.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.95%, the S&P 500 gained 1.17% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.53%. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.47%.
Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.5% to a 29-year high in early trade and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.4%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures rose 1.85%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.12% higher.
Pfizer's announcement jolted European shares to an eight-month high, building on expectations of more stable trade policies following the U.S. election.
While stocks have also rallied on the assumption that Democrat Joe Biden would be the next U.S. President, the top Republican in U.S. Congress on Monday did not acknowledge Biden as president-elect, raising concerns about a rough transition of power.
Senator Mitch McConnell said in a speech that President Donald Trump was well within his rights to look into charges of election ""irregularities"" but did not offer any evidence of fraud.
The dollar index rose 0.65%, but Joseph Capurso, a strategist with Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) in Sydney, expects the move to be short-lived.
""As a counter cyclical currency, the USD falls against most currencies as the global economy improves, with the exception of the JPY,"" Capurso wrote. He noted modeling suggested the dollar was ""significantly undervalued"" against the yen.
The Australian dollar fell 0.07% versus the greenback at $0.728.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.25% versus the greenback to 105.09 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3171, up 0.06% on the day.
The vaccine news also sent long-dated U.S. Treasury yields sky-rocketing in their biggest one-day jump since March. The yield curve, an indication of risk appetite, hit its steepest level since March.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 31/32 in price to yield 0.9235%, from 0.82% late on Friday.
The CBOE Market Volatility index, a barometer of investor anxiety, hit its lowest closing level since late August.
Oil prices surged, posting their biggest daily percentage gain in more than five months as the vaccine news and an OPEC output deal fueled optimism about rebounding demand.
Gold prices slumped as investors pivoted away from the safe-haven metal in favor of riskier assets.
Spot gold added 0.4% to $1,868.68 an ounce.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brightening prospects for a COVID-19 vaccine and greater clarity on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election have not dimmed expectations for volatility in U.S. stocks.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" reversed course on Monday to end higher, at 25.75, after having reached its lowest level since August.
Data showing an effectiveness rate above 90% for  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) experimental COVID-19 vaccine sent shares in small-cap companies and in value sectors such as financials and energy soaring, while shares in technology-related companies lagged. The trading marked a departure from the long-standing trend of tech outperformance.
Yet stocks trimmed gains as some investors who had bet on such a rotation sought to take profits, analysts said. Likewise, many options investors closed positions that benefited from gains in such shares. The flurry of activity - leading to near-record trading volume in U.S. stock options - drove up volatility as a result.
""It was a pretty violent unwind,"" said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
Volatility could persist over the next week given heavy positioning in short-term call options, used to bet on further upside in stocks, according to strategists at RBC Capital Markets. An unwind of those positions could exacerbate stock moves, a phenomenon known as the ""gamma effect.""
Lingering political risk could also keep market participants on tenterhooks for the next few months. VIX futures show that volatility expectations appear relatively steady for the first half of 2021, but prices for most contracts stand near 25, compared to the index's long term average of 20. 
Two January runoffs for Senate races in Georgia could determine whether Democrats or Republicans control that chamber. Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock face an uphill battle against incumbent Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. [nL1N2HU0GM]
Investors have embraced the idea of a divided Congress, which would make it more difficult for a Biden administration to push through tax hikes or increased corporate regulation. But should Democrats win both seats in Georgia, they could control the Senate with a tiebreaker vote from Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
""The Senate being Republican-controlled is fairly important to the whole story for volatility,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management.
Moreover, though Joe Biden has secured enough Electoral College votes to win the White House, President Donald Trump has not conceded and has put forth legal challenges to the election results. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he supported Trump's efforts. [nL1N2HV2GI]
A bumpy transition between White House administrations could also boost anticipation for volatility, said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets. 

""With the markets exuberant today, I worry about the coming days, weeks and months,"" she wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: FAA in final stages of Boeing 737 MAX review; could approve as early as Nov. 18,"By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is in the final stages of reviewing proposed changes to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX and expects to complete the process in the ""coming days,"" the agency's chief told Reuters on Monday.
Three sources briefed on the matter told Reuters the FAA is set to lift its grounding order on the plane as early as Nov 18.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in a statement that he expects ""this process will be finished in the coming days, once the agency is satisfied that Boeing has addressed"" safety issues involved in two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
Boeing declined to comment.
The FAA decision comes as other global regulators are also moving closer to decisions on allowing the plane to again resume flights and could approve the MAX around the time U.S. regulators act, the sources said.
The ungrounding would be a vital step in a still-arduous path to recovery for Boeing, plunged into its worst-ever crisis by the crashes and the worldwide grounding of its best-selling plane in March 2019.
""The FAA continues to engage with aviation authorities around the world as they prepare to validate our certification decision,"" Dickson said. 
""As I have said many times before, the agency will take the time that it needs to thoroughly review the remaining work. Even though we are near the finish line, I will lift the grounding order only after our safety experts are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.""
Following the FAA green light, airlines must complete software updates and fresh pilot training, a process that will take at least 30 days, before the planes can return to the skies.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), the world's largest MAX operator, has said it would take several months to comply with the FAA requirements and that it does not plan to schedule flights on the aircraft until the second quarter of 2021.
The grounding has cost the U.S. planemaker billions, hobbled its supply chain, and triggered investigations that faulted Boeing and the FAA for a lack of transparency and weak oversight during the jet's development, among other problems.
A Justice Department criminal investigation is ongoing.
As the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated the MAX crisis, Boeing slashed production and shed thousands of jobs. It has been locked in negotiations with airlines over taking delivery of some 450 already built 737 MAX planes being stored at facilities around the United States.
Last month, China's aviation regulator said it had not set a timetable for the plane's return to service.
Europe's chief aviation safety regulator said in September the MAX could receive regulatory approval to resume flying in November and enter service by the end of the year.

Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu said Monday he expects the MAX to fly in Canada early next year.

1655,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 07:26PM ET</span>",Exclusive: NextEra Energy in $15 billion bid for Evergy - sources,"By David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  NextEra Energy Inc  (NYSE:NEE), the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy, has made a roughly $15 billion all-stock acquisition offer for U.S. power utility Evergy (NYSE:EVRG) Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Evergy turned down the offer in recent days and it is unclear whether NextEra will make a new approach, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. One of the sources added that NextEra had no immediate plans for a new bid. 
The offer for Evergy shows how NextEra is seeking to capitalize on a rally in its stock by pursuing large acquisitions. In September, NextEra was rebuffed by  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK), another major utility it approached with a takeover offer.
NextEra's bid valued Evergy in the mid $60s-per-share, said the sources. Evergy informed NextEra that the price was inadequate, and that it also required a detailed plan to overcome regulatory hurdles to a deal, the sources added.
Evergy shares ended trading on Monday up 5.4% at $57.99. NextEra shares ended trading down 0.3% at $75.51, giving the company a market capitalization of $148 billion.
Evergy solicited takeover bids earlier this year under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. It attracted NextEra's interest, but Evergy decided last summer to remain independent. It is not clear what prompted NextEra's latest takeover approach.
""As previously discussed... we conducted an extensive strategic review process, that process is complete, and our attention is focused on our sustainability transformation plan,"" an Evergy spokeswoman said. NextEra did not respond to a request for comment.
U.S. utilities are under pressure to gain scale through dealmaking, as they grapple with the swelling costs of serving a larger population, upgrading aging infrastructure and investing in cleaner energy production. 
Evergy was formed out of the merger of Great Plains Energy and  Westar Energy  in 2018 and serves 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri. The company is searching for a new leader after chief executive Terry Bassham announced in August that he would step down. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company has also unveiled a standalone plan that calls for infrastructure investment and cost reductions.
NextEra, the largest U.S. utility, owns two electric companies in Florida serving more than 5.5 million customers, and is the biggest producer of renewable energy. It briefly surpassed oil giant  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s market capitalization last month to take over as the most valuable U.S. energy company, underscoring the value that investors place on cleaner forms of energy. 
NextEra CEO James Robo said on Sept. 30 that he would not pursue hostile acquisitions because major deals in his industry could only clear regulatory hurdles if companies worked co-operatively.
Regulators are often concerned that mergers could push up electricity bills for consumers or weigh on capital expenditure. The Great Plains/Westar tie-up took around two years to complete, after the Kansas regulator demanded changes. 
LOST DEALS
NextEra has previously lost out on acquisitions by not acquiescing to regulatory demands.
When it sought to buy Texan power utility Oncor for $18.4 billion four years ago, NextEra was asked by the state regulator to operate Oncor at arm's length. NextEra declined, arguing it needed board control and the ability to extract cash to fund its dividend. It lost the deal as a result, with Oncor subsequently acquired by  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE).
NextEra had previously spent two years trying to buy Hawaiian Electric Co for $4.3 billion. It abandoned that deal in 2016, amid regulatory concerns the benefits promised by NextEra to local consumers were insufficient.

To be sure, NextEra has managed to complete acquisitions. It paid $5.1 billion for Gulf Power from  Southern Co  (NYSE:SO) in 2018, pledging to cap transmission rates in Florida for five years, according to a regulator statement at the time.

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 06:30PM ET</span>",Vaccine news gives U.S. value stocks their big day,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Value stocks notched their best one-day performance against their growth-focused peers ever, by one measure, after Monday's news of an effective vaccine against the coronavirus sent investors into shares of companies expected to benefit the most from an economic recovery.
 Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, a potentially major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than a million people, hammered the world’s economy and upended daily life.
Shares of companies that have struggled for months under coronavirus-fueled lockdowns surged, with the S&P 500 index (SPX) closing just shy of a record, and some investors believe the moves may have further to run if the vaccine news continues to be favorable.
Value stocks tend to be companies that are more sensitive to the economy's fluctuations.
Here’s a look at today’s market action, as well as how value and growth have stacked up through the years.
(GRAPHIC: Valuable day - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwbgjqpw/Pasted%20image%201604956416423.png)
Monday's percentage gain for the Russell 1000 Value Index (RLV) exceeded that of the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 7.48%, the largest margin in history, driven by bets that the prospects of a working vaccine some time in the next few months could help industries that have suffered under coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions. 
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 sectors - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpozwjwvd/Pasted%20image%201604957398442.png)
Sectors such as energy, travel and financials, which were among the hardest hit by lockdowns aimed at curbing the virus, were some of the biggest percentage gainers on Monday, while technology stocks and other ""stay-at-home"" plays made smaller gains or declined.
(GRAPHIC: Growth vs. value - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznpnndlrpl/Pasted%20image%201604955412621.png)

Monday's action stood in contrast to the performance of growth against value over the last several years, when big technology and communications companies have soared while energy and other value sectors have relatively subdued.

In an interview with CNN, Fauci said he believes he will stay in his current role for the time being and he has no intention of leaving. President Donald Trump, who is attempting to contest his apparent loss in last week's presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden in the courts, has publicly criticized Fauci and has not spoken to the country's leader on fighting infectious diseases since early October, according to Fauci.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>",Retail trading hits snags as vaccine news sparks stock scramble,"By Muvija M and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Stock trading volumes on retail platforms hit record levels on Monday, although the impact of positive news about  Pfizer 's (N:PFE) experimental COVID-19 vaccine triggered problems for clients of some major brokerages.
Equities rallied after the first successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine caused a stampede to buy stocks. 
However, some retail traders said technical difficulties meant they had missed out on the rally.
Monitoring website Downdetector.com said customers of Merrill Lynch, Fidelity,  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW), TD Ameritrade (MX:AMTD) and Vanguard had problems logging in or placing orders. 
Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade acknowledged issues with their platforms and later said in statements posted on Twitter that they have been resolved.
A spokesman for Bank of America's (N:BAC) Merrill Lynch said it had not experienced an outage after Downdetector.com said more than 1,000 clients reported problems logging into Merrill Lynch accounts within the first two hours of trading.
Vanguard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for IG Group (L:IGG) said ""unprecedented"" trading volumes in the 30 minutes after the Pfizer announcement were up to 10 times the level seen earlier in the day and broke a previous record set in March when markets recorded sharp falls at the peak of virus-related restrictions.
Retail brokers, which have been under scrutiny for outages, spent months shoring up their platforms in preparation for record volumes following the election, but the latest pandemic related development proved to be a harder test.
""It's unthinkable that a piece of news could eclipse the result of a U.S. Presidential election, but Pfizer's vaccine results have done just that,"" said AJ Bell analyst Laith Khalaf.
""The stock market is experiencing a serious melt-up, and safe havens like gold and bonds have sold off.""
Oil prices, which plunged into negative territory in April, rose by nearly 10% and global stocks scaled record highs after Pfizer and German partner BioNTech (O:BNTX) said that based on initial trial results their experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19. [O/R]
Retail participation in the equities markets has surged since March, as shares soared in response to government stimulus aimed at countering the coronavirus' economic impact. 
Traders rushed to stocks hit by the pandemic, including oil companies, hospitality groups, fashion retailers and airlines.
In what could perhaps be the clearest sign that markets are counting on life getting back to normal, shares in cinema operators AMC (N:AMC) and Cineworld (L:CINE) rose by about 40%. 
 Hargreaves  Lansdown (L:HRGV), a fund and trading platform with more than 1.4 million investors, said the trial results prompted the busiest day in volumes on its website and app.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>","Bayer makes 'substantial progress' in Roundup cancer lawsuits, mediator says","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A court-appointed mediator on Monday said  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) has made ""substantial progress"" toward resolving tens of thousands of remaining claims that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer.
The mediator Kenneth Feinberg spoke at a Zoom hearing in San Francisco federal court, where a judge still oversees nearly 2,000 unresolved cases over glyphosate-based Roundup, which Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) acquired with its purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON). Other cases are in state courts.
""We're not there yet but we are certainly making substantial progress,"" said Feinberg, who oversaw compensation programs for victims of the Sept. 11 attacks and 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. ""It's just a question of when and how quickly they'll get resolved.""
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria had previously paused the federal litigation and given Bayer until Nov. 2 to settle.
Bayer has said 1,861 of the 3,787 plaintiffs in that litigation had not settled. Chhabria did not extend the stay, meaning some cases could move toward possible trials.
""I'm not interested in having such an elongated schedule for the adjudication of these cases,"" he said.
Bayer has said Roundup is safe for human use.
The German company inherited liability for the lawsuits when it bought Monsanto for $63 billion in June 2018, becoming the world's largest supplier of seeds and pesticides. Its shares have since fallen 54%.
In June, Bayer projected it would pay up to $10.9 billion to resolve Roundup litigation, mostly for existing claims and $1.25 billion for future claims.
Last week, it increased the projected cost of future claims to $2 billion, and took a 9.25 billion euro ($10.9 billion) writedown in its crop science business.
It also said it had resolved roughly 88,500 out of an estimated 125,000 filed and unfiled Roundup claims.
Bayer lost three Roundup trials in 2018 and 2019. In October, the California Supreme Court declined to hear its appeal from a $20.5 million award in favor of school groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson for his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The case is In re Roundup Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-md-02741.

Investing.com --  Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stumbled 25% in after-hours trading after reporting a big loss.
A third-quarter loss per share of 28 cents per share compared to the expected earnings per share of 5 cents on sales of $94.4 million, missing the estimated $132 million, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. 
Shares had already had a roller coaster of a day on news that McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) was making a rival veggie burger, only for Beyond Meat to come out and say that it was a co-creator with the fast food chain on the McPlant patty. 
The fast food chain said in its virtual investor day that the McPlant will be tested next year in select markets, USAToday reported. It neglected to mention any Beyond Meat involvement, which the market interpreted as meaning McDonald's would now sell a rival veggie burger. Investors dumped shares of Beyond Meat, briefly halting the stock, which fell 8%. 
A few hours later, Beyond Meat said it was actually involved in the development of the McPlant and was a co-creator along with the Golden Arches, Bloomberg reported. McDonald's declined to comment. Shares of Beyond Meat turned higher after the news but closed down about 4%. 
Last month, Beyond Meat hit a record, rallying more than 150% in 2020. The stock has jumped repeatedly this year as the company has announced new products, including plant-based meatballs and expansion in China. McDonald's had tested a Beyond Meat patty in Canadian stores until April of this year.

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>",Corporate America says it is ready to work with Biden,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Corporate America says it is ready to work with President-elect Joe Biden, hoping for quick action on a new round of COVID-19 relief and infrastructure spending.
Major business trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable quickly issued congratulating statements to Biden, even though President Donald Trump has refused to concede.
""The first order of business of the new Congress and the new administration is a broad-based infrastructure program"" that would include money to ensure high-speed internet access for remote areas, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley told reporters. 
Trump often frustrated U.S. business leaders through erratic actions on trade or off-the-cuff calls to boycott or punish a long list of major companies that angered him.
In August, for example, Trump called for a boycott of Goodyear (O:GT) after the company barred some pro-Trump political attire. 
To boost infrastructure spending dramatically, Biden has vowed to raise the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28% from the current 21% and to impose a minimum tax to ensure no U.S. corporation can avoid paying income taxes.
The National Association of Manufacturers said the election results, which included Biden's win and gains by House Republicans, show ""the American people are not interested in extreme policies from either party; they are looking for smart, stable and solutions-oriented governance.""
United Airlines (O:UAL) Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) on Monday wrote Biden to congratulate him. ""We are ready to work with leaders in Washington in support of our nation, our economy and our environment.""
Executives from major tech firms, including Facebook (O:FB), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN), also issued statements of support, as did Detroit's Big Three automakers.
""We share your vision of using science to control the virus, widening economic opportunities, achieving racial justice and combating the climate crisis,""  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Chief Executive Arvind Krishna wrote to Biden.
Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos wrote via Instagram on Saturday that ""Unity, empathy and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era,"" posting a photo of Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. 
The National Mining Association, the trade group for U.S. mining companies, congratulated Biden, saying ""working together we can increase the competitiveness of existing industries and reestablish and strengthen our domestic supply chains.""
The U.S. Travel Association praised ""President-elect Biden’s objective of helping the industries most heavily impacted by the pandemic. The travel industry accounts for more than a third of overall U.S. unemployment, and policies to promote relief, recovery, and stimulus for travel businesses are integral to a U.S. economic turnaround.""

""Beyond Meat and McDonald's co-created the plant-based patty which will be available as part of their McPlant platform,"" a Beyond Meat spokesperson said in an email.
Shares of Beyond Meat initially fell as much as 8% after McDonald's announcement, but recovered to end 4% lower after the plant-based meat company said it had a role in creating the McPlant patty. It did not provide additional details. 
McDonald's, which reported market-beating profit and revenue for the third quarter earlier in the day, declined to say which suppliers it would use in crafting its own line of veggie products. 
Beyond Meat was the front runner for a contract as it had conducted tests of a so-called ""P.L.T."" burger at nearly 100 McDonald's locations in Ontario, Canada, earlier this year.
""Plant-based products are an ongoing consumer trend. It's not a matter of if McDonald's will get into plant-based, it's a matter of when,"" McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said on a call with analysts.
Analysts, rival fast food companies and plant-based protein producers have been closely watching McDonald's plans as it is one of the few national chains yet to sell plant-based meat burgers on a permanent basis. 
While other chains have started offering plant-based meat options, including Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc's (TO:QSR) Burger King, White Castle and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN), a McDonald's contract could be the biggest and would put the plant-based meat movement front and center in mainstream America.

McDonald's said under its McPlant line, it could offer products including burgers, chicken substitutes and breakfast sandwiches, which it expects to test in some markets in 2021.

Southwest said on Friday it had sent the warnings of furloughs, which would be the first in the company's history, because the union was discontinuing all cost-savings negotiations for its material specialists.
""That simply is not true, and further we continue to be open to any other cost savings the Company believes might be helpful,"" Teamsters airline division director David Bourne said in a Nov. 6 letter to members that was shared with Reuters.
The union had informed Southwest that an overwhelming majority of the workers indicated in a survey that they did not want pay cuts, but said the union was open to other ideas to meet Southwest's goal of 10% cost savings without furloughs or concessions.

Southwest is asking all of its unions to agree to pay cuts in order to prevent furloughs and layoffs through 2021 as the industry struggles to stem losses from the coronavirus pandemic in the absence of more federal aid.

Investing.com -- Markets soared in the U.S. as a potential vaccine promises a post-Covid life. Tech missed the boat.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said its Covid-19 vaccine is 90% effective at preventing infection, and investors threw an airline-cruise-leisure party in response. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 835 points, or 2.95%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.15% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5%.
Pfizer and partner  Biontech Se  (NASDAQ:BNTX) will seek regulatory approval for the vaccine by the end of November. The company said it could manufacture and distribute 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year. 
President-elect Joe Biden nonetheless warned that the U.S. is facing a “dark winter” with infections soaring in the U.S. and abroad, and the vaccine not yet approved by regulators. 
Travel and leisure stocks rallied, with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) soaring 50%, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corporation up 39% and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) up 18%, as the vaccine promises to be a ticket to ride. Airlines also soared, with JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp up 21% and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc rising 21%.  
Stay-at-home winners turned into losers, with  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc tumbling 17% and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) down 20%, days after reporting strong demand for its bikes.   
In non-vaccine related news, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) was temporarily halted after McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) said it was developing a proprietary plant-based product. But then Beyond Meat came out and said, in fact, it is co-creating the McPlant patties, reversing losses. 
Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) tumbled 30% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted against its experimental Alzheimer's treatment.  
Tech stocks sat out the rally, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) falling. 
Monday also marked the first trading day after Joe Biden was projected as the United States of America's 46th president. 
Gold melted down on the vaccine news, sinking some 5% at one point. Oil jumped almost 10% on hopes the economy will be making a comeback as governments are expected to let us out again upon vaccination.

Investing.com -- Democrats taking the White House did not cause a stock market crash as predicted by President Donald Trump. Quite the opposite, in fact.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks soared to record highs on Monday, two days after Joe Biden was projected the winner of the U.S. presidential election and on a day when  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine appeared to be 90% effective in early tests.
Stocks let out a little steam heading into the close. But the prospect of a post-Covid world where human activity could return to a semblance of normal ignited stocks in the travel, entertainment, and leisure sectors while causing a sell-off in shares of companies that benefited from the stay-at-home trend. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite index closed down.
As Biden moved his team into transition mode, Trump has vowed to fight election results in court. That uncertainty did not evidently dampen stock markets on Monday. Coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continued to surge, with some locations turning back reopening measures.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Hiring trends in latest economic data
Job growth was stronger than expected in October, with the unemployment rate falling to 6.9%, but some industries are still struggling with bringing employees back to work after business shutdowns.
On Tuesday, the government releases the JOLTs hiring data (job openings and labor turnover) at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect 6.5 million, up slightly from the 6.49 million announced the prior month.
2. Oil prices soar because of supply
American Petroleum Institute is expected to release its weekly oil inventory estimate at around 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT). Last week’s report indicated a draw of more than 8 million barrels the previous week, something confirmed by the government’s own data on crude stockpiles.
Positive demand trends -- when inventories go down that’s an indication that demand is rising -- and news of the coronavirus vaccine pushed up the price of oil on Monday, likely good news for shares of the oil majors like  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC Class A (AS:RDSa). Crude Oil WTI Futures the U.S. benchmark, jumped more than 8%, while Brent Oil Futurescrude, the international standard, rose more than 7%.
3. Fed's Lael Brainard set to speak
The Federal Reserve’s Lael Brainard is scheduled to speak at 5:00 PM ET (2100 GMT) about ""Community Reinvestment Act Modernization"" at the National Congress of American Indians Annual Convention. A Q&A will follow the virtual event.
Brainard is considered to be a top contender for Treasury Secretary in the Biden administration, according to the Washington Post. She was a senior Treasury Department official in the Obama administration, with broad policy-making experience, particularly during economic crises, the Post said."

Investing.com --  Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) dramatically reversed course Monday after initially slumping as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) said it was making its own plant-based beef.
Investors discovered hours later that those patties are, according to Beyond Meat, being developed with Beyond Meat.
The fast food chain said in its virtual investor day that the McPlant will be tested next year in select markets, USAToday reported. It neglected to mention any Beyond Meat involvement, which the market interpreted as meaning McDonald's would now sell a rival veggie burger. Investors dumped shares of Beyond Meat, briefly halting the stock, which fell 8%. 
A few hours later, Beyond Meat said it was actually involved in the development of the McPlant and was a co-creator along with the Golden Arches, Bloomberg reported.  McDonald's declined to comment. Shares of Beyond Meat turned higher after the news but have since dropped back down, trading lower by about 2%.
Last month, Beyond Meat hit a record, rallying more than 150% in 2020. The stock has jumped repeatedly this year as the company has announced new products, including plant-based meatballs and expansion in China. McDonald's had tested a Beyond Meat patty in Canadian stores until April of this year.    
""In the future, McPlant could extend across a line of plant-based products including burgers, chicken-substitutes and breakfast sandwiches,"" Ian Borden, McDonald's international president, said at the investor meeting.  
""The McPlant delivers our iconic taste in a sink-your-teeth-in (and wipe-your-mouth) kind of sandwich,"" McDonald's said. ""It’s made with a juicy, plant-based patty and served on a warm, sesame seed bun with all the classic toppings.""

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 02:06PM ET</span>","Gun stocks tumble after upbeat vaccine news, lack of civil unrest","By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Shares of firearms sellers tumbled on Monday as promising data from a COVID-19 vaccine trial knocked stay-at-home stocks, and as civil unrest failed to materialize after Democrat Joe Biden emerged as the winner of last week's presidential election.
 Smith & Wesson  Brands (O:SWBI) and rival Sturm Ruger & Co (N:RGR) fell more than 9%, while Vista Outdoor (N:VSTO), which sells ammunition and a range of sporting goods, fell over 12%.
They were among several so-called stay-at-home stocks dropping after  Pfizer  (N:PFE) said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19.
Sales of sporting goods, including hunting gear, have increased this year as consumers spend more time outdoors due to the coronavirus pandemic.
""If a vaccine that is 90% effective can truly bring COVID to an end, the return to work and school could subsequently bring sales in these categories back down to normalized levels,"" Aegis Capital analyst Rommel Dionisio said in an email.
Two other big winners this year from consumers spending more time at home - Peloton Interactive (O:PTON) and  Zoom Video Communications  (O:ZM) - both fell more than 14%, while airlines and other companies that would benefit from an end to the health crisis rallied.
An absence of civil unrest following the election may also be hurting sentiment for gun stocks.
Worries that Joe Biden and his Democratic party would win the presidency and take control of the Senate from Republicans sent firearms sales surging in recent months, as did violent protests in several cities, and fears of new civil unrest related to Tuesday's presidential election.
But with control of the Senate still undecided, Biden could struggle to fulfill campaign promises, including banning the sale of military style rifles.
However, Dionisio predicted that fears of gun control could still fuel another surge in firearms purchases by consumers worried they will not be able to buy them in the future.

Smith & Wesson's shares have jumped or dropped at least 6% in every session since the election, and they are now down 11% overall since Tuesday.

In a separate note, Citi said Pfizer's experimental COVID-19 vaccine being 90% effective exceeded the most optimistic market expectations and that transport and leisure stocks have the most to gain from any vaccine.
European and U.S. airline stocks jumped 20% to 30% on Monday.
Citi said it favored Australian and UK equity markets due to their exposure to business sectors that outperform when nominal yields are rising.
""More than any fiscal spending package or central bank lending program, a healthcare solution to COVID has the greatest potential to restore economic activity to its full potential, lifting deeply-depressed 'social-close' industries,"" said Jeffrey Sacks, Citi Private Bank's EMEA Investment Strategist.
Citi said U.S. stocks may lag any vaccine-driven rallies in Europe or Asia due to their heavy exposure to the technology sector, which has done well during lockdowns and social restrictions.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>","Behind Pfizer's vaccine, an understated husband-and-wife 'dream team'","By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Positive data on BioNTech and U.S. partner  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine is an unlikely success for the married couple behind the German biotech firm, who have devoted their lives to harnessing the immune system against cancer.Pfizer said on Monday said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on initial data from a large study.
Pfizer and BioNTech are the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The companies said they have so far found no serious safety concerns and expect to seek U.S. emergency use authorization later this month.
From humble roots as the son of a Turkish immigrant working at a Ford factory in Cologne, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin, 55, now figures among the 100 richest Germans, together with his wife and fellow board member Oezlem Tuereci, 53, according to weekly Welt am Sonntag.
The market value of Nasdaq-listed BioNTech, which the pair co-founded, had ballooned to $21 billion as of Friday's close from $4.6 billion a year ago, with the firm set to play a major role in mass immunisation against the coronavirus.
""Despite his achievements, he never changed from being incredibly humble and personable,"" said Matthias Kromayer, board member of venture capital firm MIG AG, whose funds have backed BioNTech since its inception in 2008.
He added Sahin would typically walk into business meetings wearing jeans and carrying his signature bicycle helmet and backpack with him.
Doggedly pursuing his childhood dream of studying medicine and becoming a physician, Sahin worked at teaching hospitals in Cologne and the southwestern city of Homburg, where he met Tuereci during his early academic career. 
Medical research and oncology became a shared passion. 
Tuereci, the daughter of a Turkish physician who had migrated to Germany, said in a media interview that even on the day of their wedding, both made time for lab work.
Together they honed in on the immune system as a potential ally in the fight against cancer and tried to address the unique genetic makeup of each tumour.
Life as entrepreneurs started in 2001 when they set up Ganymed Pharmaceuticals to develop cancer-fighting antibodies, but Sahin - by then a professor at Mainz university - never gave up academic research and teaching. 
They won funding from MIG AG as well as from Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who sold their generic drugs business Hexal to Novartis in 2005.
That venture was sold to Japan's Astellas in 2016 for up to $1.4 billion. By then, the team behind Ganymed was already busy building BioNTech, founded in 2008, to pursue a much broader range of cancer immunotherapy tools. 
That included mRNA, a versatile messenger substance to send genetic instructions into cells.
DREAM TEAM 
For MIG's Kromayer, Tuereci and Sahin are a ""dream team"" in that they reconciled their visions with the constraints of reality. 
The BioNTech story took a twist when Sahin in January came across a scientific paper on a new coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan and it struck him how small the step was from anti-cancer mRNA drugs to mRNA-based viral vaccines.
BioNTech quickly assigned about 500 staff to project ""light speed"" to work on several possible compounds, winning pharma giant Pfizer and Chinese drugmaker Fosun as partners in March. 
Matthias Theobald, a fellow oncology professor at Mainz university who has worked with Sahin for 20 years, said his tendency towards understatement belies a relentless ambition to transform medicine, exemplified by the leap of faith to a COVID-19 vaccine.
""He is a very modest and humble person. Appearances mean little to him. But he wants to create the structures that allow him to realise his visions and that's where is aspirations are far from modest,"" Theobald said. 
Sahin told Reuters on Monday the read-out amounted to an “extraordinary success rate” but that he did not know earlier in the year how difficult the task overall would be.
“It’s certainly not something that you would easily voice as a serious scientist, but it was within the realms of possibility from the beginning.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of stocks that have been demolished as the coronavirus and related lockdowns have crippled the global economy surged on Monday following positive news from  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech (DE:22UAy) about is experimental COVID-19 vaccine. 
Pfizer shares jumped 10.16%, although they were off earlier highs, after the company said the vaccine was more than 90% effective in a large-scale clinical trial for which it will now seek a U.S. emergency use authorization. U.S.-listed shares of BioNTech were up 9.89%.
While Pfizer shares were higher on the news, the overall healthcare sector (SPXHC) was underperforming the broader S&P 500, in large part due to a sharp decline in Biogen (O:BIIB) after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel voted against its Alzheimer’s treatment. 
The energy sector (SPNY), down more than 50% through Friday's close as reduced travel sapped demand for oil and gas, shot up 14.82% and was on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since March 24.  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) gained 13.39% and  Valero Energy  (N:VLO) soared 29.81%.
Banks <.SPXBK>, down more than 34% through Friday, climbed 12.66% and were also on track for their biggest one-day percentage gain since March 24 as bond yields soared and the U.S. yield curve steepened. A similar reaction was seen in Europe, with French banks  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), closing up 18%.
""It's all about the vaccine. If Pfizer's vaccine is as good as people are saying it is that's a game changer for consumer behavior and a lot of the trends we've seen of the cyclical sectors being depressed are going to reverse on that hope that this is the beginning of the end of our dealing with COVID-19,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer, Independent Advisor Alliance, Charlotte, North Carolina.
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 sectors gain amid vaccine hopes - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/ygdpzbrmxpw/chart.png)
Airlines <.SPLRCALI>, down more than 45% through Friday, jumped 15.22%, led by gains in Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), up 15.07% and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) as a vaccine would reduce the fear of traveling in an enclosed space. 
Other travel-related stocks also moved higher.  Disney  (N:DIS) rose 11.29% while fellow theme-park operator Six Flags (N:SIX) advanced 17.07%.
The S&P hotels, restaurants & leisure index <.SPLRCHRL> shot up 5.43% with cruise lines Carnival Corp (N:CCL) and  Royal Caribbean  (N:RCL) each surging more than 30% higher. Casino operator Wynn Resorts (O:WYNN) rose 26.26% while hotel operators Marriott International (O:MAR) and  Hilton Worldwide  (N:HLT) each gained more than 10%.
Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, said the news was particularly good for companies in services industries. ""The services part of the economy can recover strongly,"" he said.
""It's affecting services across the board,"" he said, noting strong gains in Disney,  Expedia  (O:EXPE) and other travel-related stocks.

On the flip side, names that have benefited from work-from-home policies and travel restrictions, as Peloton Interactive (O:PTON) and Zoom Video (O:ZM) tumbled 15.55% and 13.48%, respectively.

1673,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Berkshire Scoops Up Its Own Stock While Pandemic Hits Profit,"(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett might have just found his next elephant-sized deal: Buying back his own stock.
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa) spent $16 billion buying back its stock in the first nine months of 2020, more than triple its previous annual record. The repurchases even surpass many of Berkshire’s biggest investments in recent years, including 2019’s Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). financing deal, and total more than Berkshire has ever spent in one year buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). stock.
The record buybacks, coupled with investments in Japanese trading houses and deals for natural gas assets, mark a shift from the start of the pandemic, when Buffett, 90, took a more cautious approach and even dumped his stakes in major U.S. airlines. The billionaire investor has long hungered for an “elephant-sized” deal to put huge sums of capital to work but has failed to find lucrative, large acquisitions in recent years.
With a large deal looking unlikely, “share buybacks all of a sudden look like a very pleasant option,” CFRA Research’s Cathy Seifert said.
Buybacks have gotten cheaper too. Shares fell drastically in March and have since started to climb back, but overall Berkshire Class A shares are still down 7.6% this year. Those shares rose 5.8% at 9:36 a.m. in New York.
Berkshire, in its earnings report filed Saturday, also hinted that the buying didn’t stop with the third quarter’s $9 billion haul. Decreased share counts imply Buffett repurchased at least $2.3 billion of stock from the end of September through Oct. 26.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“We believe the large share buyback was a display of conservatism, given the elevated values of targets with diminished earnings expectations and coronavirus uncertainty are impediments to acquisitions.”
--Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Derek Han, associate analyst
Here are other key takeaways from Berkshire’s third-quarter earnings:
Profit Slump
Berkshire’s businesses were hit by the pandemic in the third quarter, contributing to a 32% drop in operating profit. All of Berkshire’s reporting segments except its energy operation reported lower earnings.
Still, Berkshire’s net income, which is impacted by the swings in its $245 billion equity portfolio, benefited from the stock market’s rally. Investment gains fueled an 82% jump in net income from a year earlier.
Berkshire’s collection of insurers posted their first underwriting loss this year, driven by losses at its namesake groups of primary insurers and reinsurers. The businesses were hit by costs tied to the pandemic as well as losses from Hurricanes Laura and Sally in recent months.
Geico, the company’s auto insurer, reported a nearly 27% drop in pretax underwriting earnings, partially driven by a program to give consumers premium credits because of the pandemic.
Virus Impact
Covid-19 continued to put pressure on Berkshire’s operations. For its insurers, it meant not just claims tied to the pandemic, but also customers failing to pay premiums and higher operating costs with staff scattered. Operations such as the railroad were also hit by ripple effects from the virus and shutdowns.
Still, Berkshire said several of its manufacturing, service and retailing businesses saw significant increases in profit in the third quarter from the previous three months, when they “declined considerably.”
Berkshire’s operations, such as aerospace-parts maker Precision Castparts, have had to furlough or cut workers this year as the virus gripped the nation. Buffett’s company warned in its third-quarter report that some businesses might have to continue to restructure.
“Certain of our businesses are undertaking and will likely continue to undertake restructuring activities that will resize their operations to better fit expected customer demand,” Berkshire said Saturday in the filing.
Cash
Despite Berkshire’s record buybacks and stock investments, the conglomerate’s cash pile was just slightly lower than the second quarter’s record. Berkshire held roughly $145.7 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, down less than $1 billion from the end of June.
Berkshire’s recently been expanding its hunting horizons, with its $6 billion bet on Japanese trading houses and even a stake in the newly public Snowflake Inc.
“Berkshire just has so much capital, they have to take other bets they’ve never made before and kind of be adventurous,” said Cole Smead, who is president and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management. “The question is whether they will actually earn negative returns in some of these.”
Energy Gains
Berkshire’s sprawling energy empire was a bright spot in the third quarter. That business posted $1.4 billion of earnings in the period, its highest level in more than a decade as revenue climbed 8.8% from a year earlier.
The biggest contributor was MidAmerican Energy Company, which provides power to customers in Iowa and Illinois. That unit saw a 21% jump in earnings as new wind energy projects delivered tax credits.
The utility business “was a pretty significant contributor to operating earnings,” Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “That business is doing pretty well.”

In December, Italian American Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and French  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA agreed to combine in a $38 billion all-share deal to create the world's fourth-biggest carmaker, uniting brands such as Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Maserati with the likes of Peugeot, Opel, Citroen and DS.
""The logo symbolises the rich heritage of Stellantis' founding companies and the unique combined strengths of the new group's portfolio of 14 storied automotive brands, as well as the diversity of professional backgrounds of its employees working in all the regions,"" the two automakers said in a joint statement.
FCA and PSA in July said they had picked 'Stellantis' as a name for the merged group, adding it was in reference to the Latin verb ""stello"", which means ""to brighten with stars"". The names and the logos of the group's constituent brands will remain unchanged after the deal's projected close.

FCA and PSA on Monday reiterated they expected to finalise the merger by the end of the first quarter of next year.

The Chicago-based airline said it is seeing more customers book Thanksgiving travel closer to the departure date this year. 
According to the airline, 50% of United flyers are booking their tickets less than 30 days before the travel date compared with last year when around 40% of bookings were done 30 days before departure.
A recent U.S. Department of Defense study claimed the risk of exposure to the coronavirus on flights is very low, a positive sign for the airline industry as it tries to rebound from the pandemic's crushing effect on travel.
United also said it expects to fly 48% of its overall schedule in December compared with 2019, adding more than 140 daily flights and increasing capacity on more than 350 routes.
The airline said it is monitoring bookings in real time to swap in larger aircraft when needed, to accommodate last-minute demand.
Last month, United reported its daily cash burn slowed to an average $25 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $40 million in the second quarter, and included $4 million per day in severance and debt payments.
United and other airlines have signaled a slow but steady improvement in leisure demand but do not foresee a recovery to 2019 levels for at least two years, with business and international travel particularly slow to bounce back amid ongoing travel restrictions.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) said on Monday it would test a loyalty program for customers and launch a new crispy chicken sandwich next year as it refocuses its long-term strategy to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.
The world's biggest burger chain beat revenue and profit estimates for the third quarter on Monday as customers in the United States ordered more hamburgers and fries in drive-through outlets and on delivery apps to avoid dining out during the pandemic.
Overall, global sales fell 2.2% in the quarter, an improvement over the previous quarter's drop, as McDonald's had already announced in an October update.
The company's limited-time promotional deal with rapper Travis Scott, which caused shortages of some ingredients, and other marketing investments also helped sales bounce back from pandemic lows.
Shares were last 2.3% higher amid broader market gains.
McDonald's plans next year to prioritize marketing, including new packaging globally with a ""modern, refreshing feel and playful touches to unify branding"" it said in a statement.
McDonald's will focus on core products such as burgers, coffee and chicken, including a new Crispy Chicken Sandwich - something some franchisees have long sought in order to compete with the success of similar products at Popeyes, a unit of Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR), and Chick-fil-A.
It will also soon include another growth driver that other chains have long had: loyalty programs. 
""MyMcDonald's"" digital program will allow customers who sign up to get tailored offers, the company said. A loyalty rewards program using the MyMcDonald's program will start as a pilot in coming weeks in Phoenix and next year across the United States.
It will also launch a ""McPlant"" line of plant-based menu items it will make itself, though it previously tested a vegan ""P.L.T."" burger by  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) in Canada.
Finally, it will build some locations without any dining rooms to focus on carryout, drive-through and delivery only.
Despite some sales recovery and better-than-forecast margins, the company is still pressured in key markets outside the United States, including France, Germany and Britain by new lockdown restrictions due to a spike in coronavirus cases.
McDonald's total revenue fell about 2% to $5.42 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, largely recovering from the over 30% plunge posted in the second quarter.
Analysts on average had estimated revenue of $5.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
U.S. customer traffic still remained down from a year earlier, the company said. 
Net income surged 10% to $1.76 billion, helped by gains from the sale of a part of McDonald's stake in its Japanese affiliate. 

Excluding those gains, the company earned $2.22 per share, beating estimates of $1.90.

""This is extremely important and should give the market confidence that Pfizer's candidate offers a breakthrough in terms of reaching herd immunity at some point next year,"" said Robin Winkler, strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Research.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",SoftBank's Vision Fund back to black even as some of Son's tech bets sting,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp on Monday reported $6.1 billion in quarterly profit as a broad upswing in tech valuations brought its mammoth Vision Fund back into positive territory.
The Vision Fund recovery is likely to be welcome news for investors unnerved by some of SoftBank's recent stumbles, even as overall earnings were tainted by a 132 billion yen ($1.3 billion) hit following bets on technology stocks and derivatives. 
The news came as SoftBank announced the removal of several high-profile executives from its board, including Vision Fund chief Rajeev Misra and Chief Operating Office Marcelo Claure, following investor pressure to improve governance. 
At September-end, SoftBank held positions worth $16.8 billion in stocks including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been parking excess cash from asset sales in tech stocks and derivatives in at attempt to capitalise on an uplift in valuations in the sector. 
The fair value of SoftBank's options and futures positions was $2.7 billion at the end of September. 
The bets sparked wide speculation in markets that SoftBank was the so-called ""Nasdaq whale"", an investor with large derivatives positions in tech stocks.
Son said he was surprised at the characterisation. 
""I'm not sure if that's praise or disparagement,"" he told a news briefing.
VISION FUNDS
SoftBank reported net income attributable to shareholders of 628 billion yen for the three months through September, versus a loss of 700 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.
It booked a gain of 1.04 trillion yen in the quarter from investments via its two Vision Funds, though much of that typically reflected unrealised profit from portfolio companies. The figure compared with a loss of 944 billion yen a year earlier.
The first fund is now worth some $76.4 billion, slightly north of the $75 billion paid for its 83 investments, it said.
That total does not include gains over the life of the fund including a $4.5 billion gain from exited investments and a $1.5 billion gain from derivatives. 
The smaller second fund saw a big uplift following the listing of housing firm Ke Holdings Inc. That fund had a fair value of $7.6 billion versus a total cost of $2.6 billion, SoftBank said.
SoftBank itself is the only investor in the second fund - a move aimed at attracting more investment. 
""We are always open to third-party investors but at the moment we are not that popular,"" Son said. 
CORPORATE SHAKE-UP
In a major corporate governance shake-up, SoftBank said Vision Fund chief Rajeev Misra, Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure and Chief Strategy Officer Katsunori Sago had left the board. 
The changes were made to increase the ratio of external directors on the board, Son said. The managing director of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, Yasir al-Rumayyan, has also resigned, reducing the total number of board members to nine. 
The board changes, which follow investor pressure to improve oversight at the group, come as SoftBank accelerates its shift to investing beyond its recent focus on late-stage startups. 
Unlisted startups make up 8% of the group's holdings. Investments in listed stocks like the Amazon stake, worth $6.3 billion at the end of September, are like a pilot programme for the group, Son said.
The Japanese billionaire has a 33% stake in the new asset management subsidiary making the investments, SB Northstar. 
Company executives are frustrated by the gap between SoftBank's market capitalisation and the value of its assets and have mulled plans to take the group private, Reuters reported in September.
Son on Monday said he regularly considers the merits and demerits of being a listed company, but declined to comment on whether a management buyout was in the works.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.N. envoy Mark Carney backed a push to make companies give investors an annual vote on their climate change strategies, saying on Monday that might prove more effective than ""overly prescriptive"" regulation.
Carney, who took a U.N. climate finance role after stepping down as Bank of England governor in March, said investors could have an automatic advisory vote on a company's plans to cut greenhouse emissions, in the same way they are involved in pay discussions.
""Rather than have authorities be overly prescriptive on plans, it may be desirable to have investors have a say on transition,"" Carney told a conference on climate finance in London.
""This would establish a critical link between responsibility, accountability and sustainability,"" he added.
Last month, Spanish airports operator Aena (MC:AENA) became the first company to give shareholders an annual vote on its climate plans following pressure from billionaire investor Chris Hohn, founder of the TCI activist hedge fund.
Shareholders backed Aena's steps, which include ensuring that airports in its network will be energy self-sufficient - largely using solar - and carbon neutral by 2026.
Some in the asset management industry say many investment companies have yet to assemble the expertise needed to subject climate plans to meaningful scrutiny.
But backers of such votes believe they can help ensure that companies take their climate commitments seriously, and see them as essential to fulfilling the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to slow climate change.
""Such votes should be automatically required,"" said Paul Simpson, chief executive of nonprofit climate risk disclosure group CDP. 
Catherine Howarth, chief executive of investor group ShareAction, also backed the calls for carbon-heavy companies to put their climate strategies to an annual vote. 

""Where companies don't do so, investors should use their voting rights to force the issue,"" Howarth told Reuters.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets skyrocketed at the open on Monday, after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX) announced what looked like a major breakthrough in the search for a vaccine against the Covid-19 coronavirus.
The news propelled beaten-down cyclical stocks sharply higher, as investors bet on a return to traditional working and leisure habits after a year devastated by lockdowns, soaring unemployment and battered business and consumer confidence.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1,551 points, or 5.5% at 29,875 points, while the S&P 500 was up 3.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
Pfizer and Biontech said they are on track to ask regulators to approve the drug for treating the coronavirus by the end of the month, after a late-stage trial showed it was over 90% effective in preventing infection. The U.S.'s top infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci has said that 60% effectiveness would be acceptable. Newswires quoted him as saying on Monday that a 90% success rate was ""extraordinary.""
Pending endorsement from regulators, the announcement makes the widespread distribution of a vaccine a realistic possibility early in the new year. Pfizer said it could manufacture and distribute 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year. 
Pfizer stock rose 8.4% and Biontech stock rose 14.4%, but they were far from being the biggest beneficiaries of the news. That honor was reserved for the travel and leisure stocks that have seen their businesses decimated by the fear of infection. The rebound in consumer confidence that vaccine availability promises can make the difference between bankruptcy and viability to many stocks in these sectors, or at least reduce the risk of dilution via recapitalizations.
Accordingly, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), the world’s biggest operator of movie theaters, saw its stock rise 51%, while rival Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) stock rose 44%.
It was the same story with airlines and cruise stocks:  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) stock rose 25%, while JetBlue stock (NASDAQ:JBLU) rose 20%.  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) stock rose 27% and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock rose 29%. Casino operator Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) rose 24%.
The flip side of the coin was equally sharp drops in the stocks that have profited most from the shift to remote working and online shopping this year: Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock fell 17%, while Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock fell 19.3%.
Another big loser - albeit unrelated to the Pfizer news - was Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock, which fell 32% after a Food and Drug Administration panel found overwhelmingly that its experimental drug for Alzheimer's was, in fact, ineffective. Biogen had soared last week on the news that the FDA was set to approve it. Alzheimer's is, after Covid-19, arguably the disease for which the rich world would pay most for a cure."

(NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) reawakened hopes that a return to normal is on the horizon.
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc. plunged 16% in early trading, while Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc. slumped 13% and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). was down 5% as investors piled into risk assets and dumped shares of firms that have been winners during global lockdowns. Futures contracts on the Nasdaq reversed earlier gains and fluctuated.
“The rotation that the market is doing is beyond any imagination with Nasdaq in negative territory and Russell 2000 in limit up,” said Alberto Tocchio, a portfolio manager at Kairos Partners. “We will continue to see some rotation out of “winners” into the laggards.”
The preliminary results, which Pfizer’s chief executive called the most significant medical advance in the last century, dealt a blow to some of the lockdowns’ biggest winners as a push to reopen would mean less time on video chats and working out from home. Those expectations in turn lead to a roaring boom for companies that operate things like cruises, concerts, and hotels.
Winners to losers
Zoom Video Communications Inc. and  Peloton Interactive Inc  . -- both stocks and companies that have become household names because of the virus -- were among the market’s top decliners, as investors sold out of firms that have seen the largest surge in demand as consumers were forced home. Other companies that cater to online consumers like Wayfair (NYSE:W) Inc. and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc. tumbled on the news. The pair each fell more than 10% while Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc. sank 6.9%.
Netflix Inc. dropped 5% and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). tumbled 3.1% as the Nasdaq 100 fluctuated. High-flying companies that make and sell Covid-19 testing kits like Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL) Corp. crashed as investors weighed what testing would look like if a vaccine is successfully developed and distributed.
Reopen trade roars
Airline stocks and cruiseliners helped lead the S&P 500 higher as investors flocked to companies that had fallen out of favor as global travel and vacations were paused.
Cruise companies including Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp.,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd, and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd. all surged more than 20% in early trading Monday. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. surged 24%, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. jumped 18% and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co. and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Inc. each rallied more than 10%.
Theme park operators ranging from Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. to Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) Entertainment Corp and Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN) surged. Disney shares boomed 10% while Six Flags and Cedar Point jumped 22% and 18% respectively.

Wall Street analysts largely believe the panel's near-unanimous votes against the drug, aducanumab, make it difficult for the FDA to go against the panel.
""Approving aducanumab, in the face of such an overwhelmingly negative vote and commentary, is virtually impossible and would destroy the agency's reputation at a very tenuous time for the regulator, ahead of potential actions on COVID vaccines,"" Baird analyst Brian Skorney said.
The panel on Friday voted ""no"" to three questions related to whether a single successful large trial of the drug was enough evidence of its effectiveness, given the failure of a second large study.
The FDA is expected to make its decision on aducanumab by March and is not obligated to follow the recommendations of the panel, but usually does.
It is uncommon for the FDA to act against the committee, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said, adding that it happens less than 20% of the time.
Bowing to pressure from patient advocates, the agency in 2016 approved a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy from  Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc (O:SRPT), even though an outside panel of experts and the agency's own reviewers questioned the drug's efficacy. (https://reut.rs/2IaXM17)
""The FDA can do what it wants,"" Stifel analyst Paul Matteis said, adding that the vote against Sarepta's Exondys 51 was obviously better than the 0-10-1 against aducanumab.

If approved, aducanumab would become the first new treatment for Alzheimer's in decades and the first that appears to be able to slow progression of the fatal, mind-wasting condition, potentially bringing in billions of dollars in sales for Biogen.

1693,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 07:06AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Soar; Pfizer Announces Positive Vaccine News,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening substantially higher Monday, continuing the post-election rally, helped by positive news from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) over its Covid-19 virus vaccine as well as the likely end of political uncertainty after Joe Biden claimed the White House over the weekend.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 120 points, or 3.5%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 1,312 points, or 4.6%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 140 points, or 1.2%. These cash indices last week posted their best weekly gains since April.
Earlier Monday, U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said its experimental vaccine, made in conjunction with German partner BioNTech, was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 based on initial data from a large study.
This is the first incidence of drugmakers showing successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine, designed to combat a pandemic that has killed over one million people worldwide.
This is good news for the markets, and will be a major help to the coronavirus task force that president-elect Joe Biden has already convened, appointing former surgeon general Vivek Murthy and former Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler to lead the team.
Biden clinched the presidency on Saturday, clearing the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House. Incumbent Donald Trump has yet to concede defeat, but his lawsuits alleging unsubstantiated election fraud are seen as highly likely to fail.
The Republicans are expected to keep hold of the Senate, although this won’t be decided until January, meaning drastic policy changes such as tax hikes or more stringent corporate regulation are less likely.
“We see a Biden presidency and a divided Congress, our central scenario, as a constructive outcome for risk markets,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. 
Along with expectations of a reflationary U.S. fiscal policy and a continued loose monetary policy, there are also hopes that a Biden administration will lead to a more collaborative attitude towards global trade, particularly between the major trading blocs of the U.S., the European Union and China.
The economic data slate is quiet Monday, but the earnings season continues with numbers from the likes of McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) expected later in the session.
Oil prices also surged Monday, with Pfizer's news coupled with Biden’s victory in the U.S. presidential race buoying risk appetites as traders look for a larger coronavirus relief package, offsetting worries about the impact on demand from a worsening pandemic.
U.S. crude futures traded 8.7% higher at $40.38 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 8% to $42.59, recovering after losing 4% on Friday.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 2.1% to $1,910.50/oz, but remained on course for its biggest weekly gain since July, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1885."

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Norwegian Air plunged into winter fight for survival,"By Terje Solsvik and Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Pandemic-hit Norwegian Air (OL:NORR) faces a battle for survival this winter, it said on Monday after the country's government declared that it will not provide additional financial support for the cash-strapped carrier.
Norwegian Air, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis and has grounded most of its fleet, said in August that it would run out of cash in the first quarter of 2021 unless it could secure fresh funds and has held talks with the government in the hope of winning support.
""That the government has decided to reject the request for funds is disappointing and feels like a punch in the gut for everyone at Norwegian,"" Chief Executive Jacob Schram said.
""The company and the board will turn every stone to get through this situation,"" Schram told a news conference on Monday morning, adding that the budget airline is not out of cash yet.
Asked whether the company was at risk of bankruptcy, Schram said he would not rule out any potential outcomes.
""But we need ventilator support to get through the winter,"" he added.
Norwegian's shares were down 16.9% by 1053 GMT, extending this year's price plunge to 99%.
Favouring free enterprise, Norway's centre-right coalition government has long ruled out any nationalisation of Norwegian or other carriers and in 2018 sold the state's remaining 10% stake in rival SAS (ST:SAS).
'RISKY SUPPORT'
""It is a tough message to get. But we are answerable for the responsible use of public funds,"" Industry Minister Iselin Nyboe told an earlier news conference.
""Norwegian Air has a financial structure that makes it risky for us to go in with support. It was not defensible.""
A pioneer in low-fare transatlantic air travel, Norwegian Air's rapid expansion left it with debt of close to $8 billion by mid-2020, making it vulnerable to the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is due to report third-quarter results on Tuesday.
The carrier has shown a great ability to overcome financial difficulties in the past, Transport Minister Knut Arild Hareide said.
""I don't want to speculate on their ability to do so,"" Hareide said when asked about Norwegian's chances of staying in operation.
Parat, a labour union for pilots and other workers in the aviation industry, called on the government to reconsider its position.
""Wideroe, SAS and Norwegian must get help to weather the crisis,"" said Parat leader Unn Kristin Olsen. Wideroe is a regional airline.
Creditors and lessors took control of Norwegian in May with a financial rescue that allowed it to access state-guaranteed loans of 3 billion crowns ($329 million) as the company sought to operate a slimmed-down service.
Norwegian last month operated only 21 of its aircraft, leaving more than 100 grounded, including its entire fleet of 37 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliners used for transatlantic journeys. 
The airline industry is likely to provide sufficient services and will still see healthy competition in the time ahead, Nyboe said.
It was not surprising Oslo had withdrawn support after the failure of Norwegian's bid to become a pan-European airline serving intercontinental markets, said Bertrand Grabowski, a former aviation banker who is now an independent adviser.
""You can perhaps use Norwegian taxpayers' money to support a regional airline, but not one serving Paris-New York or London-Buenos Aires (routes),"" he said. 
Scandinavian carrier SAS is a major competitor in Norway, and Hungary's Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) recently launched several services to Norwegian cities. 
CRUCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Airlines are particularly crucial infrastructure in Norway, the geography of which stretches more than 2,200 km (1,367 miles) across fjords and mountains with few train lines to transport people. Its capital, Oslo, is closer to Munich than to its own northernmost mainland town, Hammerfest.
Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said Wizz Air's plans for new services in Norway may have deepened Oslo's reluctance to ""throw good money after bad"".
""Even if they had put in a bit more money for the winter, it likely wouldn't have been enough,"" he said, adding that a bankruptcy would leave aircraft lessors stuck with planes they won't be able to place.
However, a last-minute government intervention shouldn't be ruled out entirely, Roeska said, adding that ""the door is never closed"" until bankruptcy is confirmed.
The company has said that more funding could come from the sale of aircraft, conversion of more debt to equity or from its owners and the Norwegian government, while declining to specify the amount it might seek.
""Norwegian is evaluating the effects of the current situation with the aim of safeguarding the interest of all stakeholders,"" the airline said.
The government also said that it had rejected a request from a start-up carrier for public funds.

So far this year the government has provided an estimated 13 billion crowns in support for the airline industry including loans, guarantees and tax cuts, it said.

1696,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",SoftBank Recovery Gains Ground With Vision Fund’s Record Profit,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son is making his case for SoftBank Group Corp.’s turnaround.
The Japanese conglomerate reported a record 784.4 billion yen ($7.6 billion) profit in its Vision Fund business for the three months ended Sept. 30, a sign the fund’s investments in startups are paying off amid a broad rally in technology stocks. One Chinese startup quadrupled SoftBank’s money after going public in August.
Son also addressed nagging concerns about his stewardship. He revealed details about a controversial stock and options trading program, making clear the effort was relatively modest in scope and strategy. He even took steps to improve corporate governance by increasing the proportion of outside directors with the removal of four insiders, including Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure and Vision Fund chief Rajeev Misra.
“Masa, myself, should be most supervised,” Son joked in a question and answer session after the results. “More external directors mean better governance.”
The Japanese billionaire took the stage at a briefing in Tokyo to explain how the company he founded four decades ago is coming back from record losses in the last fiscal year. The Vision Fund unit’s highest-ever profit cames as a global surge in technology shares lifted the value of stakes in public firms like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and improved the prospects for startups in its portfolio. That helped the Tokyo-based company report net income of 627.5 billion yen for the quarter.
“The Vision Fund’s performance was very encouraging,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Anthea Lai said. “They have pulled off a U-turn.”
The standout success for the quarter was a little-known Chinese startup called KE Holdings Inc. It runs an online property platform called Beike and its shares have surged since an initial public offering in August, handing SoftBank an unrealized gain of $5.1 billion on the investment for the quarter.
In his presentation, Son said his original $1.35 billion investment is now worth $7.9 billion because shares have kept surging since the end of September. Still, he said that after WeWork, another real estate bet that lost him billions, Beike “wasn’t very popular” at first.
Son’s disclosures about his stock and options trading may ease the concerns of some investors who sold off SoftBank shares after initial reports about derivatives bets in September. The company said the fair value of its futures and options positions came to $2.7 billion at the end of September, including long call options on listed stocks worth $4.69 billion and short call options on listed stocks with negative $1.26 billion of value.
In response to media reports that SoftBank was the “Nasdaq whale” stoking the rally in tech stocks, Misra said publicly in October that SoftBank is “not even a dolphin, forget being a whale.”
Son explained that recent investments in securities and derivatives are experiments in how to put its cash to use now that the company is selling assets. He pointed out that the options account for just 1.2% of the company’s shareholdings.
That hasn’t stopped the skeptics.
“It’s still not clear why a company like SoftBank is dabbling in derivatives,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “There is a chance they are mistaking their initial success at the Vision Fund for skill instead of luck. Now they are trying to replicate that with the public funds division.”
SoftBank has also been putting capital into publicly traded stocks, part of an asset management effort revealed this year. It acquired 1.7 trillion yen of “highly liquid listed stocks” in the quarter, including a $6.3 billion investment in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., $2.2 billion in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and $1.8 billion in  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc. The operation is managed by its new subsidiary SB Northstar, in which Son personally holds a 33% stake.
SoftBank has typically made investments in private startups, giving funds to companies like Uber and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to help them grow. The founder argued his bets on public stocks are consistent because he’s backing more mature companies with advanced capabilities in areas like artificial intelligence.
“I can hear people saying, what’s he doing now investing in public companies,” Son said at the briefing. “These are investments in the AI revolution.”
Separately, Son announced the most substantial changes to his board in years, a move toward stronger governance practices supported by activist investor Elliott Management Corp. Four internal directors -- Claure, Misra, Chief Strategy Officer Katsunori Sago and Yasir Al-Rumayyan of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund -- have resigned. That increases the proportion of outside directors because the changes leave the board with four independent members out of nine.
SoftBank also said Chief Legal Officer Robert Townsend is leaving the company this month. The former co-chair of Morrison & Foerster’s Global M&A Practice Group joined SoftBank in August of 2018 to head its legal, compliance operations and corporate governance operations. Tim Mackey, who has served as deputy general counsel since November 2018, will take over from Townsend.
The departure comes after SoftBank has lost several top executives, including the COO of the Vision Fund. SoftBank’s Chief Compliance Officer Chad Fentress left the company in September and vacated his WeWork board seat.
Son has boosted his share price in part by selling off assets and buying back his own shares. After years of resisting, he’s sold stakes in Alibaba, T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc. and SoftBank Corp., the Japan telecommunications unit. SoftBank also announced a deal to sell its chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. for $40 billion.
The shift from running telecom and tech companies to investment management has left some investors and analysts perplexed.
“It’s becoming difficult to tell what SoftBank is all about anymore,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). “While investors are always keen to hear about Son’s vision for the company, it seems to be changing every quarter. What people really want is more consistency.”
The billionaire argued that SoftBank is in fact very simple to understand: Investors should focus on a single metric -- net asset value, or the value of its shareholdings minus net debt. By that measure, the company is worth 27.3 trillion yen, a 5.6 trillion yen gain from half a year ago. SoftBank’s market capitalization was 14.8 trillion yen at the end of trading on Monday.
“What is SoftBank? It’s a company that invests in the information revolution,” Son said. “That hasn’t changed even for a day since I founded it.”

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Infineon forecasts strong sales rebound after coronavirus slump,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) forecast double-digit revenue growth for the year ahead, sending its shares higher even as management proposed to trim the dividend to account for the blow inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Munich-based power chip specialist ditched its financial guidance in March as the coronavirus hit - just before its $10 billion acquisition of U.S. Cypress Technologies closed - but has since been lifted by an auto industry recovery.
""The sequential increase in revenue is very significant and confirms that the June quarter had marked the low point,"" CEO Reinhard Ploss said of the automotive segment that accounts for two-fifths of Infineon's revenue.
Taking into account the impact of the pandemic and ongoing risks as countries battle a second wave of infections, management proposed a 5-cent cut to its dividend to 22 euro cents for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
Investors shrugged off the cut, focusing instead on the sales outlook, sending Infineon shares up 3.1%, outpacing a wider German market lifted by Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential election.
AUTOMOTIVE DRIVER
Infineon forecast flat sales in the first quarter of its new financial year - instead of showing the usual seasonal drop - setting up the company for projected growth of 22.6% in sales to 10.5 billion euros ($12.5 billion) in fiscal 2021.
Citi analyst Amit Harchandani estimated that implied underlying top-line growth of 10-11%, after accounting for the impact of consolidating Cypress.
Even though global light vehicle sales are forecast by IHS Markit to fall by 6 million to 83 million units next year, growth in electric and hybrid vehicles will play to Infineon's strengths, said Ploss.
More than half of Infineon's top-line growth would come from the automotive sector next year, he added, while consolidating Cypress would help expand segment margin - management's preferred measure of the operating profitability of its business units - to a forecast 16.5% from 13.7%.
That outlook was more or less in line with a poll of analysts by Vara Research, while results for the year just ended were also close to analyst estimates and the company's own reinstated guidance.

1699,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 04:56AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Airbus Soars as U.S.-EU Trade War Continues in a New Key,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Airbus (OTC:EADSY) stock soared on Monday to its highest level in more than two months, profiting from hopes of an end to the trade wars that characterized Donald Trump's presidency. 
By 5:45 AM ET (1045 GMT), the European aerospace giant was up 4.0%, the best-performing stock in the Euro Stoxx 50 blue chip index, as investors bet that the new administration will seek an end to the decade-long wrangle between the EU and U.S. over subsidies for their domestic champions in the sector.  
The moves were part of a broad risk-on rally in the wake of a weekend that saw Joe Biden clinch the U.S. presidency, with investors choosing to dismiss Trump's chances of overturning the result with lawsuits and recounts. 
Analysts argue that a Biden administration is likely to drop Trump's efforts to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by the imposition of import tariffs, and is also likely to return to multilateral approaches in foreign policy in general, building coalitions to pursue what will be an unchanged primary goal of restricting Chinese economic and geopolitical influence. 
That means rebuilding bridges with the EU, and the first step to rebuilding bridges is the dropping of import tariffs, notably on steel and aluminum. 
So the argument goes, at least. However, trade disputes have their own internal dynamics and the path to such a goal is unlikely to be a straight one. The first thing EU trade ministers did as they convened via Webex on Monday was to confirm the imposition of import tariffs on  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA). This had been in the making since the World Trade Organization deemed earlier this year that the U.S., too, had been guilty of subsidizing its national champion. That followed a WTO ruling last year against illegal EU launch aid for Airbus, since when Trump has imposed tariffs on a broad range of European goods (not just Airbus's).
With the EU's action, that particular dispute is now evened up. But EU Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis was quick to point out that this makes the choreography of a mutual de-escalation easier: 
""Of course we remain open for a negotiated solution,"" Dombrovskis said in a briefing ahead of the meeting. ""Our proposal of course remains on the table, that both sides withdraw their tariffs and that we move ahead with a negotiated settlement.""
So far, so peaceful. It remains to be seen, however, whether the traditional lobbying power of Airbus and Boeing will allow that de-escalation. Both companies have suffered grievously from the pandemic, slashing  both current production and their long-term outlooks amid doubts that international air travel will ever regain its previous momentum. Neither will want their biggest rival to be let off the hook, and both can convincingly plead that thousands of high-quality manufacturing jobs are at stake: The previous Democratic administration, in which Biden served as vice-president, was more than sympathetic to Boeing's arguments then.
The risk for Airbus and Boeing investors is that they get carried away by rhetoric of healing and peacemaking. This one will be harder to de-escalate than, for example, steel and aluminum imports or even those of strategically vital luxury cars. But with Airbus stock still down over 40% from its January level, and Boeing stock even more so, at least the risks look more evenly balanced from here on.
