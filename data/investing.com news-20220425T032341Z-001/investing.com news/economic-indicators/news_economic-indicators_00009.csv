In the latest sign that the property market is cooling since Britons voted to leave the European Union, Knight Frank said prices fell by an annual 2.3 percent last month in London's most desirable postcodes, the biggest drop in seven years.
A decline of 1.8 percent in August and 2.1 percent in September had been the biggest falls since October 2009, when prices fell 3.2 percent as Britain began recovering from the effects of the financial crisis.
Prime central London stretches from Kensington and Notting Hill in the west to the City of London in the east. The biggest drop was recorded in Chelsea, where prices fell 9.9 percent.
""Uncertainty generated by the decision to leave the EU has made vendors more realistic on asking prices,"" Head of London Residential Research Tom Bill said.
Stamp duty - paid on purchases of new homes- was increased from April on second homes and buy-to-let purchases, particularly hitting central London where many buyers are foreign investors.
The timing, which brought forward many purchases and resulted in a slump afterwards, makes it difficult to disentangle the effect from the uncertainty created by the run-up to the June 23 referendum and the decision to leave the EU.
Upmarket estate agents  Savills  (L:SVS) said in September that prices in London's prime locations will fall by 9 percent this year and not grow again until 2019.
There are also signs that foreign investors are bargaining down prices and using the fall in the value of the pound, which has declined by around 15 percent against the euro and the dollar since the referendum, as a way to snap up London property with large discounts.

""While sales have been weaker, a combination of lower asking prices and a weaker pound has begun to push demand indicators higher,"" said Bill.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2016 05:00AM ET</span>","China October forex reserves fall most in nine months, lowest since early 2011","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves fell the most in nine months in October and by far more than expected to the lowest since March 2011, indicating further capital outflows despite recent signs the world's second-largest economy is stabilizing.
Reserves fell $45.7 billion last month to $3.121 trillion, the biggest monthly decline since January, compared with a near $19 billion fall in September, central bank data showed on Monday.
The October drop was the fourth in a row, and exceeded the previous three months combined.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to dip to $3.14 trillion in October from $3.166 trillion at the end of September, a five-year low.
The central bank is widely believed to have sold U.S. dollars to support the yuan currency <CNY=CFXS> in October as it fell to six-year lows.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) had sold a net 337.5 billion yuan ($50.1 billion) worth of foreign exchange in September, as it sought to support the weakening yuan as outflows picked up.
China's reserves, the largest in the world, fell by a record $513 billion last year after Beijing devalued the yuan, sparking a flood of capital outflows that threatened to destabilize the economy and alarmed global financial markets.
The yuan, also known as the renminbi, fell over 1.5 percent against the dollar in October alone as the greenback rose broadly against major global currencies in anticipation of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
Currency strategists polled by Reuters expect the yuan to depreciate by nearly 2 percent more in the next 12 months, to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.
China's gold reserves fell to $75.348 billion at the end of October from $78.169 billion at end-September, data published on the People's Bank of China website showed.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A majority of Bank of Japan policymakers believe it could take time for inflation expectations to firm, underscoring lingering doubts on how effective the BOJ's new policy framework would be in achieving its ambitious 2 percent price target.
The nine board members also disagreed on whether the BOJ's massive stimulus program would help spur public expectations of future price rises, minutes of the central bank's September policy meeting showed on Monday.
The minutes suggested that the make-over of the BOJ's policy framework in September had done little to narrow differences within its fragmented board and may reinforce doubts among investors on the BOJ's ability to cast off years of deflation amid its dwindling policy ammunition.
""Some members said firms' cautious price-setting behavior might continue for longer than expected,"" as recent declines in consumer prices prevent inflation expectations from heightening, the minutes showed.
""Many members expressed the view it could take time for (the BOJ's policies) to heighten inflation expectations,"" according to the minutes, which did not specify how many of them agreed to the view.
At the Sept. 20-21 meeting, the BOJ switched its policy target to interest rates from base money - or the pace of money printing - after years of massive asset purchases failed to jolt the economy out of stagnation.
Under a new ""yield curve control"" (YCC) framework, the BOJ's main easing mechanism would be to deepen negative interest rates, accompanied if needed by a cut in its 10-year government yield target.
While ditching its base money target, the central bank left a loose pledge to keep buying government bonds at the current pace in a move largely seen as a compromise to advocates of aggressive money printing on the board.
""One member noted that a long-run relationship between the monetary base and inflation expectations was not observed,"" the minutes showed.
Another board member countered the argument, saying that such a relationship ""existed theoretically,"" because the BOJ's aggressive money printing could boost public sentiment by weakening the yen and boosting stock prices, the minutes showed.
Several board members echoed the view voiced publicly by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda that the new framework would make its monetary policy more flexible by allowing it to directly target interest rates rather than trying to indirectly influence them through bond purchases.
But one member said achieving both the interest rate targets and maintaining a loose goal on the pace of bond buying at the same time was ""difficult,"" the minutes said.
Japan's core consumer prices fell for a seventh straight month and household spending slumped in September, underscoring the challenges of hitting the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target.

In a glimmer of hope, however, data on Monday showed real wages rose for the eighth consecutive month in September, which could support consumption in coming months.
"
15,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2016 08:50PM ET</span>",Japan September real wages rise as consumer prices sink,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's real wages rose for the eighth consecutive month in September, data showed on Monday, helped by falling prices as the economy shows scant sign of generating inflation.
Real wages, which are adjusted for moves in consumer prices, rose 0.9 percent in September from a year earlier, faster than a revised 0.6 percent gain in the previous month.
Wage earners' nominal cash earnings rose 0.2 percent year-on-year in September. Revised data showed that in the previous month nominal wages were unchanged from a year earlier.
Japanese policymakers originally hoped aggressive monetary easing and fiscal spending would spur economic growth, which would in turn push up real wages and spark inflation.
Instead, consumer prices have slumped due to lacklustre growth, which is pushing up real wages but unlikely to benefit the economy.
Separate data last month showed core consumer prices fell for a seventh straight month and household spending slumped in September, tell-tale signs the government's attempt to reflate the economy is not working.
Special payments, such as bonuses, fell 2.9 percent in September from a year earlier, versus a revised 0.5 percent annual decline in August, data on Monday showed.
Special payments are generally small, so even a slight change in the amount can cause big percentage changes.
Regular pay, which determines base salaries, increased an annual 0.4 percent. Overtime pay - a barometer of strength in corporate activity - fell 1.3 percent in September from a year ago.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who are employed for more than one month at a firm that employs more than five people, or 2) those who are employed on a daily basis or have less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted at a firm that employs more than five people.

16,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 06, 2016 08:07PM ET</span>",BoJ minutes highlight discussion on boosting inflation expectations,"Investing.com - Several Bank of Japan board members agreed that a stronger commitment to hitting a sustained 2% inflation target was needed, including overshooting the aim, as expectations were sliding due to the public's backward-looking views on prices, minutes of the Sept. 20-21 policy meeting released Monday showed.
The board shared the view that, in order to achieve the price stability target of 2%, it was necessary to raise inflation expectations, which had weakened, toward 2%, the minutes said.
""Most members expressed the recognition that measures to strengthen the forward-looking expectation formation mechanism were warranted, as the adaptive component continued to play a relatively large role compared to other countries in terms of the formation of inflation expectations in Japan,"" they said.
Many members shared the view that, in light of such measures, it was appropriate for the BoJ ""to strengthen its commitment to achieving the price stability target.""
A few members said it was appropriate for the BoJ to adopt the ""inflation-overshooting commitment,"" in which it committed itself to expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeded the price stability target of 2% and stayed above the target in a stable manner.
However, one member said, ""Inflation-overshooting commitment was not a realistic target in light of the growth potential, and would not be effective for raising inflation expectations either.""
For now, the BoJ has kept the increase in the monetary base at an annual rate of ¥80 trillion.
In the September meeting, in a 7-to-2 vote, the board maintained the negative interest rate at -0.1%, which is charged on a small portion of reserves lenders park with the central bank. The policy took effect in February with the aim of encouraging banks to lend to and invest in more growth areas.

The CBI said its monthly growth indicator - which is based on surveys of how companies' output has changed over the previous three months - rose to +8 in October from a six-month low of +3 in September.
""Manufacturing exports are riding high on the back of weaker sterling and consumers are continuing to spend on the high street, but activity is more modest in the services sector,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
However the CBI said there were likely to be tougher times ahead, as uncertainty about the terms on which Britain would leave the EU had led to a ""sharp deterioration"" in planned investment.
""Although growth will be robust for the remainder of this year, we expect uncertainty ... to dampen business investment in 2017, along with a rise in inflation which will knock household spending,"" Newton-Smith said.
The forward-looking component of the CBI growth survey fell to +13 in October from a one-year high of +22 in September, though this was still above its long-run average.
Last week the CBI said it expected growth to slow to 1.3 percent next year from 2.0 percent in 2016, and to 1.1 percent in 2019.
This is a slightly darker outlook than the Bank of England, which revised up its 2017 growth forecast last week on the back of a fall in sterling and unexpectedly strong growth of 0.5 percent in the three months to September.

The CBI growth indicator is based on a combination of its surveys of manufacturers, retail and distribution companies and business and professional services firms, which it says covers about three quarters of the private-sector economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers maintained a strong pace of hiring in October and boosted wages for workers, which could effectively seal the case for a December interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 161,000 jobs last month amid gains in construction, healthcare and professional and business services, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Adding to the report's strong tone, August and September data was revised to show 44,000 more jobs created than previously reported. Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents in October. As a result, the year-on-year gain in wages last month was the largest in nearly 7-1/2 years.
""All in all, the data fits perfectly with a Fed hike in December,"" said Alan Ruskin, global co-head of FX research at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York.
The unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.9 percent, in part as people dropped out of the labor force.
The closely watched employment report was published four days before the Nov. 8 presidential election. It came on the heels of data last week showing an acceleration in economic growth in the third quarter. But economists see little impact from the report on an increasingly bitter and divisive campaign.
""There is so much noise out there right now, everyone is screaming from the rooftops. I just don't know that any particular data point is going to have a great bearing on the election, in and of itself,"" said Sam Bullard, senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Though the U.S. central bank is expected to increase borrowing costs next month, that decision will likely depend on the outcome of Tuesday's election. The tight race between Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival Donald Trump has rattled financial markets.
The dollar raced to session highs against the yen and the euro after the report. U.S. Treasuries fell, while U.S. stock index futures trimmed losses.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 175,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent from 5.0 percent.
A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 9.5 percent last month. That was the lowest level since April 2008.
The Fed on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged but said its monetary policy-setting committee ""judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen."" It lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade.
""The election could still derail the Fed's plans, particularly if a very close result led to one or both candidates contesting it via the courts,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
TREND HAS SLOWED
The trend in employment growth has slowed as the labor market nears full employment and the economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession shows signs of aging.
Employment growth so far this year has averaged 181,000 jobs per month, down from an average gain of 229,000 per month in 2015. Still, the monthly job gains are more than enough to absorb new entrants into the labor market.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the work-age population.
The prospects of an interest rate hike next month were also bolstered by a solid rise in wages.
Average hourly earnings increased 0.4 percent in October after advancing 0.3 percent in September. That pushed the year-on-year increase to 2.8 percent, the biggest gain since June 2009, from 2.7 percent in September.
The Fed on Wednesday struck a fairly upbeat note on inflation, saying price pressures had ""increased somewhat since earlier this year.""
Despite the labor market nearing full employment, wage growth has been moderate. Economists blame this on a low labor force participation rate.
The participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.1 percentage point to 62.8 percent last month, not too far from multi-decade lows, in part reflecting demographic changes.
The solid payrolls gain accompanied by the surge in wages could support consumer spending heading into the holiday season, and in turn keep the economy on a relatively higher growth path.
While the household survey showed a large increase in the number of people saying they could not get to work because of bad weather, the department said it was difficult to assess the impact of Hurricane Matthew on job growth last month.
The storm lashed the east coast of the country last month, causing extensive flooding. The average workweek held steady at 34.4 hours.
Construction payrolls increased 11,000, rising for a second straight month. But manufacturing employment fell 9,000 last month, falling for a third straight month.
Retail sector employment surprising fell 1,100 jobs, despite anecdotal evidence retailers had embarked on early hiring for the holiday season.
Professional and business services payrolls rose 43,000.

Healthcare and social assistance employment increased 39,100 last month. Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger for future hiring, increased 6,400. Government employment rose by 19,000 jobs.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap narrowed 9.9 percent to $36.4 billion, the smallest since February 2015. August's trade deficit was revised slightly down to $40.5 billion. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap decreasing to $37.8 billion in September after a previously reported $40.7 billion shortfall. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $55.0 billion from $57.4 billion in August.
The data was included in last week's gross domestic product report, which showed trade contributing 0.83 percentage point to GDP growth in the third quarter. 
Exports were boosted by shipments of industrial supplies and materials, and consumer goods. Exports of soybeans, which helped power the economy in the third quarter, fell in September.
Exports increased 0.6 percent to $189.2 billion in September, the highest level since July 2015. 
Exports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest since August 2015, while those of consumer goods hit their highest level in a year. 
Still, exports continue to be constrained by the residual effects of the dollar's surge against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015. 
Exports to the European Union increased 6.0 percent, with goods shipped to the United Kingdom soaring 12.4 percent.
Exports to China rose 1.8 percent. 
Imports of goods and services dropped 1.3 percent to $225.6 billion in September. The decline in imports is consistent with a slowdown in consumer spending.

Imports from China fell 2.8 percent. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit dropped 4.1 percent to $32.5 billion in September.

Non-farm payrolls rose 161,000 in October, compared to the rise of 191,000 in September that was revised from the initial reading of 156,000. The data missed the consensus estimate for the creation of 175,000 jobs.
Nonetheless, the Federal Reserve (Fed) considers the creation of 150,000 to be a solid reading.
The jobless rate dropped down to 4.9%, from the previous 5.0%, as expected.
Average hourly earnings rose month-on-month by 0.4%, compared to the prior increase of 0.3% (revised up from an initial gain of 0.2%). Analysts had expected an increase of 0.3%.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Fed for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created fewer of the new job contracts than expected in October with a total of 142,000, compared to consensus expectations for 166,000. September’s number was revised up to 188,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 167,000.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity in the euro zone during October was not as robust as first thought, a survey showed on Friday, adding to signs the bloc's recovery remains on track but is struggling to gain momentum.
For the second month running, firms held prices steady despite costs rising at the steepest rate since July 2015, indicating companies' pricing power remained muted and that the European Central Bank might have to do more to drive up inflation.
Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 53.3 in October, below a 53.7 flash estimate but beating September's 52.6 and its highest since January. 
The reading has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013.
""The economy is ticking along but there is a lack of traction and that tells you the ECB's best efforts to stimulate the economy haven't worked yet,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
Markit said the PMI pointed to fourth quarter economic growth of 0.3 percent, in line with the prediction in a Reuters poll. [ECILT/EU]
A stable but lackluster economic outlook will push the ECB to tweak its asset purchase program and announce by year-end an extension to it beyond March 2017, a Reuters poll found last month. 
Years of ultra-loose monetary policy has so far failed to get inflation anywhere near the central bank's 2 percent target ceiling but the PMI showed input prices rose sharply, largely driven by higher staff costs and oil prices.
The input prices sub index was 54.2, up from 53.5. Inflation was just 0.5 percent in October, the European Union's statistics office said last week, while the figure used by the ECB as core inflation dipped to 0.7 percent from 0.8 percent.
Producer prices rose 0.1 percent month-on-month in September, official figures showed earlier on Friday.
Although costs were rising, firms in the bloc's dominant service industry returned to discounting to drum up trade after holding prices steady last month. The output prices sub index for the sector was 49.7, down from September's 50.0 and the flash 50.3 estimate.

Those price cuts helped drive activity up from the previous month and the services PMI registered 52.8, above September's 52.2 but below the 53.5 preliminary reading.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely expanded for a third straight quarter in July-September, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, but weak private consumption and lackluster company capital spending suggest growth will remain fragile.
The world's third-largest economy is expected to have grown at an annualized rate of 0.9 percent in the third quarter, the poll of 22 economists found, following a 0.7 percent expansion in the second quarter.
That would translate into a muted 0.2 percent rise for the quarter, the same pace as in the second quarter.
""The economy is escaping from a lull but we cannot say it returned to a track of sustainable growth because private spending and capital expenditure remained low,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""The economy is expected to pick up moderately from October-December but downside risks continue to stay.""
A recovery in automobile production which may have contributed to the economy in July to September has likely waned, though government stimulus measures are expected to continue to provide some support for activity, he said.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), likely stalled in the last quarter after improving in the previous two quarters, economists predicted.
Capital spending was seen up a marginal 0.1 percent, but still rising for the first time in three quarters.
The Cabinet Office will announce the GDP data on Nov. 14 at 8:50 a.m.(2350 GMT, Nov. 13).
The poll also found core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital spending, likely slipped 0.8 percent in September from the previous month, down for the second straight month.
The expected fall would follow a 2.2 percent decline in August. The highly volatile data series is regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the next six to nine months.
Core orders, which exclude those for ships and electrical equipment, likely rose 3.5 percent in September from a year earlier after a 11.6 percent jump in August.
""External demand is weak due to an impact from a strong yen, which could prompt manufacturers to become cautious about capital expenditure,"" said an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities at the survey.
The Cabinet Office will release machinery orders on Nov. 10
On Wednesday, the finance ministry will release the current account balance for September, which is expected to show a surplus of 1.9602 trillion yen ($19.02 billion).
The Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI) on Friday, which measures the price companies charge each other for goods and services, was seen down 2.7 percent in the year to October.

In its latest economic update under the monetary policy statement, the RBA said its GDP growth and inflation outlooks were mostly unchanged compared with August, but it did drop a reference to the exchange rate as a main source of uncertainty for its forecasts.
The underlying inflation forecast remained at 1.50% by December of this year and at 1.50% to 2.50% by June of 2017. The GDP growth outlook stayed steady at 2.50% to 3.50% by December 2016 and the same by June 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England scrapped its plan to cut interest rates, which it said could now move up or down, and raised its forecasts for 2017 growth and inflation sharply due to the slide in sterling since Britain's vote to leave the EU.
The battered pound rose and British government bond prices fell after the BoE shifted to what Governor Mark Carney called ""a neutral stance"" on what its next move would be.
The Bank, which has faced political criticism for its near-zero rates, rethought its view on when Britain's economy will feel the pain of June's decision to leave the European Union.
In a set of forecasts on Thursday, it largely reversed its previous prediction of a major hit to growth next year which it now saw at 1.4 percent, up from an estimate of 0.8 percent made in August. That represented its biggest ever growth upgrade.
But it warned that Britain's access to EU markets could be ""materially reduced"", which would hurt growth over ""a protracted period"" and forecast a slower recovery for 2018 and 2019 as significantly above-target inflation squeezed living standards.
The BoE responded to the Brexit vote by cutting rates to a record low of 0.25 percent in August and reviving its bond-buying plan. It also said then that another rate cut was likely in 2016 if the economy slowed as it expected. 
Critics, many of them Brexit supporters, accused Carney and his fellow policymakers of overstating the risks to the economy.
Asked by reporters about the big change to the 2017 growth forecast, Carney said in ""broad-brush"" terms the BoE was sticking to its view of the economy in three years' time. 
The BoE's nine policymakers all voted to keep rates on hold, in line with a Reuters poll of economists. There was also unanimous support to stick with August's bond-buying plans.
RECORD INFLATION OVERSHOOT
The Bank said it now expected a record overshoot of inflation above its target over the next two to three years, peaking above 2.8 percent in early 2018, because of sterling's recent fall to a 31-year low against the U.S. dollar.
""There are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated,"" the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee said as it forecast inflation would jump to 2.7 percent this time next year, nearly triple its current level.
""Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes in the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2 percent target.""
Inflation was only expected to return to 2 percent in 2020.
But economists doubted the Bank would raise rates soon. ""We don't think there is any material probability of a Bank Rate hike in the foreseeable future,"" RBC's Sam Hill said.
Thursday's change in stance could please Prime Minister Theresa May, who said last month that the BoE's ultra-loose monetary policy had ""bad side effects"" for savers and had to change, raising questions about the BoE's independence. 
Soon after, Carney said he would not ""take instruction"" from politicians on how to meet the Bank's inflation target.
Earlier this week, the Canadian said he would stay at the BoE for an extra year until June 2019 but declined to take up an option of staying until 2021.
Carney sought to return the focus to the Bank's monetary policy on Thursday, saying he wanted to move on from the ""saga"" around his position and denying that the BoE had come under political pressure from Downing Street.
But he declined to answer questions about whether he might stay on at the Bank longer than 2019.
Sterling's renewed fall last month came shortly after May suggested she might adopt a tough approach for Brexit talks with the EU, pushing the currency down to around $1.22. 
It jumped above $1.24 on Thursday after England's High Court ruled that the government needs parliamentary approval to trigger Brexit. Carney cited the ruling as an example of uncertainty that could affect the economy.
Sterling rose further to nearly $1.25 after the BoE announcement.
The BoE said it would keep a close eye on inflation expectations and that its response to a further inflation overshoot would hinge on the reasons behind it, how widespread price rises were and the size of any shortfall in growth.

While the BoE raised its growth forecast for 2017, it revised down its 2018 growth forecast to 1.5 percent and saw growth of 1.6 percent in 2019.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2016 01:23PM ET</span>","Slowdown in orders, hiring curbs U.S. services sector growth","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity cooled in October amid a slowdown in new orders and hiring, suggesting a moderation in economic growth early in the fourth quarter. 
Other data on Thursday showed planned job cuts by U.S.-based employers dropped 31 percent to a five-month low last month. That underscored the labor market's healthy fundamentals, though more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week.
The mixed reports came a day after the Federal Reserve offered a fairly upbeat assessment of the economy and signaled it could raise interest rates next month. 
""While the services report was weak, it is not nearly weak enough to disrupt Fed plans to hike in December. It is consistent with a softer pace of economic growth,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing index fell 2.3 percentage points to a reading of 54.8 percent in October. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy. 
It said respondents' comments remained mostly positive about business conditions and the overall economy, but added that ""several"" had highlighted uncertainty about the impact of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.
Services industries reported a slowdown in new orders and employment, as well as demand for exports. 
The new orders sub-index dropped 2.3 percentage points to 57.7, while a measure of services sector employment decreased 4.1 percentage points to 53.1. A sub-index for export orders fell 1.0 percentage point last month.
Thirteen services industries including information, professional, retail and finance reported growth in October. The five industries reporting contraction included education, public administration and arts, entertainment and recreation.
The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the third quarter after expanding at a 1.4 percent rate in the April-June period.
Separately, the Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Oct. 29, the highest level since early August. 
It was still the 87th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
""U.S. jobless claims remain supportive of labor market improvement,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
The Fed on Wednesday held interest rates steady but said its monetary policy-setting committee ""judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen.""
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to increase its overnight benchmark interest rate in December, but the decision could depend on the outcome of next week's election.
The tightening of the race between Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival Donald Trump has rattled financial markets. The Fed raised borrowing costs last December for the first time in nearly a decade.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with traders focused on the race for the White House.
The dollar stabilized from multi-week lows against a basket of major currencies after a poll showed Clinton holding on to a narrow lead over Trump. U.S. stocks were a bit weaker, while prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds fell.
LAYOFFS DECLINE
Last week's claims report has no bearing on October's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 175,000 last month after rising by 151,000 in September. The unemployment rate is seen slipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.9 percent.
Expectations of an upbeat October employment report were supported by a report on Thursday from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing employers announced 30,740 job cuts last month, down from 44,324 in September.
Job cuts in October were concentrated in the computer industry, where employers announced 4,792 layoffs. Most of the computer job cuts came from HP Inc, which laid off another 4,000 workers last month. That was in addition to the 30,000 job cuts the company announced in 2015. 
In another report, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at a 3.1 percent annual rate, the fastest pace in two years. The increase ended three straight quarters of decline. 
Despite the rise, the trend in productivity remains weak.
A fifth report from the Commerce Department showed new orders for manufactured goods increased for a third consecutive month in September. Unfilled orders at factories, however, fell for a fourth straight month.

Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been hurt by a strong dollar and weak global demand. Production has also been undermined by the collapse in oil drilling activity in the wake of the plunge in oil prices.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday new orders for manufactured goods increased 0.3 percent after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent gain in August.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.2 percent in September after a previously reported 0.2 percent increase in August. Unfilled orders at factories fell for a fourth straight month in September.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been hurt by a strong dollar and weak global demand. Production has also been undermined by the collapse in oil drilling activity in the aftermath of the plunge in oil prices.
There is cautious optimism, however, that a turnaround may be imminent. A survey published on Tuesday showed factory activity rising in October for a second straight month amid a jump in production.
But factories reported a slowdown in new orders, which suggests any pickup in manufacturing activity will be modest.
In September, orders for transportation equipment fell 1.1 percent, largely reflecting a drop in defense aircraft orders.
Motor vehicle production jumped 2.6 percent, the largest increase since July 2015. Orders for machinery increased 1.1 percent, the biggest rise since January.
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – fell 1.3 percent instead of the 1.2 percent decline reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.4 percent in September instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent rise.

Shipments of overall factory goods shipments increased 0.8 percent, the biggest rise since June 2015. Inventories of factory goods were unchanged after two straight months of increases. That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio at 1.34 compared to 1.35 in August.

The Labor Department said on Thursday that nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at a 3.1 percent annual rate. The increase ended three straight quarters of decline.
Productivity fell at a revised 0.2 percent rate in the second quarter, which was previously reported as a 0.6 percent pace of decline. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity rising at a 2.0 percent rate in the third quarter.
Productivity was unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2015.
The surge in third-quarter productivity was flagged by a report last week showing an acceleration in gross domestic product during the same period.
The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the third quarter after expanding at a 1.4 percent rate in the April-June period.
Output per worker in the third quarter jumped at a 3.4 percent rate, also the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014. That was up from the 1.6 percent pace notched in the April-June period.
The increase in output came despite total hours worked rising only at a 0.3 percent rate in the third quarter, slowing from a 1.7 percent pace of increase in the second quarter. That reflected a drop in hours for the self-employed.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at a 0.3 percent pace in the third quarter after increasing at a downwardly revised 3.9 percent rate in the second quarter.
Unit labor costs were previously reported to have increased at a 4.3 percent rate in the second quarter.

Third-quarter unit labor costs rose at a 2.3 percent rate compared to the same period of 2015. Hourly compensation per hour increased at a 3.4 percent rate in the third quarter after increasing at a 3.7 percent pace in the prior quarter.

On Wednesday, the central bank offered a fairly upbeat assessment of the labor market, inflation and the broader economy.

Signs of steady expansion would give room to policymakers to focus on reforms and risk control as China faces a growing debt pile and increasingly inefficient credit-fueled growth. 
China has reported steady 6.7 percent economic growth for the last three quarters, and looks set to hit Beijing's full-year target of 6.5 to 7 percent, fueled by strong infrastructure spending, record bank lending and a red-hot property market.
However, unbalanced growth and debt risks have stoked internal debate over potentially lowering the target for 2017, especially as global demand remains weak and private firms have been reluctant to invest, leaving growth reliant on government spending and state-owned firms. 
Vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao said this week that China's debt is under control, but warned that challenges remain, while the IMF said in August that the country's debt load is unsustainable.
Analysts are expecting new property curbs to have an impact on economic growth, but the impact may not show up in October. 
""The new measures target property sales, so the impact on real estate investment will take time to show up,"" said Bank of Communications economist Liu Xuezhi in Shanghai. 
""We still forecast property investment grew in October with relatively strong growth in property-related consumption."" 
Nomura economists said in a note this week that ""a cooling property market should weigh on property investment and in turn, on the real economy, in the coming months. We maintain our real GDP growth forecast of 6.4 percent year-on-year in Q4.""
HIGHER PRICES 
Inflation is expected to hit a six-month high in October, while factory prices likely rose again after turning positive in September after almost five years of deflation, according to economists polled by Reuters.
Higher prices for raw materials have helped boost industrial profits over the last two months, prompting factories to boost output. Factory activity increased at the fastest pace in over two years in October, China's official purchasing manager survey showed on Tuesday. 
Consumer inflation likely picked up to 2.1 percent from a year earlier, which would be the fastest pace since April. Inflation in recent months has been driven by higher costs for health care and other services. 
Producer price inflation is expected to have risen to 0.8 percent, up from 0.1 percent in September.
The October data deluge will kick off with foreign exchange reserves on Monday, followed by trade and inflation on Nov. 8 and 9, respectively.
Despite signs the economy is on steadier footing, economists expect forex reserves dipped again to $3.14 trillion in October after dropping to the lowest since 2011 in September, suggesting continued capital outflows as the yuan currency plumbs six-year lows.
The yuan fell over 1.5 percent against the firming dollar in October alone and forex strategists in a separate Reuters poll predicted it will weaken nearly 2 percent more in the next 12 months.
October exports likely fell 6 percent from a year earlier, an improvement from a 10 percent drop in September but pointing to still sluggish global demand. Imports may have dropped 1 percent, after falling 1.9 percent in September. 
China's trade surplus is forecast to have expanded to $51.70 billion in October, versus September's $41.99 billion.
Industrial output, investment and retail sales data will be released on Nov. 14, while loan and money data will be released Nov. 10-15.
Growth in industrial output is expected to remain little changed in October, with only a slight uptick from September's 6.1 percent, while retail sales and investment growth were likely mostly stable.
Fixed asset investment growth for Jan-Oct is expected to remain at 8.2 percent，buoyed by the government's spending spree but still around the weakest pace since December 1999.
Investors will be looking for signs of a further recovery in private sector investment, which grew 4.5 percent in September after hitting record lows earlier in the year. Factory surveys this week hinted that conditions may be improving for small and mid-sized firms.
Retail sales growth was likely unchanged from 10.7 percent in October.
New yuan loans may have fallen back to 700 billion yuan after strong mortgage-led growth over the last few months, while the growth of outstanding loans was likely unchanged at 13 percent. New loans totaled 1.22 trillion yuan in September. 

The increase in the M2 money supply likely moderated slightly, with analysts expecting an increase of 11.4 percent from September's 11.5 percent.

Financial data company Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.5 in October from September’s 52.6.
Economists had expected the index to tick down to 52.4.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Faster growth of total business activity was driven by a stronger expansion of incoming new business. New contracts rose at the fastest rate in nine months.
Employment increased for the third month running, but the rate of job creation remained well below the marked rates achieved in 2014 and 2015.
The survey also showed that a weak pound drove a marked intensification of cost pressures at service providers in October. Input price inflation surged to the highest since March 2011, the report said.
“Given the faster growth of both business activity and prices, it’s hard to see how the Bank of England would consider any further stimulus appropriate, though policymakers will most likely want to stand ready to act if the UK’s path to Brexit leads to an escalation of economic uncertainty,” Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at survey compiler Markit said.

The Investec Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in services fell to 54.6 in October from 56.2 in September, the lowest reading since May 2013, when Dublin was still working its way through an international bailout.
The index, which covers companies from banks to hotels, has fallen from a 10-year high of 64.0 in January as new business has steadily declined.
Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O'Sullivan said the fact new business had fallen for five consecutive months was a ""particular concern"", with a number of panelists citing the Brexit vote and related sterling weakness as a factor.
Ireland is widely considered the European Union economy to have the most to lose from the June referendum vote in its key trading partner.
But respondents remained optimistic about the future, with 49 percent predicting activity would increase over the coming 12 months compared to 7 percent expecting a decrease.
The rate of employment growth in the sector improved slightly, with more than 14 percent of respondents taking on extra staff during the month, while 6 percent cut jobs.

64,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2016 10:40PM ET</span>",China services sector grows at fastest pace in four months in October: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector grew at the strongest pace in four months in October as new business picked up, encouraging companies to hire more workers, a private survey showed.
The figures were first reported by Chinese financial news outlet Caixin on its website at 0900 Beijing time. That was ahead of a scheduled embargo time of 0945.
The findings, along with upbeat official factory and services readings earlier this week, add to the view that the world's second-largest economy is on a steadier footing.
Beijing is increasingly counting on the services sector to create jobs and drive growth as it looks to shift its economic model more toward consumption from a traditional reliance on investment and exports.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 52.4 in October on a seasonally adjusted basis from 52.0 in September, posting the strongest reading since June.
A reading above the 50-mark suggests expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
Services companies saw the fastest growth in new work since June, though the pace was still modest. Some firms attributed the improvement to better underlying market conditions and an associated upturn in demand.
Backlogs of work also increased slightly, ending a four-month sequence of marginal contractions, as some firms reported the increase in orders was creating capacity pressures.
Companies in the survey added staff for the second month in a row, and at the fastest pace since January, though gains were moderate.
Business expectations were more positive than the previous month, but still slightly below August when they hit a six-month high.
All measures improved from the previous month except prices charged for services, as increased competition and efforts to attract new business have curbed the pricing power of some firms. Most companies were only able to pass along a small part of the increase seen in their input costs in October.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors expanded at the fastest pace in over three years, rising to 52.9 from September's 51.4.
Economists called for continued government policy support to sustain the momentum.
""It may be possible to sustain this stable condition throughout the fourth quarter, but it's important that supportive policies are not relaxed because the economy still lacks sufficient growth momentum,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
China's official services survey showed robust growth in October, with the index rising at the fastest pace since December 2015.
Manufacturing surveys also suggested the economy was stabilizing, thanks to improved domestic demand and a construction boom.

The surveys by Markit, which is a registered trade mark of IHS Markit Limited, focus more on small and medium-sized firms, which have been facing greater financial strains than larger, state-owned companies.

66,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 02, 2016 06:35PM ET</span>",Fed keeps end year rate hike option open as it holds in November,"Investing.com - The Federal Reserve said the case for a rate hike by the end of the year remains in place as it held steady as expected on on Wednesday, adding few tweaks to its statement that was seen by some as still short of a very strong signal.
The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee voted 8 to 2 to continue targeting the 0.25% to 0.50% range for the fed funds rate, where it has been since liftoff last December.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester again dissented in favor of an immediate 25 basis point increase, while September's third dissenter, Boston Fed's more moderate Eric Rosengren, rejoined the majority.
The committee's statement said: the case for raising federal funds rate ""continued to strengthen,"" even as it decided once more to wait ""for the time being"" for ""some further evidence"" of continued progress toward its goals.
The central bank also issued an upbeat assessment of economic conditions, especially in regard to inflation, which ""has increased somewhat"" since earlier this year but is still below the Committee's 2% longer-run objective, and market-based measures of inflation compensation have ""moved up.""
To be sure, market reactions to the results of next week's presidential election and nonfarm payrolls data on Friday remain factors for December, anlayst said, noting the Fed is trying to walk a fine line. On the one hand, it wants to raises rates to head off the risk of the economy overheating, leading to higher inflation or even another recession. But if it moves too quickly, it risks undermining the current tepid recovery and may be forced to backtrack.

67,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2016 04:10PM ET</span>","Fed holds rates steady, sets stage for December hike","By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday in its last policy decision before the U.S. election, but signaled it could hike in December as the economy gathers momentum and inflation picks up.
The U.S. central bank said the economy had gained steam and job gains remained solid. Policymakers also expressed more optimism that inflation was moving toward their 2 percent target.
""The committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives,"" the Fed said in a statement following a two-day meeting.
That suggests the bar is low for a rate increase at the Fed's final policy meeting of the year in mid-December, which has largely been factored in by financial markets.
U.S. stocks extended earlier losses and Treasury yields fell after the release of the Fed statement. The U.S. dollar (DXY) briefly pared losses before falling further against a basket of currencies.
""You are still pointing to a December hike, they just didn't pre-commit to it,"" said John Canally, investment strategist and economist for LPL Financial in Boston.
In the statement, the Fed's increasing confidence that prices were moving higher was reflected in its view that ""inflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year"" and the removal of its previous reference to inflation remaining low in the near term.
Policymakers have increasingly converged on the likelihood of a December hike. In September, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that a move before year's end was likely as long as U.S. employment and inflation continued to strengthen.
Since then, job gains have continued at a solid rate and inflation has ticked higher, putting both close to the Fed's long-run targets. The economy also has gained momentum, growing at a 2.9 percent annual pace in the third quarter after a fairly sluggish first half.
ELECTION UNCERTAINTY
Investors had all but discounted an increase in borrowing costs this week ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. election.
Polls showing Republican Donald Trump gaining ground on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House sparked a slide on global equities markets, with the benchmark S&P 500 index headed for its seventh straight day of declines.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday showed the former secretary of state leading Trump by 5 percentage points, but some other surveys this week put the New York businessman ahead by 1-2 percentage points.
A Trump victory could trigger financial market volatility given investor worries about his stance on trade, immigration and foreign policy. Trump has also accused the Fed of keeping rates low because of pressure from the Obama administration.
""It just reinforces that unless Trump wins and markets become dislocated, the Fed has a green light to tighten,"" said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management in Philadelphia.
The Fed has held its target rate for overnight lending between banks in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent since last December, when it raised borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a decade.

Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester dissented in Wednesday's decision in favor of an immediate hike. They were among three policymakers who dissented at the last meeting in September.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing activity accelerated at its fastest rate in nearly three years last month, supported by a buoyant performance from Germany, while inflationary pressures showed further signs of recovery, a survey found on Wednesday.
The findings will make welcome reading for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who have struggled to get growth and inflation up despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy.
Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to a 33-month high of 53.5 from September's 52.6, ahead of the preliminary flash reading of 53.3 and above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.
A sub-index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Friday that is seen as a good overall growth indicator, climbed to 54.6 from 53.8, its highest level since April 2014.
The upturn came even though prices rose for the first time in over a year. An output price index was at a 16-month high of 50.8, up from 49.9 and its first time above 50 since August last year.
""Price pressures are coming up a bit. We would question whether that is strong enough to lead to a sustained increase in core inflation,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.
""It's positive, the ECB will be happy, but it's not going to be enough for it to hold off on pulling the trigger in terms of more loosening."" 
The ECB left policy unchanged last month but is likely to tweak its asset-purchase program and announce an extension by year-end, economists polled by Reuters said recently [ECILT/EU].
Earlier figures from Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed factory growth there was also near a three-year high. French manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest rate since March 2014.
Spanish growth also accelerated, but in Italy manufacturing activity grew at roughly the same listless rate as September, suggesting no near-term acceleration for its struggling economy.
Italian gross domestic product expanded 0.7 percent last year, less than half the rate in the 19-nation euro zone, and the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi forecasts a similar growth rate of 0.8 percent in 2016.
A Reuters poll last month also predicted growth of 0.8 percent this year and next. reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=ITGDPQQP 

Still, suggesting the uptick across the bloc may continue towards the end of the year, new orders came in at their fastest rate in two and a half years.

LONDON (Reuters) - Growth in Britain's construction industry hit a seven-month high in October as housebuilding rose, but slowing order books and soaring prices for building materials darkened the outlook, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose unexpectedly to 52.6 from 52.3, confounding a Reuters poll forecast for a drop to 51.8. Sterling and government bonds showed little reaction to the figures.
While the survey chimed with signs the economy has maintained momentum since June's Brexit vote, weakening growth in new orders and rocketing costs suggested next year will prove more difficult.
""The downturn in the construction sector continued to ease in October, but it would be premature to conclude that the sector is back on a recovery path,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Survey compiler IHS Markit said respondents held back investment spending because of uncertainty surrounding Britain's exit from the European Union.
Britain's second-biggest housebuilder  Persimmon  (L:PSN) cited this uncertainty on Wednesday as it said it would slow the pace of new land purchases, despite sales rising almost a fifth since the Brexit vote.
The PMI showed business expectations for the year ahead cooled markedly, while prices paid by construction firms for raw materials and goods rose at the second-fastest pace since 2011.
""We expect input prices to rise significantly in 2017 which will put financial pressure on an industry just about managing on squeezed margins and fixed-price contracts,"" said Paul Trigg, construction specialist at trade credit provider Euler Hermes.
A Markit/CIPS survey of manufacturers on Monday also showed rocketing input prices, describing the inflationary impact of weaker sterling as increasingly evident.
The fall in sterling is expected to push the Bank of England to raise its inflation forecasts on Thursday to show a bigger overshoot of its price target than at any time since it gained independence in 1997.
The BoE is widely expected to hold off from a fresh interest rate cut on Thursday.
Housebuilding drove the bulk of construction activity, with the commercial and civil engineering sectors broadly stagnant, the PMI showed.
Mortgage lender Nationwide reported unchanged house prices in October after rising in monthly terms in each of the previous 15 months, a new sign of the market cooling after the Brexit vote.

Preliminary official data for the third quarter suggested construction output contracted 1.4 percent, despite stronger-than-expected economic growth of 0.5 percent for the period.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German unemployment fell more than expected in October, pushing down the jobless rate in Europe's biggest economy to a record low and signaling a likely fourth-quarter boost for private consumption and overall economic growth.
The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 13,000 to 2.662 million, the Labor Office said. That compared with a consensus forecast of a fall of 1,000 in a Reuters poll.
""Due to the autumn pick-up, unemployment fell significantly, employment rose again and demand for new staff increased further,"" Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labor Office, said.
The adjusted unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage points to 6.0 percent, the lowest level since German reunification in 1990.
The number of job vacancies hit a record high of 691,000, suggesting companies are increasingly struggling to find new staff quickly on the labor market.
Additional workers were needed especially in the social and care sectors, in the retail and catering industry and in housing construction, KfW chief economist Joerg Zeuner said.
The government expects the number of people in employment to hit a record of 43.6 million this year and of 44 million in 2017. That should push up state revenues, enabling the government to increase state spending or reduce taxes.
At the same time, Berlin expects the number of unemployed to drop further to 2.69 million this year and 2.66 million next despite a record influx of migrants and refugees.
Germany registered more than 1 million arrivals from abroad this year and last, mainly from war-torn countries including Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The government and federal states are spending more than 20 billion euros this year to accommodate them and help them to integrate.
The Finance Ministry said on Wednesday it would make an additional 3.8 billion euros ($4.21 billion) available over this year and next for states to help migrants join the labor market.
The surprisingly strong labor market data came after a survey showed German manufacturing growth reached an almost three-year high in October as Asian and U.S. demand rose.
To meet the rising demand, firms increased production and hired staff at a pace not seen since September 2011. About 20 percent of companies said they had made new hires.
The expanding workforce signals that at least the short-term outlook looks bright for German manufacturers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity increased for a second straight month in October amid a pickup in production and hiring, supporting views that the embattled manufacturing sector would regain some momentum in the fourth quarter. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday said its index of national factory activity rose 0.4 percentage point to a reading of 51.9 percent last month. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
Manufacturing has suffered a prolonged slump in the aftermath of the dollar's surge between June 2014 and December 2015, which has constrained exports. Activity has also been hurt by the collapse in oil drilling after oil prices plunged.
""The latest data suggest that the manufacturing sector is starting to pick up some momentum following a weak run through most of the year so far,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""The sector is due for some improvement as some of the earlier drags that impacted the sector fade."" The ISM production sub-index gained 1.8 percentage points to 54.6. But a gauge of new orders slipped to a reading of 52.1 from 55.1 in September, suggesting any future gains in manufacturing activity would be modest. A measure of factory employment jumped 3.2 percentage points to a reading of 52.9.
The data came as Federal Reserve officials gathered for a two-day meeting to deliberate on monetary policy. 
The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates at the end of the meeting on Wednesday, which comes less than a week before the Nov. 8 presidential election, but is expected to do so in December.
Another report from data firm Markit also suggested an improvement in factory conditions in October. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data amid jitters over the outcome of the acrimonious election. 
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks and Treasuries were also lower.
MILD GAINS
Weak manufacturing has contributed to business spending on equipment declining for four straight quarters. While there are signs that a turnaround may be imminent, any improvement in the factory sector will likely be mild.
Heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) last week reported a 49 percent drop in third-quarter profit from a year ago and lowered its full-year revenue outlook for the second time this year. Caterpillar said demand for new heavy machinery had been undercut by an ""abundance"" of used construction equipment, a ""substantial"" number of idle locomotives and a ""significant"" number of idle mining trucks.
Though the dollar's rally appears to have largely faded, the greenback has so far this year gained 0.7 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners.
""It still seems somewhat premature to get comfortable with the outlook for the sector, given a strong dollar and weak global growth,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), senior economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
Last month, 10 manufacturing industries, including nonmetallic mineral products, furniture, and computer and electronic products reported growth. The eight industries reporting contraction in October included wood products, apparel, primary metals and electrical equipment, and appliances and components.
Manufacturers in the primary metals sector said they expected a ""considerable"" slowdown in October and November, noting that production was down 20 percent. Machinery manufacturers reported that business was up ""significantly"" because of a hurricane and other storms.
In a third report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0.4 percent in September as outlays on nonresidential structures recorded their biggest drop since December 2015. 
There were also declines in spending on public construction projects, which fell to its lowest level since March 2014. Outlays on state and local government construction projects dropped for a third straight month. 

""The disappointing reading makes us less optimistic for the fourth quarter,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending slipped 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 0.5 percent drop in August. Construction outlays were down 0.2 percent from a year ago.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.5 percent in September after a previously reported 0.7 percent drop in August. July's outlays were revised up to show them rising 0.5 percent instead of falling 0.3 percent as previously reported.
Spending on private construction projects dipped 0.2 percent in September, with outlays on residential construction rising 0.5 percent after falling 1.2 percent in August. The government reported on Friday that residential construction was a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes factories, hospitals and roads, tumbled 1.0 percent in September, the largest drop since December 2015, after rising 0.5 percent the prior month.
Investment in nonresidential structures contributed to the economy's 2.9 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter.
Public construction spending declined 0.9 percent in September, falling to its lowest level since March 2014.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Asia's largest economies posted strong factory activity in October, though poor showings in Korea and Southeast Asia and a weaker inflation outlook from the Bank of Japan kept market reaction muted.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in October, adding to views that the world's second-largest economy is stabilizing thanks to a credit and housing boom.
India factory activity grew at the fastest rate since December 2014, boosted by a surge in output and new orders, as Asia's third largest economy continues to grow at a robust pace.
But investors remained cautious as the prospects of another U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike in December raise concerns about the impact on emerging market economies, despite positive trends in Asia. 
""Asia is especially exposed to a potential rate hike by the Fed: the region's highly indebted economies will feel the pinch from rising dollar funding costs but will not receive a lift from stronger exports that a strengthening U.S. economy ordinarily entails,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economic Research at HSBC. 
Uncertainty was also on the rise as the acrimonious U.S. presidential election campaign entered its final week.
In China, there are worries that a pickup in activity over the last few months can't last, with record loan growth set to slow and the government seeking to dampen rocketing home prices. 
For India, a sharp rise in input costs could point to heightened inflationary risks, which could crimp the Reserve Bank of India's room to ease policy interest rates further.
Inflation looked to be trending lower in the region's major developed economies. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia held its policy interest rate at a record low on Tuesday, saying inflation was expected to remain subdued for some time and that the economy was likely to grow near its potential next year. 
The Bank of Japan on Tuesday held off on expanding stimulus on Tuesday despite pushing back the time frame for hitting its 2 percent inflation target, signaling that it will stand pat unless a severe market shock threatens to derail a fragile recovery.
Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in nine months in October as output and new export orders picked up, a private business survey showed on Tuesday, offering some hope for the struggling economy.
DIVERGING TRENDS
Factory surveys for major technology exporters Taiwan and Korea went in opposite directions in October. 
Taiwan's manufacturing sector showed the fastest growth in two years, with output rising for the last five months.
Meanwhile, South Korea's purchasing managers index (PMI) contracted for a third straight month and was the second-lowest since August 2015. While the downturn eased slightly, persistent weakness in global demand hampered the recovery in the export-reliant economy, the private survey showed.
Factory activity also contracted in Indonesia and Malaysia in October, while growth in Vietnam cooled, according to IHS Markit purchasing managers' indexes released on Tuesday.
Surveys from Europe and the U.S. were due later Tuesday. 
The U.S. economy grew at a faster than expected 2.9 percent in the third quarter, and consumer spending rose more than expected in September, which could bolster expectations of an interest rate hike from the Fed in December.

103,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2016 05:35AM ET</span>","BOJ keeps policy steady, delays inflation target again","By Leika Kihara and Minami Funakoshi
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan held off on expanding stimulus on Tuesday despite once again pushing back the timing for hitting its inflation target, signaling that it will keep policy unchanged unless a severe shock threatens to derail a fragile economic recovery.
The BOJ maintained its view that the world's third-largest economy will expand moderately as exports and consumption emerge from the doldrums.
But it also warned that risks to the outlook were skewed to the downside and that price momentum was weakening, an unusually bleak assessment that underscored its waning conviction of achieving the elusive inflation target.
""It's true it's taking a significant amount of time to eradicate the deflationary mindset that beset the economy during 15 years of deflation,"" Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters.
In a quarterly review of its forecasts released alongside its policy decision, the BOJ pushed back the timing for hitting 2 percent inflation by as much as a year to ""around fiscal 2018"" - admitting that the target won't be achieved before Kuroda's tenure ends in April 2018.
In July, the BOJ had said inflation will hit 2 percent by around March 2018.
Kuroda said the central bank stands ready to deploy ""all available means"" to hit his inflation target, seeking to keep alive market expectations of additional stimulus.
But he added that fiscal and monetary measures can reinforce each other, signaling that government steps to spur growth needed to accompany the BOJ's efforts to eradicate deflation.
""For the economy to achieve sustainable, appropriate growth, we need fiscal and structural policies as well as monetary policy,"" Kuroda told a news conference.
The central bank also cut its inflation forecasts for fiscal 2017 and 2018, blaming weak overseas demand and waning public conviction that prices and economic activity will pick up.
In a widely expected move, however, the BOJ maintained its minus 0.1 percent short-term interest rate target and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields at around zero percent.
""The BOJ has settled down for a long-drawn-out war to achieve its inflation target, so a delay in meeting the timing alone would not force it into action,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""The only trigger for easing could be a sharp rise in the yen. The BOJ is likely to stand pat for the coming months, barring a yen spike to 90-95 to the dollar.""
The dollar hovered around 104.80 yen on Tuesday.
While no longer an official target, the BOJ also kept a pledge to buy bonds at the current pace so its holdings rise at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($764 billion).
PRICE OUTLOOK GLOOMY
In the quarterly report, the BOJ warned that global uncertainties could discourage companies from raising wages, which would dash hopes that higher paychecks would boost consumer demand and prices.
Japan's core consumer prices fell for a seventh straight month and household spending slumped in September, endorsing the central bank's view that it will take some time for inflation to accelerate to its 2 percent target as the economy stagnates.
Analysts had not expected a back-to-back policy move after the BOJ switched its policy target to controlling interest rates from the pace of money printing in September.
The overhaul came after years of massive asset purchases failed to revive economic activity, raising fresh doubts about the central bank's ability to engineer a revival as it runs out of policy ammunition.
Under its new ""yield curve control"" (YCC) framework, the BOJ's main means for easing would be to cut negative interest rates even deeper and accompany it by a cut in the 10-year bond yield target if needed.
Japan's economy expanded for the second straight quarter in April-June but many analysts expect growth to remain modest for the rest of this year, with exports and output weak on sluggish global demand.
Slow wage growth has also hurt consumption, further undermining the chance of a strong near-term revival in the economy.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest pace in over two years in October thanks to a construction boom, with smaller firms growing more upbeat, suggesting the world's second-largest economy is stabilizing and getting on steadier footing. 
Signs of a more broader-based recovery will be welcomed by the government amid growing views that a housing rally may have peaked. Much of China's better-than-expected growth this year has been highly reliant on spending by often inefficient state firms as private investment languished. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.2 in October, much stronger than September and the highest reading since July 2014.
Economists had expected a far more modest reading of 50.4, in line with the previous month. Levels above 50 indicate an expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
China's economy expanded at a steady 6.7 percent clip in the third quarter and looks set to hit Beijing's full-year target of 6.5 to 7 percent, fueled by stronger government infrastructure spending, record bank lending and a red-hot property market that are adding to a growing pile of debt. 
The construction spree has fueled stronger demand and higher prices for building materials from cement to steel, boosting sales for related companies from engineering firms to property agents. Global construction equipment maker  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) said last week it sees further modest improvement in 2017.
""The significant improvement in PMI is largely driven by commodity prices,"" said Singapore-based economist Zhou Hao at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Beijing's plans to cut excess industrial capacity and factories' need to replenish low inventories are also buoying prices for commodities such as coal and steel, and boosting profits, said David Qu, a Shanghai-based economist from ANZ. 
Factory output accelerated in October, with the sub-index rising to 53.3 in October from 52.8 in September.
Total new orders also showed solid improvement, rising to 52.8 from September's 50.9. But new export orders contracted slightly, pointing to persistent sluggishness in global demand that has weighed on Asia's export-reliant economies for nearly two years. 
A similar business survey showed activity in China's services sector expanded at the fastest pace since December 2015, with the official reading picking up to 54.0 in October from 53.7 in September. 
PRIVATE SECTOR PICKING UP?
Both the official factory survey and a private survey by Caixin/Markit showed conditions were improving for smaller and medium-sized Chinese firms, which have struggled for traction as Beijing relies more on large state firms to spur activity.
The Caixin survey showed output expanded at the quickest pace since March 2011.
If the trend does not prove to be a flash in the pan, it may suggest that government efforts to revive weak private investment are starting to pay off. Private investment growth picked up to 4.5 percent in September after falling to record lows in recent months.
""I suspect the growth has more to do with a recovery in private investment,"" said Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard in Singapore.
""The government has been doing a lot to lower the borrowing costs for the private sector. But I doubt the strength will sustain as those measures are not fundamental reforms,"" He said.
IS GROWTH SUSTAINABLE?
While Asian stock markets edged higher after the upbeat China reports, financial markets remain unconvinced about how long the rebound can last, especially given the rapid rise in debt being used to fuel growth, said Cliff Tan, East Asia head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
ANZ economist Qu agreed the economy is not out of the woods.
""China is still cutting excessive capacity in heavy industries and the global economy is still quite sluggish.""
Despite the apparent surge in domestic demand, manufacturers continued to cut jobs, the factory surveys showed.
Signs are also growing that the housing boom which has helped support the economy this year may be peaking.
A measure of construction activity remained robust at 61.8, little changed from September, but a property sector reading contracted.

House prices and sales have cooled in recent weeks as more cities impose restrictions on purchases to curb soaring home prices.

The decisions were in line with expectations.
Under the latest policy framework, the BoJ will seek to stabilize the 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for long-term borrowing costs, round zero percent and keep the overnight interest rate around -0.1%.

For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Philip Lowe, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
Number2016-27Date1 November 2016At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Labour market conditions in the advanced economies have improved over the past year, but growth in global industrial production and trade remains subdued. Economic conditions in China have steadied recently, supported by growth in infrastructure and property construction, although medium-term risks to growth remain. Inflation remains below most central banks' targets.
Commodity prices have risen over recent months, following the very substantial declines over the past few years. The higher commodity prices have supported a rise in Australia's terms of trade, although they remain much lower than they have been in recent years.Financial markets are functioning effectively. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative. Government bond yields have risen, but are still low by historical standards.
In Australia, the economy is growing at a moderate rate. The large decline in mining investment is being offset by growth in other areas, including residential construction, public demand and exports. Household consumption has been growing at a reasonable pace, but appears to have slowed a little recently. Measures of household and business sentiment remain above average.
Labour market indicators continue to be somewhat mixed. The unemployment rate has declined this year, although there is considerable variation in employment growth across the country. Part-time employment has been growing strongly, but employment growth overall has slowed. The forward-looking indicators point to continued expansion in employment in the near term.
Inflation remains quite low. The September quarter inflation data were broadly as expected, with underlying inflation continuing to run at around 1½ per cent. Subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world mean that inflation is expected to remain low for some time.
Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 has been helping the traded sector. Financial institutions are in a position to lend for worthwhile purposes. These factors are assisting the economy to make the necessary adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.
The Bank's forecasts for output growth and inflation are little changed from those of three months ago. Over the next year, the economy is forecast to grow at close to its potential rate, before gradually strengthening. Inflation is expected to pick up gradually over the next two years.
In the housing market, supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards and some lenders are taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. Turnover in the housing market and growth in lending for housing have slowed over the past year. The rate of increase in housing prices is also lower than it was a year ago, although prices in some markets have been rising briskly over the past few months. Considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Growth in rents is the slowest for some decades.
Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May and August meetings, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in September as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and inflation increased steadily, which could bolster expectations of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.5 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in August. Last month's rise in consumer spending offered a fairly strong handoff from the third quarter to the current quarter.
The report was published ahead of the start of the Fed's two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates at this meeting, which comes about a week before the Nov. 8 presidential election, but is expected to do so in December.
""The latest data should be of comfort to the Fed. Spending continues to underpin growth and, combined with positive developments on the labor market and inflation, should enable the Fed to tighten policy in December,"" said Greg Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Economists had forecast consumer spending rising 0.4 percent last month. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3 percent after falling 0.2 percent in August.
The spending figures were incorporated into last Friday's report on third-quarter gross domestic product. Consumer spending increased at a 2.1 percent annual pace after advancing at a robust 4.3 percent rate in the prior period.
A separate report on Monday showed factory activity in the U.S. Midwest hit a five-month low in October amid declining production and weak growth in new orders. The report from the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago suggests prolonged weakness in manufacturing as the sector continues to deal with the aftermath of a dollar rally and lower oil prices.
U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher as investors showed caution ahead of next Tuesday's elections. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell.
INFLATION TICKING HIGHER 
Consumer spending combined with a spurt in soybean exports and a turnaround in inventory investment to boost economic growth to a 2.9 percent pace in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the April-June quarter. 
Rising wages due to a tightening labor market should help support consumer spending. With consumer spending firming, inflation continued to gain steadily last month. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.2 percent after a similar gain in August. 
In the 12 months through September the PCE price index rose 1.2 percent, the biggest gain since November 2014, after advancing 1.0 percent in August.
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index rose 0.1 percent after advancing 0.2 percent in August. In the 12 months through September the core PCE rose 1.7 percent after a similar increase in August. 
The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. 
""Overall inflation is accelerating as energy prices and the U.S. dollar have stabilized since the spring. Stronger wage growth from the tight labor market will also help push up inflation over the medium term,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.
Consumer spending last month was lifted by a 1.3 percent surge in purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods such as automobiles. Spending on services rose 0.3 percent. 

Personal income increased 0.3 percent in September after rising 0.2 percent in August. Wages and salaries advanced 0.3 percent after edging up 0.1 percent the prior month. Savings fell to $797.8 billion from $820.5 billion in August.

The latest reading for Chicago purchasing manager's index (PMI) came in at 50.6, a five-month low.
That's a lower reading than the 54.0 economists had forecast, a below the prior month's 54.2.
Still, a reading above 50 indicates that business activity is still in expansionary territory.
The report noted that the decline was led by a slowdown in production, which fell 5.4 points but remained above the 2016 average, and new orders, which dipped to their lowest level since May.
On the flip side, employment ticked up slightly, climbing above 50.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2016 07:00AM ET</span>","Euro zone growth still slow, October core inflation dips","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew at the same slow pace in the third quarter as the second and core inflation dipped in October, reinforcing expectations that the European Central Bank will decide to extend its asset-buying program in December.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the July-September period and by 1.6 percent year-on-year.
Both figures were the same as in the second quarter and matched expectations of economists polled by Reuters.
Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent year-on-year in October, Eurostat estimated, picking up from 0.4 percent in September and 0.2 percent in August as the drag on the index from energy diminished.
Energy prices were only 0.9 percent lower in October than 12 months earlier, compared to 3.0 percent down in September.
However, excluding the most volatile prices for unprocessed food and energy, inflation was just 0.7 percent year-on-year, down from 0.8 percent in the previous five months. The figure is the one the ECB uses as core inflation.
The European Central Bank wants a higher rate of overall inflation -- close to 2 percent over the medium term -- and has been buying euro zone government bonds to inject cash into the banking system and make banks lend to the real economy.
The ECB meets in December and will have to decide then whether it extends its bond-buying beyond an initial target date in March. To do otherwise would essentially subject markets and banks to a cold turkey cut-off.
ECB policymakers have said accommodative monetary policy would be maintained until inflation is on a sustainable path to the target. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said on Friday on growth: ""The whole discussion will be how sustained is that.""
In fact, euro zone sentiment, published by the European Commission on Friday, was much better than expected in October driven by higher optimism in industry and services, suggesting a robust start to the fourth quarter.
However, Capital Economics said it doubted this would be enough to convince the ECB to slow the pace of its asset purchases yet.
""Indeed, we still expect the Bank to announce a six-month extension of the program at the current pace to September 2017 at its December meeting,"" it said.
Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Markit agreed, although said it was conceivable that the ECB could announce a lower rate of purchases after March.

""Even if euro zone growth does show further signs of improvement over the coming weeks, there is a compelling case to try and fuel the improvement given past hiccups,"" he said.

In a report, Eurostat said consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% this month, in line with forecasts and following a final reading of a 0.4% advance in September. That was the biggest increase since June 2014.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in October, matching expectations and the previous month’s increase.
Despite the uptick in the core number, the low levels of headline inflation continues to be negative news for the euro zone’s monetary authority as inflation remains far below its 2% target.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output stalled in September in a worrying sign that the economy, already struggling to mount a sure-footed recovery, may be losing some momentum due to weak consumer spending and exports.
Separate data showed retail sales fell more than expected in September from a year ago, further evidence that private consumption remains a drag on growth.
Industrial output was unchanged in September from the previous month. That compares with the median estimate in a Reuters poll of a 1.0 percent increase and followed a 1.3 percent increase in August, data by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed on Monday.
Economists say output may not pick up much in coming months. The cautious view and other data showing weak consumption and falling consumer prices could heighten expectations that the Bank of Japan will yet again push back the timing of its price target.
""I don't expect output to rise significantly for the time being,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Domestic demand simply is not strong enough. The BOJ has sent a message that monetary policy is on hold for now. We need more effort from the private sector to increase wages.""
Industrial output was flat in September as declines in semiconductor and personal computer production offset gains in autos and construction equipment.
Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to rise 1.1 percent in October and gain 2.1 percent in November, but their forecasts are often overly optimistic, economists say.
Overall inventories fell 0.4 percent versus a 0.3 percent increase in the previous month, but there were signs that high inventories in some industries could curb future output, according to Daiju Aoki, economist at UBS Securities.
Inventories of mobile phones and car navigation systems jumped 14.1 percent, the fastest gain in six months. Inventories of construction equipment also rose 1.2 percent in September.
In the July-September quarter, industrial output rose 1.1 percent, faster than a 0.2 percent gain in the previous quarter, but economists say growth could moderate slightly in October-December.
Retail sales fell 1.9 percent in September from a year earlier, slightly more than a median market forecast for a 1.8 percent annual decline due to lower spending on apparel and daily necessities, separate data from the trade ministry showed.
That marked the seventh consecutive month of declines in retail sales, highlighting underlying weakness in the economy.
One stand out was domestic auto sales, which rose an annual 2.3 percent in September, faster than a 2.1 year-on-year increase in August, as the BOJ's negative interest rate policy pushes down rates on car loans.
Having moved to a new policy framework that targets interest rates rather than base money only last month, the BOJ is likely to hold off on expanding stimulus at a meeting ending on Nov. 1. Sources have told Reuters the central bank will cut next fiscal year's inflation forecast slightly, reflecting weak consumption and falling import costs.

The policy review may also extend the timeframe for hitting its ambitious inflation target. At present, the BOJ projects inflation to reach 2 percent during the fiscal year ending in March 2018.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German inflation rose more than expected in October, reaching its highest level in two years, preliminary data showed on Friday, a welcome sign for the European Central Bank that its monetary policy is gradually eliminating the threat of deflation in Europe's biggest economy.
The ECB has unleashed unprecedented stimulus in recent years, slashing interest rates and pumping more than a trillion euros into the economy of the 19-member currency bloc through asset purchases.
A strong recovery in German inflation would give hawks like Bundesbank's president and ECB rate setter Jens Weidmann more grounds to argue for a reduction in the ECB's bond-buying program.
German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries, rose by 0.7 percent on the year after an increase of 0.5 percent in September, the Federal Statistics Office said.
That was the highest inflation rate since October 2014 and stronger than a Reuters consensus forecast of 0.6 percent.
""Temperatures drop, inflation rises,"" KfW Bank economist Joerg Zeuner said. German inflation is likely to reach 2 percent at the beginning of next year, he said, as oil prices go up and the base effects from low energy costs fade out.
""There is a chance that monetary policy can slowly get back to normal soon,"" Zeuner added.
But other economists were less sure the pick-up in German inflation would lead the ECB to unwind its stimulus. They doubt that even German inflation will remain around 2 percent on a sustained basis, meaning the ECB will probably undershoot its target for the euro zone for the foreseeable future.
""This should encourage the ECB to maintain its current supportive policy stance for a long time to come,"" Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said.
Policymakers have said the central bank will provide stimulus until a sustained inflation rebound.
On a non-harmonized basis, German annual inflation picked up to 0.8 percent from 0.7 percent in September, the Statistics Office said. That was also the highest level in two years.
Energy prices remained the main drag on the headline figure, but they fell significantly less than in the previous months, a breakdown of the non-harmonized data showed.
In the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, prices for gasoline and diesel fuel rose on the year for the first time since February 2013, regional data showed.
In a sign that a housing shortage in some urban areas is pushing up living costs, rents rose more strongly in October than in the previous months, the pan-German data showed.
The surprisingly solid German data suggests that euro zone inflation, due on Monday, is likely to come in at 0.6 percent in October, McKeown said.
That would also be higher than expected: Economists polled by Reuters so far have predicted the euro zone inflation rate edged up to 0.5 percent from 0.4 percent in September.

The ECB expects the bloc-wide inflation figure to stay below its target of just under 2 percent for some time, despite its massive stimulus.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2016 09:17AM ET</span>",Exports boost U.S. growth in third quarter; consumer spending slows,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in two years in the third quarter as a surge in exports and a rebound in inventory investment offset a slowdown in consumer spending.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.9 percent annual rate after rising at a 1.4 percent pace in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its first estimate. 
That was the strongest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014 and beat economists' expectations for a 2.5 percent expansion pace. Business investment improved last quarter, though spending on equipment remained weak. 
Despite the moderation in consumer spending, the third-quarter rise in growth could help dispel any lingering fears the economy was at risk of stalling. Over the first half of the year, growth had averaged just 1.1 percent.
""This shows that the U.S. is roughly on track. It's a natural bounce back following a pretty underwhelming year so far,"" said Luke Bartholomew, fixed income investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. ""The election campaign has probably created a degree of uncertainty that has impacted growth."" Americans go to the polls on Nov. 8.
Though the Federal Reserve is mostly focused on employment and inflation, signs of economic strength would be supportive of an interest rate hike in December. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade.
The dollar rose to a three-month high against the yen on the report, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell. U.S. stock index futures were little changed.
Consumer spending still supported the economy in the third quarter, even as the pace slowed from the second quarter's robust 4.3 percent rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.1 percent rate. 
Spending was held back by a decline in purchases of goods which are not meant to last long. With a tightening labor market generating a steady increases in wages and strong household balance sheets, spending could accelerate in the fourth quarter. 
Data on Friday from the Labor Department showed labor costs rose 0.6 percent in the third quarter after a similar gain in the second quarter, leaving the year-on-year rate of increase at 2.3 percent. 
SOYBEANS POWER EXPORTS
A surge in soybean exports helped to shrink the trade deficit in the third quarter. Exports increased at a 10 percent rate, the biggest rise since the fourth quarter of 2013. 
As a result, trade contributed 0.83 percentage point to GDP growth after adding a mere 0.18 percentage point in the April-June quarter.
There are concerns that the soybean-driven export growth spurt could reverse in the fourth quarter. Economists, however, also note that exports of capital and consumer goods have been growing strongly in recent months. 
Businesses increased spending to restock after running down inventories in the second quarter. Businesses accumulated inventories at a $12.6 billion rate in the last quarter, contributing 0.61 percentage point to GDP growth.
Spending on nonresidential structures, which include oil and gas wells, increased at a 5.4 percent rate in the third quarter, the fastest pace since the second quarter of 2014, after falling at a 2.1 percent pace in the second quarter.
Business spending on equipment slipped at a 2.7 percent rate, dropping for a fourth straight quarter. While the pace of decline has been ebbing as oil prices stabilize and the dollar's rally gradually fades, a strong turnaround is unlikely in the near-term.
Heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) this week reported a 49 percent drop in third-quarter profit from a year ago and lowered its full-year revenue outlook for the second time this year. Caterpillar said demand for new heavy machinery had been undercut by an ""abundance"" of used construction equipment, a ""substantial"" number of idle locomotives and a ""significant"" number of idle mining trucks.

Investment in residential construction fell for a second straight quarter, while spending by the government bounced back.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6 percent after a similar gain in the second quarter, the Labor Department said on Friday. That left the year-on-year rate of increase at 2.3 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI rising 0.6 percent in the third quarter.
While the ECI costs have increased 0.6 percent every quarter this year, anecdotal evidence suggest wage growth has been picking up. The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book reported rising pressures in some parts of the country and certain sectors of the economy in September and early October.
Wage growth has been frustratingly slow, but there are hopes that tightening labor market conditions could unleash a faster pace of increases. Economists say labor costs need to rise by at least 3 percent to push inflation closer to the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target.
Labor costs increased 2.3 percent in the year to June.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation.
Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.5 percent in the third quarter. They increased 0.6 percent in the second quarter. Wages and salaries were up 2.4 percent in the 12 months through September.
That followed a 2.5 percent gain in the year to June.
Benefits for all workers increased 0.7 percent in the July-September quarter after rising 0.5 percent in the second quarter.

In a report, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said that GDP increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.9% in the three month period from July to September, from the 1.4% expansion registered in the second quarter of 2016. That was its largest expansion since the third quarter of 2014.
Analysts had expected GDP growth to increase to 2.5%.
However, real consumer spending increased by only 2.1% in the third quarter, missing expectations for a 2.6% advance, and much lower than the prior quarter’s 4.3% jump.
The GDP price index for its part rose 1.5% in the third quarter, compared to the prior reading of a 2.3% increase and forecasts for a 1.3% gain.
Immediately after the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0916 from around 1.0922 ahead of the publication; GBP/USD was at 1.2131 from 1.2147 earlier; while USD/JPY was at 105.45 from 105.36 earlier.

The Commission said the economic sentiment indicator rose to 106.3 in October from 104.9 in September, well above market expectations of a small decline to 104.8.
Separately, the business climate indicator also calculated by the Commission, rose to 0.55 from 0.44 in September, its highest reading since July 2011.
Selling price expectations among manufacturers rose sharply to 3.2 points in October from 0.0 in September and -0.8 in August, coming closer to the long-term average of 4.7.

Among consumers however, inflation expectations over the next 12 months remained subdued, easing to 4.3 in October from 4.7 in September and remaining well below the long-term average of 19.

Industrial production was expected to have risen 1.0 percent in September from the previous month, the Reuters poll of 20 analysts found, after a 1.3 percent rose in August.
""Factory output was probably supported by auto and IT production in July-September, but it is too early to say whether industrial production has started picking up - even if the September data is good,"" Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. ""We also need to see the manufacturers' forecast for October and November.""
He said an expected rise in factory output in the July-September period would be largely due to auto production recovering from April's earthquakes in southern Japan, and IT demand for smartphones. He advised caution because this type of boost may not last long.
The poll showed retail sales fell 1.8 percent in September from a year ago following a revised 2.2 percent drop in August, suggesting consumer spending stayed weak.

The trade ministry will announce September factory output with manufacturer's forecasts and retail sales at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (2350 GMT on Sunday).

Consensus expects the reading to show a significant strengthening from the second quarter’s 1.4% growth to a 2.5% expansion.
As recently as Wednesday, analysts had been notching up their forecasts for economic growth.
Goldman Sachs raised its estimate to 2.9% from the prior 2.7%, while Barclays increased its projection to 3.0% from 2.7% previously.
However, estimates published by regional Fed banks showed lower expectations.
The latest Atlanta Fed projection released on October 27 was at 2.1%, while the New York Fed’s forecast from October 21 was for 2.2% growth.
Fed officials have indicated that interest rates could rise in December if the economy remains on track.
The U.S. central bank holds its next two-day monetary policy meeting on November 1 and 2 with markets currently only pricing in the odds of a rate hike at 8.3%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fell for a seventh straight month and household spending slumped in September, endorsing the central bank's view it will take some time for inflation to accelerate to its 2 percent target as the economy stagnates.
While the sluggish indicators come as little surprise to policymakers, Friday's numbers add to a recent run of gloomy data that will keep the Bank of Japan under pressure to maintain an aggressive stimulus program.
That said, the central bank is likely to hold off on expanding stimulus at its board meeting next week, despite an expected downgrade in its price forecast that may show Governor Haruhiko Kuroda won't see inflation hit 2 percent before his tenure ends in 2018.
The nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, fell 0.5 percent in September from a year earlier, matching a median market forecast, government data showed.
An index stripping out the effect of energy and fresh food costs showed that inflation slowed for the third straight month to post flat growth in September - hit by weak spending and a strong yen's downward pressure on import prices.
""Companies are struggling to raise prices because consumption is weak,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The rise in household income remains modest and people aren't sure economic prospects will brighten ahead, prompting them to withhold spending.""
Households spent 2.1 percent less in September than a year earlier, marking the seventh straight month of declines, even as the jobless rate fell to 3.0 percent, separate data showed.
An increasing number of retailers are cutting prices in the face of sluggish consumption, casting doubt on the BOJ's view that a moderate economic recovery will prop up household spending and help push inflation toward its target.
McDonald's Holdings Japan (T:2702) launched a new discount lunch menu in September. Skylark Co (T:3197), which was among restaurant chain operators that raised prices in 2013, revamped 70 percent of its menus in June to attract customers seeking cheaper meals.
""An increasing number of companies are starting to feel that prices may not rise much ahead. That's affecting price-setting behavior - particularly among supermarkets,"" Atsushi Miyanoya, the BOJ's branch manager overseeing the Kinki western Japan region, told reporters earlier this month.

The BOJ has acknowledged that it will take time for inflation to accelerate to its 2 percent target and has revamped its policy framework to one better suited to a protracted battle against deflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. manufactured capital goods unexpectedly fell in September amid weak demand for computers and electronic products, which could temper expectations for an acceleration in business spending in the fourth quarter.
Despite the prolonged energy-driven weakness in manufacturing, the rest of the economy is in better shape. Other reports on Thursday showed a drop in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week and a jump in contracts to purchase previously owned homes in September.
""We are still seeing the effects of the downturn in energy production. The service industries continue to drive economic growth, that will probably remain the case through the rest of this year,"" said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 1.2 percent after three straight months of strong gains. 
These so-called core capital goods orders increased 1.2 percent in August. Economists had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.3 percent last month.
Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.3 percent after being unchanged in August. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
But those shipments still fell at a 4.4 annualized rate in the third quarter. That implies business spending on equipment likely remained weak in the third quarter. The government will publish its first estimate of third-quarter GDP on Friday. 
Growth estimates for the July-September period are currently as high as a 3.6 percent annualized rate, reflecting a solid pace of consumer spending and strong exports. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the second quarter.
TIGHTENING LABOR MARKET
The improving economic picture was underscored by a separate report on Thursday from the Labor Department showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreasing 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended Oct. 22. That marked 86 straight weeks that claims have been below the 300,000 threshold, which is normally associated with a strong job market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed last month, rose 1.5 percent. These contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's increase pointed to further gains in home resales, which surged 3.2 percent in September. 
The dollar was little changed by the data, while U.S. stocks were trading marginally lower. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, is struggling with the lingering effects of a strong dollar and sluggish overseas demand, which have cut into the profits of multinational corporations. Companies, especially in the energy sector, have responded by slashing capital spending budgets.
Though overall business spending rebounded modestly in the second quarter, investment on equipment has been subdued since late 2015. 
With the dollar's rally appearing to have peaked and oil and gas drilling activity rising in recent months, there is cautious optimism that the worst of the equipment spending rout is over. 
""The stronger trend in core capital goods orders suggests equipment spending could return to positive territory in the fourth quarter, but we do not expect a robust turnaround,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) this week reported a 49 percent drop in third-quarter profit from a year ago and lowered its full-year revenue outlook for the second time this year. 
Caterpillar said demand for new heavy machinery had been undercut by an ""abundance"" of used construction equipment, a ""substantial"" number of idle locomotives and a ""significant"" number of idle mining trucks.
A 44.8 percent plunge in demand for defense equipment pushed down overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, by 0.1 percent last month. That followed a 0.3 percent increase in August. 
There were also declines in orders for primary metals and fabricated metal products. Orders for machinery and electrical equipment, appliances and components rose last month.

Pointing to continued manufacturing weakness in the near-term, unfilled orders for durable goods fell for a fourth consecutive month in September, while inventories increased for a third straight month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy slowed only slightly in the three months after the Brexit vote and carmaker Nissan said it would build more cars in the country, tempering fears about the immediate economic impact of the decision to leave the European Union.
The stronger-than-expected growth figures published on Thursday further diminished the likelihood of the Bank of England cutting rates as soon as next week, prompting investors to sell British government bonds.
But finance minister Philip Hammond sounded cautious, saying he still planned to provide support for the economy as Britain launches tough negotiations with the EU next year.
""I think it is right that we still prepare to support the economy during the coming period to make sure that we get through this period of uncertainty,"" said Hammond, who is due to announce his first budget plans next month.
Official data showed the economy grew by 0.5 percent between July and September, less rapid than the strong growth of 0.7 percent seen in the second quarter but comfortably above a median forecast of 0.3 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
Sterling jumped to a one-week high against the U.S. dollar after the data and the yield on 10-year government bonds hit its highest level since the European Union membership referendum.
Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services, said the GDP data killed the chance of a rate cut on Nov. 3 and could also prompt the Bank's most stimulus-skeptical policymaker Kristin Forbes to call for an end to its bond-buying.
Britain's dominant services industries provided all the growth, helped by a boom in the film and television sector as the latest releases in the Jason Bourne and Star Trek series hit the screens in July along with other blockbusters.
Compared with the third quarter of last year, growth picked up to 2.3 percent, the strongest pace in more than a year, according to the preliminary figures from the ONS.
""COME CLEAN""
Brexit supporters said the figures backed their argument that warnings of a big hit to the economy from a Leave vote were little more than scaremongering.
Economists for Brexit, a group who disagree with the majority view in their profession that leaving the EU is damaging, said Britain's finance ministry ""must now come clean"" and admit that its long-term forecasting was likely to be wrong, just as its short-term forecasts were.
But many economists are still warning that the real challenge is yet to come. 
""The adverse consequences of the Brexit vote will become increasingly clear as inflation shoots up and firms postpone investment over the coming quarters,"" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics, who correctly predicted the quarterly growth rate in the Reuters poll.
The sharp fall in the value of the pound since June is expected to push inflation to around 3 percent next year. BoE Governor Mark Carney this week noted the ""fairly substantial"" fall in sterling, in a sign that the Bank was no longer expecting to cut rates on Nov. 3.
Many companies are expected to put investment plans on hold pending the outcome of the two-year process of negotiating Britain's exit from the EU and a possibly longer period for securing the terms of its new relationship with the bloc.
But Japanese carmaker Nissan gave Prime Minister Theresa May a boost by saying it will build its new Qashqai model in Britain. A source said on Thursday the government had offered support to counter any damage from leaving the EU.
The new investment in manufacturing came as the ONS data showed how reliant Britain has become on its services sector, which grew by 0.8 percent from the April-June period. 

By contrast, industrial production, including manufacturing, and construction both contracted, down 0.4 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. The fall in construction was the biggest since the third quarter of 2012.

Economists had estimated that orders for things built to last were flat in September, according to Bloomberg. Excluding transportation orders which are usually quite volatile, so-called core durable goods rose 0.2% as expected. 
The headline drop was due to a plunge in orders for defense aircraft and parts.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended Oct. 22, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
That marked 86 straight weeks that claims have been below the 300,000 threshold, which is normally associated with a strong job market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
Claims for the prior week were revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 255,000 in the latest week.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's data and that no states had been estimated.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,000 to 253,000 last week.
The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 15,000 to 2.04 million in the week ended Oct. 15, the lowest reading since June 2000.
The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims declined 6,250 to 2.05 million. That was the lowest level since July 2000. The continuing claims data covered the period of the household survey from which the unemployment rate is calculated.
The four-week average of continuing claims fell 64,500 between the September and October survey periods. That suggests the unemployment rate could fall this month from 5 percent in September.

Lending to companies grew by 1.9 percent year-on-year in September while household loans rose by 1.8 percent, keeping the steady but slow pace seen since the start of the summer
With the euro zone recovery remaining timid and plenty of risks at its doorstep, such as Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union, the ECB is nearly certain to continue buying bonds beyond its March target, sources have told Reuters.
Hoping to revive borrowing, spending and investment, the ECB has offered stimulus for years, cutting rates deep into negative territory, providing ultra cheap loans to banks and buying bonds worth over a trillion euros.
A key forward-looking indicator also counseled caution.
The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money circulating in the euro zone, which has in the past predicted economic activity, slowed to 5 percent, compared to economist expectations and an August reading of 5.1 percent.
M3 has been hovering around its current level since April 2015. 

An ECB survey showed last week euro zone banks are set to tighten access to corporate credit for the first time in two and a half years as they become more wary of risk and negative interest rates eat into their profit.

In a report, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product expanded by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in the three months ended September 30, above forecasts for growth of 0.3%. The U.K.’s economy grew by 0.7% in the preceding quarter.
Year-over-year, U.K. economic growth expanded 2.3% in the third quarter, also above the forecast for an expansion of 2.1%. The U.K. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.1% in the second quarter.
Additionally, the index of services in the U.K. rose 0.8%, in line with consensus expectations and after a prior gain of 0.6%.
The third quarter data is the first measure of growth after the U.K.’s June 23 referendum that resulted in Britain’s decision to leave the European Union (EU), known as a Brexit. 
The ONS indicated that there were few signs of a pronounced effect from the Brexit on the economy, but added that it was still too early to tell the effect of sterling depreciation on the data.
Immediately following the report, sterling initially reacted to the upside. GBP/USD was trading at 1.2257 from around 1.2240 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8904 from 0.8917 earlier and GBP/JPY changed hands at 128.30 compared to the prior 128.05.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2016 01:19AM ET</span>",China's slowing industrial profits show rising debt hampering economy,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profit growth in China's industrial firms slowed sharply as some key manufacturing sectors stumbled on weak activity and rising debt, suggesting the world's second-biggest economy remains underpowered despite emerging signs of stability.
The September data from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) underlined the daunting task facing policy makers as the nation's vast manufacturing industry grapples with slack demand, overcapacity and ballooning debt. 
Industrial sector profits last month rose 7.7 percent to 577.1 billion yuan, slowing markedly after surging 19.5 percent in August, NBS figures released on its website showed on Thursday. 
Earnings in industries such as electronics, steel and electricity were hit by a significant drop in growth, He Ping, a NBS official said in a note accompanying the data.
""Although industrial profits have got back on track with more stable growth, unfavorable factors still exist,"" He said, noting weak demand at both home and aboard, and delayed payments put a strain on firms' cash flow.
The official also cautioned about rising debt levels in the coal and steel sectors, stressing the importance of controlling debt risks as capacity cuts and structural reforms get implemented.
China's debt has soared to 250 percent of GDP and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) warned in September that a banking crisis was looming in the next three years.
Recent data showed some signs of stability, with annual economic growth of 6.7 percent in the third quarter matching the previous quarter, as increased government spending and a property boom offset stubbornly weak exports.
But the profits data suggest China's economy continues to face a host of challenges as authorities try to wean businesses off cheap credit-fueled growth, temper a surge in home prices and curb rising debt levels and shadow banking activity. 
""If you look at the structure of the economy, it's actually worsening because the growth of SOEs and public sector growth is relatively stronger, but private sector growth is much weaker. This shows the quality of the growth is deteriorating,"" said Yang Zhao, economist at Nomura.
OUTLOOK SUBDUED
Profits in electricity tumbled 23.2 percent on-year, as electricity prices were adjusted lower and revenue growth slowed. Earnings in general and special equipment manufacturing also turned negative, dropping 10.8 percent on-year.
Total profits for the first nine months stood at 4.64 trillion yuan ($684.77 billion), up 8.4 percent from the same period a year ago, the same pace as in the January to August period.
Industrial overcapacity, mainly in the traditional sectors, have been a drag on profits in recent months and analysts say the outlook for earnings in the sector could hinge on the progress made by policy makers to cut capacity. 
Beijing has embarked on a campaign to cut capacity in the coal and steel sectors in the economy's most significant transformation in two decades. 
The August profit growth - the fastest pace in three years - was helped by Beijing's splurge on infrastructure projects and a booming real estate industry and so was seen as unsustainable.
China's producer prices rose in September for the first time in nearly five years, thanks to higher commodity prices. 
""Profits were largely driven by a restoration in commodity prices such as coal and steel,"" David Qu, economist at ANZ said in Shanghai.
But Qu said the outlook for steel prices remain cloudy, as ""the tightening in the property market means potential demand could shrink."" .
Indeed, a subdued property market is expected to drag on growth in the first two quarters next year, as policy makers introduce curbs to cool home prices. 
""We are optimistic that stable growth will last through end of this year, because they have to finish the projects started earlier,"" said Merchants Securities economist Xie Yaxuan in Shenzhen.

""But property and its related industries will definitely affect growth in the first or second quarter next year,"" Xie said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales unexpectedly rose in September, pointing to sustained demand for housing even as data for the prior three months were revised lower.
Other reports on Wednesday suggested a stronger pickup in economic growth in the third quarter than is currently anticipated. The goods trade deficit narrowed sharply, while both wholesale and retail inventories increased in September.
""A lot of the pieces of the puzzle have come back together in a positive direction, with a pickup in the export of goods to the rest of the world and new home sales,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units last month, pulling them close to a nine-year high touched in July. However, the pace for the prior three months was revised down by a total of 85,000 units from previous estimates.
New home sales, which are derived from building permits, are volatile on a month-to-month basis and subject to large revisions. Sales increased 29.8 percent from a year ago.
Economists had forecast single-family home sales, which account for about 9.8 percent of overall home sales, falling to a rate of 600,000 units last month.
""The housing market may not be booming but it is clearly moving forward at a steady pace,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""But the big problem is still the lack of inventory. Builders are cautious and tend to do very little speculative construction.""
Despite the downward revisions, new home sales rose in the third quarter compared to the April-June period. Residential construction, however, likely remained a mild drag on gross domestic product for a second straight quarter.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP probably increased at a 2.5 percent rate in the third quarter, quickening from the second-quarter's tepid 1.4 percent pace.
But advance data on Wednesday showing the goods trade deficit falling 5.2 percent to $56.1 billion in September amid strong exports suggested that third-quarter GDP growth could exceed expectations.
In addition, wholesale inventories increased 0.2 percent in September and retail inventories rose 0.3 percent.
""Based on this morning's data, we now believe the boost from trade could be closer to a full percentage point, almost twice what we had expected,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
""Even assuming some offset in farm inventories, and possibly business investment, we now look for real GDP growth in the third quarter to have advanced by 3.3 percent.""
The government will publish its advance GDP growth estimate for the third quarter on Friday.
HOME BUILDING LAGGING
The broader PHLX housing index (HGX), which includes builders, building products and mortgage companies, was little changed in early afternoon trading. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), were slightly lower.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) rose 0.48 percent, while  Toll Brothers  (N:TOL) was flat.
Despite rising demand for housing, home building has been lagging, with builders complaining about land and labor shortages. Demand is being driven by rising wages as the labor market nears full employment, as well as by low mortgage rates.
""New home sales are still running ahead of single-family housing starts when inventories of new and existing homes for sale are already very lean,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
""This should support much better future homebuilding activity if homebuilders can overcome what they've described as supply-side constraints on activity from shortages of qualified labor and lots.""
Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for home loans for last week fell to their lowest level since January.
Last month, new single-family homes sales rose in the Northeast, the Midwest and South. They fell in the West.

The inventory of new homes on the market dipped 0.4 percent to 235,000 units. At September's sales pace it would take 4.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 4.9 months in August.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 54.8 in October, from the prior month’s reading of 52.3.
Analysts had expected the reading to remain unchanged.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
Markit noted that the increase in business activity in October accelerated at a robust pace, with new order volumes rising at the quickest rate this year.
Furthermore, the research group remarked that service providers reported the strongest level of business optimism since August 2015.
When combined with manufacturing activity, “the latest reading pointed to the sharpest expansion of private sector output since November 2015”, the report indicated.
“Taken together, the ‘flash’ PMIs suggest that the economy is growing at an annualized rate of around 2% at the start of the fourth quarter,” IHS Markit senior economist Tim Moore said.
On the downside, Moore noted that job creation remained relatively subdued in October, with firms reporting cautious hiring plans and efforts to alleviate pressures on margins.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's industrial production unexpectedly surged in September, raising the prospect of an upward revision to third-quarter gross domestic product, although the outlook remains clouded by sluggish global demand.
Manufacturing output rose 6.7 percent from a year earlier in September, data from the Singapore Economic Development Board showed on Wednesday. The median forecast in a Reuters survey was a rise of 0.6 percent year-on-year.
The 6.7 pct year-on-year rise in industrial production is the biggest annual expansion since March 2014 (when output rose about 12.2 percent).
""There's no doubt that there was a bit of an underestimation of Q3 GDP,"" said Vishnu Varathan, senior economist for Mizuho Bank. ""The more important question is, to what extent is this durable? Because if it's one and done, then yes arithmetically we do move Q3 (GDP) up but it doesn't do anything for the prospects ahead,"" he said.
On a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, factory output expanded 3.3 percent in September. The median forecast was a contraction of 2.6 percent month-on-month.
Solid increases in the output of electronics and pharmaceuticals helped lift overall production. Electronics output increasing 15.9 percent from a year earlier. Pharmaceuticals output jumped 26.9 percent after having slid 14.1 percent in both August and July.
Pharmaceuticals output tends to be a volatile data series, and can swing sharply from month to month.
Earlier this month, Singapore's central bank held policy steady despite a surprisingly sharp economic contraction in the third quarter.
""It does seem to justify their not-moving earlier this month. It does suggest that the growth was not falling off the cliff,"" said Brian Tan, an economist for Nomura.
""At least for the next six months there is some possibility of them keeping it unchanged,"" Tan said.
Nomura's base case is for the central bank to keep policy unchanged in April with a 30 percent chance of an easing by re-centering the Singapore dollar policy band lower.
Gross domestic product contracted 4.1 percent in the July-September quarter from the previous quarter on an annualized and seasonally adjusted basis, according to the government's advance estimate of third-quarter GDP released on Oct. 14.
The GDP data showed that manufacturing sector shrank 17.4 percent in the third quarter.
Mizuho Bank's Varathan said that third-quarter manufacturing performance might be revised to show a smaller contraction, of about 3.8 percent or so.
Unless there is an upward revision to services, however, third-quarter GDP will still probably still show a quarter-on-quarter contraction, Varathan said.
Updated third-quarter GDP data is expected to be released around late November.
Even with the jump in output in September, Singapore's industrial production has been sluggish this year, with total manufacturing output in January to September increasing just 0.7 percent from the same period a year ago.
Industrial production has been held back by lackluster exports, hit hard by depressed demand for offshore drilling rigs built by Singapore's rig-building industry as global oil prices slid over the past two years.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller report published on Tuesday said its 20-city index was up 5.1 percent, after a rise of 5.0 percent in the year to July. The national index has now almost recovered to the record high set in July 2006 before the financial crisis of 2008.
""All 20 cities saw prices higher than a year earlier with 10 enjoying larger annual gains than last month,"" David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said.
The acceleration in home price inflation comes after other signs the housing recovery is gaining strength.
Sales of existing U.S. homes increased 3.2 percent in September from August, but the number of homes for sale has fallen nearly 7.0 percent from a year ago, the National Association of Realtors said last week. Just 2.04 million existing homes were for sale in September.
Building of new single-family houses rose 8.1 percent in September, in data published earlier by the Commerce Department, although the annual rate of 783,000 starts remains well below the historical average of more than one million annual rate of new home building.
""Demand is high and enthusiasm for homeownership remains strong, especially among all-important young, minority and would-be first-time buyers,"" Svenja Gudell, chief economist at real estate data provider Zillow, said.
Case-Shiller's national index, after seasonal adjustment, rose 0.6 percent month-over-month in August, while the 10-city and 20-city indexes rose 0.2 percent.
Portland, Seattle and Denver reported the strongest year-over-year increases for the seventh month in a row, with gains of 11.7 percent, 11.4 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively, as buyers were forced out of the expensive Silicon Valley area in California.
After the financial crisis of 2008, home prices plunged 35 percent from their peak in July 2006 until they bottomed out in March 2012. They have since risen to just 7.2 percent below the peak.
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SLIPS
Consumers' perceptions of both current conditions and the six-month outlook dimmed in October, with the U.S. Conference Board's confidence index slipping to 98.6 in October, down from 103.5 in September.
Economists expected the index to hit 101.5 in October, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate.
The survey, a closely followed barometer of consumer attitudes, measures confidence toward business conditions, short-term outlook, personal finances and jobs.
""Consumer confidence retreated in October, after back-to-back monthly gains,"" said Lynn Franc, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board.
""Consumers' assessment of current business and employment conditions softened, while optimism regarding the short-term outlook retreated somewhat. However, consumers' expectations regarding their income prospects in the coming months were relatively unchanged.""
Monthly U.S. job growth slowed to an average 161,000 in August and September after gains in the previous two months and is averaging 178,000 this year, down from 229,000 in 2015.
However, unemployment remained low at 5.0 percent in September.
The Conference Board report also said the present situation index, which measures overall consumer sentiments toward the present economic situation, decreased to 120.6 from 127.9 in the prior month. The Expectations Index, which measures sentiments for the next 6-months, declined to 83.9 from 87.2 in September.

The number of people registered as out of work in mainland France fell by 66,300 in September, more than erasing a huge surge in August by 50,200.
The drop, down 1.9 percent over one month and 1.7 percent over one year, trimmed the jobless total to 3,490,500, bringing it below 3.5 million for the first time since January 2015.
The improvement offers Hollande a bit of relief on a front where he otherwise has made little progress since taking office in 2012, despite pledges to not run for a second term unless he steered unemployment onto a convincingly downward path.
The jobless total is still 569,000 higher than when he was elected in May 2012.
Hollande has dropped strong hints he might run for re-election in next April's president vote although polls show he would lag behind nearly all other well-known candidates.

A Cevipof poll released on Tuesday indicated that his popularity had hit four percent following the publication of a book last week by two journalists telling how he disparaged judges and some ministers in a dozens of frank interviews.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2016 11:30AM ET</span>",German business climate hits two-and-a-half year high in October,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale improved unexpectedly in October, hitting its highest level in 2-1/2 years, suggesting company executives have become more optimistic about growth prospects for Europe's largest economy.
The surprisingly strong business climate index, published on Tuesday by the Munich-based Ifo institute, gave a further boost to hopes that a widely expected slowdown of the German economy could be less severe than feared.
""The upturn in the German economy is gathering impetus,"" Ifo head Clemens Fuest said, though a separate survey forecast a squeeze on German exports and domestic growth from Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
The Cologne Institute for Economic Research said it saw German exports to Britain falling by 6 percent next year due to the weakness of the pound following Britain's Brexit vote.
Britain is a major market for German companies, accounting for around 7 percent of exports overall. Weaker shipments to the UK and other Brexit-related risks would cost the German economy 0.25 percentage points of growth in 2017, the institute said.
Ifo's business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 110.5 in October from 109.5 the month before.
It was the highest reading since April 2014 and was stronger than the Reuters consensus forecast for an unchanged value.
The data helped Germany's DAX top-30 index (GDAXI) to touch a new 2016 peak of 10,827.72 points shortly after its release.
GOOD PERFORMANCE
""These are very good figures. The German economy is again significantly stronger, which is mainly due to an upturn in the manufacturing sector,"" Sal. Oppenheim economist Ulrike Kastens said. ""It looks like we'll see a good year-end performance.""
Company bosses were more content with their current business situation and were far more optimistic about the coming six months.
The rise was driven by improved sentiment in the manufacturing and construction sectors, while the climate in wholesaling and retailing deteriorated slightly.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters company executives had taken account of Britain's vote to leave the EU, while positive signals from China and the United States were pleasing exporters.
Wohlrabe added that an impasse over a trade deal between the European Union and Canada - which has not been signed because of opposition from the Wallonia region of Belgium - was not putting a dampener on the German economy.
Helaba economist Ralf Umlauf said: ""Business sentiment is solid overall and worries about lengthy and difficult Brexit negotiations also don't seem to be a burden anymore ... The economic momentum is likely to continue in the final quarter.""
The German economy is expected to lose steam in the third quarter, after relatively strong growth rates of 0.7 percent in the first and 0.4 percent in the second.
For 2016 as a whole, the government expects the economy to grow by 1.8 percent, which would be the strongest rate in five years, helped by soaring private consumption and higher state spending.
For 2017, Berlin predicts a growth rate of 1.4 percent. Adjusted for the number of work days, the slowdown is expected to be less severe, with a predicted expansion rate of 1.6 percent.

In a report, the Conference Board, a market research group, said its index of consumer confidence fell to 98.6 this month from a reading of 103.5 in September, whose figure was revised from a previously reported 104.1.
Analysts had expected the index to drop to 101.0 in September.
The Present Situation Index decreased from 127.9 to 120.6, while the Expectations Index declined from 87.2 last month to 83.9.
“Consumers’ assessment of current business and employment conditions softened, while optimism regarding the short-term outlook retreated somewhat,” Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said.
“However, consumers’ expectations regarding their income prospects in the coming months were relatively unchanged,” Franco noted, adding that “overall, sentiment is that the economy will continue to expand in the near-term, but at a moderate pace.”
The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a probability-design random sample, is conducted for The Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch. The cutoff date for the preliminary results was October 13.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Construction spending in New York City is on track this year to surpass the record set just before the financial crisis as an all-time high in city jobs drives strong demand for new housing and office space, an industry association said on Tuesday.
The New York Building Congress forecast construction spending this year will reach $43.1 billion, a 26 percent increase from 2015 and the first time the metric will have eclipsed the $40 billion mark in the city.
The association projected spending of $42.1 billion in 2017 and $42.3 billion the year after as the biggest building boom since the 1980s changes the skyline in downtown Manhattan, its far West Side and in Long Island City across the East River.
New York City employment has grown 18 percent since late 2009, the strongest pace in decades, as seasonally adjusted nonfarm employment rose to a record 4.3 million jobs in September, according to the state's Department of Labor.
Growth in private sector jobs increased 2.3 percent in the city, faster than the U.S. average of 1.9 percent, as millennials seek to live, work and play in urban environments.
On an inflation-adjusted basis, this year's projected spending on residential and non-residential buildings is 47 percent greater than 2007, the previous peak when $31.1 billion was spent on city construction, the association said.
However, after-inflation government spending on infrastructure is expected to be 39 percent less than 2007, a sign the current boom is being driven more by the private sector than the previous surge when spending was split almost evenly.
Almost a dozen marquee office buildings will be completed or be under construction in Manhattan by 2018, including five towers in or nearby the mammoth Hudson Yards project on the far West Side, 3 World Trade Center downtown and One Vanderbilt adjacent to Grand Central Terminal in Midtown.
Global capital is increasingly looking to New York real estate for investment returns, which poses a double-edged sword, said Jesse M. Keenan, a faculty member at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University. 
While softening the economic cycle's downside, the capital flowing to New York also forces domestic returns lower.

It remains to be seen whether this money can diversify asset classes to repair decaying infrastructure, house the elderly and poor, or prevent the exodus of highly productive mid-career workers who cannot afford to raise families in the city, he said.

228,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 24, 2016 09:46AM ET</span>", U.S. manufacturing PMI unexpectedly rises in October - Markit,"Investing.com – Activity in the US manufacturing sector registered a surprise increase in September, according to preliminary data released on Monday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 53.2 in October from the prior month’s final reading of 51.5.
Analysts had expected no change to September’s reading.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit noted that the data showed the strongest upturn in business conditions for 12 months and that both output and new order growth hit one-year peaks.
The market research group added that manufacturers had reported the fastest expansion of input buying since June 2015 and that input cost inflation had accelerated to its strongest in almost two years.
“Manufacturing showed further signs of pulling out of the malaise seen earlier in the year, starting the fourth quarter on a solid footing,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson commented.
“Both output and new orders are rising at the fastest rates for a year amid increasingly widespread optimism that demand will pick up again after the presidential election, which has been commonly cited as a key factor that has subdued spending and investment in recent months,” he said.
Williamson further noted that there were signs of manufacturers building inventories which should provide an extra boost to the economy in the fourth quarter.
“Weak export growth, attributable to the strong dollar, and lackluster hiring remain big areas of disappointment, and highlight an ongoing dependency on domestic demand and a need to keep labor costs low amid a still-uncertain economic and political outlook,” Williamson concluded.
In an immediate reaction, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0890 from around 1.0894 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2233 from 1.2234 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 104.08, compared to the prior 103.97.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2016 09:33AM ET</span>","Russia seen cutting interest rates in first-quarter, holding for now","By Elena Fabrichnaya and Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank will cut its main lending rate in the first quarter of 2017, but keep it unchanged at 10 percent on Friday, a Reuters poll of analysts predicted.
Struggling to tame inflation, the central bank has cut the key rate only twice this year despite a need for cheaper lending to kick start a sluggish economy. The central bank said last month it would only consider a rate cut in 2017.
Seventeen of 25 economists polled by Reuters said on Monday they expected the central bank to cut its key rate in the first quarter of next year from its current level of 10 percent. 
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said the central bank would need to strike the right balance between the impact of higher oil prices, a recent recovery in consumer demand indicators, and recent fiscal policy. 
""We believe the central bank is going to play down the sustainability of the recent recovery in oil prices while focusing more on the latter two factors as a significant risk to its 4 percent inflation target in 2017,"" said Alexey Pogorelov, an economist at Credit Suisse.
Fiscal planning has been in focus at a time when the country is trying to curb the budget deficit amid low oil prices. Russia is trying to avoid having to spend 1 trillion rubles ($16.06 billion) from its Reserve Fund to plug holes in the budget. 
Greater budget spending could spur inflation, which the central bank has been trying to rein in for years. The central bank warned last week that there was still a risk that inflation might not fall to its 4 percent target by the end of next year.
""The press release is likely to retain a hawkish tone,"" said Vladimir Tsibanov, a strategist at Sberbank CIB.
Inflation is on track to hit a post-Soviet low of less than 6 percent this year. If and when inflation hits the 4 percent target, the central bank will cut its key rate to 6-7 percent, Elvira Nabiullina, the bank's governor, said earlier this month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity in the euro zone has expanded at the fastest pace this year so far in October, as a buoyant Germany offset the impact from firms raising prices at the sharpest rate in more than five years, a survey showed.
The upturn in both activity and prices will make welcome reading for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who left their ultra-loose policy unchanged last Thursday but kept the door open to more stimulus in December.
IHS Markit's euro zone flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good overall growth indicator, jumped to 53.7 from September's 52.6. 
It was far above the 50 point line indicating growth in activity and smashed even the highest forecast in a Reuters poll of economists which had predicted a more modest rise to 52.8.
""Good PMI news as the composite index rose to its highest level since December of last year, driven by both manufacturing and services. Higher input prices are filtering through to output prices,"" Holger Sandte at Nordea said.
However, although Germany's economy outperformed expectations, France's overall private sector activity expanded at a slower pace due to weaker than forecast service sector business.
Germany's composite PMI was also its highest this year, indicating Europe's largest economy is performing well at the start of the fourth quarter after losing momentum in the previous two months.
IHS Markit said, if maintained, the PMI pointed to 0.4 percent euro zone growth in the current quarter, although added there were upside risks to that prediction. A Reuters poll last week predicted a more modest growth rate of 0.3 percent. [ECILT/EU]
Despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy, inflation is nowhere near the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling - it was just 0.4 percent in September - so evidence of rising prices could dampen expectations the ECB extends its massive asset-buying program.
A Reuters poll predicted the ECB would tweak its asset purchase program and announce an extension by year end.
It has already spent over a trillion euros buying government bonds, cut its refinancing rate to zero and adopted a negative deposit rate, besides giving billions of euros in essentially free loans to commercial banks to lend on to customers.
""The ECB will still need to do more to bring inflation back towards its target on a sustained basis across the euro zone,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.
A subindex measuring output prices rose to 50.5 from 50.0, its highest since August 2011, but still suggesting relatively weak inflationary pressures.
The bloc's dominant service industry also performed much better than expected. Its PMI came in at a nine-month high of 53.5, ahead of September's 52.2 and beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll where the median call was for 52.4.
New business growth picked up sharply, suggesting the overall acceleration could continue into November. The index registered 53.2, up from 52.5.
Manufacturers followed the same trend. The factory PMI climbed to a 30-month high of 53.3, above the poll median and September's 52.6, while the output index, which feeds into the composite PMI, jumped to 54.4 from 53.8.

Highlighting the confidence about the coming months amongst manufacturers, they increased headcount at the fastest rate since May 2011. The employment subindex was 53.7 compared to September's 52.1.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors increased to 53.7 October, from the prior month’s reading of 52.6 and above forecasts for an increase to 52.8. That was the highest reading since December 2015.
The flash services purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.5 this month, from September’s final reading of 52.2, beating expectations for a reading of 52.4.
The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index unexpectedly rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.3 this month from a final reading of 52.6 in August.
Analysts had expected the index to remain steady at 52.6 in October.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said, ““The euro zone economy showed renewed signs of life at the start of the fourth quarter, enjoying its strongest expansion so far this year with the promise of more to come.”
“With backlogs of work accumulating at the fastest rate for over five years, business activity growth and hiring look set to accelerate further as we head towards the end of the year,” he said.
Williamson said that the data suggested that the euro zone economy was growing at a quarterly rate of 0.4% at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
“Policymakers will be encouraged by signs of both stronger economic growth and rising price pressures, and the prospect of a robust fourth quarter will fuel further speculation of a possible tapering of QE purchases by the ECB,” Williamson added.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Immediately following the report, the euro continued trading near seven-month lows. EUR/USD was at 1.0886 from around 1.0890 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8893 from 0.8899 earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell for a 12th straight month in September from a year earlier, official data showed, as the yen's gains undermined export prices, but rising shipment volumes pointed to a tentative pick-up in global demand.
Ministry of Finance data issued on Monday showed Japan's exports fell 6.9 percent in September from a year earlier, following a 9.6 percent decline in August, dragged down by U.S.-bound shipments of cars, China-bound shipments of electronics parts and exports of steel.
The result is a little less gloomy than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a 10.4 percent fall as the yen's 16 percent gains versus the dollar from a year earlier hurt the value of exports.
In terms of volume, exports rose 4.7 percent in the year to September, the fastest gain in nearly two years and rising for a second straight month, the data showed.
""It's a positive sign that export volume grew after having been more or less flat until recently,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
Analysts say net exports probably contributed to Japan's July-September GDP expansion, reflecting declines in imports, although weak overseas demand shaved 0.3 percentage points off second-quarter growth. 
Asian demand for iPhone-related electronics parts, and car sales in Europe recovering from a slump caused by the euro zone debt crisis, helped increase Japanese export volumes.
While these possibly temporary factors may help boost sales in the short run, the Japanese export engine would still lack strength given lackluster capital spending around the world, Tokuda said.
In a further positive sign, Japanese manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in nine months as new orders rose, with the Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rising to a seasonally adjusted 51.7 in October.
New data will be closely scrutinized by the Bank of Japan at its Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, where it issues new economic and price forecasts. The central bank is expected to hold off from expanding stimulus after having just revamped its policy framework last month, sources say.
By destination, the MOF data showed the value of exports to China - Japan's largest trading partner - fell 10.6 percent in September from a year earlier, marking the seventh straight month of annual declines.
Shipments to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japanese exports, fell 8.4 percent, posting the 13th straight month of falls.

U.S.-bound exports fell 8.7 percent, posting a seventh straight declining month, while exports to the European Union rose 0.7 percent, the first increase in five months.

The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 51.7 in October from a final 50.4 in the previous month.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the second month and showed that activity expanded at the fastest since January.
The index for new orders rose to a preliminary 51.3 from 49.6 in the previous month, marking the first expansion in nine months.
The flash index for new export orders rose to 53.1 from a final 51.1 in September, indicating the second consecutive month of growth.
Government data on exports and household spending suggest Japan's economic growth was subdued in July-September, so the PMI survey could point to an acceleration in growth in October-December.

Japan's economic growth has been lacklustre for much of this year as consumer spending and exports largely undershot economists' expectations.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are forecast to drop more than 7 percent in October from the same period in 2015, the sixth monthly decline so far this year, as automakers offer steep discounts and adjust production to manage inventories, J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Friday.
The two auto industry consultants said October U.S. new vehicle sales will number 1.347 million, down 7.3 percent from 1.453 million units a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for October will be 17.7 million vehicles, down from 18.1 million on the same basis a year earlier. This October has two fewer auto sales days than October of 2015.
The U.S. auto industry has experienced several years of robust sales and has not experienced six months of declines since before the Great Recession.
""Although automotive sales are expected to remain near the all-time high, they are still expected to contract slightly this year, as well as in 2017,"" Jeff Schuster, LMC Automotive's senior vice president of forecasting said in a statement. 
He said that over the rest of this year and 2017, nearly a third of all vehicles in the market will either be new models or redesigned versions, which ""will test the discipline of the industry for the first time since 2009."" 
""So far, automakers are adjusting production levels to manage inventory,"" Schuster said.
As the market shrinks, automakers are hiking incentives to entice consumers to spend. October industry incentive spending fell short of September's record high of $3,921 per vehicle, but at $3,726 per unit, was still 12 percent higher than in October 2015.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales surged in September after two straight months of declines as first-time buyers stepped into the market, pointing to underlying momentum in the economy.
While other data on Thursday showed a bigger-than-expected increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week, the trend continued to suggest that the labor market remains strong. Labor market strength is one of the key factors underpinning the housing market.
""Today's reports reaffirm that the jobs and housing markets are moving in the right direction. That's important because the jobs and housing markets are going to be critical to supporting growth in 2017,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 3.2 percent to an annual rate of 5.47 million units. That was well above economists' expectations for an increase to a 5.35 million-unit pace. 
First-time buyers accounted for 34 percent of transactions last month, the largest share since July 2012. Still, the share remains well below the 40 percent to 45 percent that economists and realtors say is required for a robust housing market. 
September's strong home sales report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing a jump in single-family housing starts and overall building permits in September. 
The upbeat housing data added to reports on manufacturing and auto sales in suggesting that economic growth picked up in the third quarter after a lackluster performance in the first half of the year. Third-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are as high as a 2.6 percent annual rate.
But with the supply of houses available for sale remaining low, the rising demand for housing will probably push up prices and constrain future sales.
The PHLX housing index fell (HGX), in line with a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI) dropped 1.6 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) fell 1.33 percent. 
The dollar rose to a seven-month high against a basket of currencies after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the ECB did not discuss ending bond purchases at its latest meeting. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were higher.
SUPPLY CONSTRAINT
The increase in existing home sales last month was broad-based, even as housing inventory remained tight. There were 2.04 million previously owned homes on the market, up 1.5 percent from August, but down 6.8 percent from a year ago.
With supply constrained, house prices continue to rise. That is boosting profits for homebuilders and encouraging them to ramp up construction. PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM), the No.3 U.S. homebuilder, reported on Thursday a 19.2 percent jump in quarterly profit.
The median price of a previously owned home increased 5.6 percent from a year ago to $234,200 last month. At September's sales pace, it would take 4.5 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, well below the six-month supply that is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
Separately, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 260,000 for the week ended Oct. 15. That marked 85 straight weeks of claims below the 300,000 threshold normally associated with a strong jobs market, the longest such period since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 250,000 in the latest week. 
Part of the increase in claims last week could be related to the effects of Hurricane Matthew, which lashed the Southeast of the country, causing severe flooding. The storm could have left some people temporarily out of work. 
""It is possible that Hurricane Matthew contributed to the latest increase in claims, but it does not look like this is the only factor causing the recent disappointment,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Unadjusted claims for North Carolina increased 2,520 last week. Outside the storm-affected states, there were hefty gains in unadjusted claims for Michigan, Kentucky and California.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 251,750 last week.

The claims data covered the survey week for October's nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 6,500 between the September and October survey periods, suggesting another month of solid employment growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales rose more than expected in September, boosted by a firming labor market that is helping buyers overcome a fast increase in prices and a national shortage in inventory.
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday existing home sales rose 3.2 percent to an annual rate of 5.47 million units, the quickest pace since June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rising to a 5.35 million-unit pace.
August's sales pace was also revised slightly lower to 5.30 million units.
The housing market has been strengthening on the back of healthy job gains, which have helped pull back into the labor force workers who had grown discouraged following the 2007-09 recession.
Wages gains have also shown signs of accelerating, although not enough to keep up with home price growth.
The increase in existing home sales was broad-based across four major regions tracked by the NAR, with gains reported in the Northeast, Midwest, South and West.
Inventories remained tight, with 2.04 million homes on the market. That was up 1.5 percent from the prior month, but 6.8 percent lower than in September 2015. The dearth of available homes for sale helped push prices higher, with the median price up 5.6 percent from a year ago to $234,200 last month.
Earlier this week, data showed construction of U.S. single-family housing surged in September, though a drop in apartment building pushed overall home building activity to an 18-month low.

At September's sales pace, it would take 4.5 months to clear the stock of houses on the market. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

255,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2016 10:09AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales rise more than expected in September,"Investing.com – U.S. existing home sales rose more than expected in September, bolstering optimism over the health of the housing market, according to a report released on Thursday by the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
The industry data showed that home resales increased 3.2% in September to a seasonally adjusted 5.47 million units from the 5.30 million units in August. The prior month’s data was revised from an initial reading of 5.33 million units.
The consensus forecast was for a 0.4% advance to 5.35 million units.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
Furthermore, the report revealed that the median existing-home price for all housing types in September was $234,200, up 5.6% a year ago ($221,700). 
September's price increase marks the 55th consecutive month of year-over-year gains, according to NAR.
NAR noted that the September reading was a strong rebound which was “propelled by sales from first-time buyers reaching a 34% share, which is a high not seen in over four years.”
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said the two-month slump in existing sales reversed course convincingly in September.
""The home search over the past several months for a lot of prospective buyers, and especially for first-time buyers, took longer than usual because of the competition for the minimal amount of homes for sale,"" he said.
Yun explained that most families and move-up buyers looked to close before the new school year starts.
“Their diminishing presence from the market towards the end of summer created more opportunities for aspiring first-time homeowners to buy last month, Yun"""

Per capita disposable income in China rose 6.3 percent year-on-year in the January to September period to 17,735 yuan ($2,6314), data from the statistics bureau show, down from 6.5 percent growth in the first half of the year and the slowest since 2013, the year in which the data was first released. Incomes rose 7.7 percent a year ago. 
Maintaining strong per capita income growth faces increasing difficulty, a National Statistics Bureau (NBS) official wrote in a commentary on Thursday, with special attention needed for migrant workers and employees displaced by the state-ordered closure of excess production capacity.
Indeed, migrant workers' incomes rose only 5.9 percent in the first nine months of the year, with momentum for future growth looking weak.
""Related departments and regions should step up work to ensure basic necessities and re-employment for those that have lost jobs, in order to lessen the negative impact of industrial restructuring on incomes,"" wrote NBS official Wang Pingping.
NBS spokesman Sheng Laiyun acknowledged there is some pressure from slowing income growth, citing already high migrant worker wages and falling prices of farm products, which hurt farmers' earnings. 
""The government is looking for ways to stabilize growth in household incomes,"" Sheng told reporters at a briefing.
REAL ESTATE STRONG, FINANCIALS AND CONSTRUCTION WEAK
A breakdown in economic growth by industry issued on Thursday highlighted a relatively strong consumer and services sector, but also found new weakness in other areas. 
China reported on Wednesday that its economy expanded by 6.7 percent in the third quarter, in line with expectations, with over 70 percent of growth coming from consumption. 
Growth in the retail and wholesale sector accelerated to 7.0 percent for July-Sept from 6.5 percent in the second quarter as China's consumers kept spending, Thursday's data showed. 
China's red-hot property market grew 8.8 percent in the third quarter, unchanged from the second quarter. The real estate sector was the fastest growing segment of the economy, along with ""other services"", which also grew 8.8 percent. Other services includes many consumer services such as media and education, but also scientific research, social services and utilities. 
Economists believe the greatest near-term risk for China is a possible correction in the high-flying property market, which accounts for about 15 percent of GDP, as more than 20 cities have introduced measures to restrict home purchases after prices this year skyrocketed in many markets - especially top-tier cities. 
The financial industry grew 5.6 percent in the third quarter, faster than 5.3 percent in the second quarter but slower than some analysts had expected considering the low base created by a market crash in the year-ago period.
""(Financial services) is lower than what I expected, a downside surprise. It doesn't seem to be consistent with the stock market performance in the third quarter, which seemed to recover,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief Greater China economist for ANZ in Hong Kong. 
Growth in the construction sector also slowed in the third quarter, to 6.0 percent from 7.3 percent in the second quarter, as new housing starts fell 19.4 percent in September. 
A weaker property market, along with slower auto sales after a tax incentive expires this year, present the biggest challenges to growth, says JP Morgan chief China economist Haibin Zhu. 
""Growth momentum is still trending downwards - the fourth quarter will be even weaker. If the government wants to stick to the 6.5 percent growth target, 2017 will be more challenging,"" Zhu said in an interview.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil cut interest rates for the first time in four years on Wednesday, opting for a modest 25 basis-point reduction to launch an easing cycle aimed at pulling Latin America's biggest economy out of its worst recession in over a century.
The central bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, voted unanimously to cut its benchmark Selic rate to 14 percent, signaling it will proceed with a ""moderate and gradual"" easing cycle.
However, the bank said in its post-decision statement that it could opt for steeper cuts in the future if the pace of disinflation accelerates and Congress presses ahead with the approval of austerity measures.
""The magnitude of monetary easing and a possible speeding up of its pace will depend on a favorable evolution of factors that allow greater confidence on meeting the inflation targets at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy,"" the bank said.
Lower rates will help President Michel Temer in his effort to strengthen a recovery that remains elusive with high unemployment as well as dwindling industrial and service activity frustrating hopes of a rebound later this year.
For some analysts, the central bank is signaling a longer and more aggressive rate-cutting cycle is on the horizon.
""We believe the central bank will have enough elements to step up the pace of easing to 50 basis points at its next meeting despite the caution expressed today,"" economists with Sao Paulo-based Haitong said in a research note.
An overwhelming majority of analysts expected a rate cut, with many of them betting on a more aggressive 50-basis-point move.
In its statement, the bank said it forecast inflation at 4.3 percent in 2017 and 3.9 percent in 2018, but acknowledged private estimates remain above the 4.5 percent center of the official target for both years. Annual inflation currently stands at 8.48 percent.
Stubbornly high inflation forced the central bank to hold the Selic steady for the past year at one of the highest rates among the group of G20 industrialized economies.
However, a recent slowdown in inflation and the initial approval of a key austerity proposal in Congress gave the central bank's new governor Ilan Goldfajn enough arguments to cut borrowing costs.
The easing cycle could take the Selic below 10 percent by as early as late 2017, some analysts said. The last time Brazil had a single-digit benchmark rate was in 2013.
CONFIDENCE ON THE RISE
That prospect could lift the spirits of investors in an economy battered by months of political upheaval that led to the ouster of Temer's leftist predecessor Dilma Rousseff earlier this year.
For over a year businesses and politicians have demanded a rate cut to avoid stifling recovery during a second year of recession.
Lower borrowing costs could further lift confidence that has climbed steadily since Temer took office in May with a pro-business agenda.
The recovery, however, remains tentative with high unemployment and falling activity.
Service activity dropped by 3.9 percent in August from the same month last year, official data showed on Wednesday, a sharper fall than expected in the latest sign the recovery could be slow.
Economists in a global Reuters poll on Tuesday projected Brazil's economy would only resume growth on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter of 2017. [ECILT/LTAM]

Although the Selic is the financial sector benchmark rate, Brazil's new administration is calling on private banks to reduce the rate differential that they charge their clients. Some banks demand rates of up to 40 percent more than the Selic.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2016 03:21PM ET</span>","U.S. single-family house building jumps in September, building permits up also","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The construction of U.S. single-family housing surged in September, though a drop in apartment building pushed overall home building activity to an 18 month low.
But Wednesday's report from the U.S. Commerce Department also showed building permits jumping last month, suggesting overall residential construction may rise again in the fourth quarter.
In its Beige Book report also published on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve struck an upbeat note on the housing market, saying residential real estate activity expanded in most districts in recent weeks. 
""Home construction is in decent shape, despite the volatility in the multi-family segment,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Activity is growing in the key single-family segment and permit requests are strong.""
Single-family housing starts, which account for the largest share of the residential housing market, jumped 8.1 percent to a 783,000-unit pace last month. That was the highest level since February. 
Low U.S. unemployment, slowly rising wages, and low mortgage rates are underpinning demand for housing. Single-family starts are also getting a boost from a chronic shortage of existing homes available for sale.
Overall groundbreaking activity, however, declined 9.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.05 million units last month, the lowest level since March 2015. It was dragged down by starts for the volatile multi-family segment, which plunged 38.0 percent to a 264,000-unit pace in September.
Starts for multi-family buildings with five or more units crumbled to their lowest level since June 2013. But with rents rising at their fastest pace in 10 years amid strong demand, September's drop in groundbreaking activity could be temporary.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on business activity nationwide published on Wednesday also noted real estate activity expanded in September and early October.
The U.S. central bank said some evidence suggested optimism about future growth, though shortages of skilled labor remained a constraint on construction activity in some districts.
The PHLX index of shares in U.S. house building companies (HGX) was little changed on the day, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), rose 0.95 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) gained 0.19 percent. 
ROBUST PERMIT INCREASES
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast overall housing starts rising to a 1.18 million-unit pace in September. Last month's decline left overall housing starts in the third quarter well below their average for the second quarter. 
That suggests residential construction remained a drag on gross domestic product in the third quarter after subtracting from output in the April-June period. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates that GDP increased at a 2.0 percent annual rate in the third quarter after rising at a 1.4 percent pace in the second quarter. 
Overall home building activity is likely to rebound in the coming months, as permits for future construction surged 6.3 percent in September to their highest level since last November. Single-family permits rose 0.4 percent last month. 
Permit issuance for multi-family buildings with five or more units soared 17.2 percent to a 10-month high.
""Permits are outpacing starts, which indicates that developers and builders are finally planning for more growth ahead. That's great news for both the economy and the consumer,"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at realtor.com in Washington. 
""A persistent lack of growth in new construction has given us low vacancies in rentals and very low inventories of homes for sale. That has produced above-average increases in rents and prices, but today's data is a good sign that we could be turning the page on this troubling scenario.""
Last month, single-family home construction jumped 20 percent in the Northeast. Starts in the South, which accounts for the bulk of home building, vaulted 12.1 percent. 

Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects shot up 6.3 percent in the Midwest, but fell 2.2 percent in the West.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy expanded at a steady 6.7 percent in the third quarter and looks set to hit Beijing's full-year target, fueled by stronger government spending, record bank lending and a red-hot property market that are adding to its growing pile of debt.
Wednesday's data painted a picture of an economy that is slowly stabilizing but increasingly dependent on government spending and a housing boom for growth, as private investment and exports remain stubbornly weak.
Some economists believe Beijing has had to ""double down"" on stimulus this year to meet its official growth range of 6.5 to 7 percent, and say the government's obsession with meeting hard targets may hurt both planned reforms and the long-term health of the world's second-largest economy.
""So far this year they have clearly chosen to do everything they can to meet the growth targets, and now there is a little bit of an upward surprise from the housing market which actually will help them with GDP growth this year,"" said Louis Kuijs, head Of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
""The question really is, is the leadership willing to move to somewhat lower growth targets in order to put growth on a more sustainable footing, or will it feel obliged to continue to hang on to those very high growth targets.""
The economy grew at the same clip in the third quarter year-on-year as in the first and second quarters, as analysts polled by Reuters had expected. Government infrastructure projects and the property boom have spurred prices and demand for raw materials and goods from cement and steel to furniture.
On a quarterly basis, it grew 1.8 percent, again in line with expectations but easing slightly from the previous period.
PROPERTY MARKET BIGGEST RISK FOR NOW
Economists believe the greatest near-term risk for China is a possible correction in the high-flying property market, which accounts for about 15 percent of GDP.
Real estate investment accelerated in September and home sales soared, highlighting persistent investor demand even as more cities tighten measures to curb prices.
Property investment growth ticked up to 7.8 percent in September on-year, and property sales surged 34 percent, though new construction starts fell 19.4 percent, suggesting sentiment among builders may be shifting as the government looks to cool the buying frenzy.
A wave of restrictions imposed on buyers in major cities since early October has resulted in a sharp drop in sales and authorities are stepping up pressure on speculators.
Shanghai said on Tuesday it had punished some property agencies for falsifying contracts and had launched probes into some developers suspected of raising prices without authorization.
Most economists do not expect house prices to collapse, arguing the market is supported by steady migration to bigger cities, but memories are still fresh of authorities' heavy-handed attempt to cool surging stock markets last year, which triggered a crash and an unprecedented government rescue.
The property craze has also heightened concerns about China's growing debt and the risks to its financial system, as much of the record loan growth has been driven by mortgages.
China's debt has soared to 250 percent of GDP and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) warned in September that a banking crisis was looming in the next three years.
""We think that the cooling measures in property market will weigh on China's economy over the coming quarters,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Zhou Hao in Hong Kong said in a note.
But statistics bureau spokesman Sheng Laiyun said ""the impact (of property adjustment measures) on the economy will not be very big"" in the short-term.
MOST SEPTEMBER DATA SHOWS MODEST IMPROVEMENT
Consumption contributed 71 percent of GDP growth in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 66.4 percent for 2015. The increase is partly due to contracting net exports but also indicates some success in Beijing's attempts to rebalance the economy from an over reliance on investment-led growth.
September indicators were mostly in line with expectations and improved slightly from August, but industrial output growth unexpectedly cooled to 6.1 percent from a year earlier, versus expectations for 6.4 percent.
Fixed-asset investment rose 8.2 percent in January-September from a year earlier, as expected, as the government cranked up infrastructure spending to support the economy. Fiscal spending in the nine-month period climbed 12.5 percent.
Private investment growth picked up to 4.5 percent in September after falling to record lows in recent months, but still significantly lags investment by state-owned firms. For the first nine months, private investment rose just 2.5 percent.
Retail sales rose 10.7 percent in September on-year, beating expectations of 10.6 percent as home buyers bought appliances and decorated, while subsidies fueled strong sales of new cars.
China's economy expanded 6.9 percent in 2015, the slowest pace in a quarter of a century.
While analysts expect China to meet its growth target this year, as usual, many remain skeptical of the official numbers, especially as growth has remain unchanged for three straight quarters even as the country attempts a major economic transition.
""The official GDP figures remain too stable to tell us much about the performance of China's economy. Our own measure of economic activity suggests that growth actually picked up last quarter, though the improvement clearly won't last,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore wrote in a note.

Capital Economics' calculations suggest the economy is growing at around 5 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest gain in five months in September as the cost of gasoline and rents surged, pointing to a steady pickup of inflation that could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday its Consumer Price Index increased 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the CPI accelerated 1.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year increase since October 2014. The CPI rose 1.1 percent in the year to August.
""The upward creep of prices weakens any argument against a rate increase in December,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. ""The economy is close to full employment and prices are starting to respond to that reality."" 
Last month's increase in the CPI was in line with economists' expectations. However, underlying inflation moderated amid a slowdown in the pace of increases in healthcare costs after recent robust gains. 
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, gained 0.1 percent last month after climbing 0.3 percent in August. That slowed the year-on-year increase in the core CPI to 2.2 percent following a 2.3 percent rise in August.
But with rents, which account for a larger share of the core CPI, recording their biggest increase in nearly 10 years, and wages pushing higher, economists cautioned against putting too much emphasis on last month's weak reading. 
The U.S. central bank has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is at 1.7 percent. Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said on Monday that the U.S. central bank was ""very close"" to its inflation and employment targets.
""As inflation approaches 2 percent, the argument that the economy has more room to run becomes harder to make and we believe the Fed remains on track for a rate hike in December,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The Fed lifted its short-term interest rate last December and has held it steady since because of persistently low inflation. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose slightly. U.S. stocks rallied, cheered by better-than-expected quarterly earnings from UnitedHealth (N:UNH), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
FIRMING DEMAND
While the jump in overall inflation was also the result of last year's lower energy prices dropping out of the calculation, it suggested firming domestic demand.
A 5.8 percent jump in gasoline prices accounted for more than half of the increase in the CPI last month. Americans also paid more for electricity, with prices posting their biggest gain since December 2014. 
The price increases are bad news for retirees, with social security recipients only due to get a 0.3 percent cost of living adjustment increase next year. Households, however, got some relief from food prices in September, which were unchanged for a third straight month. The cost of food consumed at home declined for a fifth straight month. 
Within the core CPI basket, housing costs rose further in September. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence increased 0.4 percent, the largest gain since October 2006, after rising 0.3 percent in August. Rents tend to be sticky and should keep core inflation supported.
Medical care costs rose 0.2 percent last month, the smallest increase since March, after surging 1.0 percent in August. The cost of hospital services was unchanged, while prices for prescription medicine rose 0.8 percent. 
The government revised prices for prescription drugs from May through August this year as incorrect data had been used to calculate price changes. Prescription medicine accounts for about 1.4 percent of the CPI basket. 
Consumers also paid more for grooming, motor vehicle insurance, tobacco and airline fares. However, prices for communication recorded their largest decline in two years, while heavy discounting by retailers pushed apparel prices down 0.7 percent. Prices for motor vehicles also fell.

""Inflation is moving up, showing this is not an economy that is undergoing serious demand-based weakness,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices gained 0.3% in September from a month earlier, in line with expectations and compared to a 0.2% increase in the previous month.
Year-over-year, consumer prices increased 1.5% last month, also in line with forecasts and after having risen 1.1% in August. That was its highest reading since October 2014.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese banks extended 1.22 trillion yuan ($181 billion) in new loans in September, well above expectations and capping a record nine-month lending spree despite growing concerns about the risks from the country's ballooning debt.
Much of the loan growth in recent months has been driven by a rapid rise in home mortgages, as China's sizzling housing market drives a buying frenzy that authorities are now trying to clamp down on without triggering a price collapse.
China's credit growth has been ""very fast"" by global standards, and without a comprehensive strategy to tackle the debt overhang there is a growing risk it will have a banking crisis or sharply slower growth or both, the International Monetary Fund said in a working paper last week.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected new lending to increase modestly to 1 trillion yuan in September, after more than doubling in August to 948.7 billion yuan.
Loans over the first nine months of the year were a record 10.16 trillion yuan ($1.51 trillion), according to central bank data on Tuesday.
In September alone, new housing loans to individuals totaled 475.9 billion yuan, some 76 percent higher than the same period last year, Ruan Jianhong, a central bank official said in a news release.
Personal mortgages accounted for 39 percent of all new lending last month, based on Reuters calculations using central bank data. 
IS CHINA TRYING TO REIN IN CREDIT GROWTH?
In a further sign that authorities are keeping the system awash with money to support economic growth, broad M2 money supply grew 11.5 percent in September from a year earlier, slightly below forecasts but up from August's 11.4 percent rise.
Outstanding yuan loans grew 13 percent by end-September on an annual basis. Outstanding loans had been forecast to rise 12.9 percent, while money supply was seen up 11.6 percent.
China's debt has soared to 250 percent of GDP and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) warned in September that a banking crisis was looming in the next three years.
""Credit booms, even stealth mini ones, have a stair-step effect on the credit-to-GDP ratio, which at 250 percent China can ill afford,"" Tim Condon, ING's chief Asia economist, wrote in a recent note.
However, Condon believes the recent credit boom driven by lending for government debt swaps has already peaked.
For similar reasons, Capital Economics also believes credit growth has been easing in recent months, while acknowledging that it remains rapid compared with a few years ago.
Strong lending has also been driven by Beijing's push to have local governments participate in debt swaps, which are aimed at reducing their interest payments and freeing up more money for economic development at the municipal level.
""It will take time for this more cautious policy stance to impact economic growth,"" said Capital Economics' China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
""Indeed, in coming months the economy may continue to propped up by earlier policy easing. However, a slower expansion in credit is likely to prove a major headwind to growth next year."" 
Total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose to 1.72 trillion yuan in September from 1.47 trillion yuan in August.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offers, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
M1 money supply, which includes cash and short-term deposits, rose 24.7 percent in September from a year earlier, versus August's 25.3 percent rise.
A widening gap between M1 and M2 growth has fueled concerns about a ""liquidity trap"" in the economy where companies remain wary of investing regardless of how much stimulus policymakers pump into the system.
Central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said earlier this month that risks in China's banking system are controllable even as bad loans increase.
But growing risks of a property bubble have reinforced expectations that the central bank will be in no rush to ease policy soon by cutting interest rates or banks' reserve requirements (RRR) further.
""Although we expect economic growth to slow again in the fourth quarter, the (property) tightening measures taken by local governments suggest that short-term policy is now focused on reining-in the surge in home prices rather than boosting growth,"" analysts at Nomura said in a note.

""Against this backdrop, room for the PBOC to further cut interest rates or the RRR this year is limited. As such, we remove our call for one more interest rate cut and one more RRR cut through the rest of this year.""

307,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2016 05:00AM ET</span>",China September central bank forex sales highest in eight months as it sought to steady yuan,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Net foreign exchange sales by China's central bank hit the highest in eight months in September as it sought to support the weakening yuan as capital outflows picked up, data indicated.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) sold a net 337.5 billion yuan ($50.1 billion) worth of foreign exchange in September, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data released on Tuesday.
That is the highest since January, when net sales were 644.5 billion yuan.
The rebound in the PBOC's net currency sales signaled renewed capital outflows amid expectations of an interest rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve in December and worries about China's growth outlook.
Still, most analysts believe the pressure remains modest due partly to stricter capital controls, unlike heavy outflows last year and in early 2016.
China's reserves, the largest in the world, fell by a record $513 billion last year after Beijing devalued the yuan, sparking a flood of capital outflows that threatened to destabilize the economy and alarmed global financial markets.
Foreign exchange reserves fell for a third straight month in September and by slightly more than markets had expected, suggesting fresh outflows.
Traders suspect authorities kept the yuan largely stable over the summer ahead of several high-profile political and market events such as the G20 leaders' summit in China in early September and the yuan's inclusion in the International Monetary Fund's reserve currency basket on Oct. 1.
But it has been allowed to slip since then against a resurgent dollar and is now hovering around six-year lows ahead of Chinese economic data on Wednesday.
Third-quarter growth in the world's second-largest economy is seen steadying at 6.7 percent on increased government spending and a property boom, but the property market is showing signs of overheating and exports remain weak.
The yuan  has lost about 3.7 percent against the dollar so far this year, making it one of the worst performing currencies in Asia.
A Reuters poll earlier this month showed foreign exchange strategists expect it to depreciate by about 3 percent more by September 2017.
Persistent capital outflows could increase pressure on the PBOC to cut banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR), but analysts believe the central bank is trying to use other policy tools, such as the medium-term lending facility and standing lending facility, to inject cash into the banking system.

The latest Reuters poll forecast a RRR cut in the first quarter of 2017.

The company, which places workers in areas such as finance, and IT, reported a sharper fall in first-quarter UK and Ireland profit than that seen in the preceding three month. 
So far the biggest impact was in London, where hiring activity in fell sharply, sending profit in the region 17 percent lower on a constant currency basis over the three months ended Sept. 30.
Permanent UK hiring activity had stabilized following a step-down in activity immediately after Brexit, Hays said, adding that its temporary placement business remained challenging due to tough conditions in public sector markets and the construction and property industry.
Hays said first-quarter gross profit for the United Kingdom and Ireland fell 10 percent in constant currency terms in the quarter, a steeper slide than the fall of 4 percent seen in the preceding quarter.

Although British consumers have taken ""Brexit"" in their stride, helping the economy show some resilience, surveys released earlier this month have suggested firms are cautious about investing, stoking fears unemployment could rise.

New governor Philip Lowe said policy makers had to ""guard"" against the risk that sluggish consumer prices would feed into ever lower expectations for inflation, leading to an unwelcome downward spiral.
""Lowe emphasized low inflation expectations more than the previous governor ever did,"" said CBA economist Kristina Clifton, referring to the recently retired Glenn Stevens.
""Next week's Q3 CPI will be an important update. In our view, an underlying CPI of 0.3 percent or lower will trigger a rate cut at the November meeting."" The data are due on Oct. 26.
Most forecasts are for underlying inflation to rise by between 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent, but the series has surprised on the downside for several quarters now. Indeed, it was those surprises that led the RBA to cut rates in August and May.
Consumer prices rose a meager 1 percent in the year to June while core inflation hit a record low at 1.5 percent, well below the RBA's target band of 2 to 3 percent.
Minutes of the RBA's October policy meeting drove home the importance of the coming price figures.
""Members noted that data on CPI inflation for the September quarter and an update of the (RBA's economic) forecasts would be available at the next meeting,"" the minutes showed.
""This would provide an opportunity to consider the economic outlook, assess the effects of previous reductions in the cash rate, and review conditions in the labor and housing markets.""
Investors, however, still assume an easing is a distant possibility. Interbank futures <0#YIB:> imply only a 16 percent chance of a cut in the 1.5 percent cash rate next month. The Australian dollar <AUD=D4> actually climbed on the day.
MIXED SIGNALS
The RBA noted there was considerable uncertainty about momentum in the labor market with part-time work having accounted for all of the increase in jobs this year.
The next report on employment is due on Thursday and analysts tip a slight rise in the jobless rate to 5.7 percent.
Conditions in the housing market were mixed too. While turnover and mortgage growth fell from a year ago, prices in Sydney and Melbourne – Australia's most populous cities – continued to escalate. [nRUADLEC30] 
On the positive side, the RBA said there was a reasonable prospect of sustaining economic growth and that a long slump in mining investment was past its worst.
Prices for some key commodity exports, notably coal and iron ore, had also rebounded thanks to stable economic growth in Australia's major trading partners.
 Recent data showed Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 3.3 percent in the year to June, the fastest pace in four years. It is forecast to enjoy at least another two years of solid economic growth. [nL4N1CK1AL]
""Overall, Lowe's comments suggest that if worries over housing/leverage abated and the labor market deteriorated -while inflation remained low - we think there is risk of further easing over the medium term,"" said UBS economist George Tharenou.

Domestic Economic Conditions
Members commenced their discussion of the Australian economy by noting that growth had moderated in the June quarter, as expected, following the very strong growth recorded in the March quarter. GDP growth over the year was higher than had been forecast a year earlier and above estimates of potential growth. Overall, growth in output in the September quarter was expected to have continued at a moderate pace similar to that seen in the June quarter.
Mining activity had grown over the year to the June quarter by more than had been expected a year earlier due to a larger-than-expected increase in resource export volumes, which looked to have increased further in July. Notwithstanding this, labour market conditions remained relatively weak in Queensland and Western Australia, reflecting the effects of earlier falls in the terms of trade and ongoing declines in mining investment. Members noted that the ramp-up in liquefied natural gas production would make a significant contribution to GDP growth over the forecast period, but was not expected to lead to many new jobs.
Non-mining activity had grown at around its long-run average rate over the year to the June quarter, supported by low interest rates and the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate. Growth had been broadly based and supported by strong growth in public demand. However, non-mining investment had been little changed over the past few years even though survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained above their long-run averages. Growth in output and employment, and business conditions more generally, had continued to be strongest in the services sector.
Household consumption growth had moderated in the June quarter. This was driven by a decline in the consumption of goods, consistent with low growth in retail sales volumes, while growth in the consumption of services had remained around average. More timely indicators of household consumption had been mixed: although growth in retail sales had been low over the few months to July, households' perceptions of their personal finances had remained above average. Members noted that future consumption growth would largely depend on growth in household income. Members observed that the household saving ratio had been little changed in the June quarter but remained on a gradual downward trend, in line with earlier forecasts.
Dwelling investment had been increasing more rapidly than housing credit, suggesting that households were increasing their housing equity at a relatively strong rate. Indeed, private dwelling investment had continued to grow at an above-average rate in the June quarter. The large amount of work in the pipeline and the high level of building approvals in July and August were expected to support a high level of dwelling investment for some time, although the rate of growth in dwelling investment was expected to decline over the forecast period.
In the established housing market, conditions had eased relative to a year earlier, although there had been some signs that conditions had strengthened a little more recently. Housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne had increased in recent months and auction clearance rates in these two cities had risen. In contrast, turnover and housing credit growth had been noticeably lower than a year earlier and the value of housing loan approvals had been little changed in recent months. Conditions in the rental market had continued to soften, particularly in Perth, where population growth had been easing and the rental vacancy rate had risen.
Indicators of labour market conditions had been mixed. The unemployment rate had declined to 5.6 per cent in August and had fallen by around ½ percentage point over the past year. However, the underemployment rate, which captures workers who would like to work more hours, had increased over the past year. Members noted that it was important to consider the number of additional hours workers wanted to work in order to assess the degree of underutilisation in the labour force more accurately. They observed that there had been similar developments in a number of other countries, including the United States, where spare capacity in the labour market had also not declined to the same extent as implied by the decline in the unemployment rate. In Australia, part-time work had accounted for all of the increase in employment since the beginning of the year, with full-time employment having been little changed. Looking ahead, the increase in job vacancies and advertisements was consistent with moderate employment growth in the coming months, although outcomes were expected to vary across states.
Growth in average earnings per hour recorded in the national accounts – a broader measure of earnings than provided by the wage price index – had picked up over the past two quarters, to be 3 per cent over the year to the June quarter. This had provided some evidence that the downward pressure on earnings from the movement of workers in high-paying mining-related jobs to lower-paying jobs in the non-mining economy was waning. Aggregate unit labour costs had been little changed for almost five years as growth in earnings had been matched by growth in labour productivity. Members noted that this had helped to improve the international competitiveness of Australian businesses.
International Economic Conditions
Members noted that growth in Australia's major trading partners appeared to have been slightly stronger than expected in the June and September quarters. Over recent years, consumption growth in Australia's major trading partners had been resilient but investment growth had declined, as had growth of global trade and industrial production.
Growth in China appeared to have stabilised in recent months, supported by fiscal stimulus and accommodative financial conditions. Growth in private investment had shown some signs of stabilising, after declining since late 2011, and consumer spending appeared to be holding up, consistent with stable labour market conditions. Investment in the residential property market had increased and growth in output in some industrial sectors, including steel, machinery, equipment and motor vehicle manufacturing, had picked up a little. These developments had supported Chinese demand for commodities at the same time as Chinese production of iron ore and coal had been scaled back. As a result, imports of both commodities had been on an upward trend, and iron ore imports from Australia had remained around record highs in recent months. Stronger demand and temporary supply disruptions had contributed to increases in spot prices for coal. Members noted that the risks in China associated with the build-up of debt in an environment of slower growth and questions about the sustainability of current policy settings remained a source of concern for economic prospects in China.
Commodity prices overall had increased since the previous meeting and were well above the lows recorded earlier in the year. Australia's terms of trade were expected to rise again in the September quarter, following the first increase in a few years in the June quarter. Members noted that if the terms of trade were to be little changed over the forecast period, as expected, it would be more positive for profits, wages and fiscal revenues than if the decline in the terms of trade seen over recent years were to continue.
In the major advanced economies, growth in output had been sufficient for labour market conditions to improve further. This, in turn, had contributed to relatively strong consumption growth. In contrast, growth in investment had remained subdued in most advanced economies. Despite continued declines in unemployment, unit labour cost growth had eased in Japan and remained low in the euro area, and inflation had remained below the central bank target in both economies. In contrast, the tighter labour market conditions in the United States had contributed to further increases in unit labour cost growth, which had been broadly correlated with movements in underlying inflation over time. However, inflation was still a little below the Federal Reserve's goal. Monetary policy settings remained very stimulatory in all advanced economies.
Financial Markets
Members observed that financial markets had been focused on the actions of central banks in recent months. During September, there had been some volatility in bond markets around the major central bank meetings and in share markets related to concerns about the health of some European banks. Markets had otherwise been generally quiet, including in Australia, and financial conditions had remained favourable.
The US Federal Reserve had left the federal funds rate unchanged at its September meeting, having decided to wait for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before raising the policy rate. Three members of the Federal Open Market Committee had voted to raise the federal funds rate at the September meeting and most members expected to raise the policy rate in December. The latest market pricing implied that markets considered a rate increase likely in December.
Following a comprehensive review of its monetary policy, in September the Bank of Japan (BoJ) had introduced a commitment to exceed its 2 per cent inflation target for a sustained period in order to increase inflation expectations. The BoJ had also announced a target of around zero for the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds, with these yields having been below zero for most of 2016, and maintained the short-term policy rate for central bank deposits at −0.1 per cent.
The European Central Bank (ECB) had left policy rates unchanged at its September meeting. Members noted that there had been little increase in the ECB's net lending to banks despite banks being able to borrow from the ECB at negative interest rates if certain on-lending targets were met. The ECB had also announced that a review of its asset purchase program would be conducted to ensure its smooth implementation, which is scheduled to run until at least the end of March 2017. The Bank of England (BoE) had also left its policy rate unchanged at its meeting in September, restating its view that the effective lower bound for the policy rate is less than the current level of 0.25 per cent but above zero.
Movements in 10-year government bond yields in the major economies over 2016 had largely reflected market expectations for the scale of central bank bond purchases. Yields remained very low in the major economies, as well as in Australia.
Credit market conditions had remained favourable for most corporates. Issuance had been strong in August and September, particularly in the United Kingdom following the BoE's announcement in early August of its bond-buying program. Two corporate bonds had been issued in the euro area at negative yields.
Major share price indices had been broadly unchanged over September. Members noted that renewed market concerns about  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) had seen its share price fall sharply during the month, following news that the US Department of Justice was seeking fines from Deutsche Bank related to its mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities prior to the global financial crisis.
Members noted that the cost of borrowing US dollars for short terms in wholesale markets had risen further in September ahead of the implementation of new regulations for US money market funds in mid October and given the ongoing influence of stimulatory monetary policy in Japan and elsewhere. Members noted that Australian repurchase agreement rates had also risen further, but that the daily cash rate target had continued to be met and bank bill rates had been unaffected.
Foreign exchange markets had been fairly quiet over the previous month. The Australian dollar had appreciated a little against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis during September. The US dollar and Chinese renminbi exchange rates had been little changed in trade-weighted terms. The yen had appreciated by around 2 per cent against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the month, as market expectations of additional easing by the BoJ in September had not been met. Members noted that the yen was around 20 per cent higher than when the BoJ had eased monetary policy in late January.
Australian share prices had risen slightly over September, reflecting strength in the resources sector in line with higher commodity prices, as well as slightly higher prices for financial stocks, while share prices in other sectors had declined.
Members observed that the cash rate reduction in August had now been passed on in full to at-call deposit rates, while rates on term deposits with a maturity of 12 months or more, which make up only around 2 per cent of banks' funding, had increased. Interest rates paid by the major Australian banks on their outstanding wholesale debt, which makes up around one-third of their total funding, had declined by around 15 basis points since the cash rate reduction in August and were expected to decline further as the cost of new issuance remained below the cost of outstanding debt. Australian banks' bond issuance had been soft in September but strong in 2016 overall.
About half of the August cash rate reduction had been passed through to housing and business lending rates. Members noted that financial market pricing indicated that market participants expected virtually no chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the October meeting.
Financial Stability
Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system.
A number of risks had continued to weigh on the global financial system. In China, debt had continued to expand despite slower economic growth, and banks' non-performing loan ratios had been rising. Members made the general observation that levels of leverage that previously seemed sustainable could pose risks as economic growth slows. Slow growth had also been hampering European banks from recovering from an unfavourable mix of low profitability, high non-performing loan ratios and weak equity prices. Although capital levels at European banks had been rising, some banks were still in a weak financial position, especially in Italy. In Japan, as well as Europe, low or negative interest rates had been squeezing bank profits. More broadly, low interest rates had been boosting asset prices globally, including prices of commercial property.
Domestic risks to financial stability had continued to shift to commercial property and areas dependent on the resources sector. Members noted that some risks from household lending had lessened a little further over the past six months. Lending standards had been strengthened and housing credit growth had slowed. The level of non-performing mortgage loans had risen over 2016 to date, but remained low. The household debt-to-income ratio was high and drifting up, although most other indicators suggested that household finances were in reasonable shape.
Risks around the projected large increases in supply in some inner-city apartment markets had increased. In commercial property markets more generally yields had continued to fall. Conditions were weak in Brisbane and Perth, because demand for office space from resource-related firms had declined; in contrast, the Sydney and Melbourne markets were much stronger. Non-performing business loan ratios had picked up a little, largely driven by loans to firms linked to the resources sector. Members noted that there had been few signs of stress in most other parts of the business sector.
The Australian banking system had continued to perform well despite these risks. In many respects, banks had become more resilient over the previous year or so by raising capital and rebalancing their businesses away from some less profitable activities overseas. They had also taken a more cautious and selective approach to domestic business lines, such as lending to property developers. This business had been growing quickly in recent years, particularly at local branches of banks with headquarters in Asia. Capital ratios had remained high. Members noted that it would be important that banks' efforts to maintain current levels of profitability did not result in increased systemic risk.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
Overall, developments in the global economy had been slightly more positive leading up to the meeting. Although the Chinese economy was still facing a difficult transition, growth in China appeared to have stabilised and demand for commodities had been resilient. At the same time, some reduction in the supply of commodities had contributed to an increase in commodity prices since the turn of the year. This had supported a rise in Australia's terms of trade around the middle of this year. Members observed that the forecast stabilisation in the terms of trade around current levels would see an end to the drag on incomes from the persistent decline in the terms of trade over recent years. Globally, inflation remained below most central bank targets and monetary policy settings were very stimulatory.
Over the past year, the Australian economy had continued its transition following the end of the mining investment boom. Over the year to the June quarter, GDP growth had been a little above estimates of potential, driven mainly by growth in resource exports that had been stronger than expected a year earlier. Growth in the June quarter had been more moderate than in the March quarter. Recent data were consistent with further moderate growth in the September quarter. This implied that, in year-ended terms, growth was expected to decline somewhat in the near term before rising gradually.
There remained a degree of uncertainty about the momentum in the labour market. While the unemployment rate had edged down a little further in previous months, broader measures of labour underutilisation had not declined. This was consistent with part-time work having accounted for all of the increase in employment over the year to date and the relative strength of the household services sector, which employs a higher-than-average share of part-time workers. National accounts data had provided some further tentative evidence that growth in employee earnings had stabilised. This was consistent with less downward pressure on earnings associated with the movement of labour from mining to the non-mining sectors of the economy.
Conditions in the housing market had been mixed over prior months. The effects of tighter lending standards had been apparent in indicators such as the shares of interest-only loans and loans with high loan-to-valuation ratios in new lending, both of which had declined over the past year. Turnover had declined and housing credit growth had been steady at a noticeably lower rate than a year earlier. Although the rate of increase in housing prices had been lower than a year earlier, growth in housing prices and auction clearance rates had strengthened in Sydney and Melbourne in the months leading up to the meeting. Members noted that considerable supply of apartments was scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Overall, members assessed that while the risks associated with rapid growth in housing prices and lending had receded over the past year, developments would need to be monitored closely.
Since the September meeting, the data on the domestic economy had been broadly consistent with the forecasts presented in the August Statement on Monetary Policy. The adjustment to the decline in mining investment was well advanced; headwinds from that adjustment and the earlier fall in the terms of trade appeared to be waning. The adjustment had been assisted by low interest rates, which had been supporting domestic demand. In addition, the lower exchange rate since 2013 had been helping the traded sector, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this. There was a reasonable prospect of sustaining growth in economic activity that would support further employment growth and, in time, a gradual increase in wage growth and inflation. At the same time, however, there remained considerable uncertainty about momentum in the labour and housing markets.
Members noted that data on CPI inflation for the September quarter and an update of the forecasts would be available at the next meeting. This would provide an opportunity to consider the economic outlook, assess the effects of previous reductions in the cash rate and review conditions in the labour and housing markets. Taking account of developments since the previous meeting, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand official cash rate stands at 2.0%, with expectations of a further cut with inflation still below the bottom of the central bank's target band. However, RBNZ Assistant Gov. John McDermott last week said the bank expected this quarterly CPI to show inflation bottoming out and it would rise from here. The RBNZ will next review the official cash rate Nov. 10 and expectations are for a 25 basis points cut to 1.75%.

314,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2016 05:51PM ET</span>",RBA's Lowe says Q3 inflation figures key for measuring expectations,"Investing.com - Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said Tuesday third quarter inflation figures will be an important indication of inflation expectations, which have clearly declined recently and there is a need to guard against them falling further.
""Of course, one of the key influences on inflation expectations is the actual outcomes for inflation. We will get an important update next week with the release of the September quarter CPI,"" Lowe said at a conference in Sydney. CPI data is due Oct. 26.
The RBA lowered the cash rate in May and August, now at a record low 1.5%, in response to lower-than-expected inflation outcomes early in the year and an assessment that inflation was likely to remain quite low for some time, Lowe said.
""The easing in policy wasn't in response to concerns about economic growth. If anything, the growth outcomes over the past year, as measured by real GDP or the trend in unemployment, have been a bit better than expected,"" Lowe said.
In deciding how much variation in inflation is acceptable the RBA gives prominence to employment and stability of the financial system, Lowe said.
""Achieving the quickest return of inflation back to 2.5% would be unlikely to be in the public interest if it came at the cost of a weakening of balance sheets and an unsustainable build up of leverage in response to historically low interest rates.
""Conversely, the case for moving more quickly would be strengthened in a world where the labor market was deteriorating and people were having increasing difficulty finding jobs,"" he said.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2016 01:02PM ET</span>",Weak utilities demand restrains U.S. industrial production,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production barely rose in September as a rebound in manufacturing and mining output was offset by surprisingly weak demand for utilities, pointing to a moderate acceleration in economic growth in the third quarter.
Still, the mixed report from the Federal Reserve on Monday suggested that the industrial sector downturn has probably run its course. Gains in output are likely to be muted as the sector remains constrained by the lingering effects of the dollar's past rally, a collapse in oil prices and weak global demand.
""It is hard to have a full-blown, strong economic expansion if the manufacturing sector is hurting and that has been the case this year,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania.  
The Fed said industrial output edged up 0.1 percent last month after declining 0.5 percent in August. Last month's gain was in line with economists' expectations. Industrial production rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the third quarter, the first quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2015.
The report came on the heels of data on Friday showing a mild increase in core retail sales in September, which prompted the Atlanta Fed to cut its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.9 percent rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the second quarter. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
MANUFACTURING OUTPUT RISES
Industrial production was last month supported by a 0.2 percent rise in manufacturing output, which followed a 0.5 percent drop in August. Manufacturing output was boosted by the production of goods such as textiles and plastics.
Motor vehicle and parts production edged up 0.1 percent, while the output of machinery and primary metals fell.
Manufacturing production rose at a 0.9 percent rate in the third quarter. Manufacturing has also been hurt by business efforts to reduce an inventory overhang, which has resulted in fewer orders being placed with factories. 
There are, however, signs of stability, as the dollar's rally appears to be slowing and oil prices steadily rise. A survey early this month showed an acceleration in factory activity in September, and new orders for manufactured capital goods have increased since June. 
But strong gains in the near-term are unlikely. A separate report from the New York Fed on Monday showed factory activity in New York State weakened further in October as new orders continued to contract. Manufacturers were, however, more upbeat about the sector's prospects in the next six months.
""We look for modest growth in the manufacturing sector to continue as the worst of the effects of the strong dollar and inventory overhang pass,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
In September, mining production rose 0.4 percent as gains in oil and gas well drilling offset a drop in crude oil extraction.
That left mining output rising at a 3.7 percent rate in the third quarter following six consecutive quarterly declines. Energy services firm Baker Hughes reported on Friday oil firms increased drilling rigs last week for the 16th straight week.
Utilities production dropped 1.0 percent last month, despite unseasonably warm weather during the month. The drop in utilities output suggests slower consumer spending in the third quarter. With output tepid last month, industrial capacity use edged up 0.1 percentage point to 75.4 percent, and is 4.6 percentage points below its long-run average.

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to accelerate before it becomes inflationary.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2016 10:10AM ET</span>","Brazil set to cut rates this week, economists split on size: Reuters poll","By Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil will probably reduce interest rates this week for the first time in four years, in what is set to be the beginning of a long and deep series of rate cuts expected to help the economy emerge from a two-year-long recession.
Forty-six of 50 economists polled by Reuters expect the central bank to cut its benchmark Selic rate from a decade-high of 14.25 percent  on Oct. 19, and only four see the bank keeping rates steady for a tenth straight meeting.
The analysts that expect a move are split about the size of the cut. Half of them expect the bank's policy committee, Copom, to trim the Selic rate by 25 basis points, to 14.00 percent, and the remainder forecast a cut of 50 basis points, to 13.75 percent.
A smaller cut would signal the bank is in no hurry to slash rates as inflation remains high and government efforts to rein in spending are in the early stages of a long battle in Congress.
""From a tactical and also reputational standpoint, the Copom will choose to start the easing cycle with a moderate 25-point rate cut,"" said Alberto Ramos, head of Latin America economic research at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
A larger cut would suggest policymakers feel more confident about hitting the center of their inflation target, 4.5 percent, for the first time this decade. Inflation is currently at 8.48 percent , after topping 10 percent earlier in 2016.
Yields on interest rate futures have dropped in recent days as a fuel price cut, a surprising drop in food costs and a overwhelming government victory in a first-round Congress vote led traders to add bets on a 50-basis-point cut in October.
""We don't see any reason for the Copom not to begin easing monetary conditions on a 50-point pace,"" said UBS economists led by Rafael de la Fuente in a note.
Rate cuts are seen as crucial to lifting Brazil's economy out of its worst downturn in decades, in a boost to unpopular President Michel Temer and his ambitious agenda of economic reforms and privatizations.

Economists expect the central bank to cut interest rates to 11.00 percent by the end of 2017, according to the median forecast in the poll. Five analysts already see rates falling to single-digits next year, putting Brazil more in line with other Latin American and emerging economies.

317,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2016 09:20AM ET</span>",U.S. industrial production rises less than expected in September,"Investing.com - Industrial production in the U.S. did manage to bounce back in September after a dip the previous month, but the increase was lower than hoped, official data showed on Monday.
In a report, the Federal Reserve said that industrial production increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, below expectations for a gain of 0.2%.
Industrial production dropped by 0.5% in August, whose figure was revised from a previously reported decline of 0.4%.
However, manufacturing production increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% last month, compared to forecasts for a 0.1% rise and following a decline of 0.5% in August that was revised from an initial 0.4% decrease.
The report also showed that the capacity utilization rate, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, ticked up to 75.4% in September from 75.3% a month earlier. August’s reading was revised down from an initial 75.5%.
Analysts had expected a reading of 75.6% for September.
Immediately following the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1000 from around 1.1006 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2169 from 1.2166 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 104.04 from 103.95 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 97.90, compared to 97.86 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures pointed to a flat to lower open. The blue-chip Dow futures slipped 10 points, or 0.06%, the S&P 500 futures inched down 1 point, or 0.06%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures gave up 3 points, or 0.06%.

Energy prices, despite rising 1.0 percent from August, were still 3.0 percent lower than a year earlier. Their annual drop is much milder than in August, when energy prices fell 5.6 percent, reflecting mounting oil prices.
Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food items, or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, euro zone prices rose 0.4 percent on the month for a 0.8 percent year-on-year gain -- remaining steady for the fifth month running.
The ECB wants to keep inflation at below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term.

To boost inflation levels closer to its target, the bank is buying 80 billion euros worth of government bonds each month on the secondary market to inject more cash into banking system and force banks to lend more to the real economy to boost economic growth rates and therefore inflation.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia is forecast to enjoy at least another two years of solid economic growth, extending a quarter of a century without recession and dodging the deflation that dogs so many of its rich world peers.
The latest Reuters poll found analysts expect Australia's A$1.6 trillion ($1.2 trillion) of gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by 2.9 percent this year, unchanged from the July poll.
Growth was seen at 2.8 percent next year and 2.9 percent in 2018, a result that would see Australia capture the Netherlands' crown for the longest run without a recession.
Surging export volumes, record low interest rates and an historic boom in home building have already underpinned growth of 3.3 percent in the year to June.
A recent revival in the value of commodity exports also promises to boost company profits, national income and tax receipts in coming months. Surging prices for coal alone could eradicate the country's trade deficit and add 2 percentage points to nominal GDP.
The worst also seems to be over for a long slump in mining investment, which subtracted a huge 1.6 percentage points from GDP growth in the year to June.
Policymakers at the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) believe three quarters of the mining downturn has now passed and its drag on growth will greatly diminish for here on.
""The Australian economy's output performance, in aggregate, has been resilient in what remains a challenging environment,"" said Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan. He is tipping economic growth of 3 percent for both 2016 and 2017.
""That said, downside risks persist. World growth is sluggish, and global financial sector vulnerabilities remain.""
At home, jobs growth has turned sluggish and heavily weighted to part time work, restraining wage growth and adding to downward pressure on inflation.
Indeed, underlying inflation slowed to a record low of 1.5 percent in the year to June and looks likely to have remained very subdued in the third quarter.
Analysts forecast consumer price inflation would run at just 1.2 percent for 2016 as whole, well under the RBA's target of 2 to 3 percent. 

Yet they also expected it to pick up to 2.1 percent next year and 2.4 percent for 2018, a welcome outcome that would eliminate the need for more rate cuts.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's exports in September slid less than expected as shipments to top customer China declined at a slower pace and sales to Europe rebounded, but the outlook for the trade-dependent economy remained grim.
Shipments to the United States recoiled sharply from gains the previous month, while sales of electronics continued to slump despite heading into peak year-end shopping season.
Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) fell 4.8 percent last month from a year earlier, the trade agency International Enterprise Singapore said in a statement on Monday.
That was slightly better than the median forecast of a 6.0 percent slump in a Reuters poll. In August, the city-state's overseas shipments stalled.
On a month-on-month, seasonally adjusted basis, exports grew 2.4 percent in September, beating a forecast of a 1.5 percent rise in the survey.
""We expect Singapore NODX to stabilize in the coming months on a year-on-year basis. But the recovery is expected to be modest given still weak external demand,"" said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for Natixis in Hong Kong.
""Given the spillover of the trade sector into services lately, the MAS does not want to cause significant depreciation expectations of the Singapore dollar, which will cause domestic interest rates to rise too fast,"" Nguyen said, referring to the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
The central bank on Friday held policy steady despite a surprisingly sharp economic contraction in the third quarter, but analysts say the weak outlook for inflation and growth will likely force policymakers to ease further.
Exports to China fell 2.2 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with a 5.4 percent slump in August.
China's exports in September fell more than forecast while imports unexpectedly shrank, indicating signs of stabilization in the world's second-largest economy may be short-lived.
""The bigger picture remains that particularly given that China's export falls were very unexpectedly weaker, the sense is that this is going to set the stage for a rather wobbly and fragile coming months,"" said Vishnu Varathan, senior economist for Mizuho Bank in Singapore.
Sales to the European Union expanded 9.9 percent last month from a year earlier, compared with a 15.6 percent decline in August.
But shipments to the United States shrank 7.2 percent in September on-year, after rising 4.8 percent in August.
Declining U.S. demand for aircraft parts, integrated circuits (ICs) and non-electric engines and motors all dragged on exports to the world's top economy.
By product, volatile pharmaceutical exports increased 16.2 percent, compared to a 17.9 percent decline in the previous month.
Total electronics exports in September shrank 6.6 percent from a year earlier after falling 6.0 percent in August.

Activity at the local factories expanded in September for the first time in 15 months as new orders rose, a survey showed earlier this month.

The buoyant overall tone of the survey commissioned by business advisory firm Deloitte echoed other measures of confidence by consumers who appear to have shrugged off the shock vote to leave the EU.
Deloitte said confidence among consumers rose by three percentage points from its previous quarterly survey, the biggest increase since late 2014.
But in London, consumer sentiment fell by three percentage points.
""The Brexit vote may be weighing on a region in which 60 percent of the population voted to remain (in the EU) and where reliance on financial services, migration and capital flows are especially strong,"" Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said.
A survey of Britain's housing market published last week found property prices fell in London, bucking a rise in the country as a whole.
Many employers share the concerns about Britain's uncertain future relationship with the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May has signaled she will pursue controls over migration which could reduce Britain's future access to the EU's single market.
Deloitte's quarterly survey of 3,000 UK consumers was carried out between Sept. 16 and 18.
While it pointed to continued growth in retail sales going into the fourth quarter, spending power could be challenged in 2017 and beyond when inflation is expected to rise and negotiations about the country's exit from the EU begin, Deloitte said.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll expect official data due on Thursday to show retail sales growth slowed in September as a rise in prices starts to eat into how much shoppers were able to buy.
Separately on Monday, property website Rightmove said asking prices for homes put up for sale in England and Wales rose in the month to Oct. 8, the second monthly increase after falling following the referendum.

Prices rose by 0.9 percent and were just 0.4 percent below the highest level on Rightmove's records which was hit in June.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' confidence rose for a second straight month to a half-year high in October, a Reuters poll showed, while sentiment in the services sector hit a 3 1/2-year low - highlighting the uneven nature of economic recovery.
The Reuters Tankan, which strongly correlates with the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey, also found manufacturers' sentiment is expected to tumble to zero over the next three months, although non-manufacturers are seen rebounding.
The monthly poll of 532 large and mid-sized firms, of which 265 responded, was conducted Sept. 28-Oct. 12.
It follows this month's BOJ tankan showing big Japanese manufacturers' mood held steady in the third quarter although service-sector sentiment worsened to its lowest in nearly two years. 
The sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 10 from 5 in September, driven by materials industries and food-processing firms, which benefited from lower import costs stemming from gains in the yen and declines in commodity prices.
It was expected to worsen to zero in January.
""We have managed to secure a profit margin by maintaining product prices while costs of fuel and raw materials have declined since the year before last,"" a manager at a chemicals firm said in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
Exporters of cars and electronics, on the other hand, complained that the yen's gains over levels seen last year have weighed on profits. Their sentiment report remained flat.
A transport equipment maker said business conditions were ""not so good"" because of the yen's gains, softening demand in North America, and slowdown in China.
The service-sector index fell for a second straight month to 9 from 14 in September, in a worrying sign for private consumption that constitutes about 60 percent of the economy.
The service-sector index stood at its lowest level since February 2013, just two months before the central bank launched an aggressive but so far ineffective stimulus campaign to spur economic activity and get inflation up to 2 percent. 
The service-sector index was seen bouncing to 22 in January.
Bad weather undermined retailers' sentiment which worsened to minus 16, the lowest reading since February 2015, when they were reeling from the effects of a sales tax hike. 
""Sales have been stagnant due to the typhoons that hit in August and September and a prolonged period of rainy days,"" a manager of a retailing business said in the survey.

Sentiment indexes subtract the percentage of companies saying conditions are poor from those saying conditions are good. A positive number means optimists outnumber pessimists.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2016 06:56PM ET</span>",U.S. fiscal year budget deficit widens to $587 billion,"By Lindsay Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. budget deficit widened to $587 billion for the fiscal year 2016 on slower-than-expected revenues and higher spending for programs including Social Security and Medicare, the Treasury Department said on Friday.
The 2016 deficit increased to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product.
It was the first time the deficit increased in relation to economic output since 2009, according to figures from the Congressional Budget Office. That year, the deficit peaked at $1.4 trillion amid the financial crisis.
Last fiscal year's deficit was $439 billion, with a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 2.5 percent. Accounting for calendar adjustments, the 2016 fiscal year deficit was $548 billion.
Fiscal 2016 revenues grew 1 percent to $3.267 trillion, while outlays rose 5 percent to $3.854 trillion.
Revenue growth was reduced by the retroactive extension of some expired individual and corporate tax deductions passed by Congress as part of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act late last year, Treasury said.
With an aging population, mandatory spending for Social Security and Medicare, the federal retirement and healthcare programs for the elderly, have increased.
For September, the Treasury posted a $33 billion budget surplus, a 63 percent decline from the same month last year.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a $25 billion surplus for last month.
When accounting for calendar adjustments, September would have shown a $75 billion surplus compared with an adjusted $91 billion surplus in the same month a year ago.
Receipts last month totaled $357 billion, a 2 percent decline from September 2015, while outlays stood at $323 billion, an 18 percent rise from the same month a year ago.

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly warned that increasing federal debt levels are unsustainable over the long term unless Congress changes current laws.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rebounded in September amid a surge in motor vehicle purchases and rise in discretionary spending, pointing to solid demand that reinforces expectations of an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve in December.
Other data on Friday suggested a pickup in inflation, with producer prices rising broadly last month to record their biggest year-on-year increase since December 2014. The reports were the latest indication that the economy regained momentum in the third quarter after a lackluster first-half performance.
""Today's data give the Fed a green light to raise interest rates by year-end. Retail numbers were solid and confirm that the economy is moving in what the Fed believes is an acceptable fashion,"" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management in Baltimore.
The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.6 percent after declining 0.2 percent in August. Sales were up 2.7 percent from a year ago. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month, reversing August's 0.1 percent drop. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Though the small gain in core retail sales last month suggests a moderation in consumer spending from the second quarter's robust 4.3 percent annualized rate, economists said they expected consumption grew at around a still solid 2.8 percent pace in the third quarter.
""Overall, the details of the report are more positive than what the modest print on core sales suggests,"" said Brittany Baumann, an economist at TD Securities in Toronto. ""Together with healthy levels of consumer sentiment and continued improvement in labor market conditions, today's report is enough to keep a December Fed rate hike firmly on the table.""
Economists had forecast overall retail sales increasing 0.6 percent and core sales advancing 0.4 percent last month.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. U.S. stocks were trading higher, also boosted by better-than-expected quarterly profits from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
INFLATION RISING
A second report from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment softened in early October amid uncertainty over the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, with the campaign taking a more acrimonious tone. 
""It is likely that the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election had a negative impact, especially among lower-income consumers, and without that added uncertainty, the confidence measures may not have weakened,"" the University of Michigan said in a statement.
Minutes of the Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed several officials believed it would be appropriate to increase interest rates ""relatively soon"" if the economy continued to gain strength. 
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December and has held it steady since, largely because of concerns over low inflation.
But inflation is steadily rising. In a third report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.3 percent last month after being unchanged in August. In the 12 months through September, the PPI jumped 0.7 percent, the biggest increase since December 2014. The PPI was flat in the 12 months through August. 
A 0.7 percent increase in the cost of goods, including energy, accounted for more than three quarters of the rise in final demand prices. 
Producer prices are gaining as some of the drag from the dollar's past surge starts to ease. The dollar rally appears to have peaked early this year and oil prices having pushed off multi-decade lows, which economists expect could allow inflation to gradually rise toward the Fed's 2 percent target.
The retail sales report added to upbeat data on the labor market and manufacturing and services sector surveys that have suggested economic growth picked up in the third quarter.
Growth estimates for the third quarter are currently as high as a 2.6 percent rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the second quarter.
September's retail sales were boosted by a 1.1 percent jump in auto sales. There were also strong increases in sales at furniture and building material stores. Online sales also rose, cutting into sales at the traditional department stores, which left receipts at clothing outlets flat. 

Sales at restaurants and bars advanced 0.8 percent, the largest gain since February, and receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores surged 1.4 percent, pointing to strong discretionary spending.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A mixed bag of Chinese economic data this week has unnerved global markets and clouded the outlook for China's economic growth, days before the release of the country's quarterly gross domestic product figures.
Global markets rose on Friday after official data showed China's factory output prices grew in September for the first time in almost five years, but a day earlier, stocks in Europe and on Wall Street were hammered by an unexpectedly poor Chinese trade report for the same month.
Exports for September slumped 10 percent from a year earlier, despite the yuan's  depreciation in the past year. Imports unexpectedly fell, after ticking higher in August, raising questions over the resilience of domestic demand.
Though China's economy recorded its slowest growth in 25 years in 2015, it has shown signs of stabilizing in recent months, sustained by billions of dollars of government infrastructure projects and a spreading credit-fueled housing boom. China is targeting gross domestic product growth of 6.5 to 7 percent this year, after 6.9 percent last year.
""The government has been able to stabilize the economy this year with quite a lot of stimulus, but it hasn't actually been as effective as a lot of people had expected,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a Singapore-based China Economist at Capital Economics. 
The booming property market is showing tentative signs of cooling after some local governments rolled out restrictions on home purchases to temper a months-long buying frenzy.
Chinese companies are still sitting on $18 trillion in debt, equivalent to about 169 percent of GDP, according to the most recent figures from the Bank for International Settlements. 
Fixed asset investment is hovering near 17-year lows, while private investment is still languishing at record lows.
In a Reuters poll, 58 economists estimated that third-quarter GDP, due on Oct. 19, expanded 6.7 percent, as it did in the first and second quarters.
Despite fresh signs of softer economic conditions, most economists think Beijing will meet its official GDP target without much difficulty.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 0.1 percent in September from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday, the first expansion on an annual basis since January 2012. 
But for a more realistic gauge of China's economy, economists tend to look at variables beyond official numbers.
""We tend to focus on less high-profile, volume-based indicators, which don't have to be deflated with price indices, such as freight volume, passenger traffic, floors under construction, among other measures,"" Evans-Pritchard said.
He said the official GDP hasn't been a reliable indicator of what's happening on the ground since 2012, the first year China's GDP target came under threat.
""What's really interesting about those data is that they used to move very closely with GDP, and from around 2012 onwards most of our indicators continued to slow, but the official GDP (figures) were just kindly moving within a tiny range.""
Evans-Pritchard's official 2016 official GDP estimate remains at 6.8 percent. But based on other variables, he said he believed growth was likely to be 5 percent.
Data for September's bank loans is due over the next few days. Bank lending more than doubled in August from the previous month, fueled by strong mortgage demand.
Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore, said to gauge real growth in China is ""a complicated story"", but he tends to look at the debt data that comes out of China for clues.
China unveiled guidelines this week to cut rising levels of corporate debt that some analysts fear could destabilize the world's second-largest economy.

The government aims to stabilize and reduce corporate debt levels in the near- and medium-term.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% last month, better than the forecast for a 0.2% advance and after a flat reading in August.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) rose 0.7%, compared to expectations for a gain of 0.6% and following a flat reading in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, advanced by 0.2% in September, higher than forecasts for a gain of 0.1% and following a rise of 0.1% a month earlier.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 1.2% last month, in line with expectations and after rising 1.0% in the preceding month.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.
After the report, which was released simultaneously with the retail sales for September, the dollar remained broadly higher. EUR/USD was trading at 1.1015 from around 1.1003 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2230 from 1.227 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 104.20 from 104.29 earlier.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer prices unexpectedly rose in September for the first time in nearly five years thanks to higher commodity prices, welcome news for the government as it struggles to whittle down a growing mountain of corporate debt.
Official inflation data on Friday also showed a pickup in consumer prices, helping to ease investors' concerns about the health of the world's second-largest economy after disappointing trade numbers on Thursday rattled global markets.
Corporate China sits on $18 trillion in debt, equivalent to about 169 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), according to the most recent figures from the Bank for International Settlements. Most of it is held by state-owned companies.
""An uptick in inflation, if sustained, would be good news for China's ability to service its overhang of corporate debt,"" Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Service Group, said in a note. 
""With low interest rates keeping debt service costs in check and producer prices rising, the outlook for Chinese industrial profits is improving.""
The producer price index (PPI) rose 0.1 percent in September from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said. 
While the gain was slight, it was the first time producer prices have expanded on an annual basis since January 2012, and came a bit earlier than the year-end timeframe that some analysts had expected. Producer prices had edged up on month-on-month basis over the summer. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a decline of just 0.3 percent on-year, after a drop of 0.8 percent in August.
China's factory prices have been falling since March 2012, and more than four years of producer price deflation have squeezed industrial companies' cash flow. 
Profits at roughly a quarter of Chinese companies were too low in the first half of this year to cover their debt servicing obligations, as earnings languish and loan burdens increase. according to a recent Reuters analysis. 
However, a construction boom, fueled by a government infrastructure spending spree and a housing rally, have helped boost prices for building materials from steel to copper in recent months, while coal prices have jumped as the government tries to shut excess mining capacity. 
Prices of ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals and coal mining together rose 4.1 percent on-year, a key factor in the PPI turning positive, the statistics bureau said.
The number of industries registering price increases also rose to 25, eight more than the previous month, indicating that a recovery in Chinese companies' pricing power was becoming more broad-based.
""Debt pressure will certainly be reduced,"" said Zhou Hao, analyst at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Singapore. But he cautioned that China's mounting debt is also a structural problem, and that higher prices for commodities such as coal and steel may be ""speculative"" in nature.
CONSUMER PRICES ALSO PICK UP
Consumer price inflation also quickened more than expected to 1.9 percent in September year-on-year, mainly due to higher food prices. Food prices were up 3.2 percent in September on-year, compared with 1.3 percent in August. 
Analysts had expected the consumer price index (CPI) to rise 1.6 percent from 1.3 percent in August, a 10-month low.
""A rebound in CPI growth is largely due to seasonal factors, and the overall growth trend is quite stable. It also dismissed previous concerns of deflation risks,"" said Zhang Yongjun, analyst at the China International Centre For Economic & Technical Exchanges.
The end of deflation is likely to dash any lingering expectations of further cuts in Chinese interest rates or banks' reserve ratios, economists at ANZ said.
The odds of such moves by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) had already been seen as rapidly receding due to growing concerns in the government about rapidly rising debt levels and potential asset bubbles.

""However, we do not expect the PBoC to tighten liquidity soon either,"" ANZ said in a note. ""The PBoC should be balancing the yuan exchange rate, deleveraging, and the concerns around a slowing economy.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost of renting office space in Manhattan set new records in the third quarter amid strong leasing activity that was driven by a job creation rate in New York that exceeds the nationwide average, according to brokerage Colliers International (TO:CIG).
Leasing activity across Manhattan is 13.8 percent above the city's 10-year average, and year-to-date is 11.1 percent better than 2015, a banner year for commercial real estate in New York, the brokerage said on Thursday.
New York has created 89,000 new private sector jobs in the 12 months ended August, a 2.4 percent increase that tops the U.S. job gains rate of 1.9 percent, Colliers said. 
If leasing activity maintains pace in the fourth quarter, traditionally a strong period as deals rush to close, 2016 will surpass last year to post the second-highest leasing volume in a decade, said Craig Caggiano, a Colliers' executive director.
Demand is keeping up with supply but that could soon change, he said. Some 10 million square feet of new office space, the largest glut to hit Manhattan in at least 30 years, will begin to come online over the next few years in late 2017, he said.
""What's going to happen when that comes on the market? Will that supply overwhelm demand, that is a big unknown,"" Caggiano said.
Asking rents rose to a record average of $73.85 a square foot in Manhattan even though rents in Midtown, the largest U.S. office market, were 9.3 percent lower at $83.49 a square foot than their pre-recession peak in 2008, the brokerage said.
In downtown, which is the third-largest U.S. office market, asking rents set a new record of $58.83 a square foot, while asking rents in the smaller but trendy Midtown South market also posted a new record at $67.54 a square foot.
Overall leasing activity edged slightly higher from the second quarter, but rose 16.7 percent from the third quarter of 2015, a banner year for New York commercial real estate. 

Leasing volume picked up almost 25 percent quarter-over-quarter and 30.2 percent year-over-year in Midtown South. Leasing activity surged 26.5 percent from a year ago in Midtown, though it was down 10.2 percent from the previous quarter, Colliers said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits held at a 43-year low last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December.
Thursday's report from the Labor Department added to data such as September automobile sales and manufacturing and services sector surveys in reinforcing the view that economic growth picked up in the third quarter after a sluggish performance in the first half of the year.
""The data are making the Fed's current policy look too wrong footed and the markets are waiting for them to get back on track, most likely in December,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 246,000 for the week ended Oct. 8, the lowest reading since November 1973, the Labor Department said. 
Claims for the prior week were revised to show 3,000 fewer applications received than previously reported. 
It was the 84th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with robust labor market conditions. 
That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 
Minutes of the Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed several officials believed it would be appropriate to increase interest rates ""relatively soon"" if the economy continued to gain strength. 
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December and has held it steady since, largely because of concerns over low inflation.
But there a signs that inflation will gradually rise toward the Fed's 2 percent target as the dollar's rally fades, which should ease some of the deflationary pressures from overseas. 
In a second report, the Labor Department said import prices gained 0.1 percent last month after declining 0.2 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, import prices fell 1.1 percent, the smallest decrease since August 2014, after declining 2.2 percent in August.
""The underlying trend in imported deflation is improving and is consistent with a gradual waning of the drag from the stronger dollar and lower global commodity prices,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
""An improvement in imported inflation should help to stabilize domestic core goods prices in the coming months, and push the overall core CPI (Consumer Price Index) higher.""
The rising prospects of an interest rate hike in December and weak trade data from China hurt U.S. stocks. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasuries rose.
STRONG LABOR MARKET
Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 254,000 in the latest week. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,500 to 249,250 last week, also the lowest level since November 1973. 
While the pace of employment growth has slowed to a monthly average of 178,000 jobs so far this year after averaging 229,000 positions per month in 2015, it remains well above the roughly 100,000 that Fed Chair Janet Yellen says is needed to absorb new entrants in the job market.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 16,000 to 2.05 million in the week ended Oct. 1, the lowest level since June 2000. 

The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims dropped 25,750 to 2.07 million. That was the lowest reading since July 2000.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's September exports fell 10 percent from a year earlier, far worse than expected, while imports unexpectedly shrank after picking up in August, suggesting signs of steadying in the world's second-largest economy may be short-lived.
The disappointing trade figures pointed to weaker demand both at home and aboard, and deepened concerns over the latest depreciation in China's yuan currency , which hit a fresh six-year low against a firming U.S. dollar on Thursday.
""This comes on the heels of weak South Korean trade data, and it definitely make us worry about to what extent global demand is improving,"" said Luis Kujis, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
Asian stocks tumbled to three-week lows and U.S. stock futures and Treasury yields fell after the data, while copper prices in London slipped. [MKTS/GLOB]
China's exports had been expected to fall 3 percent, slightly worse than in August as global demand for Asian goods remains stubbornly weak despite heading into what is usually the peak year-end shopping season.
Weaker demand for Chinese goods was seen in nearly all of its major markets in the U.S., Europe and much of Asia.
Imports shrank 1.9 percent, dashing hopes for a second rise in a row. Imports had unexpectedly grown 1.5 percent in August, the first expansion in nearly two years, on stronger demand for coal and commodities such as iron ore which are feeding a construction boom.
That left China with a trade surplus of $41.99 billion for the month, the lowest in six months, the General Administration of Customs said on Thursday. Analysts had expected it to expand slightly to $53 billion.
The weaker trade readings could raise concerns about the other September data and third-quarter GDP over the coming week. Economists had expected that data to show the economy was stabilizing and perhaps even slowly picking up.
The import reversal raises questions over the strength of the recent recovery in domestic demand, Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note.
""This could be an early sign that the recent recovery in economic activity is losing momentum, although we would caution against reading too much into a single data point given the volatility of the trade figures,"" he said.
""The continued underwhelming performance of Chinese exports adds weight to our view that the People’s Bank will maintain its recent policy of gradual trade-weighted renminbi (yuan) depreciation in coming quarters,"" he added.
Last month, the World Trade Organization cut its forecast for global trade growth this year by more than a third to 1.7 percent, reflecting a slowdown in China and falling levels of imports into the United States.
DOUBTS ABOUT RECOVERY
To be sure, China's imports of crude oil rose 18 percent on-year to a daily record, while iron ore purchases surged to the second highest on record, suggesting its demand for global commodities is hardly falling off a cliff.
Steel mills, in particular, appear to be running hot to meet demand from a housing boom and government infrastructure projects, which are driving higher profits.
But copper, coal and soybean imports all fell from August.
""China imported too much copper in the beginning of this year,"" said Chris Wu, an analyst at CRU Beijing, a metals consulting firm. ""The lagging effect from the property market is still helping with some of the end use sectors for example wire and cables and white goods, but we are afraid the boom is close to the end.""
A Customs spokesperson said on Thursday rising imports of oil and other commodities showed demand is improving, adding that the government's trade policies is having positive effects.
After a rough start to the year, China's economy has shown signs of steadying thanks largely to the building boom, but some analysts warn the housing frenzy may be peaking as more cities impose restrictions on home buying to keep prices from overheating. 

Data have also highlighted growing imbalances in China's economy, with growth increasingly reliant on government spending as private investment falls to record lows. Larger state firms are expanding, likely thanks to Beijing's largesse, but smaller manufacturers continue to struggle.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2016 03:51PM ET</span>","Fed policymakers closer to rate hike, but inflation doubts remain: minutes","By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several voting Federal Reserve policymakers judged a rate hike would be warranted ""relatively soon"" if the U.S. economy continued to strengthen but doubts on inflation remained, according to the minutes of the Fed's September policy meeting released on Wednesday.
The minutes of the Sept. 20-21 meeting, at which the U.S. central bank held rates steady, also showed the depth of division over timing.
""Several members judged that it would be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon if economic developments unfolded about as ... expected,"" the Fed said in the minutes.
Seventeen policymakers participated at the September meeting, of whom 10 had a vote. In the minutes, both voting members and the wider group were divided on how much more they can allow the labor market to strengthen before raising rates.
Some believe that with the United States already near full employment, inflation could rise too quickly if the Fed waits too long.
The minutes said ""it was noted that a reasonable argument could be made either for an increase at this meeting or for waiting for some additional information on the labor market and inflation.""
U.S. stocks rose slightly following the release of the minutes, while yields on U.S. government debt pared earlier gains.
""They just want a bit more data to be sure. We think they will have those data by the time of the December meeting,"" said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Three voting members of the rate-setting committee dissented in the September policy statement in favor of an immediate hike, the first time since 2011 that so many have taken such action in the same direction at a single meeting. 
In that policy statement, the Fed incorporated new phrasing saying it would maintain current interest rate levels for ""the time being,"" widely seen as a hawkish signal.
According to the minutes, however, a few voters were concerned the inclusion of the phrase ""might be misread as indicating that the passage of time rather than the accumulation of evidence"" would drive future decision making.
Although Fed policymakers disagree on whether the current 1.7 percent inflation rate is sufficiently close to their 2 percent objective, many voting members remarked that ""there were few signs of emerging inflationary pressures.""
Since the meeting, Chair Janet Yellen and several other Fed policymakers have said they expect a rate hike by year-end should the labor market and inflation continue to strengthen.
Almost all agree that after another rate hike, the path of interest rates will be much shallower than the Fed's last tightening cycle. At the September meeting, the Fed scaled back the number of rate hikes it expects next year, to two from three.
New York Fed President William Dudley said earlier on Wednesday the Fed could afford to be ""gentle"" in raising rates as the U.S. economy has ""plenty of room to run.""
Last Friday's monthly jobs report for September showed that while employment gains are slowing, they are still well above the level required to offset population growth.
There are two more meetings scheduled this year, on Nov. 1-2 and Dec. 13-14. Traders have all but ruled out a move at the November meeting, which takes place just a week before the U.S. presidential election. They currently see about a 70 percent probability the Fed will raise rates in December, little changed from before the minutes, according to data from CME Group (NASDAQ:CME).

Yellen is scheduled to deliver a speech on Friday in Boston, which may offer insight into the Fed's latest thinking.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2016 12:40PM ET</span>","U.S. job openings hit eight-month low, labor market still strong","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell to an eight-month low in August and hiring was little changed, suggesting some easing in labor market conditions amid an aging economic recovery. 
Still, details of the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report published on Wednesday continued to point to a solid jobs market, with a steady rise in the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs and declining layoffs.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, declined 388,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.4 million, the lowest level since December, after surging to a record high in July. That pushed down the jobs openings rate three-tenths of a percentage point to 3.6 percent, also the lowest reading since December. 
""These data can be volatile and the openings rate is still fairly high, so it is too early to tell whether this is a signal or just the noise of volatile monthly data,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
""However, if this drop is sustained, it could be a sign of increased caution on the part of businesses.""
The JOLTS report is one of the job market metrics on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. Fed officials view the labor market as being at or near full employment. 
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to increase interest rates in December, having kept borrowing costs steady over course of the year because of persistently low inflation.
The decline in job openings in August was led by professional and business services, where vacancies fell 223,000. Job openings in the durable goods manufacturing industries decreased 29,000, and dropped 28,000 in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector.
""The bigger concern in the data is that openings declined year-over-year in some high-wage industries, like finance, professional services, and information,"" said Jed Kolko, chief economist for job site Indeed in San Francisco.
""Plus, last Friday's jobs report showed slower job growth in higher-wage industries. These factors are worth watching.""The number of hires was little changed at 5.2 million in August, keeping the hiring rate steady at 3.6 percent.
Job growth is slowing, with nonfarm payrolls increasing 156,000 in September. Employment growth has so far this year averaged 178,000 jobs per month, down from an average gain of 229,000 positions per month in 2015. 
With the bulk of the labor market slack largely absorbed and the economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession aging, the slowdown in payrolls growth is normal. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create about 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth.
Layoffs slipped to 1.62 million in August from 1.64 million in July, the JOLTS report showed. About 3.0 million Americans quit their jobs in August, maintaining a recent trend. The quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of confidence in the jobs market, was at 2.1 percent for a third straight month.

""Nearly two-thirds of job separations are people voluntarily quitting rather than getting laid off or fired. That's a good indicator that workers are confident they will find new jobs,"" said Kolko.

Eurostat said industrial production in the 19-member single currency bloc in August increased by 1.6 percent during the month and by 1.8 percent year-on-year.
The readings were above the average forecasts of a 1.5 percent monthly increase and a 1.1 percent year-on-year improvement in a Reuters poll of economists.
Euro zone output therefore offset a revised 0.7 percent fall in July and continued a six-month pattern in which declines in one month are followed by increases the following month.
The monthly increase of production in August was broadly spread, except for non-durable consumer goods, such as clothes, for which output was down 0.6 percent.
The strongest increase was of 4.3 percent in the month for durable consumer goods, such as cars or fridges, followed by capital goods, such as machinery, which rose 3.5 percent.
Energy production was up 3.3 percent and output of intermediate goods was 1.4 percent higher.

377,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2016 11:00PM ET</span>","Japan machinery orders fall less than expected, suggesting firmer capex","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders fell much less than expected in August, suggesting a relatively firm pickup in capital expenditure that is seen as crucial for sustainable economic growth.
Cabinet Office data on Wednesday showed core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 2.2 percent in August from the previous month.
That fall was much smaller than the 5.5 percent decline expected by a Reuters poll of economists, following a 4.9 percent increase in July.
Compared with a year earlier the core orders, which exclude ships and orders from the electric power utilities, increased 11.6 percent in August, versus a 6.5 percent gain expected by economists.
Japanese policymakers are counting on capital spending to foster sustainable growth in the world's third largest economy, but businesses have been slow to invest in the face of sluggish demand, the yen's gains and external headwinds.
Capital expenditure has recently shown some signs of a pickup as demand for smartphones has kept the information and technology sector humming, although some analysts doubt it is sustainable.
""Capital spending is holding firm although it is not so strong as being a driver of GDP growth,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities.
""The risk would be a spike in the yen beyond 100 to the dollar, which would discourage manufacturers to invest.""
In August, manufacturers' orders fell 4.0 percent, dragged down by sectors such as steel and chemicals, while the services sector's orders declined by 1.9 percent, weighed by weak demand from the communications and agriculture sectors.
The Cabinet Office maintained its assessment of machinery orders, saying a pickup was seen, with an official saying that the core orders would rise 8.5 percent in the third quarter even if they turn flat in September.
The Bank of Japan's tankan survey showed this month that big firms plan to raise capital spending by 6.3 percent for fiscal 2016 from the previous year, suggesting there is still appetite for investment despite the yen's gains.
Japanese companies have been hesitant to boost investment in recent years, due to uncertainty over the economic outlook, even as they reaped record profits thanks to a weak yen under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's aggressive stimulus policy.
Capital expenditure grew about 5 trillion yen ($48.59 billion) over the past three years to some 70 trillion yen in fiscal 2015 – still 10 percent below levels seen in fiscal 2007 just before the global financial crisis - while net profits rose about 15 trillion yen.

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly influential gauge of prices for the U.S. central bank, found that median year-ahead inflation expectations tumbled to 2.5 percent last month, its lowest recorded level, from 2.8 percent in August.
Three-year ahead expectations slid to 2.6 percent, from 2.7 percent, to near a record low. Both of the price measures have been gradually declining since the online survey began in mid-2013.
Other national price measures have edged higher in recent months, though inflation remains below a Fed target. The Fed, looking to raise interest rates before year end, wants to see signs of inflation pressures before acting. 

The New York Fed survey, in which an outside group taps a rotating sample of 1,200 households, also found that median one-year ahead earnings growth decreased to 2.0 percent last month, from 2.4 percent in August.

In a report, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment rose to 6.2 this month from September’s reading of 0.5. Analysts had expected the index to increase to 4.3 in October.
On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism.
The Current Conditions Index rose to 59.5 this month from 55.1 in September, above below expectations for an increase to 55.5.
Additionally, the index of euro zone economic sentiment increased to 12.3 in October from 5.4 a month earlier. Consensus was looking for an increase to 6.3.
ZEW president professor Achim Wambach commented that the improvement in sentiment reflected a sign of relatively robust economic activity in Germany.
“However, positive impulses from industry and exports should not distract from existing political and economic risks,” Wambach warned.
“In particular, the risks concerning the German banking sector are currently a burden to the economic outlook,” he added, evidently referring to recent concern surround  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and the fine from the U.S. Department of Justice.
EUR/USD was trading at 1.1114 from around 1.1115 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.9043 from 0.9046 earlier.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank is forecast to keep interest rate policy on hold on Thursday as board members weigh the risks from household debt growing any faster, a Reuters poll found on Tuesday.
All but one of 24 economists surveyed by Reuters expect Governor Lee Ju-yeol and his board to leave the policy rate at a record low 1.25 percent following an unexpected cut in June and board votes to hold through September. 
The sole prediction for another cut, to 1 percent, came from Korea Investment & Securities, and a slim majority of 14 economists said they see a reduction coming soon. 
Some analysts, including those at Nomura Holdings,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank Korea, and HMC Investment & Securities pushed back their predictions of a rate cut and pointed out the rapid expansion in household debt as a renewed risk to growth. 
South Korea's economic growth is being stifled by a slump in global demand and soaring household debt, highlighting the challenge of turning around exports that have fallen for just about all of the last 20 months while simultaneously stabilising financial markets against the volatility that could follow more policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Lawmakers berated the Bank of Korea (BOK) earlier this month in a parliamentary audit for not taking adequate measures to curb the household debt that rose to a record high of 1,257.3 trillion won ($1.13 trillion) in the June quarter.
Legislators accused the central bank of fuelling the debt surge when it started lowering interest rates from 2014, and cutting policy rates five times in total since then.
The minutes from the BOK's September meeting suggest the BOK may be in no rush to cut interest rates again, as board members warned against rising household debt and excessive credit growth on the back of loose monetary policy.
Inflation stepped up to a seven-month high of 1.2 percent in September from a year earlier, accelerating sharply from 0.4 percent in August.
Lee Jae-hyung, an economist at Yuanta Securities Korea said the growing inflationary pressure allows the BOK more room to delay any cuts.
The bank is due to revise its economic forecasts and hold an inflation briefing on Thursday afternoon.  

It currently sees gross domestic product expanding 2.7 percent this year, and consumer prices rising 1.1 percent.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2016 01:30AM ET</span>",Bank of Japan seen holding off more stimulus for now unless yen rises sharply: Reuters poll,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to wait until next year before easing policy further unless any sharp spikes in the yen undermine the economy significantly in the meantime, a Reuters poll found.
Last month the central bank switched the focus of its stimulus program to targeting market interest rates after years of massive asset buying failed to push up inflation. 
About 70 percent of the analysts who answered an extra question said the BOJ would add more stimulus at its January meeting or later, while a handful of analysts predicted the central bank would ease further at its Oct. 30-Nov. 1 meeting when it releases its long-term growth and inflation outlook.
But several analysts said the central bank would keep to its current pace of stimulus, saying they had no specific forecast of when it would next take action.
""Our main scenario is that the BOJ will stand pat if the yen stays at the current level,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""But there is a chance that the BOJ will lower interest rates further if the yen rises to around 95 yen per dollar in case the Federal Reserve decides not to raise interest rates this year.""
The yen was trading at around 103.90 yen per dollar  on Tuesday, after hitting a one-month low beyond 104 yen last week.
Tokuda said the BOJ faces less pressure to implement more stimulus after shifting its focus to interest rates and dropping the two-year timeframe to hit its 2 percent inflation target. Instead, it now wants to meet the target as early as possible.
The BOJ dropped its explicit target of increasing base money by an annual 80 trillion yen ($777.45 billion), in what some analysts said was a tacit admission its aggressive asset-buying was becoming unsustainable. 
The Reuters poll predicted the BOJ would cut the -0.1 percent interest rate it levies on a small portion of commercial bank reserves to -0.2 percent in the third quarter next year, and would keep the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around zero percent throughout next year. 
The poll was taken between Sept. 30-Oct. 10. 
Some respondents predicted the BOJ would implement more easing at its next meeting. 
""There is a possibility that the BOJ will lower its price projection for next fiscal year and the bank is expected to ease further by cutting the short-term interest rates,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
But he added that comments by BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda at the weekend suggested there was not a significant chance of further easing by the central bank now.
Kuroda said the central bank will deepen negative interest rates or expand asset purchases if external shocks hit the economy but he also said he saw no immediate need to top up stimulus.
Asked what the intentions behind the BOJ's new policy framework were, about half the 31 analysts who answered said it was to secure the sustainability of monetary easing as the BOJ was seen reaching its JGB-buying limit soon, or to help banks which could be damaged by negative interest rates.
Over 30 percent of the analysts said the BOJ's new policy framework intended ""to strengthen monetary easing"". Around 20 percent said it was ""to prepare for a future exit strategy"". 
Asked what measures the BOJ would likely take when it decides to ease again, 21 analysts opted for only cutting negative interest rates, while 12 said it would further lower negative interest rates and the 10-year JGB yield target. 
This question allowed multiple answers.

Five respondents said the BOJ would increase its purchases of exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts, or commercial paper and corporate bonds.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports rebounded more than expected in August, recording their biggest rise in more than six years and dispelling fears that Europe's biggest economy is heading for a slowdown.
Seasonally adjusted exports rose by 5.4 percent, the largest rise since May 2010, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Monday, while imports increased by 3.0 percent.
The data signals that exports, which had been weakening and losing their traditional role as the main growth driver in Germany, will contribute to an expected expansion in the third quarter.
Analysts linked the jump in exports to an improving economy in China, but they warned that world trade remains weak and risks are high, especially from a possible ""hard"" exit by Britain from the European Union.
""This is a welcome amendment. But world trade remains very weak. And there are new risks - for instance that of a hard Brexit,"" said Thomas Schilbe of HSBC Trinkaus. ""The economy in China has stabilized. This is good for producers of capital goods.""
Weak data in July had raised concerns that the German economy will slow in the third quarter. But those concerns have largely quelled by positive figures in recent weeks.
Industrial production rose more than expected in August, posting its biggest increase since January to rebound from the steepest fall in 23 months last month.
The government raised its growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent, which would be the strongest expansion in half a decade.
""The light is green for the German economy to thrust into growth in the second half of the year,"" said Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank. ""The overall growth rate in 2016 could come in better than expected.""
A Reuters poll had pointed to exports rising by 2.2 percent and imports posting a 0.7 percent increase.

The jump in exports widened the seasonally adjusted trade surplus to 22.2 billion euros ($24.87 billion) from 19.4 billion euros in July. The August reading was above the Reuters consensus forecast of 20.0 billion euros.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy appears to be losing steam, with major business surveys showing a marked slowdown in the services sector and boardrooms beset by doubt about the future following the country's vote to leave the European Union.
While the economy has fared better than most economists expected since June's Brexit vote - largely thanks to upbeat consumers - Monday's surveys will heighten concerns about its longer-term prospects.
Key measures of business investment and turnover confidence hit four-year lows in the third quarter, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said in its Quarterly Economic Survey of 7,000 businesses - the largest of its kind.
Separately, chief financial officers (CFOs) in major British firms reported only a partial rebound in business morale after a post-Brexit vote nosedive, accountants Deloitte reported.
Investors have become increasingly concerned that Britain will lose many of the preferential trading terms it has with the EU - a so-called ""hard Brexit"" - pushing sterling to a fresh 31-year low against the dollar last week.
The Confederation of British Industry and other groups called on Saturday for the government to rule out the ""really worst"" trade options, to unblock investment held up by fears that the government will prioritize other goals in Brexit talks.
While the BCC survey offered some signs the weak pound has boosted manufacturing exports, it also pointed to a noticeable slowdown among services companies that form the backbone of Britain's private sector economy.
""The slowdown in services is concerning because it obviously is the dominant sector in the UK economy. It's slowed down to levels we haven't seen in several years,"" Adam Marshall, the BCC's acting director general, told Reuters.
He added that it was important not to read too much into a single quarter's data, pointing out that growth appeared to be slowing before the referendum.
Investors have become increasingly doubtful that the Bank of England will cut interest rates again this year, given robust consumer spending and sterling's renewed plunge. 
But policymakers will regard the BCC and Deloitte surveys as consistent with their view that the economy will slow markedly next year.
The BCC said its latest survey - which was conducted between Aug. 22 and Sept. 12 - is in line with its forecast that economic growth in 2017 will amount to just 1 percent, half its average rate since the 2008-09 recession. 
INVESTMENT FADING
The BCC's gauges of manufacturers' plans to spend on plant and machinery, and service sector investment in staff training, each fell to their lowest levels since the third quarter of 2012 - around the last time Britain flirted with recession.
""A lot of businesses have decided to step back and take stock before proceeding with investments over the coming months,"" the BCC's Marshall said.
""It's probably a logical response to uncertainty, but it makes it all the more important that the (finance minister's) autumn statement delivers positive steps to 'crowd in' business investment and build business confidence,"" he said.
Finance minister Philip Hammond last week pledged to protect British businesses from turbulence during negotiations to leave the EU, but warned economic confidence could go ""on a bit of a rollercoaster"". He is due to set out his economic policy in his autumn statement on Nov. 23. 
The Deloitte survey - conducted at 124 large firms from Sept. 12 to Sept. 26 - suggested the outlook for capital expenditure and hiring improved in the third quarter, compared with its previous poll of CFOs taken in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote.
""The animal spirits of the corporate sector took a battering in the wake of the referendum and, three months on, Brexit continues to loom large for the UK corporate sector,"" Deloitte chief economist Ian Stewart said.
""CFOs remain concerned about the long-term impact of Brexit and two-thirds believe it will lead to a deterioration in the UK business environment.""
Some 40 percent of CFOs said they expected to cut investment over the next three years, down from 58 percent just after the referendum, while 46 percent expected hiring to slow, down from 66 percent before.
Rising inflation looks likely to be another issue for businesses next year.

The BCC survey showed a sharp increase in the proportion of manufacturers expecting to increase prices, reflecting a sharp increase in raw material costs - in part due to sterling's weakness.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2016 04:36PM ET</span>",U.S. job growth slows; markets bet on December rate hike,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth eased for the third straight month in September and the jobless rate rose, but the slowdown was not expected to prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates later this year.
The Labor Department's report on Friday suggested the economy was on firm ground, but not growing so swiftly as to knock the U.S. central bank off its game plan of raising borrowing costs only gradually.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 156,000 last month, down from a gain of 167,000 in August. The unemployment rate ticked up a tenth of a percentage point to 5.0 percent as more Americans rejoined the labor force.
Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer, speaking at an event in Washington, said the jobs report was ""close"" to ideal, showing employment growth was neither too fast nor too slow.
When asked whether job creation last month was a ""Goldilocks"" outcome, Fischer said: ""It's pretty close.""
He did not address the Fed's rate hike plans directly. But his comments seemed consistent with what some policymakers have described as its ""base case"" - a rate increase at the December policy meeting.
A healthy job market could be an asset for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. She has argued that the Obama administration's policies have helped the economy create millions of jobs.
U.S. stocks fell, while prices for U.S. government debt were largely unchanged. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies, suggesting traders had scaled back bets on a rate increase next month. Rate futures, however, continued to point to a hike in December. 
DIVIDED FED
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create less than 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth. Average monthly job gains have been about 180,000 this year, which she has described as ""unsustainable."" 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected employers to add 175,000 jobs last month, with the jobless rate holding steady. The government said 7,000 fewer jobs were created in August and July than had been previously reported. 
Hourly wages for private sector workers rose 2.6 percent in September from the same month a year earlier, in line with expectations. Wage growth has shown signs of accelerating over the last year but remains slower than before the 2007-2009 recession.
""It's an economy that is doing okay. It's not necessarily accelerating, but it's certainly doing okay,"" said Jonathan Lewis, chief investment officer at Fiera Capital in New York. 
The employment report will be the last before the Fed's next policy meeting on Nov. 1-2. Investors see almost no chance of a rate increase at that meeting given how close it is to the election.
Yellen said last month that the Fed will likely raise rates once this year. It lifted its benchmark overnight rate at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held it steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation.
Three Fed policymakers voted for a hike last month when the central bank kept rates steady. However, Friday's data could boost the case of Fed officials who have vocally defended a go-slow approach to rate increases. 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has accused the central bank of playing politics by holding rates low, a charge Yellen and other Fed policymakers have denied.
Trump also has made reversing job losses at U.S. factories a key campaign promise. Manufacturing employment fell by 13,000 jobs in September and the sector has shed jobs in three of the last five months.
In a statement, David Malpass, a senior economic adviser to Trump, said the economy continued to fall short in terms of ""growth, income, trade and jobs.""
""Americans desperately need more jobs and new economic policies, not the same-old, same-old offered by the Clinton campaign,"" Malpass said.
In an appearance on CNBC, top White House economic adviser Jason Furman said the data showed the economy on a good path.
""We're seeing exactly what we want to see in the economy, which is continued steady job growth, it brings people back (into the labor force), that's driving up wages, and that's a good thing,"" Furman said.

The slowdown in the labor market last month was spread widely, with transportation and warehousing shedding 9,000 jobs and the healthcare and social assistance sector adding only 21,800 jobs, down from 45,300 a month earlier.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2016 02:50PM ET</span>",Brazil's inflation tumbles to lowest for September since 1998,"By Silvio Cascione and Christian Plumb
BRASILIA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation rate fell unexpectedly in September to its lowest for the month since 1998, paving the way for the central bank to ease cripplingly high interest rates and help pull the economy out of a harsh recession.
Consumer prices measured by the benchmark IPCA index <BRCPI=ECI> rose 0.08 percent in September, statistics agency IBGE said on Friday. That was below all 24 market forecasts in a Reuters poll and the lowest monthly reading since July 2014.
Prices rose 8.48 percent in the 12 months through September after an increase of 8.97 percent in the previous month.
The data fueled expectations that the annual inflation rate could plunge to the official 4.5 percent target by the end of 2017 even if the central bank starts cutting interest rates at its next policy meeting on Oct. 19. Yields on interest rate futures <0#2DIJ:> dropped across the board after the data was published.
Still, central bank chief Ilan Goldfajn sought to ease any market furor by warning that the pace of disinflation continues uncertain despite the sharp drop in September.
""The evolution of prices indicates an ongoing disinflationary process, but the speed of disinflation is still uncertain,"" Goldfajn told investors on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meeting in Washington.
Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles also struck a cautious tone, telling reporters in Washington that it remains to be seen if the downward trend would be long-lasting.
The lower print, though, is a sign that Brazil is slowly returning to normality after years of sharp price increases, Meirelles added.
Low inflation and rate cuts are seen as crucial to lifting Brazil's economy out of its worst recession in decades, in a boost to unpopular President Michel Temer and his ambitious agenda of budget reforms and privatizations.
Since last year, the central bank has kept its benchmark rate at 14.25 percent, its highest in a decade.
Yields on Brazil's interest rate futures indicate a 76-percent probability that the bank will cut the Selic by 25 basis points in October. The remaining 24 percent is for a 50-basis-point reduction.
The bank has insisted that any rate cuts would be conditioned to lower food prices, evidence of falling inflation and progress in Temer's fiscal agenda.
""One of the conditions that the central bank laid out to start cutting rates is becoming evident,"" said Newton Rosa, chief economist of SulAmerica Investimentos in Sao Paulo. ""But I think the outlook for the next few months remains relatively unclear, so the bank should still be cautious and start trimming rates only by 25 basis points this time.""
Goldfajn highlighted doubts about whether core inflation readings, which strips out volatile prices such as food, will also continue to drop.
The average for core inflation fell to 7.71 percent in the 12 months through September, from 8.08 percent in August. It was the first reading below 8 percent since June 2015, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) calculations.
Food prices fell 0.29 percent from August, giving back some unexpectedly sharp recent gains caused by unfavorable crop weather. Transportation costs and prices of household items also dropped in September, IBGE said.

Inventories dropped 0.2 percent during the month, the department said.
A drop in inventory investment weighed heavily on economic growth in the second quarter, and some economists believe the inventory correction is close to running its course. 
But stocks have edged lower in the first two months of the third quarter, which could drag on economic growth during the period.
The department's new monthly advance economic indicators report published last month had estimated that wholesale inventories fell 0.1 percent in August. Economists polled by Reuters expected that reading to be unrevised on Friday. 
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - fell 0.3 percent in August. 
Sales at wholesalers rose 0.7 percent in August, boosted by auto and farm product purchases.
At August's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.33 months to clear shelves, up from 1.34 months in July.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said businesses hired permanent staff last month at a similar rate to August after cutbacks in June and July, while a separate YouGov/Cebr survey of businesses showed a rebound in morale.
But pay rates for temporary staff rose at the slowest pace in more than three years, pointing to a risk that higher inflation could catch up with wage growth, the REC said.
""We hope the government will address this issue ... with fiscal stimulus. This should help to settle the nerves so that employers feel confident enough to keep hiring,"" REC policy director Tom Hadley said.
The REC also said Britain faced skill shortages and would continue to need workers from overseas in sectors such as engineering and healthcare.
""The business community must have a role in developing an immigration model that strikes the right balance,"" Hadley said.
Prime Minister Theresa May pledged earlier this week to curb migration from the EU. One of her ministers proposed requiring firms to state how many immigrants they employed and take steps to train more British staff.
A monthly survey by polling company YouGov and economics consultancy Cebr showed business sentiment had returned to the level seen in May and June, after a sharp fall in July and a partial recovery in August.
YouGov's Stephen Harmston said sentiment could deteriorate once businesses had taken on board May's emphasis on curbing EU migration in her speech at this week's Conservative Party conference, rather than on maintaining full access to the bloc's single market.
""We will have to wait to see whether the rebound in confidence is itself hard and resilient to such talk or whether it is soft and causes another spasm of panic among organizations,"" Harmston said. 
""Whichever it is, these figures could well represent the end of the pre-Brexit honeymoon period,"" he added.

The YouGov/Cebr poll of 500 'business decision makers' took place between Sept. 15 and Sept. 23.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to near a 43-year low, an indication of firmness in the labor market which may support an interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000 for the week ended Oct. 1, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 257,000 in the latest week.
First-time claims were the lowest since April, when initial applications for aid were at levels not seen since November 1973.
U.S. futures slightly trimmed losses following the release of the data, while the dollar held gains against a basket of currencies. Treasury debt yields were slightly higher.
The four-week moving average of new claims, seen as a better measure of labor market trends as it smoothes out volatility, fell 2,500 to 253,500 last week, the lowest level since December 1973.
It's the 83rd consecutive week claims have remained below 300,000, which is seen as indicative of a strong labor market.
The robust reading comes a day before the release of the closely watched September jobs report, although it has no direct bearing on that release as it falls outside the survey period for payrolls.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing by 175,000. The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 4.9 percent.
Jobs growth has been slowing but is still well above the threshold needed to absorb new entrants into the labor market. 
A report by global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday showed layoffs rose in September from a month earlier but were down from a year ago.
Employers announced plans to shed 44,324 workers from payrolls in September, 38 percent more than in August but 25 percent fewer than in September 2015.
Despite the September increase, the third quarter saw an overall decline in planned layoffs.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has said it is inclined to raise rates by the end of the year should the labor market and inflation continue to strengthen.

Thursday's claims report also showed continuing claims, which tallies how many people are still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, fell 6,000 to 2.058 million in the week ended Sept. 24. The four-week average fell 21,000 to 2.095 million. Those levels were last seen in 2000.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending October 1 decreased by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000 from the previous week’s total of 254,000, hovering just above a 40-year low reached back in April (248,000).
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 3,000 to 257,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended September 24 fell to 2.058 million from a revised 2.064 million (initially 2.062 million) in the preceding week.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to rise to 2.090 million.
The four-week moving average was 253,500, a decrease of 2,500 from the previous week's 256,000.
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2016 06:20AM ET</span>","Strong German data allay growth concerns, Merkel promises tax cuts","By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Strong demand from euro zone countries and domestic customers drove a bigger-than-expected rise in German industrial orders in August, suggesting factories will contribute to growth in Europe's economic powerhouse in coming months.
The surprisingly strong data, published by the Economy Ministry on Thursday, gave some relief after a batch of weak figures in July had raised concern that the German economy could be heading towards a sharp slowdown in the second half.
""Finally good news from industrial orders,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said, adding that continued strong demand from euro zone countries signaled a broader recovery in the bloc.
In a further positive sign for Germany's economic outlook, the BDI industry association raised its forecast for GDP growth this year to 1.9 percent from previously 1.7 percent.
Speaking at a BDI event in Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel said the economy was in a good shape and employment was rising, allowing for some fiscal flexibility while sticking to the government's goal of no new debt.
""The good budgetary situation is having a positive effect. We will be able to bring about small tax relief, which will amount to 6 billion euros for 2017 and 2018,"" Merkel said.
Merkel defended her controversial strategy to keep the budget balanced, a cornerstone in the election campaign of her conservatives ahead of next year's federal vote and a goal also known as the 'Schwarze Null' or black zero.
""I think solid fiscal policy is important also because of the demographic changes we're facing. The 'Schwarze Null' is not a fetish of uninspired people as some critics suggest, but it is the statement that we don't want to burden the next generation with even more new debt,"" Merkel said.
Speaking at the same BDI event, Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said more investment in infrastructure, schools and fast internet were needed to ensure Germany remained competitive.
Gabriel's Social Democrats, junior partner of the conservatives in the ruling coalition, have made boosting investments their election platform.
He added that given oil prices are expected to rise and dent private consumption, it made more sense for Germany to invest in its future rather than spend the budget surplus on tax cuts, a subtle criticism of the conservatives' election promise.
LIGHT UPTURN 
Contracts for goods 'Made in Germany' were up by 1.0 percent on the month, the industry data showed. That was the highest reading since March and far better than a Reuters consensus forecast for a rise of only 0.2 percent.
Domestic demand rose by 2.6 percent while foreign orders inched down. However, demand from euro zone countries rose by 4.1 percent, nearly offsetting a drop of 2.8 percent of contracts from outside the common currency bloc.
A rise in July was revised up a touch.
""Overall, the latest data point to a light upturn in the industrial sector over the rest of the year,"" the ministry added. Ifo's business sentiment survey and Markit's purchasing manager index for factories both improved in September.
After having grown by 0.7 percent in the first quarter and 0.4 percent in the second, the Germany economy is widely expected to lose some steam in the second half, hampered by sluggish demand from Asia and the United States.
Still, leading economic institutes last week raised their 2016 growth forecast to 1.9 percent, which would be the strongest rate in five years, mainly driven by soaring private consumption and higher state spending on migrants.
The government will update its own growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017 on Friday. It predicts a 1.7 percent expansion this year and 1.5 percent next year.
""While some people threw in the towel regarding German growth in the second half of the year, the wind has turned now,"" Gitzel said. ""Perhaps the recently improved forecasts for German growth are still a bit too conservative.""

Others struck a more cautious tone. ""One swallow does not make a summer,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen said on the rise in industrial orders in August, adding that the overall trend in the sector remained rather negative.

ROME (Reuters) - World food prices rose in September to their highest since March 2015, led mainly by sugar, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
Except for a small dip in July, the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index has been increasing steadily since January, when it hit a seven-year low.
The index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 170.9 points in September, 2.9 percent above the month before and 10 percent higher than the same month last year.
Sugar prices surged 6.7 percent in September from the previous month, largely because of bad weather in Brazil, the world's biggest sugar producer and exporter, FAO said.
While cereal prices declined slightly, meat edged up and dairy and vegetable oil prices increased.
""A lot of the September increase has to do with sugar, so if sugar were to stop increasing, the index would be more or less flat,"" said FAO senior economist Abdolreza Abbassian. ""But the scope for big declines is not there.""
FAO raised slightly its forecast for world cereal production in the 2016-17 season rose to 2.569 billion tonnes, which would be a new record high and a 1.5 percent increase on the previous season. World wheat output is seen at 742.4 million tonnes, up slightly from the previous forecast of 740.7 million tonnes.
Cereal stocks are seen at 659.9 million tonnes in the 2016-17 season, down slightly from the previous month's forecast.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity rebounded to an 11-month high in September, an encouraging sign for economic growth that may increase the prospect of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.
The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing activity index surged to a reading of 57.1, the highest level since October 2015. Last month's reading followed a disappointing drop in August.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 53.0. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
""These data help the case for the Fed tightening again before too long,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.
Improvement in the index was broad-based with business activity and the employment sub-indices reaching 11-month highs. 
It followed similarly upbeat news on Monday when ISM reported U.S. factory activity shrugged off weakness in August..
The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies following the data on Wednesday. U.S. stocks were trading higher, while prices of U.S. Treasuries were largely weaker.
In a separate report, the U.S. Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods rose 0.2 percent in August, a second straight monthly increase following two months of weakness.
Economists had expected factory orders to rise 0.1 percent.
Core capital goods, seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans, increased 0.9 percent. 
The Atlanta Fed left its forecast for third-quarter GDP growth unchanged at a 2.2 percent annual rate after the data.
The U.S. central bank has indicated its baseline case is for a rate increase at the December policy meeting as long as the economy continues to strengthen. It grew a lackluster 1.0 percent during the first half of the year.
The Fed raised rates in December 2015, the first such move in nearly a decade, but has held them steady so far this year.
EYES ON PAYROLLS
Another report on Wednesday by a leading payrolls processor showed U.S. private employers added 154,000 jobs in September, slightly below economists' expectations. The more closely-watched monthly U.S. jobs report is scheduled for release on Friday.
The Commerce Department also reported earlier on Wednesday that the U.S. trade deficit rose more than expected in August as a jump in imports offset higher exports. The trade gap widened 3 percent to $40.73 billion.
Imports hit their highest level since September 2015 while exports were the highest since July of last year.

However, economists said the large gain in imports was partly due to a rise in intellectual property payments tied to broadcasting rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth fell last month to its weakest since the beginning of 2015, according to surveys providing the latest evidence the bloc's economy is losing momentum.
Businesses have reined in spending amid growing caution about the economic outlook and political uncertainty as Britain gears up to start divorce proceedings from the European Union and Germany and France face elections.
What growth existed last month was once again lopsided, which may concern policymakers, with only France showing signs of its upturn gaining momentum while growth trended lower in Germany, Italy and Spain.
""Anecdotal evidence suggests that economic and political uncertainty is weighing on euro area confidence, and we expect sentiment to be further dampened in the coming month as Brexit negotiations kick in,"" noted Apolline Menut at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""Increasing uncertainty and falling confidence underpin our forecast of deteriorating growth in Q4 2016 and Q1 2017.""
Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 52.6 in September, matching a flash estimate but below August's 52.9 and marking a low since January 2015. 
It has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013.
The PMI points to third quarter economic growth of 0.3 percent, Markit said, in line with a prediction from a Reuters poll last month which highlighted the need for fiscal stimulus rather than more aggressive monetary policy easing. [ECILT/EU]
Despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy the European Central Bank has so far failed to get inflation anywhere close to its near 2 percent target. Policymakers may take some cheer from data in the survey indicating firms held prices steady last month instead of cutting them. 
The output price index, which has held stubbornly below the 50 mark for most of the past five years, came in on the dividing line for the first time since September 2015.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro doubled to 0.4 percent in September from 0.2 percent in August, the EU's statistics agency Eurostat said on Friday.
Retail sales across the bloc dipped 0.1 percent in August after a rise in July was revised down to much weaker than initially estimated, official data showed on Wednesday.
It was a possible sign that Britain's vote to leave the EU may be having a greater impact on the euro zone than previously thought. 
Markets largely ignored the data.
FRANCE OUT FRONT
Of the biggest four economies in the bloc only France showed improvement, where services activity expanded in September at the fastest pace in 15 months as demand improved, although business was not as brisk as initially thought.
In Germany, near-stagnation in services put the brakes on overall private sector growth, highlighting the risk of a slowdown in Europe's biggest economy in the second half of the year.
Services PMIs for both Spain and Italy also slipped.
That meant overall growth in the bloc's dominant service industry dwindled. The PMI fell to 52.2 from 52.8, just above the flash 52.1 reading but its lowest level since late 2014.
In contrast, manufacturing activity in the euro zone picked up last month as demand increased from both within and outside the currency bloc, a sister survey showed on Monday, driving factories to increase headcount. [EUR/PMIM]
However, with growth rates falling, services firms took on fewer new workers than they did in August. The employment sub-index fell to a five-month low of 52.0 from 52.4.

Unemployment held steady in August at 10.1 percent, the joint lowest level since 2011.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 52.6 last month from a reading of 52.9 in August.
Analysts had expected the index to fall further to to 52.0.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Markit indicated that the U.K. service sector continued to recover from “July’s EU referendum-induced shock” with new business growing at the fastest rate since February.
The research firm did note that the weakening sterling led to the largest input cost rise since February 2013.
“The survey results suggest that the economy has regained modest growth momentum since the EU referendum, with further service sector expansion accompanied by a return to growth in construction and an especially strong revival of manufacturing.,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
Williamson highlighted that the combined reads from these three sectors suggested that growth was the strongest since January, “fuelling greater job creation as companies shrugged off short-term Brexit worries and enjoyed the benefits of a weaker currency.”
This economist forecast that the improvement translated to growth of approximately 0.1% for the third quarter, but insisted that the growth was weakened by the July-low that was impacted by Brexit uncertainty.
Williamson said that September's data will cast doubt on the need for further stimulus from the Bank of England at this time, but widespread concern about the potential future impact of the Brexit means that “policy action later in the year cannot be ruled out.”
Immediately following the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2726 from around 1.2737 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8821 from 0.8809 earlier.

Retail mall vacancies fell to 7.8 percent from 7.9 percent, the firm said in a report on Tuesday.
Asking and effective rents for shopping centers rose for a third straight quarter, while rent growth rate was unchanged from the second quarter at 0.4 percent, Reis said.
""We continue to expect vacancy rates for neighborhood and community centers to slowly drift lower and rent growth to increase at a slightly faster rate,"" Barbara Denham, senior economist at Reis, said.
The national vacancy rate for neighborhood and community shopping centers rose to 10 percent, up 10 basis points from the second quarter.
Construction activity accelerated with 2.53 million square feet of new neighborhood and community center space completed during the third quarter, the highest level of completions in the past four quarters.
Net absorption, which is measured in terms of available retail space sold in the market during a certain time period, plummeted over 96 percent from the second quarter to a paltry 143,000 square feet.
Denham said the fall in net absorption was a ""troubling finding"" and attributed the reduction to ""a delayed response to tepid economic conditions in the first quarter.""
""With job growth and gains in median family income across the U.S., the retail recovery should continue,"" Denham added.

The British Retail Consortium said shop prices overall in September were 1.8 percent lower than a year earlier, compared with a 2.0 percent decline in August.
Food prices declined by 1.3 percent compared with September last year, the biggest fall since the survey started nearly 10 years ago, despite global commodity prices recording their sharpest rise since September 2011.
""Fierce competition is playing a vital role in keeping prices down,"" the BRC said. ""Despite rising global food prices and the devaluation of the exchange rate, shop prices are still showing little sign of nearing inflationary territory.""
But with sterling hitting a 31-year low against the dollar on Tuesday as it extended losses made after Britain voted to leave the EU, the BRC expects prices to start to rise soon.
""The low levels of shop price deflation we have witnessed over the last few years will not be around for much longer, and we expect shop price deflation to be closer to zero at the turn of the year,"" the BRC said. 

Britain's broader official measure of inflation, the consumer prices index, rose 0.6 percent year-on-year in August, and many economists expect it to overshoot its 2 percent target next year, bearing down on consumer spending.

""Fleets are cautious due to an uncertain economy and slow freight growth,"" Don Ake, vice president of commercial vehicles at FTR, said in a statement. ""Class 8 (truck) inventories also remain high and this also restrains new orders.""
FTR said orders for large trucks hit 13,800 units in September, a number not reached for that month since the height of the Great Recession.
Class 8 trucks are the workhorse of America's economy, hauling around 70 percent of the country's freight.
Sales have been weak this year amid lackluster retail sales and industrial output. Industry officials and analysts predict sales will start to rebound in 2017 as long as the U.S. economy grows at a more stable rate.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. consumers, bolstered by growth in jobs and disposable income, are likely to loosen their wallets and push holiday sales up 3.6 percent, the leading retail industry group said on Tuesday.
The National Retail Federation forecast sales of $655.8 billion for November and December, excluding autos, gasoline and dining out. This implies significantly higher growth than the 10-year average increase of 2.5 percent and 3 percent in 2015.
The forecast is an economic benchmark for the holiday season, which can account for 20 to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of gross domestic product.
""Our forecast is reflective of the growth in the economy. ... Consumers are in a stronger position compared to where they have been over the last few years,"" federation Chief Executive Matthew Shay said on a media call.
Wage growth, stronger job creation and low inflation have all contributed to the economic momentum, he said.
Online sales will rise by 7 percent to 10 percent during the holiday season to as much as $117 billion, the group said. 
U.S. retail sales in August fell 0.3 percent, more than expected, on weaker demand for automobiles and other items after an upwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in July.
Growth this year has been driven by lower-income consumers who favor retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT) as retailers raised wages and unemployment fell.
Sales have not been as strong at department stores like Macy's (N:M) which cater to middle-income shoppers.
Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist of the federation, said issues like the presidential election could affect spending in a few states and communities as political uncertainty may force some consumers to hold back on their purchases. However, it will not impact their overall holiday spending plans, he said.
Kleinhenz said he expected consumer spending to continue a two-year trend of shifting from goods toward services like dining and travel, he said.
The first major shopping weekend of the holiday season, which includes Black Friday, may remain subdued but will not reflect this season's results, the retail group said.
Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, has for decades been regarded as the start of the holiday shopping season, but growth in early discounts and online shopping has reduced its significance for U.S. shoppers.
The National Retail Federal said it expected retailers to hire 640,000-690,000 seasonal workers, similar to levels in the past couple of years.
Other retail forecasts also expect a pickup in holiday sales. Deloitte's retail group predicted gains of 3.5 to 4 percent, and consulting firm AlixPartners estimated growth of 3.3 to 4 percent.

(Reuters) - Borrowing by small U.S. firms rose in August, in part because the month had more business days than July, and the percentage of firms late on repaying existing loans also increased, data released on Tuesday showed.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index rose to 133.7 in August from an upwardly revised 123.1 in July, which had three fewer working days. Borrowing by companies in most industries, except construction and recreation, fell.
""It's malaise, rather than freefall,"" said Bill Phelan, PayNet's president.
Companies also struggled to pay back existing debts, PayNet data showed. Loans more than 30 days past due rose in August to 1.63 percent, the fifth straight monthly increase and the highest delinquency rate since December 2012.
The figures come as the Federal Reserve mulls the timing of its next rate hike. Higher interest rates tend to slow economic growth. Movements in the index typically correlate with movements in gross domestic product growth a quarter or two ahead.
The U.S. economy grew an estimated 1.4 percent in the second quarter, though many economists believe that rate improved in the third quarter.
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because small companies tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains.
PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.3 from August’s reading of 49.2.
Economists had expected the index to drop to 49.0 in September.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
This was the first growth in the business activity since last May and included the fastest increase in new orders for the last six months.
Markit noted that a solid upturn in housing activity offset the decline in commercial work.
“Resilient housing market conditions and a renewed upturn in civil engineering activity helped to drive an overall improvement in construction output volumes for the first time since the EU referendum,” Markit senior economist Tim Moore.
“A number of survey respondents noted that Brexit-related anxiety has receded among clients, although it remained a factor behind the ongoing decline in commercial building work,” he added.
Moore noted that construction firms appeared optimistic on the near-term outlook on the back of the fast rise in new orders and positive economic newsflow in general.
He did warn that the growth trajectory still remained on a much weaker path than that seen at the start of 2016 and that the weak pound contributed to a sharp acceleration in cost inflation.

Exports are expected to remain, weak, however, while fixed asset investment is likely to hover near 17-year lows, leaving the economy imbalanced and highly reliant on a rebound in heavy industry and government spending for growth. 
""Firmer manufacturing activity points to faster GDP growth,"" ING's chief Asia economist Tim Condon wrote in a note on Tuesday, pointing to factory surveys last week.
""We revised our second-half GDP forecast to 6.8 percent from 6.5 percent and our full-year growth forecast to 6.7 percent from 6.6 percent."" 
Improving growth would reinforce views that the People's Bank of China will be in no hurry to cut interest rates this year and could even keep them on hold through 2017, he added.
China's steel demand should continue to strengthen on strong investment in housing and infrastructure, analysts at ANZ believe.
But the property market is showing signs of overheating, with a growing number of cities imposing restrictions on home purchases to curb soaring prices.
The September data deluge will kick off with foreign exchange reserves on Friday, followed by trade and inflation on Oct. 13 and 14, respectively.
Industrial output, investment and retail sales will be released on Oct. 19 along with second-quarter gross domestic product. Loan and money data will be released Oct. 10-15.
Economists polled by Reuters expected forex reserves dipped again to $3.18 trillion after dropping to the lowest since 2011 in August after the central bank intervened to support the yuan currency as it weakened to near six-year lows.
September exports likely fell 3 percent from a year earlier, slightly worse than in August and pointing to still sluggish global demand.
Imports may have grown 1 percent, after unexpectedly rising 1.5 percent in August for the first time in nearly two years, boosted by coal and other commodities and stronger domestic demand.
China's trade surplus is forecast to have expanded to $53 billion in September, versus August's $52.05 billion. 
The consumer inflation rate may have picked up slightly to 1.6 percent on-year after falling in August to 1.3 percent, the slowest since October 2015.
Producer price deflation will continue to ease thanks to higher commodity prices, driving stronger profits for industrial firms. Economists predict a decline of only 0.3 percent after a drop of 0.8 percent in August.
And despite concerns about rapidly rising debt, policymakers likely remained generous about supplying credit. 
New yuan loans likely rose to 1 trillion yuan ($149.96 billion) in September, after more than doubling in August to 948.70 billion yuan. 
However, analysts warn much of the growth was likely due to strong mortgage demand, highlighting the risks to the banking system if property prices pop.
Growth in outstanding loans likely dipped to 12.9 percent, while M2 money supply is expected to have risen 11.6 percent in September, picking up from 11.4 percent in August.
In recent months money supply data has suggested many Chinese companies are hoarding cash rather than investing it, adding to views that further central bank easing would not be as effective in spurring economic growth as in the past. 
Fixed asset investment growth for Jan-Sept is expected to edge up marginally to 8.2 percent but remain around the weakest pace since December 1999.
Strong government spending would likely contrast with further weakness in private investment, which grew just 2.1 percent in the first eight months of the year, remaining at record lows.
Growth in industrial output likely ticked up to 6.4 percent in September from August, while retail sales growth likely remained steady at 10.6 percent.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank left interest rates at 1.5 percent on Tuesday as it weighs the effect of past easing and the biggest-ever boom in apartment building helps underpin economic activity and jobs growth.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) surprised no one with its decision. All 57 economists polled by Reuters had expected no change this week after cuts in August and May. 
The Australian dollar  barely reacted to the news.
The RBA's new governor, Philip Lowe, also resisted any temptation to signal a bias to ease again saying only that an unchanged stance was ""consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.""
Markets have been lengthening the odds of a cut since Lowe recently signaled that he was comfortable with the economic outlook and reluctant to take rates ever lower.
In particular, Lowe noted that a long slump in mining investment was past its worst and prices for some key commodity exports, notably coal and iron ore, had rebounded.
Interbank futures imply only a one-in-four chance of a cut by Christmas <0#YIB:> and have around 16 basis points of easing priced in for all of next year.
""We think the case for no more cuts is strengthening,"" says Paul Bloxham, chief economist Australia at HSBC. ""Economic growth is strong, commodity prices have risen, and the drag from the mining investment decline is set to fade.""
The economy expanded at an annual pace of 3.3 percent in the year to June, in part thanks to a surge in home building that has some way to run yet.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out earlier on Tuesday showed approvals to build new homes slipped only 1.8 percent in August. Analysts had looked for a drop of around 7 percent as payback for a 12 percent jump in July.
APARTMENT LIVING
A generational shift to apartments and away from houses saw multi-unit approvals up over 26 percent on August last year.
The shift is likely to make the building cycle longer than in the past simply because it takes much more time to complete apartment towers. 
Such is the pipeline of new projects that the RBA has warned it could lead to a glut of unsold property and downward pressure on prices, particularly in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.
Fearing eventual defaults, the major domestic banks have already stepped back from funding the apartment sector. Yet money has still been forthcoming from foreign banks and self-managed retirement funds.
Some pullback in home prices might not be unwelcome. Figures from property consultant CoreLogic out this week showed values in Sydney rising at an annual pace of 10.2 percent, with Melbourne not far behind at 9 percent.
Since the upturn began in mid-2012, prices across the capital cities have increased by 41 percent.
The bonanza in home building has also created thousands of construction jobs and helped offset weakness in mining. Australia's unemployment rate hit a three-year low of 5.6 percent in August and leading indicators of labor demand point to further gains ahead.
Job advertisements, for instance, eased 0.3 percent in September but that followed a 1.7 percent jump the previous month, according to a survey from ANZ.

A recently released government measure of job vacancies climbed 4.5 percent in the three months to August to reach a four-year peak.

Asking and effective rents both expanded 0.9 percent during the quarter, compared with a 1.1 percent growth rate in the second. This was the third consecutive quarter of decelerating year-over-year rent growth. 
""Developers had enjoyed healthy rent growth and significant pre-leasing just a few short years ago when the housing market was struggling to gain footing. But since then developers have been overbuilding in some markets as demand has ebbed somewhat,"" Reis economist Barbara Denham said in a statement.
New construction fell to 37,744 units delivered in the third quarter, a sharp decline from 53,587 units in the second, suggesting that developers were not rushing to complete construction.
However, Reis cautioned that the new construction figure for the third quarter was preliminary, and the number could be revised upward as construction data is finalized. 
Net absorption totaled 37,693 units in the third quarter, the lowest level since mid-2013, likely reflecting a delayed response to the slowdown in employment at the start of 2016, Denham said.
New York remained the most expensive market with effective rents registering $3,441 per unit per month, followed by San Francisco at $2,481 per unit per month, the report said.
Sacramento, California remained the tightest market in the United States, having the lowest vacancy rate of 2.1 percent.

Reis said it expects the national vacancy rate to continue to increase in 2016, and rent growth to stay muted to below the 4 percent level on an annual basis until after the Presidential elections in November.

For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Philip Lowe, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Labour market conditions in the advanced economies have improved over the past year, but growth in global industrial production and trade remains subdued. Actions by Chinese policymakers have been supporting growth, but the underlying pace of growth in China has been moderating. Inflation remains below most central banks' targets.
Commodity prices have risen over recent months, following the very substantial declines over the past few years. The higher commodity prices have supported a rise in Australia's terms of trade, although they remain much lower than they have been in recent years.
Financial markets have continued to function effectively. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative. Government bond yields are near their historical lows.
In Australia, the economy is continuing to grow at a moderate rate. The large decline in mining investment is being offset by growth in other areas, including residential construction, public demand and exports. Household consumption has been growing at a reasonable pace, but appears to have slowed a little recently. Measures of household and business sentiment remain above average.
Labour market indicators have been somewhat mixed. The unemployment rate has fallen further, although there is considerable variation in employment growth across the country. Part-time employment has been growing strongly, while growth in full-time employment has been subdued. The forward-looking indicators point to continued expansion in employment in the near term.
Inflation remains quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some time.
Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 has been helping the traded sector. Financial institutions are in a position to lend for worthwhile purposes. These factors are all assisting the economy to make the necessary economic adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.
Supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards in the housing market. Separately, a number of lenders are also taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. Growth in lending for housing has slowed over the past year.
Turnover in the housing market has declined. The rate of increase in housing prices is lower than it was a year ago, although some markets have strengthened recently.
Considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Growth in rents is the slowest for some decades.
Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May and August meetings, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies' long-term inflation expectations weakened in September, a Bank of Japan survey showed, highlighting the difficult and drawn-out task the central bank faces in trying to conquer the country's deflationary mindset.
The survey shows how difficult it will be to encourage inflation even after the BOJ overhauled its policy framework in September when more than three years of massive debt purchases had still failed to spark price growth.
""The BOJ has already acknowledged weak inflation expectations, so I don't expect it to ease policy at its next meeting,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""I do expect the BOJ to lower its CPI forecasts. The BOJ says downside risks are coming from overseas. So far, these risks have not increased.""
Japanese companies expect consumer prices to rise an average 0.6 percent a year from now, lower than their projection three months ago, a central bank survey showed on Tuesday.
Three months ago, companies expected prices to rise 0.7 percent over the next year.
Firms polled by the BOJ, as part of its detailed ""tankan"" survey for September, also said they expect consumer prices to rise an annual 1.0 percent three years from now and an annual 1.0 percent five years from now.
The BOJ started the survey on corporate price expectations from the March 2014 tankan to gather more information on inflation expectations, which are key to its current stimulus program.
The central bank overhauled its policy framework last month to focus on controlling interest rates amid growing concerns that its aggressive purchases of government debt were becoming unsustainable.
The BOJ will continue to buy government debt to keep monetary policy easy, but its new framework offers more flexibility to reduce purchases if needed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factories ramped up activity in September, shaking off a one-month contraction in a sign America was resisting the downward pull of the sluggish global economy.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its index of national factory activity rose to 51.5 from 49.4 the prior month, beating analyst expectations in a Reuters poll. Levels above 50 indicate the sector is expanding.
""This is a relief,"" said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Factory output was a weak spot for the U.S. economy early in the year as a global slump weighed on American factories.
More recently, net exports added to economic growth in the second quarter and Monday's report showed signs factories' future sales could increase, with the ISM index for new orders rising to 55.1 from 49.1 in August.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while Treasury yields also moved higher and U.S. stocks fell.
Manufacturing is grappling with the lingering effects of a strong dollar and lower oil prices. Economic growth is also listless in major U.S. trading partners in the European Union and Asia. 
Activity in manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has also been undercut by an inventory correction. 
Another report on Monday showed U.S. construction spending fell for the second straight month in August to its lowest level in eight months, an unexpected drop driven by weakness across public and private sectors, including in home building.
The Commerce Department said construction spending dropped 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.142 trillion in August. Economists had expected outlays to rise 0.2 percent. 
The successive monthly declines in outlays suggest home building might not help economic growth in the third quarter and forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers cuts its expectation for GDP growth in the July-September quarter to a 2.6 percent annual rate from a 2.9 percent rate.

Consumer spending has been a major prop for economic growth this year and automakers on Monday reported total vehicle sales rose in September to a 17.76 million annualized rate. Compared to the same month a year earlier, however, sales were down slightly.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers posted September U.S. sales on Monday that were slightly lower than a year ago, despite big consumer discounts, as pickup truck volumes fell for both General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
Research firm Autodata Corp showed total industry sales at 1.44 million vehicles, down 0.5 percent for a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.76 million from 18.05 million in September 2015.
GM, the top-seller in the United States, posted a 0.6 percent decline. Ford reported an 8 percent drop, and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) was down 1 percent.
Shares of the three Detroit automakers rose, led by GM with a 0.8 percent gain.
Sales of Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) grew 1.5 percent; Honda Motor Co (T:7267) had a decline of 0.1 percent; and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) showed a 5 percent rise.
Mark Wakefield, head of North American automotive practice at consultancy AlixPartners, said in a telephone interview that demand for pickup trucks remained strong in part because of low gasoline prices, despite the September dip for the biggest sellers. He also noted that September 2015 sales had been extremely strong, at an annualized rate of 18 million vehicles.
Wakefield said the market has shifted to one of ""push"" from manufacturers rather than ""pull"" from consumers, with discounts of just over 10 percent of the average selling price of new vehicles for the last several months.
While Ford said that September was the best month in 2016 for its F-Series pickup truck, sales were still down 3 percent from a year earlier.
GM said pickup sales fell 15.5 percent for its Chevrolet Silverado and 8.5 percent for its GMC Sierra.
Spokesman Dan Flores said in a telephone call that GM was holding tight reins on discounts, also called incentives, for Silverado and Sierra. It has 89 days of supply for those trucks, which he said put it in a good position heading into the fourth quarter, historically the strongest for pickups.
Fiat Chrysler's Ram 1500 pickup truck showed a sales increase of 29 percent.
Fiat Chrysler spokesman Ralph Kisiel, responding by email to a Reuters query about rivals' claims that Ram pickup trucks were highly discounted, said the company has offered ""good deals"" on 2016 model trucks to make way for the new 2017 models.
Most analysts forecast a decrease in 2016 from last year's record sales of nearly 17.5 million vehicles.
The fourth quarter of 2015 was strong, so the next several months will present difficult comparisons, Wakefield said.
Industrywide spending for discounts rose $430 per vehicle from a year ago, Mark LaNeve, Ford's vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service, said on a conference call after the company reported sales.
J.D. Power, in a research note last week, estimated record September industry incentive spending.
In contrast to most analysts' expectations, Toyota and GM executives said on Monday that a new record this year was within reach.
""Industry sales in 2016 remain in line with last year's record levels,"" said Bill Fay, head of the Toyota brand in the U.S. market, told reporters on a conference call.

GM Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem said in a telephone interview on Monday, ""I don't see any downturn in the U.S. economy any time soon.""

The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 51.5 last month from August’s reading of 49.4.
Analysts had forecast a lesser increase to 50.3.
A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, below indicates contraction.
The new orders index also exited contraction, rising to 55.1 in September from 49.1 a month earlier.
The employment index improved to 49.7 last month from the prior 48.3, compared to a forecast for an increase to 49.0.
The prices paid index remained unchanged, as expected, at 53.0 from 53.0.
The release indicated that nine of the 18 industries reported an increase in new orders in September (up from six in August), and 10 of the 18 industries reporting an increase in production in September (up from eight in August).

LONDON (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in the euro zone picked up last month as demand increased from both within and outside the currency bloc, driving factories to increase headcount, a survey showed on Monday.
However, the upturn remained uneven and was centred on Germany and its neighbours. Growth was far weaker than earlier in the year in Spain, Italy and Ireland, while manufacturing in France continued to decline.
Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the bloc rose to 52.6 in September from 51.7 in August, unchanged from a flash estimate. An index measuring output also held above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, coming in at 53.8, above August's 53.3.
""The big picture is that there have been some modest improvements in the manufacturing outlook recently. But the big question is still what is going on in the service sector,"" said Ben May at Oxford Economics.
Growth in the bloc's dominant service sector was probably at its weakest since late 2014, a sister survey due on Wednesday is expected to show.
Still, a sub-index measuring new factory orders jumped to 53.4 from August's 18-month low of 51.4, registering one of its highest readings in the past year, and factories also accelerated hiring.
""For a region beleaguered by still-high overall unemployment, the fact that the upturn is generating more jobs is especially good news. The latest rise in factory payroll numbers was one of the best seen over the past four years,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Likely providing some good news for policymakers at the European Central Bank, the manufacturing upturn came despite firms only trimming prices by the smallest of margins.
Years of ultra-loose monetary policy have so far failed to get inflation anywhere near the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling, so any sign of the policy having an effect will be welcomed. Consumer prices grew 0.4 percent in September, official data showed on Friday.
Euro zone economies stuck in low gear need fiscal policy help rather than even more aggressive monetary policy easing, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters last month. [ECILT/EU]

In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI jumped to a seasonally adjusted 55.4 last month from a reading of 53.3 in August.
According to Markit, that was the highest level since June 2014.
Analysts had expected the index to drop to only 52.1 in August.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit indicated that growth of output, new orders and employment all strengthened and pointed to the fact that the weak exchange rate drove export orders and input prices higher.
“Rates of expansion in output and new orders accelerated further, rising at rates rarely achieved since the middle of 2014,” the report said.
Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, qualified the recovery from the July low after the U.K. decided to leave the European Union as “encouragingly strong” and suggested that it would “provide a further positive contribution to GDP in the third quarter”.
“The weak sterling exchange rate remained the prime growth engine, driving higher new orders from Asia, Europe, the USA and a number of emerging markets,” Dobson noted.
“The domestic market is also still supportive of growth, especially for consumer goods,” he added.
Immediately after the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2864 from around 1.2856 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8732 compared to 0.8738 prior to the report, and GBP/JPY traded at 130.38 compared to 130.43 earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among big Japanese manufacturers was flat in the three months to September and service-sector sentiment worsened to its lowest in nearly two years, the Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan survey showed on Monday, underscoring a fragile economic recovery.
Big firms plan to raise capital expenditure in the current fiscal year, the tankan survey showed, offering some relief to policy-makers hoping the Bank of Japan's aggressive stimulus will boost business investment. 
The results followed a mixed run of recent indicators, which highlighted doubts over whether years of massive money-printing are doing any good, as the central bank rebooted its monetary policy framework last month.
""Big manufacturers' sentiment showed itself relatively resilient considering the worsening environment such as a strong yen and weak domestic demand,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""Today's tankan itself is not the one to push the BOJ into further easing.""
The headline index gauging big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 6 in September, unchanged from three months ago and roughly in line with a median market forecast of plus 7, the quarterly survey showed.
By sector, motor vehicles rebounded due to fading effects of earthquakes that hit a manufacturing hub of Kumamoto earlier this year. On the other hand, general-purpose machinery, production machinery, shipbuilding and heavy machinery sank, reflecting weak overseas demand for capital goods. 
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment slipped to plus 18 from plus 19 three months ago, falling for three straight quarters and hitting the lowest level since December 2014, due to typhoons and a slowdown in spending by foreign tourists in the face of a strong yen. Markets had expected the lower reading.
Despite the yen's gains, however, Japanese firms' appetite for capital spending remained somewhat resilient.
Big firms plan to raise capital spending by 6.3 percent for this fiscal year to March from year-before levels, largely unchanged from three months ago. Markets had expected a 6.8 percent rise.
Big manufacturers based their business plans on the assumption the dollar would average 107.92 yen in the current fiscal year, down from 111.41 yen forecast three months ago.
The revised level, however, is still much higher than recent dollar/yen levels around 101 , suggesting that company profits could be revised down.
""Capital spending plans held relatively firm despite cuts in recurring profits caused by the yen's gains,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.

""This suggested that companies think they can cope with the current level of the yen. Weak investment overseas may prevent capital spending from accelerating ahead though.""

The 50-point level separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis.
Output increased for the second month in a row. While the gain was marginal, it was enough to spur the quickest pace of job creation since May.
New export orders rose for the first time in eight months but overall new orders shrank, pointing to still tepid domestic demand.
The final index for new export orders was 51.1, above a preliminary 50.2 and above a final 47.2 in the previous month.
Japan's economic growth slowed in the April-June quarter due to weakness in consumer spending and exports. Since then, there has been some positive data on capital expenditure, but consumer spending and consumer prices have disappointed.

Japan's government also has a 13.5 trillion yen stimulus package, which should support domestic demand amid worries about overseas demand.

""Overall, market demand was stable, market expectations were stable, and business activities were stable after August's recovery,"" Zhang Liqun, a government economist who advises the CFLP, said in a statement accompanying the release. ""Conditions for stabilization of the economy are gradually accumulating.""

The Confederation of British Industry said on Sunday its growth indicator, based on a poll of companies, fell to +3 in the third quarter of 2016, down from +8 in the three months to August and the lowest since March. 
The measure showed manufacturing output grew as the fall in the value of sterling after the Brexit vote helped exporters. But retailers and consumer services were broadly flat and business and professional services fell slightly. 
By contrast, expectations for the next three months jumped to +22, the highest level since September 2015 with growth expected across all sectors.
""Firms are confident that autumn will bring a surge in activity,"" Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, said. 
Britain's economy appears to have largely defied expectations of an immediate slump after the Brexit vote in June. Official data on Friday showed growth in the run-up to the referendum was higher than expected and the services sector grew strongly in July. 
However, the CBI said uncertainty over Britain's future relationship with the EU continued to depress optimism and investment plans, which would undercut productivity gains and economic growth in the longer term. 
Newton-Smith said businesses wanted clarity on the government's negotiating position in talks with the EU. They also wanted finance minister Philip Hammond to use his first budget statement on Nov. 23 to announce policies to ""drive investment and deliver economic growth and prosperity"".
Separately on Sunday, a survey showed small and medium-sized firms were expecting a 1.5 percent acceleration of revenue growth in the year ahead but almost a quarter had put off making business decisions because of the Brexit vote.

However, the Capital Economics SME Growth Tracker, which was commissioned by consultancy Enterprise Nation and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) UK, showed 43 percent of SMEs expect the economy will deteriorate over the next 12 months, compared with 24 percent who expect an improvement.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 50.4 in September, identical with the previous month's level. A reading above 50.0 shows growth on a monthly basis.
September's 50.4 reading matched the prediction of a Reuters poll. 
After a significant pick-up in March, China's official PMI slipped, falling below 50 in July before showing expansion in August. 
In an encouraging sign, new export orders increased in September, rising to 50.1 from the previous month's 49.7.
In September, output edged up to 52.8 from 52.6 in August, but the index for total new orders slipped to 50.9 from 51.3.
A sub-index for smaller firms fell, while performance at larger companies improved, a sign that the government's dependence on big state firms for growth this year has not changed.
Economists say the pattern over the past few months suggested sustained economic growth, but a growing dependence on government spending and an overheated property market may pose increased risks later this year with debt levels continuing to rise. 
Industrial profits rose at the fastest pace in three years in August, with rising sales and higher prices stimulated by a construction boom and heated property market.
STILL STRUGGLING 
But profits remained uneven, as traditional heavy industries with excess capacity such as steel still struggled for growth. 
Sectors like high-tech, auto manufacturing and shipbuilding showed strong expansion, the survey showed.
Jobs were again lost, though at a slower pace, with the employment sub-index rising to 48.6, compared to 48.4 in August. 
Job losses could be rising as the government has pledged broad capacity cuts across a range of industries.
Industrial over capacity remains one of the main drags on economic growth. 
Beijing has pledged to quicken the pace of its industrial capacity cuts, particularly in steel, after falling behind earlier in the year. 
China's state planner rejected a request in September by the nation's steel makers for coal mines to ramp up coking coal output to help ease supply tightness that has triggered a frenzied price rally.
China's slowing economy and problems with industrial over capacity have also reduced investment opportunities, a view reinforced by Fan Gang, a member of China's central bank monetary committee. Private investment grew just 2.1 percent in the first eight months of the year, remaining at record lows.
A similar official survey showed activity in China's services sector expanded at a slightly faster pace, with the official reading at 53.7 in September from 53.5 in August.
A measure of the construction industry rose as the government has gone on an infrastructure spending spree. 
The services employment sub-index rose in September, but still indicated services companies were cutting staff. 
Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to pick up the slack as it tries to shift the economy away from a dependence on heavy industry and manufacturing exports.
A private business showed on Friday that factory activity expanded in September but the improvement was marginal and manufacturers continued to shed jobs.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index for September rose to 50.1 from a no-change level of 50.0 in August.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted its biggest primary budget deficit in August, central bank data showed on Friday, reflecting the dire state of the country's finances. 
The primary deficit  of 22.267 billion reais ($6.88 billion) in August was well wider than market expectations for a gap of 18.5 billion reais. Central bank data showed it was the biggest deficit for that month in a historic series that began in 2001.
The deficit, the seventh so far this year and the second biggest after February, stems from a sharp drop in tax revenue that led the central government primary balance, which does not include states' budget results, to post a record gap of 20.3 billion reais for that same month. 
Federal tax revenues fell 10.12 percent in August as a recession in its second year hampered consumption. 
So far this year, the country has accumulated a primary deficit of 58.859 billion reais, which is about 36 percent of the 2017 official goal for a deficit of 163.9 billion reais. 
The primary balance, or the budget result prior to interest debt payments, is a key indicator of a country's capacity to repay it debt. 
The overall budget deficit, which includes interest debt payments, continues to hover around 10 percent of the gross domestic product in the 12 months through August. 
A surge in its budget deficit after years of heavy spending has cost Brazil its investment-grade rating.
The International Monetary Fund on Thursday urged President Michel Temer to step up efforts to rebalance the public accounts by adopting a five-year plan to turn the deficit into a steep surplus to stabilize the rising debt burden.
Temer, who replaced leftist Dilma Rousseff earlier this year after she was impeached for allegedly doctoring the public accounts, has proposed a cap on public expenditure. 
His government has agreed to remove states from the spending cap to ease its approval in Congress, but is considering a separate bill to limit their expenditure.
Economists believe those efforts will do little to revert the rising trend of the country's net debt that reached 43.3 percent of GDP in August. Only three years ago, that debt stood at 30.63 percent of GDP. 
The bank's head of economic research, Tulio Maciel, said the bank expects net debt to climb to 46.2 percent in 2016 if the government meets its primary deficit goal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell in August for the first time in seven months while inflation showed signs of accelerating, mixed signals that could keep the Federal Reserve cautious about raising interest rates.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 0.1 percent last month after accounting for inflation.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1 percent gain.
""Consumers took a breather in August,"" said Chris Christopher of IHS Global Insight. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week she expected the U.S. central bank would raise rates once later this year to keep the economy from eventually overheating. 
Prices for fed funds futures suggest investors see almost no chance of a hike at the Fed's next policy meeting in early November and roughly even odds of an increase at its mid-December meeting, according to CME Group (NASDAQ:CME).
The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies while U.S. stock prices were trading higher.
Consumer spending, which has been robust in recent months, partially offset the drag from weak business investment and falling inventories in the second quarter when the economy expanded at a lackluster 1.4 percent annual rate. 
Economists said overall economic growth could still accelerate in the current quarter even with August's slight decline in consumer spending. 
The Atlanta Fed said growth appeared on track to accelerate to a 2.4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, according to its closely watched GDPNow forecasting model. It had forecast growth of 2.8 percent for the period earlier this week.
A tightening labor market appears to be pushing up wages and could fuel higher levels of spending in the future. Personal income rose 0.2 percent in August, in line with expectations.

Consumer prices also rose about as much expected in August, with the price index excluding food and energy increasing 0.2 percent from the prior month. That left inflation excluding food and energy at 1.7 percent in the 12 months through August, up a tenth of a percentage point from the prior month and closer to the Fed's 2 percent inflation target.

In a report, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its Chicago purchasing managers’ index increased by 2.7 points to a seasonally adjusted 54.2 this month from a reading of 51.5 in August. Analysts had expected the index to increase 0.5 points to 52.0 in September.
On the index, a number above 50.0 indicates an expansion, while below indicates contraction.
MNI Indicators which helps elaborate the report said that the latest increase was driven by a sharp gain in Production, which rose 7.3 points to 59.8, the highest since January 2016.
New Orders and Order Backlogs, which led the barometer’s decline last month, were little changed in September, with the latter failing to bounce back above the 50 breakeven level.
Employment was the only barometer component that fell, having rallied to a 16-month high in August.
“Economic growth in the US appears to have picked up a little at the end of the third quarter and although the Employment component fell, this was on the back of a relatively strong showing in the previous month,” said Lorena Castellanos, senior economist at MNI Indicators.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that personal spending was unchanged in August from the prior month, below expectations for a 0.1% rise, and compared to a gain of 0.4% in July, that was revised up from an initial 0.3% advance.
Consumer spending is the single biggest source of U.S. economic growth, accounting for as much as two-thirds of economic activity.

The core PCE price index rose at an annualized rate of 1.7%, in line with forecasts. July’s 1.6% gain had held steady at that level since March.
The Federal Reserve uses core PCE as a tool to help determine whether to raise or lower interest rates, with the aim of keeping inflation at a rate of 2% or below.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's giant services sector grew strongly in July, according to official data giving the clearest sign to date that the economy did not slump immediately into a major slowdown after the country's vote in June to leave the EU.
The Office for National Statistics also said economic growth was stronger than it previously thought in the run-up to the June 23 referendum as consumers and businesses increased their spending, despite the approach of the vote.
""Together this fresh data tends to support the view that there has been no sign of an immediate shock to the economy, although the full picture will continue to emerge,"" ONS statistician Darren Morgan said. 
The data may dissuade the Bank of England from following through on its plan to cut interest rates again at its next meeting, though the economy still looks set to slow sharply next year when the full impact of the referendum is likely to be felt. 
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there was now ""considerable doubt"" about the likelihood of a rate cut in November. 
Finance minister Philip Hammond is also weighing up whether he needs to bolster the economy via higher spending or lower taxes when he delivers his first budget plans on Nov. 23.
""The UK started the year in a position of economic strength, and we can see today that this momentum has continued in the services sector - the largest part of our economy,"" Hammond said after the release of the data. 
""We want to build on this strength as we forge a new relationship with the EU and deliver an economy that works for all. The UK is well-positioned to deal with the challenges, and take advantage of the opportunities, that lie ahead.""
Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Markit, said he was raising his estimate for growth in the third quarter 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent, and also revising up his view of 2017. 
Less comprehensive surveys of purchasing managers had previously suggested that the services sector sagged in July before bouncing back strongly in August.
But the ONS said output in the services sector grew by 0.4 percent compared with June, better than many economists had anticipated, and was up 2.9 percent in year-on-year terms.
PRE-REFERENDUM UPGRADE
Most of the ONS figures published on Friday covered the April-June period, which included only a few days after the June 23 referendum. 
The economy grew by 0.7 percent in the second quarter from the January-March period, up from a previous estimate of 0.6 percent growth, and by 2.1 percent compared with the second quarter of 2015 - down from the ONS's last estimate of 2.2 percent.
Consumer demand remained a big driver of growth as spending by households grew by 0.9 percent from the first quarter, even as their disposable income grew more slowly. 
The households savings ratio fell to its lowest since 2008, a potential warning sign that consumers might not keep up the pace of their spending in the coming months. Inflation is expected to rise soon because of the fall in the value of sterling in the wake of the referendum.
However, a survey of consumer confidence published earlier on Friday showed levels of optimism among households returned to pre-referendum levels in September. 
Britain's trade deficit weighed on growth, posing its biggest drag on GDP since late 2013. 
The current account deficit widened in the second quarter -but by less than expected by economists - to 28.7 billion pounds ($37.2 billion), or 5.9 percent of GDP, the widest since the end of 2015.
British business investment grew by a stronger than previously estimated 1.0 percent from the first quarter, defying earlier expectations that nervousness about the referendum would weigh on companies' spending plans.

Spain's thriving tourism industry has fueled a jobs surge over the summer months, extending an economic recovery throughout a period of political uncertainty triggered by two inconclusive national elections.
In the first eight months of 2016, the number of tourists rose more than 10 percent from the same period in 2015 to 52.5 million, INE said, putting Spain on track to surpass last year's record 68.1 million arrivals for the full 12 months. 
Security fears in competing destinations across the Mediterranean and in the Middle East have helped lure more tourists than ever to Spain's shores. Northeastern Catalonia, home to vast stretches of beaches, was the most visited region in Spain, followed by the Balearic Islands. 
Britons remained the most numerous visitors to Spain and arrivals from the United Kingdom were up 3.9 percent year-on-year in August. But this marked a slowdown compared to previous months and follows the UK's vote to leave the European Union, after which the British pound weakened against the euro. 

Tourism provides some 11 percent of Spain's gross domestic product.

Prices rose by 5.3 percent in September compared with the same month last year, slower than August's increase of 5.6 percent, Nationwide said.
The September figure matched expectations from economists polled by Reuters.
In monthly terms, house prices rose by 0.3 percent, also slowing from a rise of 0.6 percent in August.
Nationwide economist Robert Gardner said the modest slowing of growth in house prices was probably due to a shortage of homes for sale which cushioned the impact of weaker demand.
""The relative stability in the rate of house price growth suggests that the softening in housing demand evident in recent months has been broadly matched on the supply side of the market,"" he said in a statement. 
Britain's housing market has shown other signs of slowing since the referendum, although the introduction in April of a higher tax on landlords buying properties has also weighed on the market.
The Bank of England said on Thursday that the number of mortgage approvals in September were the lowest since late 2014.

However, consumer confidence remains largely intact after the Brexit vote. Market research firm GfK said on Friday that its gauge of consumer confidence jumped in September back to the level seen before the referendum.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fell in the year to August, a sixth straight month of declines and a daunting challenge for the Bank of Japan's relaunched stimulus campaign.
Household spending fell 4.6 percent year-on-year in the month, considerably exceeding the 2.5 percent drop expected by economists, and highlighting the weakness in private consumption which makes up roughly two-thirds of the economy.
A rebound in factory output brightened the outlook somewhat.
Weak consumption data may mean additional scrutiny of the central bank, which last week switched to targeting short- and long-term interest rates from of its previous target of increasing base money at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($789 billion).
It also underscored the need for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government to take up the slack by implementing vigorous economic growth plans and structural reforms on top of a 28-trillion yen stimulus package it is set to roll out later this year.
""Output and private consumption are in a gradual pickup, but what's worrying is the slowdown in consumer inflation excluding both food and energy,"" said Taro Saito, director of economic research at NLI Research Institute.
""If the price trend persists, the BOJ can no longer blame oil prices for weakening inflation and it would be forced into further easing, even though the chance of immediate action is slim.""
The 0.5 percent annual decline in the core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, matched the prior month's drop, which was the biggest since March 2013, a month before the central bank embarked on massive monetary stimulus.
The so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.2 percent in the year to August, the slowest since September 2013.
Despite 3 1/2 years of heavy money printing by the BOJ, weak household spending and a strong yen weighing on import costs have kept inflation well away from the central bank's 2 percent goal.
Neither has a tight job market helped fuel inflation. Many firms remain wary of boosting wages for fear of raising fixed costs in environment of negligible inflation, in turn dampening households' readiness to spend. The jobless rate stood at 3.1 percent in August, near a 21-year low hit in the prior month.
Separate data from the trade ministry showed factory output rose 1.5 percent in August, much bigger than a 0.5 percent rise expected by economists, led by domestic demand for liquid crystal displays for computers and car navigation systems, officials said.
The economy grew at an annualised rate of 0.7 percent in April-June, slowing sharply from the prior quarter's growth which was led by leap year effects.

The bank said the ""vast majority"" of its clients remained supportive, but the situation still drew comparisons to the 2008 failure of Lehman and the resulting global financial crisis.
There was at least some evidence that China, the world's second largest economy, had stabilized, if only because of a burst of government spending and a red-hot housing market.
The Caixin measure of manufacturing activity (PMI) edged up a tenth of a percentage point to 50.1, led by output and new orders. While the move was marginal, it was only the second time the index had reached positive territory since February 2015. 
The U.S. economy also looked to have bounced back in the third quarter, while a string of data showed Europe weathered Britain's Brexit vote better than many had feared.
All of which encouraged  Barclays  (LON:BARC) to nudge up its 2017 call for global growth to 3.5 percent, from an expected 3.1 percent this year. Yet a true lift-off still seems remote.
""Given the modest acceleration in growth that we forecast and the many downside risks around these forecasts, it seems overly optimistic to suggest that the global economy has reached ""escape velocity"","" said Barclays economist David Fernandez.
His list of headwinds included a miserly pace of global business investment, lackluster productivity, sluggish wage growth and too-low inflation.
""Although these trends do not seem to be worsening, there are few signs – despite tremendous policy efforts – of any meaningful turnaround,"" said Fernandez.
MISSING INFLATION
The limits of policy stimulus were all to evident in Japan where core consumer prices fell 0.5 percent in August from a year earlier, the largest drop since March 2013.
The data seemed to mock the Bank of Japan's recent pledge not only to boost inflation to 2 percent but to lift it above that, so far unreachable, target for a sustained period.
Nor were Japanese consumers cooperating. Household spending sank 4.6 percent in the year to August, almost twice the fall expected by analysts.
Indeed, Friday's data across Asia were littered with unwanted milestones.
In tech bellwether South Korea, factory output suffered the steepest decline in 19 months in August as strikes stalled auto production. Things were no better in September with the Nikkei/Markit measure of manufacturing falling to a 14-month trough at 47.6 as new export orders hit their lowest since mid-2013.
Malaysia's version of the PMI contracted for the 18th straight month in September as new export orders dropped at the fastest pace in three months.
Inflation, or the lack of it, will also feature heavily in European and U.S. data due later on Friday.
The flash measure of consumer price inflation in the euro zone is forecast to rise an annual 0.4 percent in September. That would be up from 0.2 percent in August but still a world away from the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent. 

The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of U.S. inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures index, is seen stuck at 1.6 percent for the year to September, exactly where it has been since March.

The BoJ decided to add control of the bond yield curve to its aggressive monetary easing, an attempt to undo some of the effects of its negative interest rate policy, which caused an excessively sharp flattening of the curve.
According to Friday's summary, one member said, ""Compared with the previous framework, the new policy framework with yield curve control placed at the core will enable the BOJ to make more flexible adjustments according to economic, prices, and financial developments, and will enhance the sustainability of monetary easing.""
And another member suggested the outcome needed further explanation
""It is a natural consequence that the amount of the BoJ's JGB purchases may fluctuate, either upward or downward, to achieve the target level of a long-term interest rate specified by the guidelines for marketoperations,"" the member said, adding the BoJ should explain that such a change in the amount of JGB buying would have no policy implications.
The bank last week dropped the politically sensitive ""negative interest rate"" from the name of its policy framework - until the change, the policy was called ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing With a Negative Interest Rate.""
The new framework also features an ""inflation-overshooting commitment"" in which the BoJ commits itself to expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index exceeds its inflation target of 2% and stays above the target ""in a stable manner.""
The summary of opinions didn't identify who said what.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2016 10:30PM ET</span>",China September factory activity expands marginally as orders edge up-Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded in September as domestic and export orders picked up but the improvement was marginal and manufacturers continued to shed jobs, a private business survey showed on Friday.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.1, in line with analysts' forecasts and slightly higher than August's no-change mark of 50.0, which separates expansion of activity from contraction on a monthly basis.
The reading has bounced around the neutral 50 level for the best part of five years, pointing to stubbornly sluggish demand.
Output expanded in September, but at the slowest pace in three months, the survey showed.
Overall new orders also continued to show modest growth, with new orders edging into expansionary territory after nine months of contraction. 
Despite easing to its slowest for nine months, the rate of job shedding remained marked overall. Around 8 percent of companies surveyed reported lower headcounts, with a number of firms attributing the fall to cost-cutting.
But companies were able to pass along higher input costs and raise selling prices of their goods by a sharper pace than in August, suggesting they were regaining pricing power.
""The readings for the manufacturing PMI over the past three months seem to indicate that the economy has begun to stabilize,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the PMI report.
A construction boom fueled by government infrastructure spending and a housing market rally have helped to underpin growth in the world's second-largest economy in recent months, though small and mid-sized private firms like those which dominate the Caixin survey have continued to struggle.
Profits earned by China's industrial firms grew the fastest in three years in August with rising sales, higher prices and reduced costs, official data showed on Tuesday. 
China's imports also unexpectedly rose in August for the first time in nearly two years, suggesting domestic demand may be picking up. Exports fell at a less than expected extent and showed signs of improvement, with demand from the United States, Japan and European Union all improving.
But the Commerce Ministry warned on Thursday that downward pressure on China's trade is growing due to various destabilizing factors, and said weak global demand is ""impossible"" to reverse fundamentally this year, though January-August trade figures showed positive signs.
Zhong also cautioned that an increasingly strained fiscal budget could pose a risk to sustainable growth.
""Given that the growth rate of fiscal income has slowed recently while expenditures have swung, there is insufficient momentum to drive future economic growth, and there is a risk that industrial output may decline,"" Zhong said.

China will release its official factory and service sector activity readings on Oct. 1.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth was less sluggish than previously thought in the second quarter as exports grew more than imports and businesses raised their investments, hopeful signs for the economic outlook.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its third estimate of GDP. That was up from the 1.1 percent rate it reported last month and higher than analysts' expectations.
The revision incorporated data that showed businesses cut investments in buildings and equipment less than the government previously estimated, while they sank more money into research and development. 
Other data released by the Commerce Department showed America's trade deficit for goods shrank in August, boding well for third-quarter growth.
""It now appears that growth is slowly making its way back on to firmer ground,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Growth in overall business investment was revised to show a 1 percent annual rate of expansion, the first gain since the third quarter of last year, suggesting the worst of an energy-sector-led slump in business investment might be over.
The slump, fueled by a sharp drop in oil prices that hit America's energy industry, has worried policymakers at the Federal Reserve because less investment could hurt economic growth over the longer term. 
The economy has struggled to regain momentum since output started slowing in the last six months of 2015 and the overall growth rate for GDP in the second quarter remained below historically normal rates. That could give grist to Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump's argument that the economy has sickened under the Obama administration.
At the same time, consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was robust in the second quarter, rising at a 4.3 percent annual rate, while growth in exports outstripped that of imports enough to boost GDP by the most since the third quarter of 2014. 
But companies continued to run down their inventories aggressively, reducing stocks by $50.2 billion and subtracting from GDP growth, while home building also sank.
The U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while yields on U.S. government debt were higher. 
The GDP data is unlikely to have much impact on the near-term outlook for monetary policy although it could make Fed policymakers more confident the U.S. economy is resisting weaker growth abroad. 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen repeated on Wednesday that Fed policymakers expect to raise interest rates by the end of the year because they worry that gathering steam in the U.S. labor market could fuel inflation.
New claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week but remained at levels consistent with a healthy job market, according to a separate report from the Labor Department.
The Commerce Department is due to release new inflation data on Friday.
The government also reported that after-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.9 percent rate in the second quarter, a smaller drop than initially estimated. 

With profits declining, an alternative measure of growth, gross domestic income, or GDI, dropped at a 0.2 percent rate in the second quarter. GDI measures the economy's performance from the income side.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said its pending home sales index fell by a seasonally adjusted 2.4% last month, missing expectations for an increase of 0.3%.
The index reading at 108.5 is the second lowest this year after January’s 105.4.
Year-on-year, pending home sales decreased at an annualized rate of 0.2%, compared to the 2.2% decline in the previous month.
Furthermore, July’s month-on-month reading was revised down to a 1.2%, compared to the initial reading of a 1.3% advance.
Additionally, the report showed that existing home prices had risen 5.1% year-on-year in August, its 54th consecutive increase.
NAR chief economist Larry Yun said suffering supply levels have taken the wind out of the momentum the housing market experienced earlier this year.
""Contract activity slackened throughout the country in August except for in the Northeast, where higher inventory totals are giving home shoppers greater options and better success signing a contract,"" he said.
""In most other areas, an increased number of prospective buyers appear to be either wavering at the steeper home prices pushed up by inventory shortages or disheartened by the competition for the miniscule number of affordable listings,"" Yun explained.
According to Yun, evidence is piling up that without more new home construction the current housing recovery could stall.
""There will be an expected seasonal decline in new listings in coming months, which could accelerate price appreciation and make finding an affordable home even more of a struggle for would-be buyers,"" Yun warned.
Following last month's decline, Yun expects existing-home sales in 2016 to be around 5.36 million, a 2.1% increase from 2015 and the highest annual pace since 2006 (6.48 million).
The national median existing-home price growth is forecast this year to rise around 4%.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2016 10:00AM ET</span>","Strong inflation numbers from Germany, Spain take pressure off ECB","By Michael Nienaber and Paul Day
BERLIN/MADRID (Reuters) - German inflation picked up in September to reach its highest level in 16 months and Spanish consumer prices rose for the first time since May 2014, positive signs for the European Central Bank that its ultra-loose monetary policy is working.
The ECB has unleashed unprecedented monetary stimulus in recent years to boost the economy and fight off the threat of deflation. It has cut interest rates aggressively to zero or less and pumped more than a trillion euros into the economy through asset purchases.
But with growth in the euro zone still moderate and inflation in the 19-member currency bloc barely above zero - well short of the ECB's target of nearly 2 percent - the central bank's critics say its monetary policy has reached its limits. Others say it should print even more money.
But Thursday's number offered some respite for the policymakers.
""Hooray, the prices are rising! This might sound crazy but it fits. Because the price development shows that the risks of deflation have been averted for now,"" KfW Bank economist Joerg Zeuner said.
The ECB has been concerned about a damaging deflationary spiral in the euro zone in which consumers delay purchases in expectation of lower prices, hitting economic growth.
Zeuner said he expected the German inflation rate -- which is something of a key to euro zone inflation as a whole -- to reach nearly 2 percent at the beginning of next year.
""Given a similar development in the euro zone, this will enable the ECB to aim for a smooth exit from its bond-buying program in 2017,"" he added.
German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries (HICP), rose by 0.5 percent on the year in September after an increase of 0.3 percent in August, the Federal Statistics Office said. This was the highest rate since May 2015 and in line with a Reuters consensus forecast.
On a non-harmonized basis, German inflation picked up to 0.7 percent on the year after 0.4 percent in August, it said.
Energy prices remained the main drag on the headline figure, but fell less sharply than in the previous months, a breakdown of the non-harmonized data showed. Costs for rents increased faster than in August while food inflation slowed.
RISING RENTS
The strong German inflation data came after Spanish EU-harmonized consumer prices rose by 0.1 percent year-on-year in September, the first increase since May 2014.
Spain's national consumer price index rose by 0.3 percent in September on an annual basis, up from a 0.1 percent drop in August and the first time it has risen since July 2015, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said.
ING economist Geoffrey Minne called the Spanish inflation data ""a sign that ECB policy might be working after all"".
But he added that overall euro zone inflation was still far away from the ECB's target of nearly 2 percent. ""In that regard ECB monetary policy is likely to remain easy for some time to come,"" Minne said.
For the overall euro zone, economists polled by Reuters expect the inflation rate, due on Friday, to edge up to 0.4 percent in September after a rise of 0.2 percent in August. This would be the highest reading since October 2014.
In Berlin, leading economic institutes urged the ECB to wait and weigh the effects of its bond-buying program before taking more expansionary steps. But they also added that the ECB should take more measures if inflationary pressures remained weak.
On Wednesday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi rejected German criticism that sub-zero interest rates were impoverishing savers and straining top lender  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), saying its monetary policy was a necessity to get the euro zone back on the path to growth and revive inflation.

Questioned by lawmakers who say ECB policy has damaged the euro zone and fueled the rise of right-wing populists, Draghi said Germans were actually net beneficiaries of the euro zone central bank's easy stance and the nation's bank troubles were actually due to poor efficiency.

LONDON (Reuters) - British lenders approved the fewest mortgages in nearly two years last month as the housing market continued to slow after June's vote to leave the European Union, raising the chance of an outright fall in prices next year.
House purchases have been falling since the start of the year, buffeted by higher taxation on investment properties as well as the EU vote. Housing market slowdowns have typically heralded future weakness in broader British economic growth.
However, other figures on Thursday suggest that for now consumers are continuing to spend and to borrow heavily, placing the Bank of England in a quandary as it considers whether it will need to cut rates for a second time this year.
The number of mortgage approvals last month dropped to its lowest since November 2014 at 60,058 -- roughly in line with the decline forecast in a Reuters poll, monthly BoE data showed.
The central bank predicted last month that approvals in the second half of 2016 would average 56,000 a month although it recently said the slowdown could be less severe.
Some economists still expect 2017 will bring the first fall in prices since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.
""Housing market activity is likely to be increasingly pressurized by appreciable uncertainty following the UK's vote to leave the EU,"" IHS Global Economics' Howard Archer said. He expects a 3 percent fall in house prices next year.
The regulatory backdrop is also becoming less favorable for some corners of the housing market.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday he did not plan to extend his predecessor's scheme to indemnify high loan-to-value mortgages - which expires at the end of this year - though other subsidies for house purchase will continue.
The 'Help to Buy: Mortgage Guarantee Scheme' supported one-in-four high loan-to-value mortgages at the start of the year - down from 70 percent at its launch - and the BoE said on Monday that scrapping it would have little effect on lending.
Separately on Thursday, the BoE urged all lenders to factor in further tax rises which will hit small landlords next year when considering new loans.
For now, however, consumers appear untroubled by the Brexit vote. A monthly survey from the European Commission showed morale rebounded in September from lows seen in July and August to levels seen in the months running up to the referendum.
Consumer borrowing in August was 10.3 percent higher than a year earlier - along with June, the fastest growth since late 2005, the BoE said.
Capital Economics's Scott Bowman said low interest rates would stop borrowing from slowing much in coming quarters. ""We think that the resilience of consumer spending will prevent the economy from falling into a full-blown recession,"" he said.

Most economists expect the BoE to follow up August's rate cut with a further reduction before the end of 2016, though stronger-than-expected data has made some policymakers hesitant.

Separately, the Commission's business climate indicator, which points to the phase of the business cycle, also jumped to 0.45 in September, its highest level since October 2015, beating market expectations of a modest rise to 0.05 from 0.03 in August.
The Commission said economic sentiment improved the most in the biggest euro zone economies - Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.
The rise was fueled mainly by rallying industry confidence, which rose to -1.7 from a six-month low of -4.1 in August, on managers' sharply improved assessments of overall order books as well as better production expectations and, to a lesser extent, stocks of finished products. 
Sentiment in the services sector, which generates two thirds of the euro zone's GDP, rose to 10.0 in September from 9.9 in August and the mood among consumers rose to -8.2 this month from -8.5 last month, well above the long-term average since 1990 of -12.7.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales fell more than expected in August for the sixth straight month of annual declines due to falling sales of clothes and home appliances - keeping policymakers under pressure to find ways of beefing up household spending.
Retail sales fell 2.1 percent in August from a year earlier, more than a median market forecast for a 1.8 percent annual decline, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed on Thursday.
The weak reading underscores the relative fragility in Japan's economy, with slow wage growth and gloomy prospects of recovery weighing on household spending.
Japan's economy grew faster over April-June than initially estimated due to upward revisions to capital expenditure and inventories, but there are concerns from a recent run of weak data on exports, factory output and household spending.
The parliament will soon start to deliberate a government stimulus package with planned spending 7.5 trillion yen by the national and local governments on infrastructure projects in an attempt to boost domestic demand.

Economists say the package, which is sure to be passed in parliament, could support growth but still worry whether wages will rise fast enough to spur consumer spending.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new orders for the category, which includes goods like motor vehicles and machinery and is a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.6 percent last month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders falling 0.2 percent.
The government downwardly revised its estimate for those orders in July to a 0.8 percent gain from the previously reported 1.5 percent increase.
Business spending has contracted since the fourth quarter of 2015, in part as companies slashed capital spending budgets in response to lower oil prices.
The slump in investment has worried Federal Reserve policymakers because it could depress longer-term economic growth.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, fell 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in July.

A 21.9 percent drop in demand for civilian aircraft helped keep overall orders for durable goods flat in August. Durable goods include items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2016 02:20AM ET</span>",German consumer morale falls slightly heading into October,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German consumers worsened slightly heading into October but remains at one of the highest levels in more than a decade, a survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting that private consumption is likely to compensate for weakening exports.
The consumer sentiment indicator, published by the Nuremberg-based GfK institute and based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to 10.0 going into October. A Reuters poll had expected unchanged at 10.2.
Record-high employment, rising real wages and ultra-low borrowing costs are boosting the spending power of Germans.
GfK said the slight fall was linked to a prevailing sense of uncertainty linked to the threat of possible attacks in Germany and the economic consequences of Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union.
""The consequences of this (Brexit) for the European and, above all, German economy are still completely unclear,"" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said.
""Nevertheless, GfK confirms its forecast that a rise in real private consumer spending of around two percent in 2016 appears achievable and realistic,"" he added. ""Consumption therefore remains an important pillar of economic growth in Germany.""
A sub-index measuring economic expectations fell for the third time in a row, suggesting German consumers fear the economy will be weaker over the next few months.
Data and sentiment surveys published over the summer have painted a mixed picture of Europe's largest economy.
Industrial production fell the most in 23 months in July while exports unexpectedly posted their steepest drop in nearly a year, adding to evidence that manufacturing is losing momentum as overseas demand, particularly from Asia, wanes.
While as German business morale hit a 28-month high this month after deteriorating sharply in August on Brexit fears.
""It appears that consumers feel the German economy will develop somewhat more moderately in the coming months,"" Buerkl said.
The GfK survey also showed that consumers' income expectations and willingness to buy remained solid at above 50.0 points, despite falling from last month.
The robust German labor market has resulted in collective wage increases, which coupled with record-low interest rates, continue to encourage traditionally frugal Germans to spend.

In a report, the Conference Board, a market research group, said its index of consumer confidence unexpectedly increased to 104.1 this month from a reading of 101.8 in August, whose figure was revised from a previously reported 101.1.
That was its highest level since August 2007.

“Consumer confidence increased in September for a second consecutive month and is now at its highest level since the recession,” said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board.
Franco pointed out that the improvement in the assessment of current conditions was due largely to a more positive view of the labor market.
“Overall, consumers continue to rate current conditions favorably and foresee moderate economic expansion in the months ahead,” she added.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 51.9 in September, from the prior month’s reading of 51.0.
Analysts had expected an smaller increase to 51.1 this month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
Though Markit noted that this was the sharpest rise in activity since April, new orders and employment increased at slower rates, while inflationary pressure eased.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson considered that the data sent mixed signals.
""A drop in optimism about the year ahead to a near post-crisis low meanwhile cast a shadow over the outlook,"" he warned.
Williamson pointed out that the activity was subdued and combined with the manufacturing survey pointed to growth of just 1% in the third quarter.
He further indicated that the slowdown in hiring was consistent with an increase of 120,000 nonfarm payrolls in September.
“The slowdown in hiring is perhaps a natural symptom of the economy reaching full employment, but companies also reported a reduced appetite to hire and job losses due to weaker inflows of new business and worries about the outlook,” Williamson concluded.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to be 50.4 for September, unchanged from August and above the neutral 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction on a monthly basis, according to the median forecast of 30 analysts polled by Reuters.
Profits earned by China's industrial firms grew the fastest in three years in August with rising sales, higher prices and reduced costs, official data showed on Tuesday.
That data indicated a construction boom helped to drive up demand while capacity cuts for sectors which had production gluts saw rising commodity prices because of reduced supply. 
But it also showed that profits remained uneven, as traditional heavy industries with excess capacity such as steel still struggled for growth.
Analysts say the improved performance of industrial firms, rising land sales and some progress on starting public-private partnership infrastructure projects should help keep the growth outlook stable in the short- and medium-term. 
Factory activity in China has been hovering around the neutral 50 point mark this year with a mild recovery in the first quarter. The official PMI index unexpectedly rose to show expansion in August after slipping to signal contraction in July.
But economists worry that growth propped up by the housing boom and government infrastructure spending is unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term.
They warn that rising government infrastructure spending will further squeeze private investment growth, which accounts for 60 percent of overall investment and has shrunk to record lows this year.
PROPERTY BOOM PEAKING?
While property investment unexpectedly rose at a modest pace in August, showing investor confidence, sharply rising home prices have caused a severe overheating in bigger cities, leading more of them to impose stricter cooling measures to prevent asset-price bubbles. Many fear that the property market boom is peaking.
On the other hand, as Beijing vows to quicken the pace of industrial capacity cuts after falling behind earlier in the year, the risks of more layoffs and debt defaults are rising.
Debt has emerged as one of China's biggest challenges, with the total load rising to 250 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) last year, with corporate debt rising steeply to around 170 percent of GDP.
China's central bank is unlikely to resort to more monetary easing soon, with policymakers already worried about possible property and bond market bubbles. Forcing more money into the system could boost already high debt levels and increase speculative activity. 
The official September manufacturing PMI data will be released on Oct. 1, along with the official non-manufacturing PMI.
Services continued to expand robustly in August, albeit at a slower pace than in July.

The Markit/Caixin PMI, a private gauge of manufacturing activity which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, is due on Sept. 30. Analysts expect it to rise marginally to 50.1, from the previous month's reading of 50.0.

589,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2016 03:53AM ET</span>",China industrial profits rise most in three years as economy shows signs of stabilizing,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits in China's industrial sector rose at the fastest pace in three years as the world's second-biggest economy showed more signs of stabilizing, though some private forecasters say the improvement may be more fleeting than real. 
Profits of industrial firms in August jumped 19.5 percent from a year earlier to 534.8 billion yuan ($80 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Tuesday. That was the largest increase since August 2013. 
China's economy grew 6.9 percent last year, the slowest in 25 years, as global demand ebbed. Following billions of dollars in government spending and a property boom in the country's top-tier cities, official data in recent months are starting to point to some stabilization in the economy.
Steel and oil refining helped drive the jump in profits last month, the statistics bureau said, in line with the view that state infrastructure projects and a ramp-up in construction are lifting the basic materials sectors and the overall economy. 
In August, the volume of rail freight rose for the first time since December 2013, up 1 percent from a year earlier, according to data released by NBS on Tuesday.
""Gross domestic product growth in the third quarter could be faster than the first or second, in the range of 6.7 to 6.8 percent,"" said Liao Qun, chief economist at Citic Bank International. 
The Asian Development Bank on Tuesday raised its growth forecast this year for China to 6.6 percent from its last estimate of 6.5 percent, citing fiscal and monetary stimulus measures.
But some economists are more cautious, saying the growth drivers are not sustainable on their own in the longer run. The statistics bureau itself also said the jump in profits was partly due to a low base of comparison the previous year. 
The surge in industrial profit data was because of government stimulus and a hot real estate market, said Zuo Congying, an analyst at Golden Sun Securities. 
""Such a jump is not sustainable. Growth will likely become very low next month,"" Zuo said. ""We're still in the big cycle of capacity reduction. The economic situation has not changed."" 
The increase in earnings was also fueled by an auto sector that has enjoyed strong sales ahead of the expiry of a tax cut on small-engine vehicles at the year-end, people in the industry say.
By sector, the industrial profit data were also uneven. 
Manufacturing profits rose 14.1 percent in August from a year earlier while mining industry profits fell 70.9 percent even as coal and steel prices surged. 
Domestic coal and steel prices have rallied in recent months due to tighter supplies brought about by the closure of some production to reduce surplus capacity and from restructuring. 
While industrial profits have shown some positive changes, traditional industries are still struggling, particularly in sectors hobbled by excess capacity, NBS said. 
China has embarked on a campaign to cut capacity in the coal and steel sectors in the economy's most significant transformation in two decades. 
The restructuring could lead to the layoff of up to 1.8 million workers in those sectors, according to official estimates.
""Another risk is consumer sentiment being undermined as income growth further decelerates and the labor market weakens under continuing industrial restructuring,"" ADB said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan policymakers fretted over weak inflation expectations and uncertain prospects for achieving its price goal even before announcing its plan to conduct in September a comprehensive review of its policies, minutes of the central bank's policy meeting in July showed on Tuesday.
Many board members said inflation expectations were weakening and some warned they might not strengthen much any time soon, the minutes showed, a sign the policymakers were leaning toward modifying the BOJ's policy framework as three years of massive money printing failed to boost price growth.
""Members shared the recognition that risks to Japan's economic activity and prices remained skewed to the downside,"" according to the minutes of the July 28-29 meeting.
At the meeting, the BOJ expanded stimulus by doubling purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETF) and announced a plan to conduct a comprehensive assessment of its policies at a subsequent meeting in September.
At its rate review last week, the BOJ switched its policy target to interest rates from the pace of money printing, after years of massive asset purchases failed to jolt the economy out of decades-long stagnation.
At the July meeting, some board members said Japan's inflation expectations were vulnerable to external shocks such as oil price declines and slowdown in overseas economies.
Given such uncertainties over the price outlook, the board decided to conduct the comprehensive review in September.
""A few members said the final goal of this comprehensive assessment was to assess what should be done to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, and did not suggest the BOJ would be reviewing the price stability target itself,"" the minutes showed.
Many members said the decision to expand ETF purchases was the best way to prevent market turmoil triggered by Britain's vote to exit the European Union from hurting Japanese business and household confidence, the minutes showed.
But one member who opposed the decision said this would be viewed by markets as indicating that monetary easing was approaching its limit.

""There was a risk this action could trigger endless expectations for further monetary easing,"" the member was quoted as saying.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales posted their biggest decline in nearly a year in August after soaring to nine-year highs the month before, with analysts saying the trend in sales remains positive.
The Commerce Department said on Monday new home sales fell 7.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 609,000 units last month. Sales were up 20.6 percent from a year ago.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast single-family home sales falling to an annualized rate of 600,000 units last month. 
July's sales pace was revised up 5,000 units to 659,000 units. That level of annualized sales was the highest since October 2007, and even with the decline, the sales pace in August was the second highest since 2008.
Analysts said the level of sales generally supported their view of a strong underlying trend in new home sales and of a quickening pace of overall economic growth in the second half of the year.
""New home sales moved lower in August, but sales were at an expansion high in July and the longer-term trend remains positive due to strong homebuyer demand,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide and former chief economist at Fannie Mae.
Following the new home sales release, analysts at Macroeconomic Advisers kept their estimate of third-quarter economic growth at 3 percent, a marked pickup from the first half of the year.
Though new home sales make up just 10 percent of all home sales, evidence that the economy continues to hold up will add to the likelihood that the Federal Reserve follows through on an interest rate hike expected in December.
Evidence in particular that households remain willing to spend - whether on new homes or meals at restaurants - will support the Fed's view that growth in jobs and wages is helping support overall recovery even though other contributors to gross domestic product remain weak. 
""There are good reasons to expect GDP growth to rebound,"" analysts at Capital Economics said in a research note, pointing to a rise in household disposable income and household net worth that is ""close to a record high.""
Major U.S. stock indices were down by about three quarters of a percent at midday. Homebuilder shares performed slightly better.
Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI) were down 0.66 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) shares fell 0.02 percent.  Toll Brothers  (N:TOL) was down 0.59 percent. 
The broader PHLX housing index (HGX), which includes builders, building products and mortgage companies, was trading up 0.10 percent. 
Another housing report last week showed a solid increase in permits for single-family dwellings as the housing market continues to strengthen overall amid a tightening labor market that is pushing up wages.
New home sales have also benefited from a dearth of previously owned houses available for sale. 
Last month, the inventory of new homes on the market rose 1.7 percent to 235,000 units. 
New single-family home sales fell 34.3 percent in the Northeast to the lowest level since September 2015. Sales were down 2.4 percent in the Midwest and 12.3 percent in the South but rose 8.0 percent in the West to the highest level since September 2007.
At August's sales pace it would take 4.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.2 months in July.

The median price for a new home fell 5.4 percent from a year ago to $284,000.

596,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2016 12:50PM ET</span>",September U.S. auto sales seen down 0.8 percent: JD Power-LMC,"By Bernie Woodall
DETROIT (Reuters) - September U.S. auto sales are forecast to drop nearly 1 percent from a year ago despite a record high for consumer discounts, J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Monday.
The two auto industry consultants said September U.S. new vehicle sales will be 1.43 million, down 0.8 percent from a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for September will be 17.7 million vehicles, down from 18 million on the same basis a year earlier.
Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were seen declining 1.4 percent in September. It would be the fifth month in the past seven to show a retail sales decline, J.D. Power and LMC said.
Wall Street analysts have pressured shares of major U.S. automakers because they have expected the industry downturn that looks to be under way, albeit at near-record sales levels. A year ago, sales hit a record high of nearly 17.5 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. 
LMC and J.D. Power on Monday maintained their 2016 sales forecast of 17.4 million vehicles.
As the market shrinks, automakers are hiking incentives to entice consumers to spend. September industry incentive spending is tracking at an average $3,923 per new vehicle sold, which would surpass the previous high from December 2008 of $3,753.
December 2008 was a time when the U.S. and global economies appeared to be in peril, and was the last month prior to the weakest year in U.S. auto sales since World War Two, adjusted for population growth.
Jeff Schuster, lead forecaster at LMC, said today's auto sales climate is much improved from December 2008, as shown by higher consumer confidence figures, a stronger stock market and higher vehicle sales prices, which cuts the ratio of incentives to vehicle cost.
New home sales, which usually correlate closely to pickup truck sales, fell 7.6 percent in August, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday.
Pickup truck and SUV sales accounted for 58.4 percent of U.S. auto sales in 2016 through August, compared with 54.4 percent in August 2015.
""The U.S. automotive market continues to show signs of little growth, yet in our opinion the numbers do not reflect a significant weakness or risk,"" said Schuster.

""The expectation remains for steady volume levels at the topline, despite a pullback in the retail market and increased monthly performance volatility.""

The number of people registered as out of work in mainland France jumped by 50,200 to 3,556,800, up 1.4 percent from July and down 0.3 percent year-on-year, the Labour Ministry said in its monthly report on joblessness.
The increase was the steepest since September 2013 and brought the total closer to a record 3.59 million reached in February.
Labour Minister Myriam El Khomri said the tourism sector in particular had suffered after an Islamist militant drove a truck into a crowd in Nice in July, killing 86 people.
With Hollande trailing in the polls seven months before the election, the increase is another stain on the president's economic record, marred by low growth and high unemployment.

Hollande has given strong hints that he intends to run for re-election, while insisting that he would do so only if unemployment can be brought onto a convincingly downward trend.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale rose far more than expected in September, reaching its highest level in more than two years, a survey showed on Monday, signaling that executives had brushed off concerns about Brexit that had weighed on their mood last month.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of 7,000 firms, rose to 109.5 from an upwardly revised 106.3 in August, the biggest monthly increase since July 2010. 
""Companies are clearly more optimistic about the months ahead. They are also more satisfied with their current business situation,"" Ifo head Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""The German economy is expecting a golden autumn"".
A separate index measuring corporate expectations in Europe's biggest economy over a six-month horizon rose to 104.5. This was the highest reading since November 2015, suggesting many firms were not expecting economic headwinds.
""The Brexit shock has been digested for now,"" said Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe, adding that German executives appear to have overcome the ""small amount of uncertainty"" created by Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union.
A breakdown of the headline figure showed that sentiment had improved significantly in construction, manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing.
The economy has been driven by rising state spending linked to the influx of a record number of migrants last year, higher private consumption and a flourishing construction sector - all supported by record low interest rates.
However, industrial production fell the most in 23 months in July while exports unexpectedly posted their steepest drop in nearly a year, adding to evidence that manufacturing is losing momentum as overseas demand, particularly from Asia, wanes.
So Monday's Ifo figures were a positive surprise for economists.
""All in all, disappointing hard data in July and falling soft data since the Brexit vote had provided further evidence that the German economy was losing momentum,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
""Today's Ifo index suggests that at least the Brexit fears have disappeared as quickly as they had emerged,"" he added.
Economists say that in the longer term Germany cannot continue relying on domestic consumption and construction for growth and both structural reforms and investments are needed to foster a new economic cycle.
""Whether the strong (Ifo) reading is the start of another golden economic Fall or just a flash in the pan is too early to tell,"" said Brzeski. 
The German economy grew 0.4 percent on the quarter between April and June. Regarding third-quarter growth, Ifo economist Wohlrabe said the economy remained on a solid footing though he added that growth in the second half of the year would be slightly weaker than in the first half.
""In all, we doubt that growth will be as strong as the Ifo now suggests,"" said Capital Economics economist Jennifer McKeown.

""But it does suggest that the German economy will continue to outperform its peers and reduces concerns raised by the latest hard data that growth could be grinding to a halt.""

Companies signed up for $7.7 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, the Washington-based trade group said on Friday.
Still, total new borrowings in the first eight months of 2016 were down 6 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, said ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion U.S. equipment finance industry.
""Taking together the (U.S. Federal Reserve's) September decision to stay put on interest rates and the approaching presidential election, the sector continues to give no clear indication about where it's headed,"" ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement.
In August, credit approvals rose to 76.9 percent of all applications submitted from 75.9 percent in July, ELFA said.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it precedes by a few days.
The index is based on a survey of 25 lenders that include Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT), CIT Group Inc and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Deere & Co,  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and Volvo AB.
Separately, the Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index fell to 53.8 for September from 54.8 for August.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 51.4 in September from the prior month’s final reading of 52.0.
Analysts had expected the index to decrease to 51.9 this month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit did note that there was a moderate upturn in payroll numbers, despite the slower expansion of output volumes.
IHS senior economist Tim Moore said that the data pointed to a sustained upturn in manufacturing production, even though growth remains subdued overall.
“Softer new order gains are the main concern in the latest PMI survey and this could act as a drag on production growth into the final quarter,” Moore warned.
The market research group also said that new business growth eased further from June’s nine-month peak and that export orders fell for the first time since May.

Longer-term expectations for the next 5-10 years were broadly stable at 2.6 percent, Citi said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity has expanded at its weakest rate since the start of 2015 this month as growth paths diverged and firms stopped discounting for the first time in a year, surveys showed on Friday.
Markit's composite survey showed a big split between buoyant manufacturers and a struggling service sector, and a similar divide in growth rates among members of the currency union: French business activity hit a 15-month high, while Germany's private sector growth slowed to a 16-month low.
The euro zone flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good overall growth indicator, fell to 52.6 from August's 52.9. Readings above 50 indicate growth, but it was still the lowest figure since January 2015.
A Reuters poll of economists had predicted only a slight dip to 52.8.
""They (PMIs) rather confirmed the expectations that moderate but stable growth in the euro area has continued in the autumn,"" said Tuuli Koivu at Nordea.
Markit said the PMI pointed to the bloc's GDP expanding around 0.3 percent this quarter, in line with a Reuters poll earlier this month that suggested economies stuck in low gear need fiscal policies rather than more monetary easing. [ECILT/EU]
The European Central Bank has unleashed extraordinary stimulus in recent years but interest rates are probably close to the bottom, even though the bank had hoped the euro zone economy would respond better, two top policymakers said on Friday.
Those years of ultra-loose policy have so far failed to get inflation anywhere near the European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling so policymakers may take some cheer from firms halting price discounting for the first time in a year.
The output price index rose just above the breakeven mark to 50.1 from 49.3.
""It does seem to be a very tentative hint at rising inflation though, meaning that it can still be a while to come before meaningful price growth will return,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Consumer confidence rose in August, official data showed on Thursday, and manufacturers had a much better September than expected. Their PMI climbed to 52.6 from 51.7, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll, while an index measuring output rose to a nine-month high of 54.0 from 53.3.
The rally could continue into October, as new orders came in at a much faster rate. The sub-index leapt to 53.0 from 51.4.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry slumped to 52.1 from 52.8, however, its lowest reading since late 2014 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had predicted no change.
Optimism among businesses in the industry also continued to slide with the expectations index falling to a 21-month low.
It was a similar mixed picture from Germany and France, the bloc's two biggest economies and the only members to issue single-country flash PMIs.
Services lifted French business activity to a 15-month high while growth in Germany's private sector slowed to a 16-month low, suggesting the powerhouse of the currency union may have lost momentum in the third quarter.

""It clearly throws a shadow on the so-far strong growth of the German economy,"" Koivu said.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2016 03:51AM ET</span>",BOJ Tankan to show business mood mixed amid strong yen,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' mood improved for the first time in five quarters while service sector confidence worsened to the lowest since 2014, a Reuters poll showed, as the effects of a strong yen <JPY=> filtered through the economy.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey will likely show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment improving by 1 point to plus 7 points in September from plus 6 points three months ago, the poll of 16 economists showed.
It would be the first time the index improves since the June survey in 2015.
The poll found the sentiment index for big non-manufacturers worsened slightly to plus 18 from plus 19 three months ago. It would be the third straight quarterly deterioration and the lowest since the December 2014 survey when the index stood at plus 16.
""A significant improvement in sentiment among big manufacturers is unlikely because of the adverse impact of a strong yen - a real body blow,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
""Although there will probably be a small improvement in sentiment, there is a lack of momentum.""
He also said a slight improvement in sentiment among big manufacturers was likely led by the auto sector, which recovered its production losses following earthquakes in southern Japan and firms' receding concerns about fallout from Brexit.
""Public works probably supported non-manufacturers' sentiment but a slowdown in spending by foreign tourists and bad weather had a negative impact.""
Sentiment of big manufacturers is expected to improve slightly in the next three months supported by the government's economic stimulus steps, while that of non-big manufacturers will probably stay the same, according to the poll.
Big firms are expected to raise their capital spending plans by 6.8 percent for this fiscal year to March, compared with 6.2 percent planned previously, the poll found.
""Some big manufacturers could delay their capex plan due to worries about a strong yen and corporate profits,"" said Takayuki Miyajima, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""On the other hand, non-manufactures likely develop their capex plan on domestic infrastructure building and inbound demand. Thus, overall firms' capex plans will probably show a solid tone.""
The BOJ will announce the tankan quarterly survey at 8:50 a.m. on Oct. 3 (2350 GMT on Oct 2)
CORE CPI DOWN AGAIN, FACTORY OUTPUT REBOUNDS
The poll also found core consumer prices (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell 0.4 percent in August from a year earlier.
It would be the sixth straight monthly fall but the pace of decline likely slowed from a 0.5 percent drop in July.
Analysts say price falls in energy-related items narrowed but a strong yen weighed on price gains in food and daily necessities.
Industrial production is expected to have risen 0.5 percent in August from the previous month helped stronger exports to Asian nations, according to the poll, following a slip of 0.4 percent in July.
The poll found the jobless rate to be steady at 3.0 percent in August and the jobs-to-applicants stayed at 1.37 in August - the same level in July and June and the highest since August 1991 when the ratio was at 1.40. And household spending fell an annual 2.5 percent in August, it showed.
Japan's internal affairs ministry will announce August core CPI, household spending and labor market data at 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 30 (2330 GMT Sept. 29) and the trade ministry will release industrial output at 8:50 a.m. on the same day.

In its third estimate for the period, the INSEE national statistics agency revised lower its second quarter growth reading to -0.1 percent after earlier predictions of flat growth.
The contraction in the euro zone's No. 2 economy came after robust growth of 0.7 percent in the January to March period. Consumer spending, the driver of France's economy, declined 0.1 percent on the previous quarter. Inventories fell sharply, INSEE said, shaving 0.7 points off.
The weak household demand and investment undermines the assertions made in recent months by Hollande, who has hinted strongly that he will run for re-election, that the economy is getting stronger.
Finance Minister Michel Sapin this week stuck to his projection of 1.5 percent growth for this year and next.

The IHS Markit/Nikkei Japan Flash Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 50.3 in September from a final 49.5 in August on a seasonally adjusted basis.
It is the first time in seven months that the index was above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion.
The index for new export orders rose to a preliminary 50.2 from a final 47.2 in the previous month, showing the first expansion in eight months.
Japan's economic growth slowed in the April-June quarter due to weakness in consumer spending and exports. Since then, economic data has pointed to a turnaround in capital expenditure, which could support future growth.
Rising residential investment due to low interest rates could also be a positive factor for gross domestic product, some economists say.

Japan's government also has a 13.5 trillion yen ($134.27 billion) stimulus package, which should support domestic demand amid worries about overseas demand.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2016 11:41AM ET</span>",U.S. job market firming; tight inventories constraining housing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to a two-month low, pointing to labor market strength that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by December.
The upbeat initial jobless claims data came a day after the U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged but strongly signaled it could raise borrowing costs by the end of the year, citing a recent pickup in economic growth and continued progress in the labor market.
While other data on Thursday showed home resales fell in August for a second straight month, realtors and economists blamed the slump on a chronic shortage of houses available on the market, which is limiting choice for buyers. 
The housing market remains on solid ground, with home prices rising at a moderate pace.
""The economy is stronger than we thought with another turn tighter of the screw for the labor market. If Fed officials are waiting for the economy to improve further before raising rates, they are just too late,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000 for the week ended Sept. 17, the Labor Department said, the lowest level since mid-July. 
It was the 81st consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with robust labor market conditions. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 
Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 262,000 in the latest week. 
The Fed on Wednesday offered a solid assessment of the labor market, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen saying policymakers continued to expect that labor market conditions ""will strengthen somewhat further over time.""
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. It has held the rate steady so far this year amid concerns over persistently low inflation.
U.S. stocks and government bonds were trading higher on Thursday amid perceptions that the Fed would increase rates slowly because of benign inflation.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
LABOR MARKET STRENGTH
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,250 to 258,500 last week. 
Last week's claims data covered the survey period for September's nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 6,750 between the August and September survey periods, suggesting a pickup in job growth this month. Payrolls increased by 151,000 jobs in August. 
While the pace of job growth has slowed from a monthly average of 186,000 in the first seven months of the year, it is well above the roughly 100,000 that Yellen says is needed to absorb new entrants in the job market.
With labor market strength starting to boost wages and mortgage rates still near historic lows, the fundamentals for the housing market remain bullish, even though sales have softened in recent months. 
In a second report on Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales slipped 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million units in August. The NAR said a dearth of properties for sale, which was keeping prices elevated, was largely to blame for the slump in activity. 
The stock of homes for sale dropped 3.3 percent to 2.04 million last month, leaving inventory down 10.1 percent from a year ago. At August's sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 4.7 months in July. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance.
""Inventory levels below 2 million suggest scarcity and a lack of available properties on the market may be a limiting factor on the pace of sales,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
""Ongoing gains in employment and low interest rates should continue to underpin housing demand in the coming quarters."" 
The median house price rose 5.1 percent to $240,200 in August from a year ago. Relatively high house prices are keeping first-time buyers from the market. The share of first-time buyers dipped to 31 percent last month from 32 percent in July.

Underscoring the inventory tightness, houses typically stayed on the market for 36 days in August, down from 47 days a year ago. Supply is also being squeezed as the flow of foreclosed properties dries up.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday existing home sales declined 0.9 percent to an annual rate of 5.33 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rising 1.1 percent in August to a 5.45 million-unit pace.
July's sales pace was also revised lower to 5.38 million units from the previously reported 5.39 million units. However, despite sales being at their second-lowest pace of the year, home resales were still up 0.8 percent from one year ago.
The housing market has been strengthening on the back of healthy job gains. The unemployment rate has hovered around 5 percent since August last year and a tightening labor market has begun to push up wages, although not enough to keep up with home price growth.
""We go back to the same bottom line: lack of inventory choices and prices rising way too fast,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.
Only the Northeast saw more sales in part, the NAR said, due to greater supply compared to the West, South and Midwest. First-time homebuyers made up 31 percent of existing home sales in August.
Earlier this week data showed U.S. housing starts fell more than expected in August but that was likely due to bad weather disrupting building activity in the South. By contrast, there was a solid increase in permits for single-family dwellings.
The number of unsold homes on the market fell 3.3 percent to 2.04 million in August from July. Inventories were down 10.1 percent compared to a year ago.
At August's sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to clear the stock of houses on the market. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. One year ago it was 5.1 months.

With inventory tight, the median house price rose 5.1 percent from a year ago to $240,200 last month.

The industry data showed that home resales decreased 0.9% in August to a seasonally adjusted 5.33 million units from the 5.38 million units in July. The prior month’s data was revised from an initial reading of 5.39 million units.
The consensus forecast was for a 1.1% advance to 5.45 million units.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
NAR noted that the August reading was the second slowest pace of 2016, although it said that sales were still slightly higher than a year ago.
""Existing-home sales eased up in August for the second consecutive month despite mortgage rates near record lows as higher home prices and not enough inventory for sale kept some would-be buyers at bay,"" the report said.
“There's no question that after peaking in June, sales in a majority of the country have inched backwards because inventory isn't picking up to tame price growth and replace what's being quickly sold,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.
""Hopes of a meaningful sales breakthrough as a result of this summer's historically low mortgage rates failed to materialize because supply and affordability restrictions continue to keep too many would-be buyers on the sidelines,"" he added.
The median existing-home price for all housing types in August was $240,200, up 5.1% from August 2015 ($228,500). August's price increase marks the 54th consecutive month of year-over-year gains.
""While recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that household incomes rose strongly last year, home prices are still outpacing incomes in many metro areas because of the persistent shortage of new and existing homes for sale,"" Yun explained.
""Without more supply, the U.S. homeownership rate will remain near 50-year lows,"" this expert warned.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation rate eased more than expected in mid-September as food prices fell, underscoring bets on an imminent interest rate cut by the central bank.
Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index rose 0.23 percent in the month to mid-September, down from 0.45 in the previous month, government statistics agency IBGE said on Thursday. The index had been expected to rise 0.35 percent, according to a Reuters poll.
In the 12 months through mid-September, consumer prices rose 8.78 percent, down from 8.95 percent a month before, IBGE said.
Although the 12-month inflation rate remained far above the official 4.5 percent target, the fast decline added to signs that companies are increasingly refraining from raising prices in the midst of a severe recession.
Yields on interest rate futures <0#2DIJ:> were down, signaling a 90-percent likelihood of a rate cut on October 19 by the central bank. The bank has held its benchmark rate steady at 14.25 percent, its highest in a decade, but signaled it could start easing soon if inflation expectations fell.
Food prices edged 0.01 percent down in the month to mid-September after a 0.78 percent increase in mid-August. Food prices had been rising at a surprisingly fast rate in previous months, partly due to bad crop weather.
Transportation and communication prices also dropped, while the cost of personal expenses and healthcare rose.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank cut its overnight lending rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, setting aside concerns about inflation and possible ratings downgrades after repeated calls from President Tayyip Erdogan for cheaper credit.
Erdogan has led a campaign for cheaper credit in the hope of boosting prospects for stronger, consumption-led growth. The economy grew a smaller-than-expected 3.1 percent in the second quarter, data showed this month.
The bank left its benchmark one-week repo rate unchanged at 7.5 percent, but reduced the highest of the multiple interest rates it uses to set policy to 8.25 percent.
It is on a push to ""simplify"" interest rates and move towards one single rate to set policy, a process that so far has lead it to repeatedly cut rates.
""Today's rate statement includes no signs hinting that simplification is finalised, which guides us to expect more of the same from CBRT going forward,"" said Gokce Celik, Chief Economist at Finansbank.
""Despite the inflation outlook, we think CBRT might test the water for at least another cut in October, in order to curb the deceleration in growth."" 
All 18 economists in a Reuters survey had expected a cut in the overnight lending rate, the seventh in a row, with 17 forecasting a 25 basis point reduction and one predicting a 50 basis point cut.
""With the help from falling food prices, headline inflation is expected to display a decline in the short term,"" the central bank said in a statement.
""Yet, the recent tax adjustment in fuel prices and other cost factors limit the improvement in inflation and thus necessitate the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance.""
ATTEMPTED COUP
An attempted coup on July 15 has fueled uncertainty on the economic outlook and sparked some concern about looming ratings downgrades. Ratings agency Moody's said on Wednesday the shock had largely dissipated. It expects to conclude its rating review of Turkey within the next month.
Moody's put the country's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade to junk status on July 18, days after the coup attempt, but calm returned to financial markets with the lira  recovering after falling to record lows.
""But Turkey's challenges remain longer-term,"" Moody's managing director of global sovereign risk Alastair Wilson told Reuters, pointing to its policymaking drives and its economic sensitivity to external factors such as global interest rate shifts and capital flows.
Turkey has reformed its food committee which monitors price rises and would work to prevent an ""unfair rise"" in food inflation, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday, announcing a number of measures aimed at easing the strain on consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Thursday the government may cut its target of 4.5 percent growth this year while raising its forecast for the current account deficit, citing the impact of the failed coup and security issues.

Credit rating agency Fitch lowered its outlook on Turkey to negative from stable last month, while Moody's said on July 18 it was putting its rating on review for a possible downgrade to junk status.

The four-week moving average was 258,500, a decrease of 2,250 from the previous week's 260,750.

Output expectations for the next three months touched a three-month high, although export order growth eased slightly from August's two-year high.

The improvement in France, the first euro zone country to release business confidence data for September, was also a good sign for growth in the bloc,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
""We'll have to wait until tomorrow's PMIs and the German Ifo on Monday to have a better gauge of how euro-area sentiment fared into the autumn, but for now the French outcome is a modestly positive indication,"" Morgan Stanley economist Carmen Nuzzo said.
The industrial sector confidence index released by statistics office INSEE on Thursday rose to 103 from 101 in August, confounding expectations from economists in a Reuters poll for a flat reading.
In a positive sign for output in the coming months, executives' personal production expectations rose sharply to the highest in six months and returned above the long-term average.
""Despite the security scares of the last two or three months, production has picked up, investment has picked up,"" Philippe Darmayan, president of the French federation of industrial groups GFI, told a news conference on the sector.
""A positive momentum is taking hold even if it is never as much as we would like.""
Sentiment in the dominant service sector also improved this month, with the index rising to 102, the highest since July 2011, the data showed. Overall, the composite business indicator rose to 102.
But the broader-based index remained within a range it has not escaped since November 2015, a month marked by Islamist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. The carnage dealt a serious blow to France's large hotel and restaurant sector.
Although the sub-index for that sector improved in September to 96 after an 11-point collapse in August following another militant attack in Nice the month before, it remained below its long-term average.
Weakness was also prevalent among wholesalers, especially in the agricultural sector, where some indicators have never been worse since the survey started in 1979, INSEE said.
This year's weather-hit French wheat harvest could be the worst in 30 years, compounding structural problems in other agricultural sectors such as the beef and milk industries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday but strongly signaled it could still tighten monetary policy by the end of this year as the labor market improved further.
The Fed said U.S. economic activity had picked up and job gains were ""solid"" in recent months.
""The case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened,"" the U.S. central bank said in a statement following a two-day policy meeting.
It added that its rate-setting committee had decided against raising rates ""for the time being,"" until there was more evidence of progress toward its employment and inflation objectives.
The Fed has held its target rate for overnight lending between banks in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent since December, when it raised borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a decade.
The central bank has appeared increasingly divided over the urgency of raising rates. On Wednesday, Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren dissented on the policy statement, saying they favored raising rates this week.
At the same time, policymakers cut the number of rate increases they expect this year to one from two previously, according to the median projection of forecasts released with the statement. Three of the 17 policymakers said rates should remain steady for the rest of the year.
The Fed also projected a less aggressive rise in interest rates next year and in 2018, and cut its longer-run interest rate forecast to 2.9 percent from 3.0 percent.
But in a sign of growing confidence, the Fed said the near-term risks for the economic outlook ""appear roughly balanced."" That means policymakers think the economy is about as likely to outperform forecasts as to underperform them.
Investors reacted with skepticism to the shallower rate path projections. U.S. short-term interest rate futures trimmed earlier losses and some nearer-term maturities rose on Wednesday. Before the rate decision, traders saw about a 58 percent chance of a December rate hike, and were betting on another hike in 2017.
The dissents from those wanting a hike suggested to some economists that pressure was building.
""While the Federal Reserve held rates unchanged, the highly unusual 7-3 vote points to the depth of its policy dilemma and makes a December hike more likely,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, Chief Economic Adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG).
Fed Chair Janet Yellen was due to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT).
FOCUS ON DECEMBER
The Fed in December signaled that four rate increases were likely this year, but that was scaled back in March due to a global growth slowdown, financial market volatility and concerns about tepid U.S. inflation.
The economy expanded sluggishly in the second quarter and added fewer jobs than expected in August. Inflation also showed signs of stirring last month.
The Fed's decision, which came the same day that Japan's central bank added a long-term interest rate target to its massive asset-buying program in an overhaul of its policy framework, was widely anticipated by economists.
A Reuters poll showed the median probability of a September rate rise was about 25 percent. Only 6 percent of those surveyed expected the Fed to raise rates, with the majority believing it would wait until December.

The Fed has policy meetings scheduled in early November and mid-December. Economists believe policymakers would avoid a rate hike in November in part because the meeting falls just days before the U.S. presidential election.

The trade group's seasonally adjusted index on refinancing activity fell 8 percent in the week ended Sept. 16 to its lowest level since the week of June 24.
The average contract interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $417,000 or less climbed to 3.70 percent, which was its highest since 3.75 percent in the week ended June 24, the Washington-based group said.
Meanwhile, MBA's seasonal adjusted index on applications for loans to buy a home, which is seen as a gauge on future housing activity, fell 7 percent from a week earlier.
This week's domestic housing data were mixed. 
The government said on Tuesday housing starts fell more than expected by 5.8 percent to an annualized 1.14 million units in August. Analysts blamed the drop on the flooding in Texas and Louisiana, which cut into construction in the South.
On the other hand, the National Association of Home Builders and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said on Monday their index on their members' confidence increased to 65 points in September, matching its strongest level since October 2015. This compared with a downwardly revised 59 in August.
The MBA's index on overall mortgage activity fell 7.3 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis from a week earlier.

The refinance share of mortgage activity edged up to 63.1 percent last week, compared with 62.9 percent the previous week.

Financial data firm Markit said its Household Finance Index stayed broadly flat at 44.8 in September from its August level of 44.9, maintaining the rebound from a plunge in July shortly after the referendum on EU membership.
Expectations for living costs in 12 months' time dropped to their lowest since January.
The Bank of England has predicted that households will gradually feel the pinch of weaker spending power following the referendum as the sharp fall in the value of sterling trickles down to consumer prices.
The BoE last month cut interest rates to a record low and took other measures to help the economy cope with the effects of the Brexit vote.
""A swift monetary policy response and a more settled political picture have likely helped to allay fears of a severe downturn"", Markit economist Philip Leake said in a statement.
The survey showed 25 percent of households expected another BoE rate cut ""at some time,"" down from 39 percent in August.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan overhauled its monetary policy framework on Wednesday, switching to targeting interest rates and sidelining more than three years of massive money printing that did little to jolt the economy out of a decades-long funk.
But the BOJ held off on deepening negative interest rates or expanding its asset purchase target, saying the modification was aimed at resetting its stimulus program for a protracted battle to hit and then keep to its 2 percent inflation goal.
Japanese stocks rose and the yen fell on hopes that the BOJ's decision to reset its stimulus program would ease pressure on the country's banks and insurers, although some analysts doubted whether the move would have a lasting positive impact on financial markets.
""The impression is that the BOJ is starting to pull back some of its troops from the battlefront,"" said Katsutoshi Inadome, senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFG  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. ""The markets could now begin testing the BOJ's commitment to its price target in the next few months.""
Kuroda said directly targeting interest rates could work more effectively to raise inflation expectations than focusing on base money.
""It's very effective in the long-term perspective. But in the short term, there isn't a clear link between the base money target and inflation expectations,"" Kuroda told a news conference. ""That's why the new policy framework can respond to changes in the economy and prices more flexibly.""
BOND BUYING PACE UNCHANGED
At the two-day rate review that ended on Wednesday, the BOJ abandoned its base money target and instead adopted ""yield curve control"" under which it will buy long-term government bonds to keep 10-year bond yields at current levels around zero percent.
It will continue to buy long-term government bonds at a pace that ensures its holdings increase by 80 trillion yen ($781 billion) per year, and maintained the 0.1 percent negative interest rate it applies to some of the excess reserves that financial institutions park with the central bank.
Under the new framework that adds yield curve control to its current quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE) regime, the BOJ could deepen negative rates, lower the long-term rate target, or expand base money if it were to ease again, the central bank said in a statement announcing the policy decision.
""The BOJ will seek to lower real interest rates by controlling short-term and long-term interest rates, which would be placed at the core of the new policy framework,"" it said.

653,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2016 12:22AM ET</span>",Bank of Japan unveils new policy framework that targets long-term rates,"Investing.com - The Bank of Japan unveiled complex changes to its policy framework by setting a target for long-term interest rates even as it kept a 0.1% negative rate on certain cash holding while rejigging its monetary base target of ¥80 trillion annually to support its yield aims, the central bank said Wednesday at the end of a two-day board meeting.
""The BoJ will seek to lower real interest rates by controlling short-term and long-term interest rates, which would be placed as the core of the new policy framework,"" the central bank said.
The new yield curve policy was adopted in a 7 to 2 vote by the 9-member board and the related measure on a revised Japan government bond market operations passed by an 8 to 1 vote with the stated aim of the changes to reach inflation levels sustained above 2%. That means the BoJ has effectively abandoned a base money target and replaced it with a ""yield curve control"" effort to buy long-term government bonds to keep 10-year bond yields around the current levels of 0%, though at a pace of the ¥80 trillion annual level now used.
""The main point for the BoJ's decision is that the bank set long-term yields as a target. The central bank is giving certain consideration to the financial industry by trying to work on the yield curve,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at the Itochu Research Institute in Tokyo.
""The BoJ changed its policy framework significantly as the central bank previously did not show much attention to the yield curve. ""We can take the BoJ's decision positively as the bank is trying to find more effective ways. The BoJ has done what it could do and the onus now is on the government to push forward with its growth strategy.""
The central bank also noted that inflation can even overshoot its target with Governor Haruhiko Kuroda slated to explain the moves in detail at a news conference at 3:30 p.m Tokyo time. (0630 GMT).

SEOUL (Reuters) - Sentiment at Asian companies edged up to its highest level in five quarters in July-September, boosted by signs that China's economy is stabilizing and as concerns about Britain's move to exit the European Union recede, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed.
But businesses cited the policy uncertainty from a potential victory for U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, as well as energy prices as key risks. 
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index <.TRIABS> , representing the six-month outlook at 118 firms, was 68 in the third quarter against 67 three months prior - marking the third consecutive quarterly gain from a four-year low in December. A reading over 50 indicates a positive view.
""The risks in China look more manageable. Brexit has not yet resulted into a full-blown crisis so there is a hope that it will be contained,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at INSEAD.
The index started in 2009 with an all-time low of 45, but has largely hovered between 60 and 70 in the years since then.
China, the world's second-biggest economy, had a subindex of 90, its highest since the first quarter of 2011. Four of five respondents in China rated their six-month business outlook as positive, while one was neutral.
China's factory output and retail sales grew faster than expected in August buoyed by a strong housing market and a government infrastructure spending spree, suggesting the country's third-quarter growth is holding up better than expected. 
Australia, a major supplier of resources to China, saw this quarter's biggest gain in sentiment, with a 19-point jump in its subindex to 88, as the economy expanded at its fastest annual pace in four years in the second quarter.
Singapore was this quarter's steepest decliner, with a 25-point slump in its subindex to 38. Singapore's exports in August stagnated, adding to concerns for the city-state which has been hurt by the tumble in oil prices and last month cut its economic growth forecast.
In contrast, companies in the Philippines were the most optimistic for a fifth straight quarter, with a subindex of 94, due to strong economic growth in the Southeast Asian nation.
South Korea and Japan posted a neutral index of 50 each, with business sentiment dropping from 73 in the case of Korea and climbing from 46 for Japan.   
A Trump U.S. presidency and energy prices were most often cited as the biggest business risks for the firms, with 15 of 114 responses each, followed by China’s rising corporate debt at 14. 
""Yes, Trump represents a risk,"" said INSEAD's Fatas, adding these included geopolitical risk and a lack of concrete economic proposals.

SECTOR OUTLOOKS
Other risks cited by the survey respondents included sluggish consumer sentiment with eight mentions while seven firms cited foreign exchange volatility.
The latest poll, conducted Sept. 1 through Sept. 17, showed 49 percent of respondents had a positive outlook - the highest in nearly two years. Thirty eight percent were neutral while 13 percent were negative. 
By sector, sentiment rose the most in the real estate sector, with a subindex climbing 12 points to 75, making it among the top performers.
The biggest decliner was the retail and leisure sector, with its reading falling 14 points to 68. 
The construction & engineering sector remained the most downbeat, with a reading of 58. But the mood was bright in South Korea, where construction began on a record 720,000 new residential units last year.
""We expect construction materials to boom until next year as the construction market has been experiencing a strong demand last year and this year,""  KCC  (KS:002380), a leading South Korean construction materials maker, said in an emailed statement.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2016 09:08PM ET</span>","Japan exports fall more than expected, eyes on BOJ review","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell in August for a 11th consecutive month due to the yen strength and sluggish overseas demand, in a sign that an export-reliant economy may struggle to accelerate in the current quarter.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Wednesday that exports fell 9.6 percent in the year to August, dragged down by shipments of cars and steel. The year-on-year fall was bigger than a 4.8 percent drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll, following a 14.0 percent decline in July.
The data underscored a dominant market view that any growth in the world's third largest economy would be moderate in July-September, offering little solace to the Bank of Japan, which concludes its two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday.
With growth lacking strength and inflation undershooting the Bank of Japan's 2 percent goal, many analysts in a Reuters poll expect the BOJ to ease further on Wednesday when it announces results of comprehensive review of its stimulus.
""Exports lacked momentum, although they were not so weak as the headline figure suggested. On average they were largely flat or on a gradual recovery,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Given the yen's gains, however, exports would likely struggle to accelerate ahead,"" he said.
The MOF data showed exports to China - Japan's largest trading partner - fell 8.9 percent in the year to August, marking the sixth straight month of annual declines.
Shipments to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japanese exports, fell 9.4 percent, led by South Korea-bound shipments of steel. It was the 12th straight month of falls.
U.S.-bound exports fell 14.5 percent, hurt by declines in car shipments, while exports to European Union fell 0.7 percent.
Imports fell 17.3 percent in the year to August, versus the median estimate for a 17.8 percent annual decline, as the yen's gains and dip in oil prices lowered import costs. 
The trade balance swung to a deficit of 18.7 billion yen ($183.91 million), versus the median estimate for a 202.3 billion yen surplus. It was the first trade deficit in three months.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized rate of 0.7 percent in April-June, slowing from the prior quarter's 2.1 percent growth, led by leap year effects, as exports and capital spending fell.
The Reuters poll of economists showed the economy was likely to expand an annualized 0.7 percent in the current quarter and 0.6 percent in the final three months of this year.

Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index  probably rose 8.91 percent in the 12 months through mid-September, little changed from the 8.95 percent increase through mid-August, according to the median of 22 forecasts.
On a monthly basis, prices probably rose 0.35 percent, down from an increase of 0.45 percent in mid-August, according to the median of 25 estimates for the indicator due on Thursday.
The central bank's official inflation target is 4.5 percent, a goal it expects to reach only in late 2017. The bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at 14.25 percent, the highest in a decade, but has signaled it could start lowering rates in the coming months if inflation falls more substantially as the economy reels from its worst recession in eight decades.
Most of the expected price increases in the past month were from higher health care and housing costs, economists at Itaú Unibanco said in a research note.
Food and beverage prices, which have surged in recent months as weather hurt crops, are expected to have eased in the first two weeks of September, led by falling milk and bean prices. 

Estimates for the month-on-month inflation rate ranged from 0.24 percent to 0.45 percent, while forecasts for the 12-month rate were between 8.80 percent and 9.02 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts fell more than expected in August likely as bad weather disrupted building activity in the South, but a solid increase in permits for single-family dwellings suggested demand for housing remained intact.
Tuesday's weak housing report came as officials from the Federal Reserve were due to gather for a two-day meeting to assess the economy and deliberate on monetary policy. 
It joined a stream of recent soft economic data such as retail sales, nonfarm payrolls and industrial production, which, together with low inflation are expected to encourage the U.S. central bank to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday.
Groundbreaking decreased 5.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.14 million units after two straight months of strong gains, the Commerce Department said.
Single-family housing starts in the South, which accounts for the bulk of home building, tumbled 13.1 percent to their lowest level since May 2015. Economists said flooding in Texas and Louisiana was probably behind the drop in starts last month.
""We believe that the slowdown in August starts likely owes to a temporary weather effect rather than a substantive shift in the underlying trend,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""Excluding the South, housing starts increased a robust 4.2 percent.""
Permits for future construction slipped 0.4 percent to a 1.14 million-unit rate last month as approvals for the volatile multi-family homes segment tumbled 7.2 percent to a 402,000 unit-rate. Permits for single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, surged 3.7 percent to a 737,000-unit pace.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts falling to a 1.19 million-unit pace last month and building permits rising to a 1.17 million-unit rate.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors awaited Wednesday's outcome of the Fed's meeting. The broader PHLX housing index (HGX), which includes builders, building products and mortgage companies, fell 0.76 percent.
STRONG HOUSING FUNDAMENTALS
Last month's decline in starts was largely anticipated as groundbreaking activity has been running well ahead of permits approvals over the past several months, especially in the single-family housing segment. 
The drop left starts just below their second-quarter average, suggesting little or no contribution from residential construction to economic growth in the third quarter. 
Spending on home building was a small drag on output in the April-June period. Following the report, the Atlanta Fed trimmed its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.9 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 1.1 percent rate in the second quarter. 
Demand for housing is being driven by a tightening labor market, which is lifting wages. A survey of homebuilders published on Monday showed confidence hitting an 11-month high in September, with builders bullish about current sales now and over the next six months, as well as prospective buyer traffic. 
Housing market strength boosted  Lennar  Corp's (N:LEN) profits in the third quarter. Lennar, the second-largest U.S. homebuilder, said it sold 6,779 homes in the three months ended Aug. 31, up 7.3 percent from a year earlier, while its average sales price rose more than 3 percent.
""Conditions seem well aligned for strong new home building. Borrowing costs remain low, the inventory of homes for sale, both new and existing, are relatively low and failing to make meaningful progress,"" said Kristin Reynolds, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
Groundbreaking on single-family homes dropped 6.0 percent to a 722,000-unit pace in August, the lowest level since last October. But with permits for the construction of single-family homes rising last month, single-family home building could rebound in the months ahead. 
The single-family housing market is being supported by a dearth of previously owned homes available for sale. 

Housing starts for the volatile multi-family segment fell 5.4 percent to a 420,000-unit pace. The multi-family segment of the market has been buoyed by strong demand for rental accommodation as some Americans shun homeownership in the aftermath of the housing market collapse.

That would be the smallest year-on-year drop in CPI since July 2015, when CPI also fell by 0.4 percent.
Downward pressure on prices is expected to have moderated in August, with economists citing factors such as recent rises in the prices of car permits.
Headline CPI has been falling on an annual basis since November 2014, hit by lower global oil prices as well as falls in housing rents and private transport costs.

Real disposable income has been falling since 2014 when Russia was hit by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, but the 9.3 percent decline, in annual terms, was the steepest since August 2009, the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
Real income, adjusted for inflation, also declined, by 1 percent, after showing some positive signs earlier this summer, according to the data from the Federal Statistics Service, or Rosstat.
With less money to spend, consumers also stayed away from shopping, with retail sales, a barometer of customer demand in Russia, down 5.1 percent in August and following a 5.2 percent decline in July.
While the data suggest that the impact of customer spending on inflation diminishes, it also clouds the prospect of an economic recovery, with consumer demand traditionally a big growth factor.
Russia's gross domestic product is expected to contract about 0.5-0.6 percent this year before returning to moderate growth of 0.6-0.8 percent next year..
The consumer pain has done nothing to dim the popularity of the Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, which was on course for its largest majority after the weekend's election, although critics noted a sharp fall in turnout.
The central bank cut its key rate on Friday, but promised tight monetary policy until the end of the year and until its target of 4 percent inflation, hoped to be achieved next year, becomes sustainable.
Overall data for August showed some improvements, with industrial output expanding by 0.7 percent after a small contraction in July and a stable and low unemployment.
""Russian activity data for August suggest that the economy continued to pull out of its slump, albeit very slowly,"" Liza Ermolenko, an economist at Capital Economics in London, wrote in a note.

""The recovery is still being driven by industry, but there are no signs of improvement in consumer-facing sectors.""

An upswing in home sales should support the U.S. economic expansion and the view the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates by the end of the year, analysts said.
U.S. household wealth has grown on a resilient real estate market. It increased to $89.1 trillion in the second quarter, Fed data released on Friday showed.
In the latest survey, the measure on current sales expectations rose 6 points to 71, while the gauge on sales outlook in the next six months increased 5 points to 71.
The component on traffic of prospective buyers climbed 4 points to 48.

By region, the three-month average indexes showed the Northeast and South each booked a 1-point gain to 42 and 64, respectively, while the West increased 4 points to 73. The Midwest was unchanged at 55, NAHB said.

The Bank's decision to hold the rate for a fifth successive time is in line with steps taken by authorities to stabilize the macro-economy of the West African country and reduce inflation, which rose slightly to 16.9 percent in August.
""The committee noted the moderation in headline inflation since the July meeting on the back of continued cedi stability, easing inflation pressures and tight credit conditions,"" Governor Abdul-Nashiru Issahaku told a news conference at the end of a Monetary Policy Committee review meeting.
Ghana signed a three-year aid program in April 2015 with the International Monetary Fund to restore fiscal balance to an economy dogged by deficits, public debt and high interest rates with inflation above the government's 2016 target of 11 percent.

The country is due to hold an election on Dec. 7 at which President John Mahama will vie for a second and final four-year term, but Issahaku said the vote was not a concern for monetary policy.

A robust recovery in home prices and sales, thanks to a flurry of government stimulus measures, gave a stronger-than-expected boost to the world's second largest economy this year, but eye-popping home price rises in bigger cities have raised fears of overheating.
Average new home prices in 70 major cities climbed 9.2 percent last month from a year ago, accelerating from July's 7.9 percent rise, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Statistics Bureau (NBS) on Monday.
The NBS data showed 64 of 70 major cities tracked by the NBS saw year-on-year price gains, up from 51 in July. 
Prices in second- and third-tier cities are rising at an alarmingly sharp rate, and speculation was rising that more cities would impose more stringent controls to discourage overeating. 
The coastal city of Xiamen outperformed long-time top performer Shenzhen and had the sharpest price spike, with prices surging 43.8 percent from a year earlier, faster than the 39.2 percent rise in July.
The inland city of Hefei was the second-fastest growing market according to the survey, with prices rising an annual 40.3 percent in August, versus a 33.8 percent gain in July.
With the buying frenzy spilling over from first-tier cities to other parts of the country, more affluent second- and third-tier cities such as Xiamen, Nanjing and Wuhan have stepped up restrictive measures, hoping to deter speculators and cool prices. 
Housing authorities from the eastern city of Hangzhou announced on Sunday that it will begin to restrict home purchases as of Sept. 19. Families who are not registered as residents and already own one or more houses in certain districts cannot purchase another home, either new or pre-owned.
Prices in the southern boomtown Shenzhen rose 36.8 percent from a year ago, slowing from 40.9 percent in July. Shanghai and Beijing prices rose 31.2 percent and 23.5 percent on-year, quickening from 27.3 percent and 20.7 percent in July. Month-on-month gains rose to 3.6 percent and 3.5 percent from 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent in July.
First-tier cities such as Shenzhen and Shanghai have tightened downpayment requirements for second homes and raised the eligibility bar for non-residents to purchase properties.
Despite signs of a broadening recovery, many small cities still have a large glut of unsold homes. Prices in the rustbelt city Dandong recorded the biggest fall at 2.1 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in July. 
Official data showed that mortgage loans remained the major driver of China's overall loan growth, accounting for more than 70 percent of bank loans in August. The rapid rise in property loans over the past few months has been a notable cause of concern among analysts.
Investment growth in Chinese real estate picked up in August on a yearly basis following a gradual decline since April, suggesting that investors are still optimistic of a booming property market.

The entrepreneurs' confidence index rose to 51.2 percent in the third quarter, 2.2 percentage points higher than in the second quarter, a central bank survey showed.
China's factory output and retail sales grew faster than expected in August as a strong housing market and a government infrastructure spending spree underpinned growth in the world's second-largest economy.

The central bank has cut interest rates six times since November 2014 and reduced the amount of cash that banks must set aside as reserves.
Another survey by the central bank showed that 53.7 percent of households rated housing prices as ""unacceptably high"", up 0.3 percentage points from the second quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in August as healthcare costs recorded their biggest gain in 32-1/2 years, pointing to a steady build-up of inflation that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.
The cost of living last month was also pushed up by sustained increases in rents. The uptick in inflation is likely to be welcomed by Fed officials when they gather next week to deliberate on monetary policy, though a rate hike is not expected at that meeting. 
""The economy may not be firing on all cylinders, but growth is enough to spark a little more inflation than we thought. The Fed decision is going down to the wire,"" said Chris Rupkey,"" chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month after being unchanged in July. In the 12 months through August, the CPI increased 1.1 percent after advancing 0.8 percent in the year through July.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.3 percent last month, the biggest increase since February, after gaining 0.1 percent in July. 
Economists had forecast the CPI nudging up 0.1 percent last month and the core CPI gaining 0.2 percent. The core CPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through August after rising 2.2 percent in the year through July.
The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were mixed. U.S. stocks were trading lower, with sentiment also hurt by declining oil prices and the U.S. Justice Department's demand for $14 billion from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to settle claims related to sales of mortgage-backed securities.
The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged next week against the backdrop of a raft of disappointing economic reports for August, including weak retail sales and industrial production as well as a slowdown in job growth. 
A separate report on Friday, however, showed consumer sentiment was steady in early September, suggesting retail sales could rebound in the coming months.
The U.S. central bank has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure that has been stuck at 1.6 percent since March. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Monday she wanted to see stronger consumer spending data and signs of rising inflation before hiking rates.
'DARK CLOUD'
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held it steady this year amid concerns over persistently low inflation. Many economists expect the Fed to increase borrowing costs at its December policy meeting. 
Medical care costs jumped 1.0 percent last month, the largest increase since February 1984, after advancing 0.5 percent in July. The cost of hospital services jumped 1.7 percent, the biggest gain since October 2015. Prices for prescription medicine soared 1.3 percent.
Economists linked the surges to the expansion of healthcare coverage under President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare restructuring law.
""This, of course, is the dark cloud surrounding the good-news story about record numbers of people signing up for health insurance,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. ""The bulk of the increase was among the population with pre-existing conditions, which has significantly boosted costs for all.""
Given the strong increases in healthcare costs, economists are forecasting the Fed's preferred measure - the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - to rise 0.2 percent in August after increasing 0.1 percent in both June and July.
That would take the year-on-year gain to 1.7 percent, which would be the biggest increase since February. The CPI and PCE price index diverge in part due to differences in coverage and weights assigned to healthcare and housing costs. 
""With the economy near full employment and more and more signs of higher wage and unit labor cost inflation, the risks are rising that it will be PCE moving up to CPI,"" said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. ""In that case, the Fed will no longer have the luxury of being slow, gradual and cautious.""
Last month, owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3 percent in August. It has risen by the same margin every month since April. Americans also paid more for motor vehicle insurance and apparel. Prices for tobacco also rose.
But households got some relief from gasoline prices, which fell 0.9 percent last month. Food prices were unchanged, with the cost of food consumed at home declining for a fourth straight month.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank cut its main lending rate on Friday for the second time this year, citing an inflation slowdown, decrease in inflation expectations and an uncertain recovery, but said there would be no further cuts until next year.
The 50 basis point cut to 10 percent  was in line with the expectations of economists, who had pointed to the fact that real interest rates in Russia were high.
For a trend towards a sustainable decline in inflation to strengthen, the central bank said the key rate needed to be maintained until the end of the year at 10 percent with further possible cuts in the first and second quarters of next year.
""The Bank of Russia expects the decision made and maintenance of the key rate at the level it reached will bring down inflation expectations,"" it said in a statement.
The central bank is treading cautiously on monetary policy, despite the economy struggling to emerge from a deep slump, as it battles to bring inflation down to its target level of 4 percent by the end of next year.
Inflation slowed to 6.9 percent year on year in August  from 9.8 percent in January.
Nevertheless, central bank head Elvira Nabiullina said last week the central bank would continue its ""moderately tight"" monetary policy and that interest rates that are above inflation were a ""new reality"".
The bank said on Friday that more time was needed for positive trends to get rooted in the economy but that positive quarterly gross domestic product growth was possible in the second half of the year. 
Next year growth would stay below 1 percent, the bank said, basing its prediction on sluggish growth in the global economy, an average oil price of around $40 per barrel and persistent structural constraints for Russian economic development.
The central bank forecast inflation would be at 4.5 percent in September 2017 and would then fall to the bank's 4 percent target in late 2017.
The rouble barely reacted to the rate decision.

Nabiullina is to hold a news conference at 1200 GMT, when she is expected to give new guidance on the outlook for Russian monetary policy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports were expected to post an 11th consecutive fall in August, a Reuters poll found on Friday, as weak foreign demand and a persistently strong yen took their toll.
Exports were seen likely to fall 4.8 percent in August from a year earlier, compounding July's 14.0 percent drop, which was the most rapid decline since the global financial crisis in 2009.
The poll found imports were expected to drop 17.8 percent from a year ago to produce a trade surplus of 202.3 billion yen ($2 billion) - a third straight monthly trade surplus.
""Advanced countries' economies continue to grow moderately but China's economy is slowing down, so the global economy has not regained its momentum,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""In addition to that, the strong yen lowered both import and export prices.""
The finance ministry will issue the trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday Sept. 21 (2350 GMT Sept. 20).
The yen hovered around 102.00 yen per dollar  on Friday in jittery trade ahead of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision next week.
The BOJ will conduct a ""comprehensive review"" of the effect of its monetary policy at its meeting Sept. 20-21 
The central bank will consider making negative interest rates the centerpiece of future monetary easing by shifting its prime policy target to interest rates from base money at the review, sources familiar with its thinking said.
The poll showed analysts were divided over whether the BOJ would cut its minus 0.1 percent interest rates even deeper next week.
Six of 11 analysts predicted the BOJ would keep its negative interest rates unchanged, while three expected the bank would cut its rates to minus 0.2 percent. Two said the rates would be lowered to minus 0.3 percent.

Despite the BOJ's efforts under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who took the post in 2013, few Japanese companies see the central bank's aggressive monetary stimulus achieving its stated goal of spurring 2 percent inflation, a separate Reuters' survey found.

690,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2016 01:32PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales, factory output slump; third-quarter growth forecast cut","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in August amid weak purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods, pointing to cooling domestic demand that further diminishes expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase next week.
The economic growth outlook also took a hit from other data on Thursday showing a drop in manufacturing output last month. The reports, which extended August's run of weak data, prompted economists to cut their growth estimates for the third quarter.
""With households not buying, manufacturers stopped producing. If the Fed is data dependent, then the next time a hike would likely come is December,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The Commerce Department said retail sales declined 0.3 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in July. Sales were up 1.9 percent from a year ago. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales slipped 0.1 percent last month after a similar drop in July.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely
with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
Economists had forecast overall retail sales slipping 0.1 percent and core sales climbing 0.3 percent last month. 
Sales were almost broadly weak, rising in only four categories, including clothing stores and restaurants and bars. Receipts at auto dealerships fell 0.9 percent and online sales, whose share has grown in recent years, dropped 0.3 percent. 
The Fed will hold its policy meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Monday she wanted to see stronger consumer spending data and signs of rising inflation before hiking rates.
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held it steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation.
Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 12 percent probability of a rate hike next week, down from 15 percent before the data, according to the CME FedWatch tool. September rate hike probabilities have been declining since early this month in the wake of a slowdown in job growth in August. 
Stocks on Wall Street rose on the diminishing chances of a rate hike next week, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Prices for shorter-dated U.S. Treasury debt rose marginally.
MANUFACTURING STRUGGLING
In a second report, the Fed said manufacturing output fell 0.4 percent in August, reversing July's increase. Output was hurt by declines in the production of nondurable goods. While many durable goods industries posted declines of nearly 1 percent or more, motor vehicle assembly increased.
Manufacturing is grappling with the lingering effects of a strong dollar and lower oil prices. Activity in the sector, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has also been undercut by an inventory correction. Regional surveys also suggested factories remained on the back foot in September.
But there was good news from mining, where output rose 1.0 percent in August as oil and gas well drilling increased for a third straight month.
In the wake of the dour reports, the Atlanta Fed lowered its third-quarter GDP estimate by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.0 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 1.1 percent rate in the second quarter. 
Even as domestic demand shows some signs of fatigue after surging in the second quarter, layoffs remain very low. A third report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits edged up 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 260,000 for the week ended Sept. 10.
It was the 80th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with robust labor market conditions. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
""Companies remain unwilling to let go of workers, presumably reflecting the difficulty of hiring new workers. In our view, the labor market is tight,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.A fourth report from the Labor Department suggested the strong dollar and cheap oil's dampening effects on producer inflation were ebbing. 
The producer price index for final demand was unchanged in August following a 0.4 percent drop in July. Excluding food, energy and trade services, producer prices increased 0.3 percent last month after being unchanged in July. 

The so-called core PPI increased 1.2 percent in the 12 months through August, the biggest gain since December 2014, after rising 0.8 percent in July.

Industrial output fell 0.4 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.6 percent increase in July. Last month, manufacturing output also declined 0.4 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production declining 0.3 percent last month.
The industrial sector measured by the U.S. central bank comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
It had recently picked up after declining for much of the last 18 months but continues to struggle to shake off the dampening effects of weak global demand, a strong dollar and low oil prices.
Last month, there were some positive signs for the hard-hit energy sector, with mining output rising 1.0 percent, it's fourth consecutive monthly increase. However, the index for utilities fell 1.4 percent.
Business equipment output also dropped 0.4 percent, with cutbacks of nearly 2 percent for industrial and other equipment, the Fed said.
With overall output decreasing, the percentage of industrial capacity in use fell 0.4 percentage points in August to 75.5 percent, from an unrevised 75.9 percent in July.

The Fed sees capacity use as a leading indicator in deciding how much further the economy can grow before sparking higher inflation.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday retail sales declined 0.3 percent after an upwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in July. Retail sales in July were previously reported to have been unchanged.
Sales were up 1.9 percent from a year ago. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales slipped 0.1 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent drop in July.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
They were previously reported to have been unchanged in July. Economists had forecast overall retail sales slipping 0.1 percent and core sales climbing 0.3 percent last month.
Coming on the heels of reports showing a slump in manufacturing activity in August and a slowdown in job growth, the retail sales data temper hopes of a strong rebound in economic growth in the third quarter.
The report also suggests the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at its Sept. 20-21 policy meeting. Fed Governor Lael
Brainard said on Monday she wants to see stronger consumer spending data and signs of rising inflation before raising interest rates.
The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting the economy growing at a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter.
Auto sales fell 0.9 percent last month and sales at service stations dropped 0.8 percent. Sales at online retailers slipped 0.3 percent and receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores decreased 1.4 percent.

There were also declines in sales at furniture and building material stores. Receipts at clothing stores, however, rose 0.7 percent. Sales at electronics and appliance outlets gained 0.1 percent and receipts at restaurants and bars rose 0.9 percent.

LONDON, (Reuters) - The Bank of England said it was still likely to cut interest rates to just above zero later this year, even though the initial Brexit hit to Britain's economy would be less severe than it expected only last month.
The Bank said on Thursday its nine rate-setters were unanimous in their decision to keep Bank Rate at its new record low of 0.25 percent, the lowest in the BoE's 322-year history.
They also voted 9-0 to keep the Bank's bond-buying program target at 435 billion pounds and to continue with its new plan to buy up to 10 billion pounds worth of corporate bonds.
Two rate-setters who last month opposed the expansion of the government bond buying program said they still did not think it was needed, but voted in line with their colleagues because reversing the decision now would be too disruptive.
Last month the BoE decided to help Britain's economy cope with the shock of the decision to leave the European Union with a stimulus package on a scale not seen since the depths of the global financial crisis.
But since August, a string of indicators has shown a bounceback from the initial impact of the Brexit vote, surprising the BoE although the economy is on course to slow sharply.
""A number of indicators of near-term economic activity have been somewhat stronger than expected,"" the Bank said in minutes of the MPC's September meeting. ""The Committee now expect less of a slowing in UK GDP growth in the second half of 2016.""
Central bank staff estimated the economy would grow by 0.3 percent in the July-September period, better than their previous forecast of a slow crawl of just 0.1 percent made in August.
However, growth of 0.3 percent would represent a halving from the second quarter's pace and the Bank reiterated it could well cut its benchmark lending rate further soon.
""The Committee's view of the contours of the economic outlook following the EU referendum had not changed,"" the minutes said.
If the Bank's November forecasts were ""broadly consistent"" with August's, ""a majority of members expected to support a further cut in Bank Rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC's forthcoming meetings during the course of the year,"" they said, reiterating the MPC's message in August.
The members of the Monetary Policy Committee said they continued to expect that the uncertainty caused by the vote would drag on the economy as Britain and the EU haggle over the terms of their new relationship which will probably reduce access for British companies to the bloc's single market.
The MPC members noted that surveys since August had shown companies were probably cutting back on business investment, something which would weigh on the economy going forward, but the housing market had proven slightly more robust than expected.
Under the MPC's new calendar, the Bank's next rate decision is scheduled to place in November. That is when economists expect it to cut borrowing costs to around 0.1 percent.
The September meeting was the first for former Citi economist Michael Saunders who took the place of Martin Weale who opposed restarting QE in August, before he left the Bank.
British finance minister Philip Hammond has said he will back up the BoE's monetary stimulus for the economy by slowing the country's push to turn its budget deficit into a surplus and he is expected to announce higher public spending in November.

711,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 15, 2016 07:00AM ET</span>",BoE holds on interest rates but a majority expect further cut this year,"Investing.com – As expected, the Bank of England (BoE) decided on Thursday to keep interest rates unchanged at a record low as well as stand pat on its asset purchase program, though a majority of members expect a further rate could at one of this year's meetings.
Specifically, the BoE left the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.25%, in line with market forecasts.
The decision to maintain interest rates was undertaken in a unanimous vote.
Furthermore, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also voted unanimously to leave its asset purchase program unchanged as expected at £435 billion.
Similarly, the MPC voted unanimously to continue with the program of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases totaling up to £10 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.
According to the minutes, the BoE felt that the evidence on the initial impact of the policy package announced in August is encouraging, but promised to closely monitor changes in asset prices and in interest rates facing households and firms and their effect on economic activity.
The MPC also noted that a number of near-term indicators of economic activity had been somewhat stronger than expected and thus now expects “less of a slowing in U.K. GDP growth in the second half of 2016.”
""It was more difficult to draw a strong inference from these data about the Committee’s projections for 2017 and beyond,"" the minutes explained.
""Moreover, there had been no new information since the August Inflation Report relevant for longer-term prospects for the UK economy,"" the document added.
Additionally, the BoE noted that the August inflation data was well below the 2% target, but forecast it to return to that level in the first half of 2017.
The minutes further revealed that the MPC’s economic outlook remained unchanged despite the fact that news on the near-term momentum of the British economy had been slightly to the upside.
The MPC further indicated that it would continue to evaluate forthcoming indicators during the November forecast round and, if the data comes in line with its expectations, a ""majority of members"" expect to support a further cut in the interest rate toward the lower bound “at one of the MPC’s forthcoming meetings during the course of this year.”
“The MPC currently judges this bound to be close to, but a little above, zero,” the minutes concluded.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2016 06:53AM ET</span>",Swiss central bank keeps policy loose to curb strong franc,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's central bank shrugged off criticism of its negative interest rates, sticking to its recipe of ultra-loose monetary policy and currency intervention amid ""considerable"" economic uncertainty in Europe.
The Swiss National Bank said on Thursday it expected moderate growth in the global economy but significant risks remained, particularly following Britain's June vote to quit the European Union.
The SNB said it expected the export-led Swiss economy to expand 1.5 percent in 2016, at the upper end of its June forecast of 1 percent to 1.5 percent, but growth ""is likely to be more modest than in the first half, partly owing to a temporary weakening of growth in Europe"".
The central bank kept its target range for three-month Libor at -1.25 to –0.25 percent, as expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It also kept its interest rate on cash deposits at -0.75 percent, as expected.
Negative rates and currency interventions have been the cornerstone of the SNB's strategy to weaken demand for the Swiss franc since it scrapped its cap against the euro in January 2015.
SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan told Swiss broadcaster SRF: ""We never comment on our interventions. The franc remains clearly overvalued and that's why we are maintaining our expansive monetary policy. Our monetary policy is aimed at reducing the pressure on the franc.""
The franc was little changed at around 1.0950 against the euro (EURCHF=) on the SNB's announcement. 
Negative rates have triggered increasing unease in Switzerland, acting as a charge on banks, while insurers and pension funds have been wrestling with low bond yields.
WAIT AND SEE MODE
""The negative interest rates have caused disastrous problems,"" Christoph Blocher, the strategy chief of the right-wing Swiss People's Party, told newspaper Schweiz am Sonntag. ""Whoever saves is being dispossessed; that hits the pension funds, savers in general and a lot of ordinary people.""
""The negative interest rates, together with the already extremely low interest rates (for bonds), make it even more difficult for pension funds to achieve the necessary returns they need to fulfill their promises,"" said Hans Peter Konrad, director of the Swiss pension fund association.
The SNB was waiting to see how the franc exchange rate developed, and especially what the European Central Bank does with its stimulus package, before changing its own policy, analysts said.
""The SNB will remain in 'wait and see' mode,"" said Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank.
""However, the issues from Brexit are only now beginning to materialize both on the economic and political front and may turn up the heat on the Swiss franc in the coming months.""
Britain's vote to leave the EU ""has caused considerable uncertainty and makes an assessment of the global economic outlook more difficult"", the SNB said, adding it had revised downwards its growth expectations for the UK and the euro area. 
Such an environment left the SNB little room to change its policy, economists said.

""While the SNB acknowledged that the recovery of the Swiss economy was somewhat stronger than expected, the SNB has become slightly less optimistic on the outlook of the European economy following the Brexit referendum,"" said Ursina Kubli, a forex strategist at J. Safra Sarasin. ""Therefore, an expansive monetary policy is still fully warranted in Switzerland.""

714,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2016 04:40AM ET</span>",UK retail sales show little sign of post-Brexit vote slowdown,"LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - British retail sales softened only slightly in August after a bumper July, suggesting June's vote to leave the EU has had little impact on shoppers' willingness to spend, official figures showed on Thursday.
Spending by shoppers has been largely robust in the wake of June's referendum decision to leave the European Union, despite consumer sentiment initially suffering its sharpest monthly fall in a generation.
""Despite a small after July's sharp increase, the underlying pattern in the retail sector remains one of solid growth,"" ONS statistician Mel Richard said. ""Overall the figures do not suggest any major fall in post-referendum consumer confidence.""
Retail sales volumes edged 0.2 percent down on the month in August after jumping an upwardly revised 1.9 percent in July, the strongest July performance in 14 years. August's fall was smaller than the 0.4 percent drop forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, the Office for National Statistics said.
Compared with a year earlier, sales volumes were up 6.2 percent versus forecasts for a 5.4 percent rise and 6.3 percent growth recorded in July. Excluding fuel, August sales rose 5.9 percent, the biggest rise since November 2014.
Spooked by initial signs of a big slowdown in economic activity, last month the Bank of England cut interest rates for the first time since 2009, and announced it would buy 60 billion pounds of government bonds over the next six months.
The BoE is not expected to change policy when it releases its September policy decision at 1100 GMT (07:00 a.m. EDT) on Thursday, and expects consumer spending growth to halve next year in real terms as a post-Brexit inflation spike erodes disposable income.
In the meantime, British businesses are saying it is too early to judge the medium-term impact of June's vote.
In half-year results earlier on Thursday,  Next  (L:NXT), one of Britain's biggest clothing retailers, said sales since July had been volatile, with gains driven by heavy seasonal discounts.
Department store and supermarket chain John Lewis said the EU referendum had had little noticeable impact but that the full impact was not yet clear.
Although food sales gained on the month in August, the ONS figures showed the biggest monthly fall in non-food sales since December - something the statistics agency said could not be explained by patterns in seasonal discounts.

Sales of pricier household goods such as electrical appliances and hardware contracted year-on-year for the first time since May 2014.

In a statement, the SNB said it was keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged at -0.75%, in line with expectations. The central bank also left the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at between -1.25% and -0.25%.
The accompanying rate statement released after the announcement said that ""the Swiss franc is still significantly overvalued.""
The SNB added that it will ""remain active in the foreign exchange market, as necessary.""
The new conditional inflation forecast has been revised slightly downwards compared to the June forecast. For 2016, the inflation forecast remains unchanged at –0.4%. For 2017, the SNB expects inflation of 0.2%, compared to 0.3% forecast in the last quarter, while for 2018, the forecast has fallen from 0.9% to 0.6%.
In the second quarter, the Swiss economy posted growth of 2.5% on an annualized basis. Overall, the revised quarterly estimates for GDP suggest a somewhat stronger recovery of the Swiss economy since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, on the whole, capacity utilization remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, not all industries have benefited equally from the recovery. As a result, margins at a large number of companies continue to be strained.
The SNB is anticipating a continuation of the recovery. In the second half of the year, however, growth is likely to be more modest than in the first half, partly owing to a temporary weakening of growth in Europe. For 2016 as a whole, the SNB now expects growth of approximately 1.5%.
EUR/CHF was trading at 1.0952 from around 1.0958 ahead of the decision, while USD/CHF was at 0.9759 from 0.9761 earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' confidence bounced from a three-year low, while sentiment in the services sector hit its lowest since 2013 when the central bank began bold monetary stimulus, a Reuters poll showed, underscoring a fragile economic recovery.
The monthly Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) quarterly tankan survey, also found that confidence at manufacturers and service-sector firms is expected to improve in December, easing pessimism about the economy's outlook.
The mixed results of the poll of 532 large- and mid-sized firms - carried out between Aug. 30 and Sept. 12 and in which 269 responded - follows recent data showing weak exports and output, and upbeat capital spending, as the BOJ prepares to hold a monetary policy meeting next week.
The sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 5 from 1 in August, rising for the first time in three months, as confidence at exporters of cars and electronics rebounded from the prior month's lows.
Compared with three months ago, the index was up two points, indicating a slight improvement in the headline big manufacturers' index in the BOJ tankan due Oct. 3.
In the survey, exporters complained about sluggish external demand and a profit squeeze caused by the yen's gains. Many companies also voiced concerns about weak domestic demand. 
""The economy remains uneven. Automobiles are performing well but electronics are declining while construction has been poor,"" a manager at a steelmaker said in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
A machinery maker said the yen was higher than its assumed rate of 110 yen to the dollar  and was concerned about consumer spending in the United States ahead of the presidential election in November, and in Britain following the Brexit vote.
""In Japan, prices of goods have not stopped falling due to a delay in escaping from the deflationary mindset,"" a manager at the machinery maker wrote in the survey.
The service-sector index fell to 14 from 18 in August, as bad weather pushed retailers' sentiment to an 18-month low of minus 9 from 13 in August, a worrying sign of weakness in private consumption that constitutes about 60 percent of the economy.
It was seen bouncing to 22 in December.
Compared with three months ago, the service-sector index was down three points, suggesting a slight deterioration in the big non-manufacturers' sentiment in the BOJ tankan.

With growth remaining weak and inflation slipping far away from the BOJ's 2 percent target, many analysts expect the central bank to ease again at its Sept. 20-21 meeting, when it will review the effects of its monetary stimulus.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2016 11:32AM ET</span>","U.S. import prices post first drop in six months, but trend improving","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices fell for the first time in six months in August on weak petroleum and food costs, but the declining trend is slowing as oil prices stabilize and the dollar's rally fades.
Still, Wednesday's report from the Labor Department suggested the near-term inflation outlook would remain tame, strengthening the argument for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady next week. 
Import prices slipped 0.2 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in July. August's drop was the first since February and was led by a 2.8 percent decline in petroleum prices. Imported petroleum prices fell 3.6 percent in July. 
In the 12 months through August, import prices fell 2.2 percent, the smallest decrease since October 2014, after declining 3.7 percent in July.
""Most Fed officials expect the gradual climb toward the inflation target to remain intact and the diminishing drag from import price deflation will help, but it's going to take time,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We expect the Fed to remain cautious, leaving rates unchanged next week.""
August's weak inflation reading added to slower job growth, soft manufacturing and services sectors surveys in reducing the likelihood of an interest rate hike at the Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Monday she wanted to see stronger consumer spending data and signs of rising inflation before raising interest rates. 
The U.S. central bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held it steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
DOLLAR, OIL DRAG WANING
Import prices have been constrained by dollar strength and cheap oil. That, together with sluggish wage growth, has left inflation persistently running below the Fed's 2 percent target. But the dollar rally appears to have peaked early this year and oil prices have pushed off multi-decade lows.
Import prices excluding petroleum were unchanged in August after climbing 0.5 percent in July. They were down 0.9 percent in the 12 months through August, the smallest year-on-year decrease since December 2014.
""In spite of the month-to-month volatility, we view the underlying trend in imported deflation as improving and consistent with a gradual waning of the drag from the stronger dollar and lower global commodity prices,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington.
""We expect an improvement in imported inflation to help stabilize domestic core goods prices in the coming months.""
The nation continued to import deflation from China, with the cost of goods imported from that country falling 0.2 percent last month. Prices for Chinese imports have not recorded a monthly increase since December 2014.
August's decrease was led by a 1.0 percent decline in the price of imported communications equipment. There were also declines in the cost of imported goods from Canada, the European Union and Mexico. The cost of imports from Japan, however, rose 0.3 percent, the largest gain since August 2011.
Overall prices for imported capital goods were unchanged last month, while the cost of imported automobiles fell 0.2 percent. Imported consumer goods prices excluding automobiles slipped 0.1 percent and the cost of imported food decreased 0.5 percent last month. 

The report also showed export prices fell 0.8 percent in August. That was the biggest drop since January and followed a 0.2 percent increase the prior month. Export prices were down 2.4 percent from a year ago.

Outbound investment for August rose 13.4 percent, to $15.31 billion, the ministry said in a statement.
China's ODI in the United States nearly tripled in the first eight months from a year earlier, the ministry said.
It said the jump was driven the completion of Haier Group's acquisition of  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) appliance business, with the actual transaction value at $5.58 billion.
The Chinese government has been encouraging local firms to invest overseas under Beijing's ""One Belt, One Road"" program.
Earlier data from the ministry showed foreign direct investment (FDI) in China rose 4.5 percent in the first eight months of 2016 from the same period a year earlier to $85.88 billion.
FDI from the United States rose 79.7 percent in the first eight months from a year earlier, while FDI from Germany climbed 79.2 percent and that from Britain jumped 96.6 percent, the data showed.
In August, FDI rose 5.7 percent on-year to 57.32 billion yuan, or $8.76 billion, according to a statement on the ministry's website.
Shen Danyang, a ministry spokesman, said in June that China was looking into possible risks to its foreign exchange reserves as outbound investment had eclipsed foreign investment inflows.

China's foreign exchange reserves fell to the lowest since 2011 in August as the central bank intervened to support the yuan currency as it weakened to near-six year lows.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2016 06:30AM ET</span>",China August new loans well above expectations on mortgage boom,"By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's bank lending in August more than doubled from the previous month, but analysts said much of the gain was due to strong mortgage demand, adding to evidence that Chinese companies are increasingly reluctant to make new investments.
The figures, along with other data this week, paint a picture of an economy that is improving slowly but increasingly reliant on a housing boom and government spending for growth.
Chinese banks extended 948.7 billion yuan ($142.23 billion) in net new yuan loans in August, well above expectations, while broad M2 money supply (M2) also grew by a more-than-expected 11.4 percent from a year earlier, according to central bank data on Wednesday.
New bank lending rebounded sharply from July's 463.6 billion yuan, which was the lowest in two years, while M2 quickened from July's 10.2 percent rise, which was the weakest in 15 months. 
The central bank has pledged to keep policy slightly loose, but sources say it is reluctant to cut interest rates or bank reserves again in the near term amid evidence that companies and banks are hoarding cash instead of investing it.
""A renewed pick-up in credit growth last month will add to the growing sense among investors that the near-term outlook for China’s economy is fairly bright,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics.
""Credit growth is still likely to slow over coming months as the PBOC refrains from further easing and focuses more on credit risks. But with recent activity data also strengthening, we expect economic growth to strengthen over the remainder of the year.""
Data on Tuesday showed China's factory output and retail sales also grew faster than expected in August as a strong housing market and a government infrastructure spending spree underpinned growth in the world's second-largest economy.
But August readings also highlighted imbalances in the economy, with private investment growth at record lows and exports still sluggish.
China's increasingly dependence on the property market is also a major concern, as more cities impose restrictions on home purchases in the face of sharply rising house prices, threatening to end a near one-year rally.
A sharp price correction would add to strains on banks which are already wrestling with growing numbers of bad loans.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, accounted for 71 percent of total new bank loans in August, though they were down from more than 90 percent in July, data showed.
""Mortgage loans remain the major driver of loan growth, based on booming housing market and weak loan demand from corporates,"" David Qu and Raymond Yeung at ANZ said in a note.
Outstanding yuan loans grew at 13 percent by month-end on an annual basis.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected new lending of 750 billion yuan, with outstanding loans seen rising 12.9 percent, and money supply seen up 10.4 percent.
""LIQUIDITY TRAP""
Total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, jumped to 1.47 trillion yuan in August from 487.9 billion yuan in July. 
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offers, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
M1 money supply, which includes cash and short-term deposits, rose 25.3 percent in August from a year earlier. The widening gap between M1 and M2 growth has fueled concerns about a ""liquidity trap"" in the economy where companies remain wary of investing regardless of how much stimulus money policymakers pump into the system.
""The rapid growth of M1 money supply indicates corporates’ preference of holding cash rather than investment. This is consistent with the slowing trend in fixed asset investment by the private sector,"" ANZ said.
Chester Liaw, an economist at Forecast Pte Ltd in Singapore, said the spread between M1 and M2 growth narrowed to 13.9 percentage points from 15.2 last month but ""remains at elevated levels."" 
The PBOC is aiming for annual M2 growth of around 13 percent this year, pointing to continued accommodative policy as Beijing pledges to embark on painful economic restructuring involving state-owned enterprises in key industrial sectors.

Policy insiders have said that evidence companies and banks are hoarding cash, alongside concerns about property market and the yuan's stability, has reinforced policymakers' view there is no major benefit in easing policy further.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. household income posted a record increase in 2015 after years of stagnation, suggesting the recovery from the Great Recession was finally lifting ordinary citizens who had been largely left behind.
The Census Bureau said on Tuesday that median household income surged 5.2 percent last year to $56,500, the highest since 2007, in large part due to solid employment gains. The jump was the biggest since record keeping began in 1968. 
    Trudi Renwick, an assistant division chief at the Census Bureau, said on a conference call with reporters it was striking that median household income rose across the board. ""It's up for almost every age group of household heads. It's up for almost every racial group,"" except Asians, she said.
Concerns about income growth have hung over the U.S. presidential election, with many Americans expressing dissatisfaction with an economy that has managed only sluggish expansion since the 2007-2009 recession. 
President Barack Obama hailed the report as evidence that his administration's economic policies were paying off, but said more needed to be done to put unemployed Americans back to work.
""The Republicans don't like to hear good news right now. But it's important just to understand this is a big deal,"" Obama in Philadelphia, where he was campaigning for the Democratic Party's presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
""For every family who hasn't yet felt progress these past eight years, we've got more work to do - we know that. And the choice that you make, that we make, just eight weeks from today will determine the direction of this country for a long time."" 
But House Republicans, who are pushing their own agenda to tackle poverty and other issues, rejected the report's positive view. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, noting that more than 43 million Americans were impoverished, called the findings ""another disappointing confirmation"" of the nation's struggles.
Although the economy exited recession seven years ago and the stock market has been booming, millions of Americans appeared not to have been part of the recovery. While median income remained below where it stood prior to the recession, the Census Bureau data suggested the tide was turning.
FURTHER GAINS EXPECTED
Chris Christopher, head of consumer economics for IHS Global Insight, said he expected incomes to continue to gain ground through 2017 with higher employment and modest inflation. The unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 4.9 percent last month.
With incomes rising, the number of people living in poverty fell 3.5 million to 43.1 million last year. That pushed the 2015 poverty rate down to 13.5 percent from 14.8 percent in 2014.
The poverty rate has continued to edge down since hitting a 17-year high in 2010. The latest drop is the largest percentage point decline since 1999, Census officials said.
In another encouraging sign, the number of residents without health insurance dropped to 29 million last year from 33 million in 2014. Nearly 91 percent of people in the United States had health coverage, up from 89.6 percent the previous year.
""The three key indicators of well-being ... all moved decisively in the right direction in 2015 - the first time that has occurred in nearly two decades,"" said Robert Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
An alternative measure of poverty that takes into account non-cash benefits, including food stamps and refundable tax credits, fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 14.3 percent.
Analysts cautioned against reading too much into this still-high supplemental poverty rate because it reflects the withdrawal of generous benefits put in place during and immediately after the recession to cushion families. 
Women working full-time saw a boost in earnings last year, with the median income rising 2.7 percent to $40,742. The median income for men working full-time increased 1.5 percent to $51,212. The gains for both genders were the biggest since 2009.
Despite the broad-based gains, there was little progress in reducing income inequality. 

""Economic recovery finally started arriving for tens of millions of American families over the past year. We should make sure the economy is nurtured going forward, and not subverted by bad policy decisions,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone employment reached a new post-crisis high in the second quarter of the year, a positive sign for future economic growth, but trade unions said the number of people employed across the currency bloc was still far too low.
Employment in the 19 countries that use the euro rose 0.4 percent in the second quarter of 2016 compared with the previous three months, and 1.4 percent from the same quarter a year before, the European Union's statistics office said on Tuesday.
Jobs growth was driven mainly by the agriculture and services sectors.
Eurostat estimated that 153.3 million people in the euro zone had a job in the April-June period, the highest number since the fourth quarter of 2008, when the effects of the global financial crisis that began in 2007 were biting.
The rise of the number of people with a job between March and June marked the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in employment levels in the euro zone.
Every euro zone country recorded a rise in employment except Finland, where the figure was flat. Among the euro zone countries with the highest unemployment levels, quarterly employment growth was a healthy 0.8 percent in Cyprus and 0.5 percent in Italy, Spain and Greece.
Eurostat also revised up to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent its estimates for quarterly employment growth in January-March.
If the employment trend continues in the third quarter, it may help revive economic growth after a slowdown in April-June, providing a counterweight to the likely negative impact of Britain's shock June 23 vote to leave the EU.
""Ongoing solid euro zone employment growth in the second quarter, coupled with still-negligible inflation, is supportive to consumer spending, thereby fuelling hopes that consumers can make a decent contribution to Eurozone growth over the coming months,"" said Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS.
Despite the positive trend, the euro zone's overall unemployment rate remained above 10 percent in July and joblessness is much higher in some countries.
""Employment is far too low, with too many people trapped in part-time and temporary work, and other precarious contracts,"" Veronica Nilsson of the European Trade Union Confederation said on Tuesday, urging more public investment and higher pay.
In the 28-country European Union, the employment rate between April and June grew 0.3 percent on the quarter, slightly less than the 0.4 percent increase recorded in the January-March period. Employment rose 1.5 percent from a year before, more than the 1.4 percent increase recorded in the first quarter.
Eurostat estimated that 232.1 million people in the EU had a job in the second quarter, the highest level on record.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2016 06:50AM ET</span>",Uncertainty clouds German investor morale,"By Caroline Copley
BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German analysts and investors was unexpectedly subdued in September, a survey showed, suggesting the outlook for Europe's biggest economy remains tinged with uncertainty despite concern about the impact of Brexit having eased.
The economic sentiment index from Mannheim-based ZEW's monthly survey was unchanged in September from August's 0.5 points. The Reuters consensus forecast was for an increase to 2.5.
Mixed economic signals from Germany and abroad ""mean that forecasts for the next few months are difficult,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
The ZEW's gauge of current conditions fell to 55.1 points from 57.6 in August, also below the forecast of 56.0 by economists in the Reuters poll.
The weaker-than-expected readings follow a run of dismal data, raising questions about future growth as Germany grapples with the fallout from Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union as well as weak demand for its exports from non-EU countries.
Sales abroad unexpectedly plunged in July, while industrial orders barely rose and output posted its steepest drop in nearly two years.
Jennifer McKeown, senior economist at Capital Economics, said it was worrying that sentiment had not recovered as Brexit concerns had receded.
""The fact that the index is barely positive means that only a slim majority of investors see German economic conditions improving over the next six months,"" she said.
Wambach said he expected the economic situation in Germany to remain favorable over the next six months, supported by an improving picture in the EU.
The German economy grew by 0.4 percent in the second quarter, double the Reuters consensus forecast, having been expected to cool significantly after a mild winter helped it expand 0.7 percent between January and March, the strongest rate in two years.
The government has said it expects domestic demand to be the sole driver this year of economic growth it has pegged at 1.7 percent. For 2017 it predicts a slowdown to 1.5 percent.
Germany's DIW institute gave a more pessimistic outlook last week, predicting growth will nearly halve in 2017 as Brexit and other risks hit exporters.
The ZEW index was based on a survey of 205 analysts and investors conducted between Aug. 29 and Sept. 12.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2016 05:34AM ET</span>","China's economy perks up in August, thanks to housing boom, gov't spending","By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory output and retail sales grew faster than expected in August as a strong housing market and a government infrastructure spending spree underpinned growth in the world's second-largest economy.
Industrial output grew the fastest in five months as demand for products from coal to cars rebounded, though analysts warned the outlook is clouded by weakness in manufacturing investment and a lack of spending by private firms.
""It is very clear that the data is improving because of the property market. This is not sustainable,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Zhou Hao said.
""It is a good time for China to deliver on structural reform, especially on the SOE side, to restore confidence in the economy,"" he said, referring to a long-promised overhaul of the country's often bloated and inefficient state-owned enterprises.
Improvements in August, while modest, suggest China's third-quarter growth is holding up better than expected just a few months ago and likely remains within the government's 2016 target range of 6.5-7 percent, despite the alarming drop in private investment which has left the economy more dependant on government spending.
Industrial output rose 6.3 percent in August from a year earlier, data showed on Tuesday. Analysts had expected it to pick up only slightly to 6.1 percent as many plants were closed around Hangzhou to guarantee blue skies for a G20 summit of world leaders earlier this month.
China's steel industry, in particular, has perked up as capacity cuts and production curbs boost prices and profits, while the infrastructure spree and housing boom have spurred demand for building materials from iron beams to cement.
China's crude steel output rose 3 percent in August from a year ago, the sixth straight monthly rise. Its biggest listed steelmaker, Baoshan Iron & Steel (Baosteel) said on Tuesday it has raised its prices for October, its eighth price hike so far this year.
Retail sales also handily beat expectations, with growth accelerating to 10.6 percent from 10.2 percent the previous month. Analysts had forecast an increase of 10.3 percent.
Car sales have been strong in China this year, hitting a 3-1/2 year high in August as buyers rushed to get new wheels before a tax cut expires at year-end.
Trade data last week showed imports rose for the first time in nearly two years, while export declines eased.
STRONG GOVERNMENT SPENDING HIGHLIGHTS IMBALANCES
Fixed asset investment was unchanged at 8.1 percent over the first eight months of the year, marginally better than expected.
Still, the rate of growth in investment remained the slowest since December 1999, and details showed a growing imbalance between public and private spending that raised questions about China's longer-term growth prospects.
Beijing-based broker China International Capital Corporation said in a note that while the headline investment figures were solid, data on new project starts, a leading indicator for future activity, softened in August.
Highlighting Beijing's increasing reliance on government spending to drive the economy, investment by state firms surged 21.4 percent in the first eight months of the year. China's fiscal spending rose 12.7 percent.
Property also remained a bright spot, despite fears that a near one-year-long housing boom may be peaking as more cities impose curbs on home purchases to rein in sharp price rises.
Property investment rose 6.2 percent in August on-year, according to Reuters calculations, compared with 1.4 percent in July, while sales by floor space grew 25.5 percent.
""Property sales continue to expand at a rapid pace. We are skeptical how long this can last given that fundamental factors point to housing demand growth in the low single digits,"" Capital Economics economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note.
The strength in the property market compared with only 2.8 percent growth in fixed asset investment in the manufacturing sector for the year through August.
COOLING PRIVATE INVESTMENT A WORRY
Private investment grew just 2.1 percent in the first eight months of the year, the same pace as in January-July and remaining at record lows.
While private firms boosted spending 2.3 percent on a monthly basis, reversing a two-month slide, the issue remains a key concern among policymakers, who have pledged to improve operating conditions for the more efficient private sector.
But government support may only go so far in sectors with weak demand that do not benefit from strong property and commodities markets. ""Business is tough. The economy overall is bad and many industries are facing overcapacity issues, which filters through and impacts all industries. Consumers' spending power is falling and competition is intense,"" says Vivi Wan, general manager at apparel manufacturer Hangzhou Meisai Clothing Co., Ltd.
Wan says her company's margins have been compressed from 20-30 percent to around 10 percent over the last few years, and that many firms in the area have shut down.
Analysts say China may face a renewed slowdown as the impact of previous policy support fades and as the government and central bank hold off on further easing over concerns of rising debt and housing bubbles.

In a report, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment was unchanged at 0.5 this month. Analysts had expected the index to rise by 2.0 points to 2.5 in September.
The Current Conditions Index dropped to 55.1 this month from 57.6 in August, worse than expectations for a reading of 56.0.
Meanwhile, the index of euro zone economic sentiment advanced to 5.4 in September from 4.6 a month earlier, missing forecasts for a reading of 6.7.
On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism.

The annual rate of consumer price inflation was unchanged at 0.6 percent in August, compared with economists’ forecast for it to increase to 0.7 percent, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
Lower prices for clothing, hotels and wine offset an upward effect from fuel prices, food and airfares.
“Raw material costs have risen for the second month running, partly due to the falling value of the pound, though there is little sign of this feeding through to consumer prices yet,” ONS statistician Mike Prestwood said.
Last month the BoE said sterling’s 10 percent fall against the dollar and the euro after the EU vote was likely to put upward pressure on prices for several years and cause inflation to overshoot its 2 percent target.
But the central bank said most policymakers still expected to cut rates again later this year, although no further action is expected at this week’s rate-setting meeting.
A purchasing managers’ survey earlier this month showed firms in the services sector were raising prices at the fastest rate since early 2014, while manufacturers reported the biggest increase in input costs in five years.
Producer price data from the ONS on Tuesday showed manufacturers’ input costs rose 7.6 percent compared with a year earlier, the biggest jump since December 2011.

But they raised the prices they charged by just 0.8 percent, less than economists expected, though still the biggest increase since January 2014.

The U.K. Office for National Statistics said the rate of consumer price inflation came in at a seasonally adjusted 0.6% last month, unchanged from July. Analyst had expected consumer prices to rise 0.7% in August.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation accelerated 0.3%, compared to estimates for a gain of 0.4% and following a decline of 0.1% in July.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Investment growth in China's real estate quickened slightly over January-August, suggesting investors still have confidence in a booming market even as more local governments tightened restrictions on home purchases in a bid to check rapid price rises. 
Property investment in January-August rose 5.4 percent from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)figures showed on Tuesday, quickening from an increase of 5.3 percent in January-July, while property sales by floor area grew 25.5 percent, slowing from 26.4 percent.
In August alone, property investment was up 6.2 percent from a year ago, according to Reuters calculations, compared with 1.4 percent in July. 
""A property investment rebound means it will continue to contribute positively to gross domestic product this year, albeit probably not as significantly as seen in the first half,"" said Ma Xiaoping, economist at HSBC. 
Real estate investment directly affects about 40 other business sectors in China and is considered to be a crucial driver for the economy. 
A robust recovery in home prices and sales, thanks to a flurry of government stimulus measures, gave a stronger-than-expected boost to the world's second largest economy in the first half of the year. 
But rapid price gains in some of the biggest cities fanned fears of a bubble and prompted some local governments to tighten home and land purchase requirements, with cities such as Xiamen, Suzhou, Naning and Wuhan being the latest to implement such measures. 
""Rises in property prices have initially been contained,"" NBS spokesperson Sheng Laiyun said at a news conference.
A housing glut continued to take its toll in smaller centers such as rustbelt city Shenyang, which implemented looser buying conditions in an effort to ramp up demand.
""Micro policies at the local level are expected to be implemented to help grow sales in these cities, but a broad policy by the central government to encourage that is unlikely,"" said HSBC's Ma.
China's central bank has become increasingly concerned at the severity of the country's debt problem, with the high concentration of capital in property identified as a major problem. 
""We should take a lot of measures to curb excessive bubbles in the real estate sector, curb the flow of excessive financial resources into the real estate sector,"" Ma Jun, chief economist at China's central bank, said in a recent interview.
The debt ratio of property developers is now nearly 80 percent and climbing, according to a commentary published in the official Xinhua news agency's Economic Information Daily.
The commentary warned of ""irrational increases in leverage"" as more home buyers rushed to invest in the overheated real estate market through borrowing. Household loans, which are mainly mortgages, made up over 90 percent of new loans in July, according to official data.
The commentary said volatility in house prices may cause either a deterioration in financial assets or soak up more capital to prop up the leverage that was threatening to undermine economic policy. 
New construction starts in August were up 3.3 percent from a year ago, measured by floor area, Reuters calculations showed, slowing from 8.1 percent in July. 

Growth in inventory floor area last month was 6.9 percent higher than a year earlier, compared to 7.7 percent in the previous month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Big Japanese manufacturers turned optimistic about business conditions in the third quarter and companies revised up their capital expenditure plans, a government survey showed on Tuesday, in a sign the economy is gaining momentum.
Large manufacturers said they expect sentiment to improve further in October-December, an encouragement to policymakers as they try to reenergize domestic demand and avoid a return to deflation.
The survey results could offer some relief to the embattled Bank of Japan, which holds a monetary policy meeting next week. The upgrade of capital expenditure plans also shows that the central bank's efforts to keep rates low are starting to spur corporate investment.
""Capital expenditure is holding up and consumer spending is starting to recover,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""We still need to be somewhat cautious about overseas economies, but the sentiment data is showing some encouraging moves.""
The joint survey by the Ministry of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute, an arm of the Cabinet Office, recorded a business survey index (BSI) of sentiment among large manufacturers at plus 2.9 in July-September, compared with minus 11.1 in April-June. 
Large manufacturers expect their sentiment index to improve to plus 8.6 in October-December, the survey released on Tuesday showed.
Japanese companies plan to raise capital expenditure by 4.9 percent in the fiscal year that started in April, up from their previous projection of a 3.8 percent increase.
The BSI measures the percentage of firms that expect the business environment to improve from the previous quarter minus the percentage that expect it to worsen. 
Japan's economy grew faster over April-June than initially estimated, the Cabinet Office said on Thursday, with upward revisions to capital expenditure and inventories easing some concerns about weak consumer spending and exports.
The BOJ holds its next meeting on Sept. 20-21, where it will review whether it needs to change its bold quantitative easing program after repeatedly delaying the timing of meeting its 2 percent inflation target.

The BOJ is studying ways to steepen the government bond yield curve to lessen pressure on bank profits, sources familiar with the central bank's thinking have told Reuters.

The New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations found that median year-ahead inflation expectations jumped to 2.8 percent in August, the highest reading this year, from 2.5 percent in July. Three-year expectations rose to 2.7 percent, from 2.5 percent in the previous month.
Both measures rebounded from near record low levels in July. The Fed, looking to raise interest rates soon, wants to see signs of inflation pressures before acting. 

""This increase in both time-horizons was consistent across age, education and income groups,"" the New York Fed said of the internet-based survey of a rotating sample of 1,200 households, done by an outside group.

766,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2016 10:35PM ET</span>",Surprise gain in Japan core machinery orders points to capex pickup,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly rose for a second straight month in July, easing some pessimism over capital expenditure, but worries remain that weak demand and the yen's gains may still discourage companies from boosting investment.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has been counting on capital expenditure to drive private sector-led growth, but business investment has been slow to pick up because of the uncertain outlook and external headwinds.
Cabinet Office data showed on Monday that core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 4.9 percent in July from the previous month.
The rise in core orders, which excludes ships and orders from the electric power industry, compared with a 3.5 percent decline expected in a Reuters poll of economists and a 8.3 percent increase in June.
The reading followed a recent run of weak indicators, including exports, factory output and household spending, helping to allay fears that the economy may lose momentum in the current quarter.
""Capital spending is holding firm as companies are refurbishing their plant and equipment,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Securities.
""Given the current external situation, capital expenditures are unlikely to accelerate though. There's a downside risk of further yen rises if a U.S. rate hike causes another round of China shocks,"" he said.
Manufacturers' orders rose 0.3 percent, led by the steel industry, including chemical machinery such as separators and heat exchangers, while the services sector's orders increased by 8.6 percent, mainly contributed by the communications industry, the data showed.
The service-sector's orders were in part boosted by demand for smartphones and may not be sustainable, BNP's Shiraishi said, adding that labor shortages would also prevent business expenditures from accelerating.
Reflecting the fragility of external demand, overseas orders - which are not included in the core calculation - fell 11.7 percent in July from June.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized rate of 0.7 percent in April-June, revised up from initial estimates but much slower than the prior quarter's growth led by leap year effects, as exports and capital spending sagged.

With growth struggling to accelerate and inflation sliding away from the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target, most analysts expect the central bank to loosen policy later this month when it conducts a comprehensive assessment of its monetary stimulus program.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2016 12:09PM ET</span>","U.S. wholesale inventories flat, boost to third-quarter growth seen modest","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories were unchanged in July as previously reported and sales recorded their biggest drop in six months, suggesting a modest boost to third-quarter economic growth from inventory investment.
An outright drop in inventory investment weighed heavily on economic growth in the second quarter and some economists believe the inventory correction is close to running its course.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that the flat reading followed an upwardly revised 0.3 percent increase in June. Wholesale inventories were previously reported to have gained 0.2 percent in June.
""The trend towards an increase of inventories at the wholesale level gives us greater confidence that GDP growth will be well above 2 percent in the third quarter as factories restart their engines and start to produce the goods to replenish the store shelves,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The department in its recently introduced monthly advance economic indicators report published last month had estimated that wholesale inventories would be unchanged in July.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP -- wholesale stocks excluding autos --was also unchanged in July.
Following the report, the Atlanta Federal Reserve trimmed its third-quarter GDP estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.3 percent annual rate.
""The forecast of the contribution of inventory investment to third-quarter real GDP growth decreased from 0.62 percentage points to 0.57 percentage points after this morning's wholesale trade report,"" it said.
Inventories subtracted almost 1.3 percentage points from GDP growth in the second quarter, the largest drag in more than two years, restricting the rise in output to an anemic 1.1 percent pace. They have weighed on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2015 as businesses sold stockpiles of unwanted goods, helping to undercut manufacturing activity.
In July, wholesale stocks of farm products fell 2.0 percent after increasing 2.8 percent in June. Wholesale inventories of petroleum declined 1.2 percent, while stocks of automobiles rose 0.4 percent. Sales at wholesalers fell 0.4 percent in July, the biggest drop since January, after jumping 1.7 percent in June. Sales were weighed down by a 3.5 percent drop at petroleum wholesalers, as well as a 0.3 percent fall in auto sales.
At July's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.34 months to clear shelves, up from 1.33 months in June. While the ratio has declined from 1.37 months touched in January, which was the highest since March 2009, it remains relatively high.
As a result, some economists caution that inventories could still be a drag on output in the third quarter.
""The inventory headwind for GDP continues, as inventory-to-sales ratios remain stubbornly high,"" said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank kept interest rates unchanged at 1.25 percent for a third straight month on Friday, as expected, taking a cautious approach to mounting household debt at home while scanning for potential changes in U.S. monetary policy.
The central bank's decision was largely ignored by investors, who dumped South Korean stocks after North Korea appeared to detonate a nuclear bomb.
All but one of 26 analysts in a Reuters poll saw the Bank of Korea (BOK) holding rates on Friday, while a majority saw one last cut coming soon.
Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol stated firmly that economic recovery was still on track, although he noted inflation could head lower. Lee did not mention North Korea at his news conference following the BOK meeting.
Although most analysts still see a rate cut soon, some have changed their minds and think the BOK will hold indefinitely as there are more factors to deliberate over, including growing household debt and Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd's (KS:117930) recent collapse.
Lee said the impact from the recent Hanjin Shipping collapse could be contained.
""I’m aware that some exporters are going through considerable difficulties from the Hanjin Shipping incident. However, the impact on the economy won't be big if measures in place from the government, including deployment of alternative vessels, are carried out smoothly.""
The Bank of Korea has trimmed the policy rate five times between 2014 and June this year to keep economic momentum going, something that has proven difficult as exports sputtered in the face of weak global demand.
""For the most part, Lee was stressing the need to be observant ahead of the Fed's policy meeting. There was little to take away besides the fact that inflation faces downside risks,"" said Kim Jina, fixed-income analyst at IBK Securities.
For now, the BOK will observe whether the government's 11 trillion won ($10 billion) supplementary budget passed by parliament last week will have an immediate effect on the economy.
Recent economic data has been mixed, which will make the central bank want to check more indicators before acting. Revised economic forecasts by the BOK will be released in October.
The BOK's decision to hold rates landed hours after the European Central Bank maintained interest rates at record lows and kept the door open to more stimulus.
It gave few hints about its next move, disappointing markets.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2016 11:51PM ET</span>",China's Aug inflation trends point to stabilizing economy,"By Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's consumer price inflation slowed to its weakest pace in almost a year in August, pulled down by abating food costs, although an encouraging moderation in producer price deflation added to growing evidence of a steadying economy.
Indeed, the broader inflation trends shown in Friday’s data confirm recent signs of a more sure-footed recovery in the world’s second-biggest economy, allowing authorities to resist any fresh monetary easing as they move to curb an unsustainable build up of credit in the financial system.
""The picture is still one of rising price pressures, and for that reason I'd be skeptical of claims this latest drop in inflation is going to increase the likelihood of further monetary easing by the central bank,"" said Capital Economics' China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard in Singapore.
""What's holding them back from further easing is not inflation concerns, it's concerns of credit risks.""
A housing and construction rebound has boosted industries including steel and coal, and while many sectors continue to struggle with overproduction, domestic demand has held up reasonably well, with trade data on Thursday showing a surprising improvement in imports.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.3 percent in August from a year earlier, compared with a 1.8 percent increase in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday.
That was the slowest pace of inflation since October 2015. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 1.7 percent gain.
Consumer inflation has remained well below China's official target of around 3 percent in 2016, despite concerns that severe summer flooding, which has disrupted public infrastructure and agricultural production, would ramp up inflationary pressures.
Food prices were up 1.3 percent in August, compared with a 3.3 percent year-on-year gain in the previous month.
Prices of pork, China's staple meat, rose only 6.4 percent versus a 16.1 percent increase in July.
Importantly, non-food prices showed headline inflation remained stable, rising 1.4 percent, unchanged from July. The Statistics bureau data showed a 4.3 percent year-on-year increase in healthcare costs and a 4.5 percent rise in ""other goods and services"" were the main drivers.
The producer price index (PPI) dropped 0.8 percent in August from a year earlier, the slowest pace of decline since April 2012.
China factory prices have been falling since March 2012, but a turning point could be on the horizon as the industrial sector improves on the back of a housing recovery, and commodity prices bounce globally.
Analysts expect factory prices to turn positive by the end of the year, which will give a much-needed boost to earnings in the industrial sector and help ease pressures from debt obligations.
""Today's PPI data mirrors the improvement in industrial profitability,"" said ANZ analyst Raymond Yeung in a note to clients.
Indeed, this trend was backed up by data showing China's imports rose for the first time in nearly two years in August as firms restocked and wholesale inflation expectations rose.
The People's Bank of China has not adjusted interest rates since October 2015, and analysts don't expect any short-term easing steps as focus remains on reduction of industrial overcapacity and stemming credit risks.
""Senior officials have been reiterating the priority of 'supply-side structural reform' and the role of active fiscal policy against the backdrop of capacity reduction and an overheating housing market,"" said ANZ's Yeung.
""The possibility for further monetary easing has significantly declined.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength even as the pace of job growth is slowing.
Despite signs of underlying labor market strength, also corroborated by record high job openings, August's slowdown in job growth, together with sluggish factory and services sector activity could encourage the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged at its Sept. 20-21 policy meeting.
""The labor market has not been this good since the 1970s. The Fed has operational risk,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""Rates are a long way from normal levels and the Fed has no firepower to come to the aid of the economy if a recession were to hit."" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week ended Sept.3, the lowest level since mid-July, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 265,000 in the latest week. It was the 79th straight week that claims remained belowthe 300,000 threshold, which is associated with robust labor market conditions. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,750 to 261,250 last week.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data. The dollar touched a two-week low against the euro after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said an extension of the ECB's asset-purchase program was not discussed at Thursday's meeting. 
Prices for U.S. government debt fell, as did U.S. stocks.
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held it steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation.
JOBS MARKET RESILIENT
A report on Wednesday showed job openings hit a record high in July, though hiring continued to lag, suggesting a possible skills mismatch. The very low level of claims together with all-time high job openings suggests the labor market remains healthy, even though employment growth moderated in August after payroll gains averaged 273,000 jobs per month in June and July. 
The economy created 151,000 jobs in August, still well above the roughly 100,000 jobs that Fed Chair Janet Yellen says is needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
""The labor market remains tight. The problem with the labor market is the shortage of workers who have the necessary skills and are willing to work at the prevailing wage,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
With the labor market near full employment and the economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession showing signs of aging, the slowdown in job growth is normal. 
Despite labor market resilience, data so far for August suggest some cooling in economic activity. Manufacturing contracted in August for the first time in six months and services sector activity was the slowest in 6-1/2 years.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 7,000 to 2.14 million in the week ended Aug. 27. 

The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims slipped 4,000 to 2.15 million.

Continuing jobless claims in the week ended August 27 declined to 2.144 million from 2.151 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to inch up to 2.153 million.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 94.70, compared to 94.64 ahead of the report.

790,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2016 06:20AM ET</span>",UK's post-Brexit rebound extends to housing and jobs,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The bounce back in Britain's economy from the initial shock of the Brexit vote has expanded to the country's recruitment and housing markets, according to two surveys which previously painted a bleak outlook.
The Recruitment and Employment Confederation - which last month said hiring was in ""dramatic freefall"" - said firms increased permanent staff for the first time in three months, and were also spending more on temporary workers. 
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its monthly house price index jumped to +12 in August from July's three-year low of +5, the first rise in six months, though still one of the lowest readings in the past year and a half.
""There are clear signs that the housing market is settling down after the initial surprise of the outcome to the EU referendum,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said.
The Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates in August for the first since 2009 probably contributed to the brighter mood, Rubinsohn added.
The recovery in the RICS and REC surveys follows a pattern set by surveys of the services and manufacturing sectors which plunged in July, when Britain was plunged into political chaos by the Brexit vote, before rising sharply in August.
Housing and retail firms also gave confident outlooks. Property website Zoopla (L:ZPLAZ) said annual earnings would hit the top end of forecasts, confounding predictions that Brexit would freeze the market. Housebuilders Barratt (L:BDEV) and  Redrow  (L:RDW) have also sounded upbeat.
Dixons Carphone (L:DC), Britain's biggest electricals and mobile phone retailer, reported better-than-expected sales and said it had not seen no Brexit impact on demand.
SLOWDOWN STILL EXPECTED
Some economists have pulled back from forecasts of outright recession made in the wake of the Brexit vote, though almost all - including the BoE - still expect a sharp slowdown.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that economic growth seemed to be slowing to about half its pace from before the referendum, a slightly less severe hit than the Bank has previously predicted. 
REC chief executive Kevin Green said it was too soon to draw long-term conclusions about the health of the job market.
""The fact that vacancy growth has softened is concerning, suggesting that hiring could be volatile over the coming months,"" he said.
Green also called on the government to allow EU workers to continue to come to Britain easily to work once it leaves the bloc, a position which is opposed by many supporters of Brexit who want to stem the flow of EU migrants in Britain. 
""Developing an immigration policy which will allow employers to access enough candidates for the jobs available is vital,"" Green said
RICS said that for the first time since April its members expected house prices to rise over the coming three months, and forecast a 1.1 percent increase in prices over the next year.
Sales volumes - which had previously dropped sharply - were now stabilizing, RICS added.
Not all analysts were positive about the outlook.

""Looking ahead, a renewed squeeze on households' real incomes, largely due to a rebound in inflation, likely will put renewed downward pressure on demand. As such, we doubt that house prices will return to a smooth upward trajectory,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics's Samuel Tombs said.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2016 04:08AM ET</span>",China Aug imports rise for first time in nearly two years as demand picks up,"By Yawen Chen and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's imports unexpectedly rose in August for the first time in nearly two years, boosted by coal and other commodities, suggesting domestic demand may be picking up and putting the world's second-largest economy on a more balanced footing.
Exports also showed signs of improvement, falling by a less-than-expected 2.8 percent from a year earlier, as demand in the United States, Europe and even Japan showed some signs of improvement, data showed on Thursday.
If it proves sustainable, a trade recovery or even signs of trade stabilization would help ease fears that China's economy is becoming increasingly lopsided, and give feeble global growth a much-needed shot in the arm.
In recent months, China's economy has shown signs of stabilizing, but growth has become more dependant on a government infrastructure spending spree and a housing boom as private investment fizzles and exports remain sluggish.
""The improvement in imports is mostly a reflection of stronger domestic demand. Chinese companies are restocking (raw materials), and also are now expecting prices to start rising,"" said Wang Jianhui, an economist with Capital Securities in Beijing.
""There is also some expectation that the economy is improving. As we are entering the high season in the fourth quarter, we expect exports to stay stable and imports to improve as higher prices spread to more products.""
China's 1.5 percent import rise was the first expansion in value terms since October 2014. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a fall of 4.9 percent, moderating from a sharp 12.5 percent tumble in July.
While a surge in commodity prices is widely acknowledged as a major factor for the rebound in imports, analysts believe the surprising uptick also reflected stronger domestic demand, which is fuelling a brighter profit outlook for Chinese manufacturers.
""The size of the pick-up suggests that there may also have been some improvement in import volumes last month,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
Non-commodity imports also rebounded, HSBC said in a note, noting gains in machinery imports.
The launch of new consumer electronic gadgets ahead of the year-end shopping season may also have given a boost to China's supply chain, as firms imported more components to make products such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone 7, which officially launched this week.
A similar bounce in hi-tech was seen in Taiwan's export data on Wednesday, though analysts are skeptical it will last much beyond the seasonal Christmas peak.
""We think the rebound in domestic demand is a reflection of robust infrastructure investment over the past few months. This is the result of an expansionary fiscal policy, which we believe will continue into the second half of 2016, and possibly well into 2017,"" HSBC economists said.
COMMODITIES AND CARS
Among commodity imports, coal jumped over 50 percent by volume as China cut back on mining its own coal in favor of buying higher quality supplies from countries such as Australia.
While iron ore imports slipped from July they remained near record highs as Chinese steelmakers rebuild inventories in expectation of higher returns. Stockpiles at small- and medium-sized mills rose 7.5 percent from Aug. 11 to 25,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
The steel price surge is due in part to Beijing's efforts to reduce excess capacity.
Some Chinese steel plants are turning in the best margins in at least three years as prices rise and demand for building materials increases. Chinese steel exports also look set to hit a fresh record this year, raising friction with some of its major trading partners.
Passenger vehicle sales in China to retail customers rose 12.7 percent in January-August from a year earlier, the China Passenger Car Association said on Thursday. Imports of automobiles and auto parts also increased significantly in August, Nomura noted.
Global demand for Chinese goods also seems to be picking up slowly, though weak U.S. factory activity readings and German output data this week suggest export orders may remain sluggish.
Exports fell 2.8 percent from a year earlier, beating forecasts for a 4.0 percent decline. Shipments to the U.S. dipped marginally while those to the European Union rose 2.4 percent. Exports to Japan also improved, albeit modestly.
China's customs department said pressure on shipments was expected to ease further in the fourth quarter, though analysts doubt there will be any strong recovery soon.
China recorded a narrower trade surplus of $52.05 billion in August, versus a $58 billion forecast and July's $52.31 billion.
However, global demand still remains depressed. International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde said earlier this month that it will likely downgrade its 2016 global growth forecast again.
China's cabinet said this week that it will step up proactive fiscal policy efforts now that commodity prices are relatively low, hinting that the infrastructure boom will continue. But some analysts said a housing rebound may be peaking as sharp price rises force more cities to tighten restrictions on home buyers.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew faster over April-June than initially estimated, the Cabinet Office said on Thursday, with upward revisions to capital expenditure and inventories, but the lack of a strong growth driver is seen undermining momentum for the rest of this year.
The Cabinet Office said the economy grew at a 0.7 percent annualized rate over April-June, an upward revision of the preliminary reading of 0.2 percent growth, in which the strong yen and weak demand were seen hurting exports and capital spending.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, is seen lacking momentum in the current quarter and beyond, following a recent run of weak export, factory output and household spending data.
Unless overseas economies improve and the yen's gains fade away, the economy is at risk of faltering later this year, before Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government fully implements the stimulus package it unveiled last month, analysts say.
The tame economic outlook will keep the Bank of Japan under pressure to ease policy further as the central bank conducts comprehensive assessment of the effects of its stimulus program at its Sept. 20-21 rate review.
""The economy is likely to remain stagnant in July-September and October-December in the absence of a growth engine,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Household income gains are not strong enough to drive up private consumption, while the yen's gains are expected to undermine exports and capital spending gradually but surely.""
The revised gross domestic product (GDP) data compared with economists' median estimate of an annualized 0.0 percent reading in a Reuters poll.
The figure translates into quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.2 percent in real, price-adjusted terms, against an initial reading of 0.0 percent.
Capital expenditure, a key component of GDP, fell 0.1 percent for the quarter, versus the preliminary estimate of a 0.4 percent decline.
Inventories contributed 0.1 percentage point to growth, versus the preliminary slightly negative contribution recorded.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of the economy, rose 0.2 percent, unchanged from the preliminary estimate.
Taken together, domestic demand contributed 0.4 percentage point to growth, versus the initial 0.3 percentage point registered. Net exports knocked 0.3 percentage point off growth.
With economic growth having ground almost to a halt and inflation sliding further away from the central bank's 2 percent target, most analysts expect the BOJ to loosen policy this month.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda signaled his readiness on Monday to ease policy further, shrugging off some concerns that monetary stimulus is reaching the limits of its effectiveness.

Early responses from a third quarter survey of 4,500 small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) show little sign of any drop in confidence according to BDRC.
A survey taken during the second quarter of the year as the EU referendum took place, showed that 13 percent of the SMEs rated the current economic climate as a major barrier to business while 10 percent rated political uncertainty as a major barrier. Those figures were unchanged from the first quarter.
Within the overall figures however, larger SMEs with 50-249 employees did show increasing concern about the economy, BDRC said.
Britain's economy on Monday showed its clearest sign to date of bouncing back from the initial shock of the June referendum outcome, as data firm Markit said the country was unlikely to enter a recession in the July-September period.
BDRC Continental said its surveys dating back to 2011 show a continuing decline in appetite for external funding, with small businesses preferring to self-fund. That sentiment could change in the coming months, according to Shiona Davies, director at BDRC.
""Brexit has the potential to change the business context. For now, most SMEs are reporting 'business as usual', albeit there are signs of concern amongst some specific groups,"" she said.

BDRC's findings are used by the government to inform policy making, the company said.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2016 12:17PM ET</span>","U.S. job openings at record high, skills mismatch emerging","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged to a record high in July, but a lag in hiring suggested employers were struggling to find qualified workers to fill the positions. 
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Wednesday also pointed to tightening conditions in the labor market, which could spur faster wage growth. 
JOLTS, is one of the job market metrics on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. It was published ahead of the U.S. central bank's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting at which the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged.
""There are millions of jobs going begging right now in what has got to be one of the biggest mismatches between skills and lack of qualified help available in the nation's history,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""The economy seems strong enough to weather a rate hike.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 228,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.9 million, the Labor Department said. That was the highest level since the series started in December 2000 and pushed the jobs openings rate up one-10th of a percentage point to 3.9 percent in July.
Hiring was little changed at 5.2 million in July, keeping the hiring rate steady at 3.6 percent for a second straight month. But hiring slowed in August, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 151,000 jobs, a report showed last week. The economy added a total of 546,000 jobs in June and July.
Although Fed officials view the labor market as being at or near full employment, concerns about persistently low inflation have left the U.S. central bank cautious about raising interest rates in the near term.
Job openings were almost across the board. There were big increases in construction, retail, leisure and hospitality, as well as professional and business services. 
In a sign of confidence in the labor market, 3.0 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in July, keeping the quits rate at 2.1 percent for a second straight month. This rate has rebounded from a low of 1.3 percent in early 2010.
Layoffs were little changed at 1.6 million in July, holding the layoffs rate at a 3-1/2-year low of 1.1 percent. The ratio of job openings to unemployment hit a 15-year high.
""This suggest wages should be pressured higher and, therefore, either price increases will pick up or profit margins will be squeezed further,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Despite tightening labor market conditions, wage growth has been frustratingly slow. Average hourly earnings have failed to hold above 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis. Economists say a growth rate of between 3 and 3.5 percent in wages is needed to bring inflation near the Fed's 2 percent target.

The reading, which is a preliminary estimate of the department's annual ""benchmark"" revision to closely watched payrolls data, showed the retail, wholesale trade, education and professional and business services sectors accounted for the bulk of the downward revision.
Payrolls in the mining, utilities and financial sectors were also less than previously reported. But manufacturing, construction, transportation and warehousing, government, and leisure and hospitality added more jobs than has been reported.
Once a year, the government compares its nonfarm payrolls data, based on monthly surveys of a sample of employers, with a much more complete database of unemployment insurance tax records.

A final benchmark revision will be released in February along with the department's report on employment for January. Government statisticians will use the final benchmark count to revise payrolls data for months both prior to and after March.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2016 06:39AM ET</span>",German industry output posts steepest drop in almost two years,"By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial production fell the most in 23 months in July, data showed on Wednesday, another sign that Europe's largest economy is set for a slowdown.
Wednesday's data, published one day after a surprisingly weak rise in industrial orders, added to worries that the German economy is losing steam, as exports suffer from lower demand in emerging markets and concern grows about Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
""Companies in the industry sector continue to adopt a wait- and-see approach because of sluggishness in the global export markets,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement.
Industrial output fell by 1.5 percent in July from June, the data showed, far below the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for an increase of 0.2 percent.
Construction's 1.8 percent increase in output and energy's 2.6 percent surge were not enough to offset a 2.3 percent drop in manufacturing activity, the data showed.
In the less volatile two-month comparison, industrial output was nearly flat, falling 0.1 percent in June and July. 
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said no single factor caused the stagnating industrial output.
""The trend already started long before the British referendum, but clearly the Brexit vote should have been one of the main drivers behind the sharp July drop,"" Brzeski said.
""More generally speaking, the German industry seems to suffer from weaker activity in China, struggling euro zone peers and a general shift away from manufacturing towards services.""
Nordea Bank analyst Holger Sandte pointed to the same structural change in the world economy.
""This is more proof that the manufacturing sector is no longer a driver of growth in a world that is increasingly dominated by services,"" Sandte said. ""The German economy maybe needs to adapt more to this.""
WHAT TO DO?
The government expects the economy to expand by 1.7 percent this year, comparable to last year, when private consumption and state spending provided most of the impetus. For 2017, the government forecasts a slowdown to 1.5 percent as weaker exports hit manufacturers, historically a pillar of the economy. 
With private consumption showing signs of slowing, the government is facing louder calls to increase investment on education, infrastructure and high technology. 
Critics say Chancellor Angela Merkel, now over a decade in power, has benefited from reforms enacted by her Social Democrat predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, and accuse her government of complacency on the economy.
The Social Democrats, coalition partners of Merkel's ruling conservatives, have made increasing investments the centerpiece of their election campaign a year before a federal vote.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, a conservative, has promised tax cuts for low- and middle-income households after the 2017 election. But he has ruled out new debt to finance investments, sticking to his balanced budget policy until 2020.
The government wants to reduce total public debt in 2020 to less than 60 percent of gross domestic product - a criterion set out in the EU's Stability and Growth Pact - for the first time since 2002.
That goal ""is not an end in itself,"" Merkel told the lower house of parliament on Wednesday. ""It's about giving room for maneuver to those who will draw up budgets after us - and not letting debt increase further.""
Economists, including a panel of so-called wise men who advise the government on policy, disagree.

Rather than promising tax cuts, ING's Brzeski said, the government should invest more in education and high technology infrastructure, which would act as ""instruments to boost long-term growth rather than providing short-term stimulus"".

Tuesday's downbeat report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) came on the heels of data last week showing a slowdown in job growth in August, a contraction in factory activity and weak automobile sales.
""It is beginning to look as if the economy went on vacation in August,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The August data are troubling and they have to concern the Fed. There is no compelling reason for the Fed to raise rates in two weeks.""
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index fell 4.1 percentage points to a reading of 51.4, the lowest since February 2010. The drop from July was the largest monthly fall since the 2008 financial crisis, with the ISM saying a majority of companies had noted a slowing in their level of business.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
After the report, interest rate futures were pricing in a 15 percent probability of a rate increase at the Fed's upcoming Sept. 20-21 meeting. The odds for a December rate hike were even.
The U.S. central bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held it steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation.
The dollar dropped against a basket of currencies on Tuesday's data, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were trading higher.
GROWTH COULD BE SLOWING
The ISM reported last week that factory activity contracted in August for the first time in six months. The ISM manufacturing index, however, remains above the threshold associated with a recession.
Economists said while the ISM surveys did not directly feed into the calculation of gross domestic product, the weak August readings suggested economic growth could be slowing.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The U.S. economy grew 1.0 percent in the first half of the year.
""This makes us very nervous for the third quarter. Growth might still be strong. There are good reasons to believe it will be, such as the rebound in mining-related investment and the strength of exports,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
Last month's sharp slowdown in services industry activity reflected a 7.5 percentage points decline in the production subindex, the largest drop since November 2008, when the financial crisis was roiling the global economy.
Activity was also weighed down by decreases in employment and new orders measures. Backlog orders and new export orders contracted last month. Inventories shrank in August after 16 consecutive months of growth.
The ISM said 11 industries, including utilities, real estate, finance and insurance, health care & social assistance, information and professional, scientific and technical services reported growth last month.
The seven industries reporting contraction included transportation and warehousing, wholesale trade, retail trade and arts, entertainment and recreation.
Retailers described the business environment as having ""softened a bit over the last month,"" while respondents in professional, scientific & technical services said they were still recovering from the renewable energy market downturn.
Some economists believe the report exaggerated the services sector's weakness.

""While this report is a little disappointing, it is important to note that the index had been running a little hot compared with underlying economic activity. As such, we expect a modest rebound in future ISM readings,"" said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics at Oxford Economics in New York.

In a report, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) fell to 51.4 last month from 55.5 in July. That was its weakest pace since January 2010.
Analysts had expected the index to drop to 55.0.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates the non-manufacturing sector economy is generally expanding, below 50.0 indicates the sector is contracting.
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index decreased to 51.8, 7.5 points lower than the July reading of 59.3. That was the 85th consecutive month of growth, albeit it at a notably slower rate.
Analysts had forecast it to fall to 58.8.
The New Orders Index registered 51.4 in August, 8.9 points lower than the reading of 60.3 in July.
The Employment Index decreased 0.7 points to 50.7 from the July reading of 51.4.
The Prices Index decreased 0.1 points from the July reading of 51.9 to 51.8. That was the fifth consecutive month of price increases.
The ISM noted that the majority of the respondents’ comments indicated that there had been a slowing in the level of business for their respective companies.
The 11 non-manufacturing industries reporting growth in August — listed in order — are: Utilities; Real Estate, Rental & Leasing; Accommodation & Food Services; Finance & Insurance; Educational Services; Health Care & Social Assistance; Public Administration; Management of Companies & Support Services; Professional, Scientific & Technical Services; Information; and Construction.
The seven industries reporting contraction in August — listed in order — are: Other Services; Mining; Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting; Transportation & Warehousing; Wholesale Trade; Retail Trade; and Arts, Entertainment & Recreation.
In an immediate reaction, the dollar weakened. EUR/USD was trading at 1.1213 from around 1.1159 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3404 from 1.3367 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 102.48 from 103.35 earlier.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held interest rates steady on Tuesday, a month after cutting to a record low of 1.5 percent, and left open the question of further easing as the country gets ready to toast 25 years without a recession.
The decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) came as no surprise given easings in August and May are yet to percolate through the economy.
""The Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time,"" said RBA Governor Glenn Stevens, who retires this month after a decade in the top job.
Stevens will be replaced by his current deputy, Philip Lowe, who in turn is being replaced by another career RBA banker, Guy Debelle. Both are well respected in financial markets.
All 33 economists polled by Reuters expected a steady outcome and financial markets had priced in a vanishingly small chance of a cut. <0#YIB:>.
Most respondents looked for rates to stay on hold to the end of the year, though many favored one final easing to 1.25 percent in the first quarter of 2017. [AU/INT]
The recent cuts were driven largely by a surprisingly sharp slowdown in inflation and the need to prevent the local dollar from climbing too far in reaction to hyper-aggressive policy easing elsewhere in the world.
GROWTH FORECASTS EDGE HIGHER
The steady decision comes a day before government data is expected to show Australia notched up a 25 years of economic expansion in the June quarter.
Indeed, analysts were nudging up their growth forecasts after data showed the conservative government of Malcolm Turnbull went on a mini spending-spree last quarter, in the run-up to a federal election in July.
Forecasts were now clustered around 0.5 percent to 0.6 percent for gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the second quarter. That would be a step down from the first quarter's unusually strong 1.1 percent increase, largely due to a pullback in net export earnings.
Yet annual growth was still seen accelerating to around 3.5 percent, the fastest pace in four years and well ahead of most of Australia's peers in the rich world.
""The Australia economic expansion is about to celebrate its 25th birthday and is zeroing in on the Netherlands' gold medal for the longest expansion in the modern era,"" said Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec.

""Household and government spending, public investment and inventories drove growth in the quarter, restrained by private investment and net exports.""

819,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 06, 2016 12:38AM ET</span>","Reserve Bank of Australia holds at 1.50% as expected, cites growth signs","Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia held the cash rate at a record low 1.50% as expected on Tuesday, citing signs of continued growth despite global headwinds.
For the full-text statement:
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Several advanced economies have recorded improved conditions over the past year, but conditions have become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. Actions by Chinese policymakers have been supporting growth, but the underlying pace of China's growth appears to be moderating.
Commodity prices are above recent lows, but this follows very substantial declines over the past couple of years. Australia's terms of trade remain much lower than they had been in recent years.
Financial markets have continued to function effectively. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
In Australia, recent data suggest that overall growth is continuing, despite a very large decline in business investment, helped by growth in other areas of domestic demand and exports. Labour market indicators continue to be somewhat mixed, but suggest continued expansion in employment in the near term.
Inflation remains quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some time.
Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 is helping the traded sector. Financial institutions are in a position to lend for worthwhile purposes. These factors are all assisting the economy to make the necessary economic adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.
Supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards in the housing market. Separately, a number of lenders are also taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. The best available information suggests that dwelling prices overall have risen moderately over the past year and growth in lending for housing purposes has slowed. Considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities.
Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May and August meetings, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Spending fell by 0.3 percent compared with August last year, down sharply from a 1.9 percent leap in July, the British Retail Consortium said.
The BRC said it was the weakest reading since September 2014, excluding distortions caused by the timing of public holidays, but it did not appear to be a delayed reaction by consumers to the shock June 23 vote to leave the European Union.
""Care should be taken in reading too much into August's lackluster performance,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said, noting volatile swings in recent British economic data.
""The fact is that, so far, little has directly changed for the UK's consumers as a result of the referendum,"" she said.
Britain's consumers, who drove the country's recovery from the financial crisis, appear to have largely taken the Brexit vote in their stride for now, according to several indicators.
However, purchases of new cars by individuals have fallen since the referendum and there have been signs of weaker demand in housing market. The Bank of England expects rising inflation and uncertainty about Britain's future trading relationship with the EU to weigh on the economy in the months and years ahead.
The BRC said that on a like-for-like basis, stripping out changes in the amount of retail space open to shoppers over the past 12 months, sales fell by 0.9 percent in August versus a year ago, compared with a 1.1 percent increase in July.
Over the three months to August, total sales were up 0.6 percent, half the average rate of the past 12 months, weighed down by non-food sales which were probably hit by lower numbers of shoppers in the warm weather.
Barclaycard said on Tuesday its measure of consumer spending rose 4.2 percent in August, the highest annual rise in just over a year, pushed up by the higher cost of holiday spending abroad after a post-Brexit vote fall in value of the pound.

Barclaycard managing director Paul Lockstone said only four in 10 consumers surveyed by the firm felt confident in the British economy. ""It's too soon to tell if this lift in spending will last once everyone's holiday tans have faded,"" he said.

The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for Brazilian services <BRPMIS=ECI>, compiled by research firm Markit, fell on a seasonally adjusted basis to 42.7 in August from 45.6 in July. The 50 mark of the index separates contraction from expansion.
The deeper contraction along with an ongoing manufacturing slump dragged Markit's Composite Index <BRPMCP=ECI> to 44.4 in August from 46.4 in July.
Financial intermediation was the only one of six service categories that did not post slower activity in the month.

The rate of job losses and input price increases eased to the slowest since January.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth in August was at its weakest since the start of last year, suggesting the bloc's struggling economy is losing what little momentum it had, a private sector survey showed on Monday.
Adding to policymakers' concerns, the slowing came as firms offered deeper discounts despite rising input costs and against the background of ultra-loose monetary policy and the promise of more loosening to come later this year.
In a sign Europe's biggest economy may also be losing steam, German services industry growth slowed more than expected, its weakest showing for more than three years. However, French, Italian and Spanish growth accelerated.
""The economy is trundling along but it is not really going very far or very fast. It has clearly lost momentum over the course of this year,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Peter Dixon said.
""The ECB's policies don't seem to be stimulating the kind of activity that is desired and it might prompt them to do more but ultimately it shows the limits of monetary policy.""
According to a Reuters poll, economists say that while the European Central Bank will keep policy unchanged on Thursday it will respond to pressure for further easing and announce an extension to its asset purchase programme this year.
Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 52.9 in August, below a flash estimate of 53.3 and July's 53.2, its lowest since January 2015 but it has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013.
August's PMI points to steady but sluggish 0.3 percent growth in the third quarter, Markit said, which if realized, would match the median prediction in a Reuters poll.
In brighter news, euro zone retail sales rose more than expected in July, posting the largest monthly increase of the year and investor sentiment in the bloc improved further in September, another survey showed on Monday.
""This is all the more welcome given the purchasing managers disappointingly reporting that overall euro zone services and manufacturing output slipped back to a 19-month low in August,"" IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer said.
Years of ultra loose monetary policy has so far failed to get inflation anywhere close to the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling - it was just 0.2 percent in August - and the composite output price fell to 49.3 last month, below July's 49.8.
Despite the discounting, growth in the bloc's dominant service industry also waned. Its PMI was 52.8, matching June's 17-month low and below July's 52.9 and flash estimate of 53.1.
With the outlook somewhat bleak, optimism among service firms was at its gloomiest since late 2014. The business expectations index registered 60.7, down from 60.9 in July.
Britain - which is outside the currency bloc - voted in late June to leave the European Union although its services industry bounced back strongly last month after apparently reeling from the shock in July.
Economists said that the Brexit vote seemed to have left European businesses unscathed, for now.
""While the euro zone economy seems to have avoided an immediate shock from the UK's Brexit vote, there is still pressure on the ECB to take action at its meeting this week,"" Capital Economics economist Stephen Brown said.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 52.9 last month from a reading of 47.4 in July.
The month on month gain in the index of 5.5 points was the largest in the 20-year history of the survey
Analysts had expected the index to rise to 50.0.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Markit pointed out that services output and new business both rose following prior month’s declines and that expectations improved from July’s 89-month low.
Furthermore, input prices rose at the sharpest rate since November 2013.
“A record rise in the services PMI adds to the encouraging news seen in the manufacturing and construction sectors in August to suggest that an imminent recession will be avoided,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
However, Williamson noted that the three PMI surveys point to a stagnation so far in the third quarter which means September will be key to see whether the economy contracts or ekes out modest growth
Williamson also pointed to the fact that business confidence still remained at one of its lowest levels in the last four years.
“Many companies remain worried about the outlook and how the economy will fare in the event of Brexit, suggesting that political and economic uncertainty is likely to prevail in coming months, subduing growth,” he concluded.
In an immediate reaction to the report, the pound strengthened. GBP/USD was trading at 1.3357 from around 1.3332 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8363 from 0.8386 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 138.19 compared to 137.84 previously.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded mostly higher, with the exception London’s FTSE 100 down 0.21%. The Euro Stoxx 50 rose 0.30%, France's CAC 40 traded up 0.36%, while Germany's DAX advanced 0.30%."

More signs of stability in China's economy support the growing consensus that China's central bank will hold off on further monetary easing such as interest rate cuts through at least the end of the year.
Stronger activity in the services sector, along with a stagnating manufacturing industry, also paint a picture of an economy that is slowly rebalancing.
However, analysts say gains in services are to some degree due to a housing recovery that is boosting real estate and construction services but may not be sustainable.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 52.1 in August on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 51.7 in July.
However, the rate of expansion was in line with recent months and remained well below the historical average. Caixin/Markit described the growth in activity as ""relatively underwhelming"".
New business increased, albeit at the slowest pace since May, and the prices firms were able to charge increased at the slowest rate in five months, indicating demand remains weak.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors continued to show healthy expansion, with a reading of 51.8, slightly slower than July.
But analysts say China needs to step up structural reforms and fiscal stimulus to avoid a slowdown in coming months.
""Overall, the economy continued to expand in August at a pace similar to the growth rate for July, but conditions in manufacturing and service sectors diverged again,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
""Downward pressure on China's economy remains and supportive policies must continue.""
China's official services survey showed robust growth continued in August but at a slightly slower pace from July.
But August manufacturing surveys were mixed, with Caixin/Markit's showing activity stagnated in August while an official factory reading saw the strongest growth in nearly two years.
The surveys by Markit, which is a registered trade mark of IHS Markit Limited, focus more on small and medium-sized firms.
A greater number of sometimes lower-skilled service jobs may help keep unemployment at bay as many industrial companies cut workers, but it could be having an impact on productivity growth.

The National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday that China's labour productivity increased 6.6 percent in 2015, which was the slowest rate since 1999.

In a statement, the board said August sales totaled 2,489, down from 3,362 in the same month last year. That decrease followed a 19 percent year-to-year decline for sales in July.
British Columbia introduced a 15 percent tax on foreign real estate buyers in Vancouver in late July, a measure geared at increasing housing affordability.
A benchmark of home prices in the Vancouver area jumped 32 percent over one year to hit C$917,800 ($705,967) in June. Foreign buyers have taken the brunt of the blame for the runaway market, though factors like low interest rates also play a role.
The home price benchmark gained slightly to C$933,100 in August, a 4.9 percent increase over the last three months, according to the board.
""The record-breaking sales we saw earlier this year were replaced by more historically normal activity throughout July and August,"" REBGV President Dan Morrison said in the statement.
""The new foreign buyer tax appears to have added to this trend by reducing foreign buyer activity and causing some uncertainty amongst local home buyers and sellers.""

841,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2016 12:22PM ET</span>",U.S. nonfarm payrolls rise less than expected; wage growth moderates,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth slowed more than expected in August after two straight months of robust gains and wage gains moderated, which could effectively rule out an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve this month.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 151,000 jobs last month after an upwardly revised 275,000 increase in July, with hiring in manufacturing and construction sectors declining, the Labor Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent as more people entered the labor market.
The report comes on the heels of news on Thursday that the manufacturing sector contracted in August, which had already cast doubts on an interest rate hike at the Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting.
""This mixed jobs report puts the Fed in a tricky situation. It's not all around strong enough to assure a September interest rate hike. But it's solid enough to engender a heated policy discussion,"" said Mohamed el-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG), in Newport Beach, California.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate slipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 percent.
Last month's jobs gains, however, could still be sufficient to push the Fed to raise interest rates in December. The rise in payrolls reinforces views that the economy has regained speed after almost stalling in the first half of the year.
Rate hike probabilities for both the September and December meetings rose after remarks last Friday by Fed Chair Janet Yellen that the case for raising rates had strengthened in recent months.
Following the report, financial markets were pricing in a 21 percent chance of a rate hike this month and a 58.6 percent probability in December, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.
The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held it steady since amid concerns over low inflation.
The dollar was marginally higher against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell, while stocks on Wall Street rose.
CALENDAR QUIRKS RESTRAIN PAYROLLS, WAGES
The step-down in employment growth comes after the economy created a total of 546,000 jobs in June and July.
With the labor market near full employment and the economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession showing signs of aging, a slowdown in job growth is normal. Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth.
The smaller-than-expected rise in payrolls also likely reflects difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations related to school calendars. Over the last several years, the government's August payrolls estimates have been weak only to be subsequently revised higher.
""As the August numbers have tended to come in on the softer side in the past, we think that this mostly reflects seasonal adjustment problems rather than underlying weakness,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
""The report thus leaves the Fed on track for a rate hike in December. September seems to be off the table now.""
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign team said the numbers were a sign of a disappointing economic performance tied to what a senior campaign adviser called ""Clinton globalist policies.""
The timing of the next rate hike could also be determined by wage growth. Average hourly earnings increased three cents or 0.1 percent in August after a solid 0.3 percent rise in July.
The moderation in gains, which reflects a calendar quirk, pulled down the year-on-year gain to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent in July.
Americans worked fewer hours last month, with the average workweek dipping to 34.3 hours from 34.4 hours in July. Other details of the report showed the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, unchanged at 62.8 percent last month.
The participation rate remains near multi-decade lows, in part reflecting demographic changes, and economists say this partially explains why wage growth has been sluggish.
Still, the payrolls gain added to July consumer spending, residential construction and durable goods orders in suggesting a pickup in economic growth after output rose 1.0 percent in the first half of the year.
A second report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed the trade deficit fell 11.6 percent to $39.5 billion in July as exports rose to their highest level in 10 months, in another boost to the growth outlook for the third quarter.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter.
Last month, manufacturing sector employment fell 14,000 after rising for two straight months. Construction payrolls slipped 6,000, while mining shed a further 4,000 jobs in August.
Professional and business services added 22,000 jobs last month after creating 80,000 positions in July. Retail sector employment increased by 15,100 jobs and payrolls in the leisure and hospitality sector rose 29,000.

Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger of future hiring, fell 3,100. Government payrolls rose 25,000 in August, extending the streak of job gains in the public sector to four months.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2016 11:28AM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders post largest increase in nine months,"WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their largest increase in nine months in July as demand increased broadly, in a hopeful sign for the embattled manufacturing sector.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that new orders for manufactured goods rebounded 1.9 percent after a downwardly revised 1.8 percent decrease in June. It was the biggest rise since October 2015 and followed two straight months of declines.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 2.0 percent in July after a previously reported 1.5 percent decline in June.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft increased 1.5 percent in July instead of the 1.6 percent rise it reported last month. These so-called core capital goods are seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans on equipment.
Core capital goods shipments, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 0.5 percent in July. They were previously reported to have slipped 0.4 percent in July.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, remains constrained by the lingering effects of a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have crimped exports of factory goods.
A collapse in oil drilling activity following a plunge in oil prices has also squeezed manufacturing by undermining business spending, leading to weak demand for heavy machinery.
In addition, a U.S. inventory correction has resulted in factories receiving fewer orders. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Thursday
that its national factory activity index fell into contraction territory in August for the first time in six months.
In July, orders for transportation equipment surged 10.6 percent, also the biggest gain since last October. Orders for motor vehicles and parts slipped 0.5 percent.
Orders for machinery, which have been hurt by weak demand in the energy, mining and agricultural sectors, jumped 1.4 percent - the largest rise in six months.
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components soared 3.7 percent, the biggest gain since June 2014. Orders for computers and electronic products rose 3.4 percent, the largest rise since March 2015.
Inventories of factory goods edged up 0.1 percent after 12 straight monthly declines. Shipments slipped 0.2 percent. As a result, the inventories-to-shipments ratio was unchanged at 1.35 in July.

Unfilled orders at factories decreased for a second straight month.

Industrial production rose 0.1 percent in July from June  after seasonal adjustments, the fifth increase in a row, government statistics agency IBGE said. The median estimate in a Reuters poll projected a decline of 0.2 percent.
Production in July retreated 6.6 percent from a year earlier , IBGE said.
A rebound in food processing after two consecutive months of slowing activity helped Brazil's industrial output stay positive in July. Production of capital goods retreated though, losing part of the gains from the first half of the year when companies started to boost spending in machinery and equipment to prepare for an imminent economic recovery.
Brazilian manufacturers have slashed nearly one-fifth of their production since 2013 as the nation fell into a deep recession. Industrial output returned to growth in the second quarter, gross domestic product data showed this week, but firms still grapple with high interest rates and inflation.
Eleven of the 24 industrial sectors surveyed reported growth in July from June, including extractive industries, electronics and metalworking. Automobile production fell.

So far this year, industrial output has shrank 8.7 percent when compared to the same period in 2015.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap narrowed 11.6 percent to $39.5 billion, declining after three straight months of increases. June's trade deficit was revised slightly up to $44.7 billion. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap decreasing to $42.7 billion in July after a previously reported $44.5 billion shortfall. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit dropped to $58.3 billion from $64.5 billion in June.
The trade report added to upbeat reports on consumer spending, industrial production and residential construction that have suggested the economy has regained momentum after output increased 1.0 percent in the first half.
Despite July's increase, exports continue to be hobbled by the residual effects of the dollar's surge against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December. 
Export growth could come under pressure. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde told Reuters this week the IMF would likely downgrade its 2016 global growth forecast because of weak demand, flagging trade and investment. 
Exports of goods and services rose 1.9 percent in July to $186.3 billion, the highest since September 2015. Exports to the European Union dropped 9.5 percent, with goods shipped to the United Kingdom falling 9.2 percent. 
Exports to China increased 3.8 percent.
Imports of goods and services slipped 0.8 percent to $225.8 billion in July. Oil prices averaged $41.02 per barrel in July, the highest level since September 2015.

A record summer for tourist arrivals has helped the economy shrug off a prolonged period of political uncertainty and, seasonally-adjusted, the number of people registered as jobless fell by 24,462 people in August, Labour Ministry data showed on Friday.
But compared with July the jobless number rose by 0.39 percent, or 14,435 people, leaving 3.7 million out of work.
Increases in unemployment are common in Spain in August, as factories reduce activity in what is the peak holiday season and many private sector teachers fall off the social security registers that track job creation in the lull that precedes the start of the new school term.
Hotels and restaurants, meanwhile, continued to create jobs last month though the services sector as a whole laid off staff, the ministry said.
With the bumper summer for tourism drawing to a close, Spain faces a fresh challenge to keep its economic recovery on track as one of the major drivers of growth and employment wanes.
Two inconclusive elections in the past eight months have left the country unable to form a new government amid a stand-off between parties on the right and left, and the impasse may start to weigh more heavily on the turnaround if it drags on, acting Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said this week.
Later on Friday conservative acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy faces a second confidence vote in parliament for a second term in office. If he loses as expected, the countdown would be triggered to a likely third election in December.
A gradual recovery in Spain's jobs market, which collapsed in 2008 when a real estate bubble burst and the economy sank into a long recession, has so far underpinned a consumer spending rebound.
That in turn has helped economic growth stay robust in the first two quarters of the year, meaning Spain can ill afford any slowdown in job creation.
Compared to August last year, there were just over 519,000 more people in work, up 3 percent, the ministry said.
But on a month-on-month basis, nearly 145,000 fewer people were registered as working, the biggest drop between July and August since 2008.

A booming housing market and government infrastructure spree helped the world's second-largest economy grow faster than expected in the second quarter, benefiting the construction industry and companies that sell building materials from steel to cement.
China's average nationwide home prices are expected to rise 10.0 percent in 2016 from a year ago, according to the median of forecasts from 11 analysts. That is significantly higher than the 6.3 percent gain predicted in the last poll conducted in June.
Analysts cited favorable macroeconomic policies and hot demand in more developed cities as some of the reasons behind the strong price rises.
""In general, current credit policy is still relatively relaxed, and this is the reason behind the price rises in first- and second-tier cities,"" Home Link Research analyst Xu Xiaole said.
Other analysts believed that although price rises in first- and second-tier cities have already been ""oppressed"" to some extent by cooling measures, capital will keep flowing into the property market given Chinese have few other good investment options.
That said, analysts surveyed do expect more cities to impose curbs on home purchases this year, such as higher mortgage downpayments, as continued price rises raise fears of overheating and property bubbles.
Though home price rises in China's biggest cities showed signs of easing in July from June, they have posted eye-popping gains on a year-on-year basis, with southern boomtown Shenzhen rising nearly 41 percent. Prices in Beijing and Shanghai were up 20.7 percent and 27.3 percent on-year, respectively. 
Poll respondents believed the enthusiasm for home purchases in bigger cities will persist, and falling inventories likely will drive up prices.
Secondary markets with continuous population inflow or located near the country's largest cities, such as Wuhan, Hangzhou and Nanjing, also will see strong price growth for the remainder of this year.
But prices in third- and fourth-tier cities are likely to underperform due to high inventories and sluggish demand. Nearly half of the respondents believed it would take over two to five years for inventories to clear with situations in less developed cities a particular worry. 
Housing inventories has been falling slowly despite strong sales this year.
Almost all of the 11 respondents thought property investment would remain low through the end of this year, with a median forecast of 4 percent, after growing just 1 percent last year.
Property investment in January-July rose 5.3 percent from a year earlier, official data showed, slowing from an increase of 6.1 percent in January-June.
Poll respondents see Chinese home prices as expensive. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is extremely cheap and 10 is extremely over-valued, the median reply was 8, slightly higher than 7 in the last poll.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth is expected to be revised down slightly to flat over April-June due to a decline in capital expenditure, a Reuters poll found, underscoring the view that any recovery in the current quarter will be modest.
A preliminary estimate last month saw economic growth grind to a virtual halt in the second quarter, posting just 0.2 percent annualized growth as the strong yen and weak demand took their toll on exports and capital spending.
The poll of 17 economists found the annualized growth rate of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to be flat over April through June, slumping from 2.0 percent annualized expansion in the first quarter, a figure flattered by leap-year effects.
This would translate into a quarter-on-quarter reading of 0.0 percent, unchanged from the initial estimate. 
Analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as a recent run of weak export, factory output and household spending data highlighted the fragility of the Japanese economy.
""The economy counted on policy steps to offset weak private demand through expansion in public works and an increase in housing investment on low interest rates,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""It's hard to see autonomous economic recovery. Unless overseas economies improve and the yen's gains ease, we must remain vigilant against the risk of the economy hitting new lows, until the planned economic stimulus is fully implemented.""
Capital expenditure, a key component of GDP, was expected to show a fall of 0.4 percent for the quarter, unchanged from the preliminary estimate, the poll found.
The Cabinet Office will issue the revised GDP data at 8:50 a.m on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday).
Separate data from the finance ministry, out at the same time as the revised GDP figures, is likely to show Japan's current account balance posting a surplus of 2.090 trillion yen ($20.23 billion) in July.
That would top June's 974.4 billion yen surplus and would be the 25th straight monthly surplus in the balance of payments, helped by income from overseas investments, foreign tourists, and the trade surplus.

The proportion of businesses that were optimistic about their own prospects over the next 12 months rose to 48 percent in August, up from 46 percent in July, according to the monthly survey conducted by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr).
The overall confidence index reached 109.7 in August from 105.0 in July, regaining much of the ground it lost immediately after the UK voted to exit the European Union on June 23, when it fell from June's 112.6.
But companies remained downbeat about the economy in the next 12 months. 
Although the proportion of pessimistic businesses fell to 45 percent in August from 49 percent in July, that was still well above the 25 percent posted in June, before the referendum.

867,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2016 04:41PM ET</span>",August U.S. auto sales fall; carmakers say industry has peaked,"By Bernie Woodall
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales fell 4.2 percent in August as some major automakers said a long-expected decline due to softer consumer demand had begun, possibly sparking a shift to juicer customer incentives and slower production.
The top three sellers, General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Toyota  Motor Corp (T:7203) (N:TM) on Thursday reported declines of at least 5 percent.
Of the seven top manufacturers by sales, only  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) reported a gain versus a year ago, when sales were restated to about 11,000 fewer than originally reported.
Monthly spending on new cars and trucks is closely watched as the U.S. auto industry accounts for about one-fifth of U.S. retail sales.
August sales, said Autodata Corp, totaled 1.51 million vehicles, or 16.98 million vehicles at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate, versus a surprisingly strong 17.88 million vehicles in July.
Ford Chief Economist Bryan Bezold said sales had hit a plateau after steadily rising following the 2008-2009 recession. The auto industry outperformed the overall U.S. economy in those years largely due to pent-up demand that has now played out, he said.
Wall Street has pressured automaker shares all year amid expectations of falling sales at some point.
GM shares dipped 0.4 percent while Ford was off 1.4 percent in afternoon trading. Fiat Chrysler dropped 1.2 percent in New York trading.
In late July, Ford was the first major automaker to confirm the lofty sales gains achieved since 2010 were at an end, even though they are still about 65 percent higher than the lowest sales year in 2009.
Mark LaNeve, Ford's U.S. sales chief, said on Thursday the company will ring up fewer sales in 2017 than this year. Results in 2016 are expected to fall short of last year's record high sales of 17.47 million vehicles, according to Autodata.
GM on Thursday forecast 2016 sales at 17.3 million vehicles.
Ford, whose sales tumbled 8.4 percent, said its U.S. inventory was at 81 days of supply versus 61 days a year earlier, suggesting Ford may have to cut production, increase profit-eroding incentives, or boost fleet sales. 
""Now the automakers' focus will shift from simple growth to market share and managing inventories,"" said analyst Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. ""The use of incentives and fleet sales as a counter to plateauing retail sales will be the statistics to watch going forward.”
Ford's LaNeve said the company will manage supply with demand, but when asked if production will be slowed or plants shut down to accomplish that goal, he declined to say. 
The trend toward SUVs and trucks and away from sedans and hatchbacks continued in August. Autodata figures show passenger car sales fell 12.6 percent while SUV and truck sales rose 2.4 percent.
While GM said this year's sales will not top results of 2015, the slide was moderate, and results remained sharply above those in the 2008-2009 recession and in the years immediately after.
“All the economic factors continue to point toward a strong second half of the year and another potential record year for the industry,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, GM’s chief economist. 
Sales of the No. 1 selling model in the United States, the Ford F-Series pickup truck, fell 6 percent, but Ford said retail sales for the trucks were robust.
Retail sales cover individuals and are generally more lucrative than volume fleet sales to rental car agencies, businesses and government. Rental car sales are particularly low-profit.
GM has boasted all year that it has significantly cut its sales to rental agencies. However, GM's retail sales fell about 5 percent, in line with its wider total sales decline.
Fiat Chrysler said in July it has revised more than five years of monthly U.S. vehicle sales figures amid a U.S. investigation into claims of inflated figures.
Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) sales were off 6.5 percent, but its Rogue midsize SUV saw a rise of 19 percent.

Honda Motor Co (T:7267) was down 3.8 percent as Accord sales tumbled 26 percent. Honda-brand car sales fell 10 percent overall while truck and SUV sales rose 4.5 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity contracted in August for the first time in six months as new orders and production tumbled, but a low level of layoffs continued to point to a pickup in economic growth in the third quarter.
While manufacturing remains constrained by the lingering effects of a strong dollar and lower oil prices, sustained labor market strength could push the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates later this year.
""Today's disappointing (manufacturing) number further weakens the case for a rate hike later this month, but we currently see no reason to change our Fed call and continue to anticipate a rate hike at the December meeting,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell 3.2 percentage points to a reading of 49.4 last month. That was the first contraction since February. The index remains above the 43.2 threshold that is associated with a recession.
A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The dollar's surge between June 2014 and December 2015 as well as weak global demand have crimped export growth. 
A collapse in oil drilling activity following a plunge in oil prices has also squeezed manufacturing by undermining business spending, leading to weak demand for heavy machinery. In addition, a U.S. inventory correction has resulted in factories receiving fewer orders.
While sentiment surveys including the ISM and several regional reports have pointed to manufacturing weakness, so-called hard data on oil drilling rigs, durable goods orders and industrial production have offered tentative signs of stability in the sector. 
Manufacturing is lagging data on consumer spending and housing that have suggested the economy has regained speed after growing only 1.0 percent in first half of the year. 
Last month, the ISM's new orders subindex plunged 7.8 points to a reading of 49.1. Production also slipped into contractionary territory and factory employment shrunk further. But the manufacturing employment downturn has yet to spread to other sectors of the economy. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 263,000 for the week ended Aug. 27. It was the 78th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,000 to 263,000 last week.
""Despite some seeming trouble in the manufacturing sector, the overall outlook for employment is positive,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
The downbeat factory data pushed the dollar (DXY) lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were generally weaker, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.
AUGUST PAYROLLS
The data came ahead of the release on Friday of the government's closely watched employment report for August, which economists say could determine whether the Fed raises interest rates again later this month or in December.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180,000 jobs in August after rising by 255,000 in July. The unemployment rate is seen falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 percent. 
August's anticipated step-down in job gains would follow two straight months of payroll increases above 250,000. The U.S. central bank increased its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a third report on Thursday, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said employers in the United States announced plans to shed 32,188 workers from their payrolls in August, down from 45,346 in July.
The computer sector dominated the job cuts last month, with Cisco Systems (O:CSCO) announcing plans to reduce its workforce by 5,500 jobs. There were also layoffs in the energy, industrial goods and entertainment and leisure sectors.
In a fourth report, the Labor Department said unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a sharper 4.3 percent rate in the second quarter as opposed to the 2.0 percent pace reported last month. 

The spike was due to a change in how the data is calculated and probably will not be sustained. Unit labor costs rose 2.6 percent from a year ago.

The result was slightly below market expectations for a surplus of $4.2 billion, according to a Reuters poll.
Exports totaled $16.989 billion and imports $12.849 billion.
Economists in a weekly central bank poll expect a trade surplus of $50 billion in 2016, more than double last year's result after a severe recession curbed demand for imports. 

A steady inflow of foreign capital has helped the Brazilian real  strengthen more than 20 percent so far this year.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2016 09:11AM ET</span>",Manufacturing falters as global demand weakens,"By Jonathan Cable and Shri Navaratnam
LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Manufacturers across Asia and Europe showed few signs of returning to health in August, as demand remained fitful at best, although British factories bucked the global trend, surveys showed on Thursday.
Britain's manufacturing rebounded from the shock of June's vote to leave the European Union, helped by a boost to exports from sterling's post-Brexit slump.
Recent data have shown consumer demand holding up, and Thursday's survey suggests manufacturing, which accounts for 10 percent of Britain's economy, is weathering the impact of the vote better than feared.
""The plunge in sterling is boosting the UK's competitiveness, which is helping to support export orders, while the aggressive stimulus from the Bank of England and the smooth transition of political leadership has also helped calm immediate fears for the economy,"" said James Knightley at ING.
""Nonetheless, the risks of recession have not disappeared and with surveys still suggesting a significant pullback on hiring and investment intentions we remain concerned about the prospect of a weaker performance around the turn of the year.""
The UK Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to a 10-month high of 53.3 in August after tumbling to a three-year low in July following the referendum. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
August's monthly surge was the joint largest in the manufacturing survey's near 25-year history and beat all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. After the release, the pound jumped over a cent to $1.3250, putting it on course for its best day in two weeks.
However, survey compiler Markit said reduced sales to Britain were partly to blame for slowdown in orders in the neighboring euro zone.
Manufacturing growth in the currency bloc slowed during August. Much of the expansion remained focused in the north, and the survey hinted at a further slowdown this month.
Germany, the Netherlands and Austria again provided the main power. France and Italy showed declines, Greece stagnated and both Spain and Ireland saw their worst growth since mid-2013.
Markit's PMI for the bloc dipped to 51.7 in August from 52.0, below a flash estimate of 51.8. An index measuring output came in at 53.3, below July's 53.9.
Manufacturing growth in the United States also eased last month, data are expected to show later on Thursday. reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=USPMI%3DECI
STORM CLOUDS 
Coming a week after the U.S. posted sluggish second-quarter growth, the uninspiring manufacturing surveys may give Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen pause before a Fed meeting on Sept. 20-21 to decide whether to raise interest rates.
In China, the world's second-biggest economy the official PMI ticked up to 50.4 in August, compared with the previous month's 49.9. But the private Caixin PMI, which covers a greater share of smaller firms, showed activity stagnated last month.
""While it is encouraging that manufacturing activity appears to be stabilizing, there is a risk that this is a 'calm before the storm' moment for the sector,"" said Danae Kyriakopoulou at Cebr.
With central banks almost exhausting their monetary policy support, governments have increased fiscal stimulus. Underlying demand in many of Asia's export-reliant economies remains weak, however. 
In Japan, manufacturing showed signs of steadying, but the IHS Markit/Nikkei PMI was still in contraction at 49.5 in August. Although output increased for the first time in six months, export orders continued to fall, bolstering expectations the Bank of Japan will need to offer more stimulus.
The pressure on Japanese policy makers was underscored by separate data showing Japanese business expenditure fell in April-June from the previous quarter.
Conditions were even gloomier in South Korea, a bellwether for global demand. An extended slide in exports has hit manufacturers in Asia's fourth-largest economy, with the August PMI contracting at its fastest pace in a year. 
""Given Korea acts as a harbinger for the rest of Asia, we believe Asia's cycle is now headed for another down-move,"" said Vaninder Singh, Asia economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in a note to clients.

There were some encouraging signs in India. August factory activity expanded at its fastest pace since mid-2015, but investors will have to square that with data released on Wednesday that showed economic growth slipped to its lowest in more than a year in the three months from April to June.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending August 27 increased by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 263,000 from the previous week’s total of 261,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 4,000 to 265,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended August 20 unexpectedly increased to 2.159 million from 2.145 million in the preceding week,.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to remain unchanged at 2.145 million.
The four-week moving average was 263,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week's 264,000.
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Immediately after the report, that was released simultaneously with second quarter nonfarm productivity and unit labor costs, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1137 from around 1.1141 ahead of the publication; GBP/USD was at 1.3255 from 1.3249 earlier; while USD/JPY changed hands at 103.83 from 103.75 before the release.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Weaker domestic demand caused a plunge in German engineering orders in July while growth in manufacturing slowed slightly in August, data showed on Thursday, suggesting factories in Europe's biggest economy are facing headwinds.
The latest figures reflected growing concern that the German economy is set for an economic slowdown, after its surprisingly strong performance in the first half of the year, as domestic demand fails to offset an increasing malaise in exports.
The IWH economic institute said on Thursday German growth would pick up to 1.9 percent this year from 1.7 percent in 2015 due to higher household and state spending, but it would slow to 1.2 percent in 2017 as weaker exports are expected to hit manufacturers.
Germany's VDMA industry association said engineering orders dropped by 19 percent in real terms from the previous year in July. Domestic orders dropped by 34 percent while bookings from abroad fell by 9 percent.
VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers attributed the steep drop mainly to an unusually strong rise in domestic orders for large industrial plants in July 2015.
But engineering orders also fell in the less volatile three-month comparison. Between May and July, they were down by 7 percent on the year, with domestic demand falling by 11 percent and foreign orders slipping by 4 percent.
""Overall we feel that there is uncertainty in many export markets about future economic developments,"" Wiechers said.
The engineering data came after a survey among purchasing managers showed activity in the manufacturing sector slowed slightly in August, while remaining solid overall.
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the German economy, edged down to 53.6 in August from 53.8 in July.
That was in line with a flash reading and well above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
GOOD SHAPE
""Although the PMI had edged down slightly since July, today's survey results highlight that Germany's goods-producing sector remains generally in good shape,"" Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said.
The survey figures for production and new business were among the strongest seen in the past two years, with foreign demand rising sharply, Kolodseike added.
The overall solid reading provided some welcome news after last week's Ifo index showed that business morale deteriorated in August, with Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union depressing sentiment among German executives.
Economists are divided on how much Britain's vote to leave the EU will weaken German exports and consequently lower growth rates in the coming quarters.
The DIW economic institute expects economic growth to slow to 0.3 percent in the third quarter from 0.4 percent in the three months to June, partly because of Brexit. Other analysts have said Germany's vibrant domestic economy forecast could underpin growth of 0.5 percent in the third quarter.

For 2016 as a whole, the central bank and the government both expect rising private consumption and higher state spending to drive an overall rate of expansion of 1.7 percent.

883,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2016 06:32AM ET</span>","UK factory activity rebounds in August, helped by slump in sterling: PMI survey","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing staged one of its sharpest rebounds on record in August as factories recovered from the initial shock of June's vote to leave the European Union, helped by a boost to exports from sterling's post-Brexit slump.
The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a closely watched gauge of factory activity - jumped to a 10-month high of 53.3 in August after tumbling to a three-year low in July after the referendum, which was revised up to 48.3 from 48.2.
The five-point monthly surge was the joint-largest in the manufacturing survey's near 25-year history and far outstripped all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. But it also underscored how the weaker currency is likely to fuel inflation.
Data over the past couple of weeks have shown consumer demand held up in the face of the referendum result and Thursday's survey suggests manufacturing, which accounts for 10 percent of Britain's economy, is weathering the initial impact of the vote better than feared.
Sterling soared more than a cent against the dollar and British government bond prices fell to a one-month low after the data.
""Clearly there is a storming recovery in the headline index,"" Investec economist Chris Hare said. ""We would expect manufacturing exports to fare well post-Brexit because they have the benefit to gain from falling sterling, but the surprise is that domestic business picked up too.""
Markit, which compiled the PMI said, companies had reported restarting work which they had put on hold in July, as their clients saw business starting to return to normal.
""The domestic market showed a marked recovery, especially for consumer products, while the recent depreciation of sterling drove higher inflows of new business,"" Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
However the EEF trade body, which represents manufacturers, said the strength may not be sustained.
""Manufacturers ... appear to have their mojo back in August,"" EEF chief economist Lee Hopley said. ""But the heightened volatility in the indicator in the last couple of months still raises questions about whether sentiment has overshot somewhat and ... some moderation is likely.""
LONGER-TERM HIT?
After Britons unexpectedly voted to leave the EU sterling fell by more than 10 percent against the dollar and the euro, losses that have not been recouped as markets bet on a long-term hit to British economic performance and that the Bank of England will lower interest rates again later this year.
Economists will be keen to see if the rebound in manufacturing PMI is also reflected in figures due to be published on Monday for the far larger, more domestically focused services sector.
The weak PMI surveys of July suggested the economy had begun to contract at the fastest rate since the 2008-09 financial crisis and were a big factor behind the BoE's decision on Aug. 4 to cut rates to a record low and restart bond purchases.
August's manufacturing PMI showed export orders flowed in at their fastest rate since June 2014, though overall order growth was below June's rapid pace. Factories reported that they increased output by the highest amount since January.
A separate survey published last week by the Confederation of British Industry showed export orders rising at the fastest rate in two years in the first part of August, but more subdued domestic demand than the PMI.
In the longer run, Britain's access to European export markets remains uncertain. Prime Minister Theresa May's new government has not said when it will start formal talks to leave the EU and has given no detail on whether it would allow unlimited EU migration in return for continued easy trade access - a likely demand of other countries in the bloc.
The flip side of the short-run boost to exports from a weaker currency are signs of rising inflation pressure.
Manufacturers taking part in the PMI survey reported the biggest rise in input costs in more than five years, and said they were also raising the prices they charged customers at the sharpest rate since mid-2011.

The BoE expects higher inflation and lower living standards to be one of the main costs for households from the vote to leave the EU, outweighing gains to trade from a weaker currency.

Coming a week after the United States posted sluggish second quarter growth, Asia's uninspiring manufacturing surveys may give Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen pause for thought ahead of a Fed meeting on Sept. 20-21 to decide whether or not to raise interest rates.
Moreover, the still-unknown impact of Britain's shock decision in June to quit the European Union is seen chilling already soft consumption, leaving factories struggling to clear their goods.
In China, the world's second-biggest economy, factory activity showed scant growth.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) ticked up to 50.4 in August, compared with the previous month's 49.9 and just above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. But the private Caixin version of the PMI, which covers a greater share of smaller firms, showed activity stagnated last month with the index at 50.0, from an unexpectedly upbeat 50.6 in July.
""Downward pressure on China’s economy remains and government support to stabilize growth must continue,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin PMI report.
Indeed, with central banks almost exhausting their monetary policy support, governments in Asia have increased fiscal stimulus although underlying demand in many of the region's export-reliant economies remain weak.
""A still subdued external demand environment and fading policy pass-throughs is weighing on aggregate demand in the region,"" said Chetan Ahya, senior economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). ""In the near-term, the growth trajectory will depend on the trend in external demand, and monetary and fiscal policy response.""
WEAK EXPORTS HIT JAPAN, S.KOREA
In Japan, while manufacturing activity showed signs of steadying, the IHS Markit/Nikkei PMI was still in contraction at 49.5 in August versus 49.3 in July.
Export orders continued to fall, even as output increased for the first time in six months, backing expectations the Bank of Japan will need to offer more stimulus on top up its already massive easings to revive a sputtering economy.
The pressure on Japanese policy makers was underscored by separate data showing Japanese business expenditure fell in April-June from the previous quarter.
Conditions were even more gloomy in South Korea, a bellwether for global demand. An extended slide in exports put manufacturers in Asia's fourth largest economy to the sword, with the August PMI contracting at its fastest pace in a year.
Other data showing Korean exports rebounded last month was seen as an aberration due to two extra working days this year.
""Given Korea acts as a harbinger for the rest of Asia, we believe Asia’s cycle is now headed for another down-move,"" said Vaninder Singh, Asia economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in a note to clients.
The situation in Malaysia was no better, with manufacturing activity in August contracting at a quicker rate than in July, although Taiwan was a surprising outlier with activity there expanding at the fastest pace in 1-1/2-years.
Still, broad-based weakness in external demand called for further policy support, including interest rate cuts, analysts said.
""We won’t rule out rate cuts in Malaysia or Korea, and expect further monetary policy easing in Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand this year,"" said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics.
There were some encouraging signs in India where August factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in 13 months, but investors will have to square that with data released on Wednesday that showed economic growth slipped to over a one-year low between April and June.
Surveys from Europe and the U.S. are due later Thursday, and while data has indicated pockets of strength the overall picture is one of slow growth, especially in the eurozone where worries remain over fallout from Brexit.
On Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer dropped 4.3 points to 51.5 in August, falling short of expectations.
While the focus will move to the key August U.S. jobs data due on Friday, struggling global manufacturers should give the Fed pause as it considers the next rate hike.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.3 last month from a reading of 48.2 in July.
That was a 10-month high and the month-on-month increase in the level of the headline PMI (5.0 points) was the joint-greatest in the near 25-year survey history.
Analysts had expected the index to rise to only 49.0 in August.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit indicated that the data showed solid rebounds in the trends in U.K. manufacturing output and incoming new orders, while a weaker pound drove up export orders and input costs.
Employment also rose for the first time in 2016.
“The August PMI data indicate a solid rebound in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector from the steep downturn that followed the EU referendum,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said.
“Companies reported that work that had been postponed during July had now been restarted, as manufacturers and their clients started to regain a sense of returning to business as usual,” Dobson added.
However, Dobson warned that inflation was “raising its ugly head” as increases in input prices and output charges both hit five-year highs.
In a cautious stance, he added that it was too early to know if the rebounds in growth and inflation will be sustained, but concluded that the August data suggested that recent policy action appeared to have helped avert a downturn.
After the report, cable hit intraday highs. GBP/USD was trading at 1.3242 from around 1.3139 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8411, compared to 0.8473 prior to the report and GBP/JPY traded at 137.20 compared to 136.12 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading higher. London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.22%, the Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.58%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.93%, while Germany's DAX traded up 0.50%."

LONDON (Reuters) - Manufacturing growth in the euro zone slowed during August and much of the expansion remained focused in the north, according to a survey that hinted at a further slowdown this month.
Germany, the Netherlands and Austria again provided the main power. Elsewhere, the picture was more subdued with France and Italy in decline, Greece stagnating and both Spain and Ireland enduring their worst growth spells since mid-2013.
Also clouding the outlook, Britain - which is outside the currency bloc - voted in June to leave the European Union. Most of the economic impact so far has been within Britain, but survey compiler Markit said reduced sales to the country were partly to blame for the order book slowdown.
""Euro zone manufacturers reported a wavering performance in August, with signs that growth could slow further in coming
months,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.
""There is some suggestion of a Brexit impact ... and growth may wane further in September after new orders growth slipped to a one-and-a-half year low.""
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index for the bloc dipped to 51.7 in August from 52.0, below a flash estimate of 51.8. An
index measuring output also held above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, coming in at 53.3, below
July's 53.9.
A sub-index measuring new orders fell to 51.4 from 52.2, its lowest reading since February 2015. Of further concern to policymakers at the European Central Bank, who despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy have so far failed to get inflation anywhere near their 2 percent target, factories offered deeper discounts to try and sell goods.
Euro zone inflation was stable at 0.2 percent in August, against expectations of a slight rise, official data showed on
Wednesday, adding pressure for the ECB to loosen policy again. But economists wonder just how much firepower the

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly expanded at its fastest pace in nearly two years in August as construction boomed, suggesting the economy is steadying in response to stronger government spending.
The best factory reading since late 2014 may reinforce growing views that China's central bank will be in no hurry to cut interest rates or banks' reserve requirements, for fear of adding to high debt levels or fuelling asset bubbles.
But the official factory survey also highlighted growing lopsidedness in the world's second-largest economy, with larger firms expanding, likely thanks to Beijing's largesse, while smaller manufacturers continued to struggle.
""Our view is that the People's Bank of China doesn't really have any reason to ease until we start to see clear signs of another downturn,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics said, saying it is concerned such action could aggravate economic imbalances and credit risks.
""I think eventually they'll come under pressure to ease further, but given the economy is still stable, I don't think it'll happen this year,"" he said, predicting the factory strength could last through the end of the year.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.4 in August from 49.9 in July, and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts had expected a reading of 49.9 for the second month in a row, and some thought there would be added weakness after Beijing ordered many plants around Hangzhou to close to clear the air ahead of China's first summit of G20 leaders Sept 4-5.
Yet factory output growth accelerated, with the index rising to 52.6, the highest this year, from 52.1 in July. Total new orders expanded sharply, though export orders continued to shrink, albeit at a more modest pace.
""While many factories have been shut down before the G20 summit, overall manufacturing activities are still elevated, reflecting improving growth momentum,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
Buoyed by a government infrastructure building spree and a housing boom, Shanghai futures prices for steel bars used in construction have surged about 43 percent so far this year, coaxing steel mills to keep output at high levels even as Beijing tries to cut overcapacity in the sector.
But analysts are divided over how much domestic demand is actually improving, with China's steel exports on track for record highs, and prolonged weakness in imports.
In another sign that business conditions remain tough, factories continued to cut staff, though at a slightly slower pace than in July.
China has vowed to quicken the pace of cutting excess steel and coal capacity after falling behind this year, raising the risk of more layoffs and debt defaults in coming months, which could further strain the banking system.
SMALLER FIRMS STRUGGLE
The divergence of performance between smaller and larger enterprises is also a concern if struggling smaller firms have more trouble servicing their debt burdens, some analysts said, noting recently introduced debt-for-equity swaps are likely to help bloated state companies more than private ones.
Smaller firms showed a sharp contraction in activity in August, while one for larger companies showed a solid expansion, suggesting state-owned enterprises, though often inefficient, remain the backbone sustaining China's economic growth.
""Fiscal expansion will likely need to continue at a strong pace, to ensure stable growth in the coming months,"" HSBC economists said in a note.
""We still see challenges in the second half, from further moderation in the housing sector to uncertainties about private investment. Therefore despite some upside surprise, withdrawal of policy stimulus at this stage would be highly premature.""
A private PMI survey focusing more on small and mid-sized firms reinforced the picture of a two-track economy. The survey suggested that activity at smaller manufacturers stagnated in August as output and new orders both grew at a softer pace.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) slipped to 50.0, the no-change mark which separates expansion of activity from contraction on a monthly basis.
An official survey on the services sector showed the sector continued to expand at a rapid pace, though slightly more modestly than in July.
China is counting on growth in services to offset persistent weakness in manufacturing and exports that dragged economic growth to a 25-year low.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2016 09:00PM ET</span>",South Korea August exports rebound on extra working days after 19 months of falls,"By Christine Kim and Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports rebounded in August after falling for 19 straight months, government data showed on Thursday, but analysts stopped short of calling it a firm recovery as the gain was due mainly to two extra working days.
Exports in August rose 2.6 percent on-year to $40.13 billion while imports edged up 0.1 percent to $34.82 billion to result in a trade surplus of $5.30 billion. 
This was the first positive growth for exports since December 2015 and for imports since September 2014 and beat poll forecasts for a 0.6 percent rise for exports and a 3.3 percent fall for imports.
In July, exports and imports dropped 10.3 percent and 13.6 percent, respectively.
A majority of South Korea's 13 key export products showed positive growth, including computers, semiconductors and petrochemicals.
""When you exclude the effect of the two working days, trade probably moved at a similar pace as it did in July,"" said Stephen Lee, senior economist at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities in Seoul.
August this year had 24 working days, versus 22 days last year. 
""We still have to see whether this gain will be maintained through year-end. Prospects for IT products are positive while global oil prices will have a much smaller effect on trade,"" Lee added.
The Nikkei/Markit South Korea purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed South Korea's manufacturing activity contracted at its fastest pace in a year in August as production and export orders declined sharply. 
A sub-index showed that new export orders declined the most this year amid stubbornly weak global demand, falling to 48.6 in August from 51.4 in July. A reduction in the volume of trade with China, Germany and Iraq contributed to the decline, according to the survey. (A number below 50 shows a contraction.)
The trade ministry said exports to China fell 5.3 percent on-year in August, the slowest decline since Sept. 2015. Further breakdowns will be released later in the day.
Meanwhile, South Korea's annual inflation eased to its lowest for more than a year in August following a temporary cut in electricity tariffs. The finance ministry said inflation was expected to return to previous levels after October.
The consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in August from a year earlier, Statistics Korea said, down from 0.7 percent in July. This was the smallest gain seen since April last year. 
The result was well below a median 0.8 percent rise tipped in a Reuters survey. 
""If you look at inflation alone, the central bank might look like it has room to cut interest rates, but you have to take other countries' policies into consideration as well as the continued surge in household debt,"" said Kim Yu-kyum, economist, LIG Investment & Securities.
""Right now export data is more important.""
Inflation fell 0.1 percent from July. 
South Korea last month took 420 billion Korean won ($377 million) off residential electricity bills for the July to September period due to unusually hot weather.
As a result, annual inflation for electricity, gas and water dropped 12.6 percent in August, compared to a 3.9 percent fall in July.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices eased to 1.1 percent in August, down from 1.6 percent in July, all compared to a year earlier.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) inched up to 49.5 in August on a seasonally adjusted basis, versus a preliminary 49.6 and up from a final reading of 49.3 in July.
While the decline was marginal, the headline index remained below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the sixth month.
The index for output rose to 50.2 from 49.4 in the previous month. It was the first increase since February, though it was slight and remained below the historical average.
""The latest survey data signaled an increase in manufacturing production in Japan for the first time since February and follows on from previously slower declines following May's sharp contraction,"" said Amy Brownbill, an economist at Markit.
However, new orders and export orders continued to fall, though at a slower rate. Some survey respondents cited weakness in orders from Chinese clients.
Highlighting the fragility of Japan's economy, growth in the country's industrial output ground to a halt in July after June's gains.
Economic growth stalled in April-June as consumer spending slowed and weak global demand hurt exports, and analysts had expected any rebound in the current quarter to be modest.
With the economy sputtering and price growth well short of the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target, a majority of economists expect the central bank to ease policy further next month alongside a planned review of its existing stimulus program.
Further clouding the inflation outlook, the Markit PMI survey showed Japanese manufacturers cut prices of their goods for the ninth straight month, citing greater competition and lower input costs. Markit is a registered trade mark of IHS Markit Limited.

The government, for its part, is set to roll out economic stimulus featuring 13.5 trillion yen ($132 billion) in fiscal measures for public works and other spending to spur economic growth.

The Nikkei/Markit South Korea purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 48.6 in August on a seasonally adjusted basis from a revised 50.1 in July, IHS Markit said in a statement.
It was the lowest index level since 47.9 in August last year.
A sub-index showed that new export orders declined the most this year amid stubbornly weak global demand, falling to 48.6 from 51.4 in July. A reduction in trade volumes with China, Germany and Iraq contributed to the decline, according to the survey.
That helped push output readings to a six-month low.
South Korea's exports have been falling since January 2015, stifling a recovery in Asia's fourth-largest economy, which generates about half of its gross domestic product from overseas sales.

Data from the IHS Markit's Nikkei Indonesia Purchasing Managers' Index for August. Readings above 50.0 signal expansion in manufacturing activity, rather than contraction.
DATA
AUGUST JULY JUNE
50.4 48.4 51.9
CONTEXT
- The seasonally-adjusted index for August edged back above 50.0 as new orders, exports and output all expanded.
- For new export orders, August's expansion ended a 22-month sequence of contraction.
- Order book volumes, which fell in July, rose in August, partly because the offering of cheaper prices increased domestic and international demand.
- Stocks of raw materials and semi-finished goods increased in August. Pre-production inventories rose at a moderate pace that was the quickest in more than two years.
- But manufacturing employment declined for a second straight month, and at a fastest pace this year.
Commenting on the Indonesia survey, Pollyanna De Lima, economist at IHS Markit, said:
""The return to growth of Indonesia's manufacturing sector in August is a positive sign, especially as July's decline raised concerns regarding the start of a new downturn. Survey data indicate that firms are undoubtedly cautious about the short-term outlook for new work and production, as highlighted by another reduction in payroll numbers.""
""August's increases in output and new orders lay a platform that companies will hope to build on in coming months should improvements in client demand strengthen.

- Manufacturing activity in August contracted at a quicker rate than in July, following sharper declines in output, new orders and employment
- Production fell on a drop in total new orders, partly from slowing international demand.
- Employment fell to its weakest since April 2013 as operating conditions worsened.
- Input buying contracted for a 15th straight month, but registered its strongest levels during that period.
Commenting on the Malaysia PMI survey, Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, said:
""Latest survey data for the Malaysia manufacturing sector signaled a sharper deterioration in operating conditions. This was underpinned by quicker declines in output, new orders and employment with the rate of job shedding the fastest in over three years.
""Meanwhile, cost inflationary pressures intensified, with input prices increasing at the joint-second fastest rate in the series history. This was linked by the survey panel to higher raw material costs stemming from unfavorable rates and the rise in the sales tax.""

- Employment posted the strongest rise in 32 months
- Purchasing activity has biggest jump since May 2015
Vietnam's August PMI edged up to 52.2 from 51.9 in the previous month, showing a modest improvement in operating conditions, thanks mainly to faster rises in employment and purchasing activity.
Employment had the strongest jump since December 2013 as a fifth consecutive rise, with staffing levels increasing in the investment and consumer goods sectors.
Manufacturers raised their purchasing activity due to higher new orders this month, supporting an increase in stocks of purchases that was biggest in 15 months.
Output and new orders both expanded, but at a slower pace compared with recent months, while input costs extended their climb but firms reduced their charges, apparently in a bid to improve sales.

Thursday's figures from property consultant CoreLogic showed its index of home prices for the combined capital cities climbed 1.1 percent in August, from July when it increased by 0.8 percent.
Annual growth in prices picked up to 7 percent in August, from 6.1 percent in July, though that remains a long way from last year's peak above 11 percent.
The spurt in prices follows rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in May and early August, which took bank borrowing costs to an all-time low of 1.5 percent.
After its last easing, the central bank played down risks of a bubble in the housing market and specifically noted that changes to the methodology of CoreLogic's data had overstated recent price gains.
CoreLogic's August data continued that pattern with hefty rises reported in Sydney and Melbourne but huge variations elsewhere. 
Home values were estimated to have jumped 1.4 percent in Sydney for the month, lifting annual growth to 9.4 percent.
Melbourne saw gains of 1.5 percent and 9.1 percent respectively.

Brisbane saw monthly growth of just 0.4 percent and Perth gained 0.2 percent, while prices fell in Adelaide and Hobart.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2016 07:59PM ET</span>","Brazil keeps rates steady, but opens door for cuts if inflation eases","By Alonso Soto and Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank kept interest rates at a decade high for the ninth straight time on Wednesday, but signaled a rate cut could be in the cards later this year if stubbornly high inflation subsides.
In a unanimous vote, the bank's monetary policy committee - known as Copom - kept its benchmark Selic rate <BRCBMP=ECI> at 14.25 percent, its highest since July 2006.
Although Brazil's borrowing costs are among the world's highest for a major economy, inflation has remained stuck around 9 percent as a surge in food prices offset a sharp drop in consumer demand.
The central bank removed from its statement a previous reference to the lack of room to cut interest rates, but laid out the blueprint to lower borrowing costs.
""The committee judges that a loosening of monetary conditions will depend on factors that allow greater confidence on meeting the inflation targets at the relevant horizons,"" the bank said.
The bank highlighted a reduction in uncertainties regarding the approval of austerity measures and easing food inflation as key factors to flexibilize monetary policy. The bank also said it will monitor the effects high interest rates and a subdued economy will have on the pace of disinflation.
The country's stubborn inflation has puzzled economists and raised worries among policymakers that it may threaten an economy they believe to be near a turning point as a political crisis eases and business confidence returns to the former star of emerging markets.
The bank's willingness to sketch out the conditions needed to lower interest rates was interpreted by many analysts as a clear signal borrowing costs could be lowered later this year.
""By detailing the conditions the bank is open to the possibility of cutting rates. But meeting those conditions is not easy,"" said Alessandra Ribeiro, economist and partner with Sao Paulo-based consultancy Tendencias.
""I don't think we can expect a rate cut in October, but the bank could make its move in November.""
Lower inflation is seen by many economists as key to bolster consumer demand and shore up an economy that is showing its first signs of recovery.
An increase in investment in the second quarter after 10 straight declines has raised hopes that the worst of the recession may be over, official data showed earlier on Wednesday.
The rise in investment stems from a rebound in confidence after former President Dilma Rousseff, whose political backing and popularity nearly vanished amid the recession, was suspended in May prior to her dismissal by the Senate on Wednesday.
The Senate vote confirmed her vice president Michel Temer as president. The center-right leader has put forward a pro-business agenda that includes key economic reforms to rebalance the public accounts.
Brazilian assets seesawed after the dismissal on market fears over division in Temer's alliance after the Senate also voted to maintain Rousseff's political rights.
The approval of the reforms to cap public spending and reduce pension benefits should help the central bank in keeping a lid on inflation and lowering price expectations for coming years.

In the statement, the bank reiterated it aims to lower inflation to its target of 4.5 percent in 2017. The central bank has missed that goal since August 2010 after years of heavy public spending and consumption-based stimulus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers maintained a steady pace of hiring in August and contracts to buy previously owned homes surged in July, suggesting the economy was regaining sufficient momentum for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year. 
Other data on Wednesday showed a sharp moderation in factory activity in the Midwest this month amid shrinking order books, indicating the manufacturing sector continued to be hobbled by the residual effects of a strong dollar and oil price slump.
""This should give the Fed confidence that the economy is strong enough to generate new employment and importantly, that the economy has enough forward momentum to withstand an interest rate hike,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased 177,000 jobs this month after rising 194,000 in July. August's gain was in line with economists' expectations. 
The services sector accounted for all the increase, with construction shedding another 2,000 jobs on top of the 5,000 positions lost in July. Manufacturing payrolls were flat after rising by 5,000 jobs in July.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for August due on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180,000 jobs in August after rising 255,000 in July. August's anticipated step-down in job gains follows two straight months of payroll increases above 250,000.
Economists say with the labor market near full employment and the economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession showing signs of aging, a moderation in job growth is normal.
The dollar rose to a three-week high against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell marginally. U.S. stocks were trading lower as the stronger dollar weighed on oil prices and materials companies.
FAVORABLE DATA
The U.S. central bank hiked interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held them steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation. 
But with data ranging from consumer spending to housing and industrial production suggesting the economy has regained speed after sputtering in the first half of the year, most economists expect another rate hike in December. 
The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting third-quarter gross domestic product rising at a 3.5 percent annual rate. 
That upbeat assessment of the economy was further bolstered by a second report on Wednesday showing that contracts to buy previously owned homes surged in July after two straight months of declines as demand rose almost across the board.
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 1.3 percent to its second highest reading in over a decade. 
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's data implied a pickup in home resales after they declined 3.2 percent in July. Economists had forecast pending home sales rising only 0.6 percent last month.
""The latest rise suggests some improvement in existing home sales,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), senior economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in Stamford Connecticut. ""However, we may not see all of the latest reported increase filter through as quickly as it usually does since there appears to be some delays in the pipeline.""
Demand for housing is being driven by the labor market, which is steadily generating increases in wages as it nears full employment. Sales, however, are being constrained by tight inventories and high prices, which are causing appraisal complications, delaying the closing of contracts.
Data on house prices, residential construction, new home sales and home builders' confidence have been upbeat in recent months. Pending home sales rose 1.4 percent from a year ago. Contracts increased 0.8 percent in the Northeast and jumped 7.3 percent in the West. They gained 0.8 percent in the South, but fell 2.9 percent in the Midwest.
But the manufacturing sector is lagging gains in the economy as factories continue to process the lingering effects of the dollar's past rally and oil price collapse. In addition, the sector which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been hamstrung by weak global demand and an inventory correction in the United States.
In a third report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer fell 4.3 points to 51.5 in August. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in factory activity in the automotive-heavy region.
Order backlogs tumbled 14.5 points, falling back into
contraction territory. New orders and production also weighed on the index, although both remained in expansion.
Supplier deliveries were little changed and factory employment rose to its highest level since April 2015.

""U.S. manufacturing has struggled to gain traction following the appreciation of the dollar in 2014 and 2015 and the collapse of drilling and mining activity in the U.S.,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""We expect manufacturing activity to improve just a touch over the rest of this year.""

914,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2016 12:09PM ET</span>",Indian growth slows sharply in April-June quarter,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economic growth hit a 15-month low between April and June, putting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target further out of reach and making it tougher for him to create millions of new jobs for a burgeoning workforce.
While 7.1 percent GDP  expansion was well below economists' predictions and the 7.9 percent growth registered in the preceding quarter, it was still faster than figures reported by China and the Philippines.
But the title of world's fastest-growing large economy does not mask the challenge Modi faces in delivering on his promise of creating 250 million jobs over the next decade.
New Delhi is targeting average growth of around 8 percent, which economists say is the bare minimum needed to provide jobs to around one million people who enter the workforce every month.
Since taking office in 2014, Modi has taken a raft of measures to attract foreign investors and revive listless domestic investment. But those initiatives have not yet succeeded in convincing cautious companies to commit to fresh capital spending.
Investment as a proportion of GDP fell by about 3 percentage points in the June quarter from the corresponding period a year ago. Worryingly, private consumption that had been underpinning economic growth thus far weakened.
Annual growth in private spending slowed to 6.7 percent in the latest quarter from a 7 percent increase in the same period last year. The slowdown more than offset a 19 percent annual surge in public spending.
""Growth continues to be driven by government spending..., which is a worry,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, an economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd in Mumbai.
DILEMMA
The reading on private consumption may complicate the central bank's decision on whether to resume interest rate cuts or stay put.
For some economists, Wednesday's data strengthen the case for a rate cut in the October-December quarter. 
But with consumer price inflation running at 6.07 percent, above the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) target band, the incoming governor, Urjit Patel, has a balancing act to perform.
A hefty hike in wages for nearly 10 million federal government employees and pensioners is widely expected to fuel spending, countering some of the caution among urban consumers caused by low wage growth.
""Given that the RBI faces a tough challenge in meeting its inflation targets, we think that it will keep the repo rate on hold,"" said Shilan Shah, economist at Capital Economics consultancy in Singapore.
The new RBI governor will also have to decide whether to take the GDP figure at face value. 
It has been more than a year since India shifted to a new method of measuring economic output, which captures value addition rather than production volumes, and economists are still struggling to square GDP figures with reality on the ground.
For example, other indicators point to persistent weakness in manufacturing, but GDP data show a robust 9.1 growth in the sector.
MONSOON RELIEF
Still, few would dispute that India remains a bright spot in a gloomy global environment, which explains why foreign investors are buying shares in Indian firms. The benchmark National Stock Exchange index (NSEI) has added 8 percent this year.
Looking ahead, bountiful rains in the June-September monsoon season should provide some support to growth and relief to India's 263 million farmers as they recover from two consecutive drought years.
That should help lift farm output, which grew 1.8 percent from a year earlier in the June quarter.
Normal rainfall this summer would boost rural consumption by $80 billion in the year to end-March 2017, according to Citibank's estimates.

""We hope that in the second half, consumption will support growth,"" said Shubhada Rao, group president and chief economist at Yes Bank.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy shrank for a sixth straight quarter between April and June, but investments grew for the first time since 2013 and fueled hopes of a modest recovery following the likely ousting of President Dilma Rousseff on Wednesday.
Gross domestic product fell 0.6 percent in the second quarter compared with the first, statistics agency IBGE said on Wednesday, slightly more than the 0.5 percent drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
Investments rose 0.4 percent though, in the first increase after 10 straight quarters of contraction. Brazil's industrial output also hit an inflection point, edging up after shrinking for five consecutive quarters.
""We've hit bottom in the second quarter,"" said José Francisco Gonçalves, chief economist at Banco Fator, in Sao Paulo. ""We may see the economy stabilizing in the third quarter, and some growth in the fourth.""
Optimism over the end of Brazil's worst recession in decades could boost interim President Michel Temer's popularity as he gears up to propose pension and labor reforms, which investors see as crucial to reestablish the nation as an emerging markets star. 
Temer is set to be confirmed in office later on Wednesday after the Senate votes to dismiss Rousseff over charges she broke fiscal rules.
The downturn, one of the world's most severe since the 2008 crisis, has left 1.7 million workers unemployed over the past 12 months and cost the nation its hard-won investment-grade credit rating. The economy is still expected to contract more than 3 percent in 2016 before growing 1.2 percent in 2017, according to market forecasts that have been upgraded in recent weeks.
""The economy is already responding to the government change,"" said Cristiano Oliveira, chief economist at Banco Fibra, who expects the economy to rebound 2.1 percent in 2017. 
Oliveira's forecast assumes the approval of economic reforms in Congress and a series of interest rate cuts in coming months. The central bank meets later on Wednesday and is expected to leave its benchmark rate on hold at 14.25 percent for now, at its highest level in nearly a decade, as inflation remains stuck at around 9 percent.
While investments and industrial output signal an imminent recovery, unemployment will probably continue to drag on consumption, which accounts for most of Brazil's output. Household consumption fell 0.7 percent in the second quarter, its sixth consecutive drop.
A stronger currency may also cap Brazil's growth in coming quarters by making local goods less competitive. Imports grew 4.5 percent in the second quarter, outpacing exports growth as the Brazilian real strengthened 22 percent this year on market optimism over Rousseff's impeachment.
""The challenges in front of the new economic team are big. All the bets are on investments, given that family consumption, government spending and exports tend to have a neutral effect in the best-case scenario,"" Andre Perfeito, chief economist at Gradual Investimentos, said in a note.

Brazil's gross domestic product fell 3.8 percent from a year earlier, according to IBGE.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 1.3 percent to 111.3, the second highest reading in over a decade. 
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's implied a pickup in home resales after they declined 3.2 percent in July. Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 0.6 percent last month. 
Demand for housing is being driven by the labor market, which is steadily generating steady increases in wages as it nears full employment. Data on house prices, residential construction, new home sales and home builders' confidence have been upbeat in recent months. 

Pending home sales rose 1.4 percent from a year ago. Contracts increased 0.8 percent in the Northeast and jumped 7.3 percent in the West. They gained 0.8 percent in the South, but fell 2.9 percent in the Midwest.

The National Statistics Institute said that compared to the same period of 2015, the economy expanded 0.9 percent, also tad stronger than 0.8 percent reported initially on Aug. 12.
The quarter-on-quarter change is also marginally higher than 0.2 percent growth registered in the last three months of 2015 and the first three months of this year.
Domestic demand was weak despite the Socialist government's drive to reverse austerity measures imposed by the previous administration in the hope of lifting consumption, contributing 0.2 percentage points to quarterly growth after 0.6 points in the preceding quarter.
Exports, however, had a mild positive contribution after weighing on GDP in the previous quarter, INE said.
Last year, the economy grew 1.5 percent, marking an acceleration from 0.9 percent in 2014, which was the first year of growth after a long recession and debt crisis.

This year, the Socialist government expects the economy to grow 1.8 percent, although Brussels, the International Monetary Fund and many analysts project a slowdown to just around 1 percent and warn the country may require additional budget measures to meet its deficit goals.

Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was 0.2 percent, the same rate as in July, EU's statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday in its first estimate.
The decline in energy prices was not as steep as a month earlier, but prices of food, industrial goods and of services rose by less.

Core inflation, which according to the ECB's definition excludes the most volatile components of unprocessed food and energy, was also unchanged at 0.8 percent, again 0.1 percentage points below market expectations.
The inflation rate remains far from the ECB's target of just below 2 percent and its failure to rise is bad news for the central bank which is seeking to prevent a deflationary spiral.
The ECB has been buying 80 billion euros ($89.2 billion)worth of assets a month to pump money into the economy. Interest rates have been cut below zero and free loans offered to banks.
Its rate-setting Governing Council meets next week, although most investor do not expect further policy measures until the fourth quarter.
Excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco products, the August inflation rate dipped to 0.8 percent.
Energy prices dropped by 5.7 percent year-on-year, compared with 6.7 percent in July.
Prices in food, alcohol and tobacco products went up 1.3 percent, against 1.4 percent in July.
In the services sector, the largest in the euro zone economy, prices were 1.1 percent higher year-on-year, from 1.2 percent in the previous month.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2016 03:50AM ET</span>","UK house prices rise, consumers regain some confidence after Brexit hit","LONDON (Reuters) - British house price rises picked up speed in August and households recovered some confidence which had plunged after June's Brexit vote, according to surveys that added to signs of calm among consumers after the unexpected referendum result.
However, the increase in house prices was largely driven by a shortage of homes on the market and the outlook depended on longer-term impact on the economy of the vote to leave the European Union, mortgage lender Nationwide said.
Prices rose 5.6 percent compared with the same month last year, faster than July's 5.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected house prices to rise 4.8 percent.
In monthly terms, house prices rose by 0.6 percent, from a rise of 0.5 percent in July.
""The pick-up in price growth is somewhat at odds with signs that housing market activity has slowed in recent months,"" Nationwide economist Robert Gardner said. 
The Bank of England said on Tuesday that mortgage approvals in July fell to their lowest level since January 2015.
Gardner also said demand for housing had fallen, hit by the introduction in April of a new tax on homes bought by landlords, but the drop appeared to have been matched by weak numbers of homes being put up for sale.
""What happens next on the demand side will be determined, to a large extent, by the outlook for the labor market and confidence amongst prospective buyers,"" he said.
A survey published earlier on Wednesday showed consumer morale in August recovered some of its post-Brexit slump.
Market research firm GfK said its gauge of consumer confidence rose to -7 in August from -12 in July, when it suffered its sharpest drop in over 26 years. But August's level was still the second-lowest since early 2014.
The improvement was in keeping with recent data suggesting consumers have remained resilient after the June 23 referendum, even though there have been some indications that they are more reluctant to make big purchases than before the referendum.

""While material uncertainty remains, the modest rise in confidence suggests that households do not expect a worst-case scenario,"" economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note to clients. ""That said, lower confidence with respect to before the vote remains broadly consistent with our macro scenario of consumer spending slowing materially but gradually next year.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Growth in Japan's industrial output ground to a halt in July after June's gains, underscoring the fragility of factory activity and the continuing challenge to policymakers grappling with a stalling economy.
The flat reading compared with economists' median estimate in a Reuters poll of a 0.8 percent increase, following a 2.3 percent increase in June, data by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed on Wednesday. 
Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to rise 4.1 percent in August and decline 0.7 percent in September.
""July output data was a little weak and it suggested factory activity was stalling,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. ""Output may temporarily rise in the current quarter as effects of Kumamoto earthquakes fade.""
The economy will return to growth in the current quarter but the momentum would not last long as falling capital spending in the United States and slowing growth in China weighed on Japan's exports and output for the rest of the year, he said.
Sluggish factory output data is yet another setback for policymakers who have struggled to generate virtuous growth in consumption and production to lift an economy mired in nearly two decades of deflation and stagnation, without much success. 
The ministry maintained its assessment on industrial output, saying production was seesawing but a pickup was seen in some parts.
By sector, transport equipment, electronic parts and devices grew in July, while chemicals and fabricated metals fell as reaction to the prior month's gains, a ministry official said.
""We kept the assessment unchanged given that output turned flat while inventory adjustment made a steady progress and production plans suggest stable rises ahead,"" he added.
Growth in Japan's economy, the world's third largest, stalled in April-June, and analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest due to weak global demand and a strong yen that undermines exports and capital expenditure.
With the economy stalling and price growth well short of the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target, a majority of economists expect the central bank to ease policy further next month alongside a planned review of its existing stimulus programme.

The government, for its part, is set to roll out economic stimulus featuring 13.5 trillion yen ($132 billion) in fiscal measures for public works and other spending to spur economic growth.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's industrial output rebounded by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 percent in July from June, data showed on Wednesday, beating market expectations as production of electronic components and cars boosted activity.
The median forecast in a Reuters survey of analysts was for output to decline 0.6 percent from June.
The June reading was revised to a 0.4 percent fall from May, down from a preliminary 0.2 percent decline estimated earlier.
""Temporary factors played a big part in today's numbers as we saw liquid crystal display exports rise because of the Olympic Games,"" a finance ministry official told reporters after the data was issued. 
Electronic parts production rose 6.4 percent on-month in July while car output gained 3.7 percent over the period.
""Exports have been improving at a very slow pace but that has also been aiding production,"" he added.
August exports data is due on Thursday. The same Reuters poll projected a 0.6 percent rise, which would be the first gain in 19 months.
Moon Jung-hui, an analyst at KB Investment & Securities said he expected to see mild gains in output until year-end but the pace of improvement would be fairly slow.
On an annual basis, industrial output gained 1.6 percent, improving from a revised 0.8 percent increase from June.
The average factory operation rate in July was 73.8 percent, a 4-month high.
Meanwhile, service sector output declined 0.7 percent from a month earlier, slipping from a 1.0 percent gain in June and breaking a five-month rising run. 

It was the first and worst fall since a 1.2 percent drop in January this year, but the finance ministry official said the decline was on base effects and services were expected to keep improving.

Market research firm GfK said its gauge of consumer confidence rose to -7 in August from -12 in July, when it suffered its sharpest drop in over 26 years. But August's level was still the second-lowest since early 2014. 
The improvement was in keeping with recent data suggesting consumers have remained resilient after the June 23 referendum, even though there have been some indications that they are more reluctant to make big purchases than before the referendum.
GfK's index measuring major purchases rose to +7 from -2 in July.
The survey was conducted between Aug. 1 and 16, after Theresa May calmed the political fallout from the Brexit vote by taking over as prime minister. It also covered the period after the Bank of England cut interest rates on Aug. 4 as part of an aggressive stimulus package.
""We're reporting some recovery in the index this month as consumers settle into the new wait-and-see reality of a post-Brexit, pre-exit UK,"" Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said.
""The uptick in confidence is driven by good news from hard data, the combination of historic low interest rates matched with falling prices and high levels of employment.""
Official data has shown retail sales jumped last month and there was no immediate sign of a big hit to employment.
Expectations for the general economic situation over the next 12 months improved to -22 from -33 in July but remained down from +3 a year ago.

Britain has yet to trigger formal exit talks and to start formal negotiations on its new relationship with the EU, something which is only likely to be resolved in 2019 or later.

The Bank of Korea's manufacturing business survey index (BSI) for September stood at a seasonally adjusted 77, compared with 73 for August.
It was the highest reading since the index stood at 80 in March 2015.
An index reading below 100 indicates that the number of companies that expect business conditions to deteriorate in the following month outnumbers those seeing improvement.
The index has remained below 100 since January 2011.
The outlook for future business sentiment rose for all respondents, especially for exporters and conglomerates.
A sub-index showed sentiment improving over a majority of indexes including exports, production and production equipment.

On Tuesday, a Reuters poll showed exports in August are expected to rebound into positive territory for the first time in 19 months, mainly aided by smartphone exports and two more working days this year.

In a report, the Conference Board, a market research group, said its index of consumer confidence increased to to 101.1 this month from a reading of 96.7 in July, whose figure was revised from a previously reported 97.3. August’s reading was its highest since September 2015.
Analysts had expected the index to slip to 97.0 in August.
The Present Situation Index rose from 118.8 to 123.0, while the Expectations Index improved from 82.0 last month to 86.4.
Commenting on the report, director of The Conference Board Consumer Research Center Lynn Franco said, “Consumers’ assessment of both current business and labor market conditions was considerably more favorable than last month.”
Franco indicated that short-term expectations regarding business and employment conditions, as well as personal income prospects, also improved, suggesting the possibility of a moderate pick-up in growth in the coming months.
The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a probability-design random sample, is conducted for The Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch. The cutoff date for the preliminary results was August 18.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Economic sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell in August to its lowest level since March, a further indication that morale is weakening after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
The European Commission's euro zone Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) fell to 103.5 in August from 104.5 in July, its lowest level since March and well below the 104.1 forecast in a Reuters poll of 38 economists. Estimates ranged from 103.0 to 104.9.
Confidence fell in four of the euro zone's five largest economies, with the exception of France where the index rose slightly in August.
""While the impact of Brexit on euro zone survey data had been muted so far, businesses have now caught up to a combination of Italian banking problems, the Brexit vote and geopolitical worries,"" ING economists said in a note.
Britain voted to leave the European Union in a June 23 referendum, though the terms of the exit are still to be negotiated, adding to the economic uncertainty.
In Italy, where the banking system is struggling with 360 billion euros in bad loans, confidence fell to an 18-month low.
The data adds to the worries of the European Central Bank, which is set to meet on Thursday next week.
""The general weakness of ESI across the euro zone suggests that more fundamental forces are weighing on growth, such as the fading boost from previous declines in oil prices and the euro exchange rate,"" economists at Capital Economics wrote.
The ECB has cut rates deep into negative territory, given banks free loans and is buying 80 billion euros worth of assets per month, but inflation has hovered near zero and is likely to undershoot its 2 percent target for at least two more years.
Morale among industry managers fell to -4.4, as the assessment of current order books fell at its sharpest level since February 2009. 
Confidence among managers in the services sector also dropped to 10.0, caused by a fall in demand expectations.
The Commission's business climate indicator fell to low of almost three years of 0.02 from 0.38 in July.
""Managers' assessments of past production, the level of overall and export order books deteriorated markedly,"" the Commission said in a statement accompanying the numbers.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese household spending fell less than expected in July and the jobless rate hit a two-decade low, offering some hope for policymakers battling to pull the world's third-largest economy out of stagnation.
But with the economy barely growing and inflation sliding further away from the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target, a majority of economists expect the bank to ease further next month, when it conducts a comprehensive review of the effects of its existing stimulus program.
Household spending fell 0.5 percent in July from a year earlier, less than a median market forecast for a 0.9 percent drop and much smaller than a 2.3 percent decline in June, data from the Internal Affairs Ministry showed on Tuesday.
Separate data showed retail sales slid 0.2 percent in July from a year earlier, less than a median market forecast for a 0.9 percent drop.
The jobless rate fell to 3.0 percent in July from 3.1 percent in June, hitting the lowest rate in more than 21 years and hovering near levels considered to be full employment.
""Consumption is showing signs of a pickup, though it's too early to judge whether the trend has changed,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""While today's data may encouraging for the BOJ, that doesn't necessarily mean it can stand pat as inflation remains weak,"" he said.
Japan's economy ground to a halt in April-June and analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as weak global growth and the yen's 20 percent rise against the dollar this year hurt exports and capital expenditure.
Consumption has stagnated even as a shrinking working-age population and gradual improvements in the economy led to a tightening job market, as companies remain wary of boosting wages for permanent workers for fear of irreversibly increasing fixed costs.
That reluctance has proved a hindrance for policymakers struggling to end two decades of deflation with aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus measures, hoping these policies would spur expectations of future inflation and prompt households to spend more now rather than save.
Despite three years of heavy money printing by the BOJ, soft household spending and a strong yen pushing down import costs have kept inflation distant from the bank's 2 percent target.

Core consumer prices fell in July by the most in more than three years as more firms delayed price hikes due to weak consumption, keeping the BOJ under pressure to expand an already massive stimulus program.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased for a fourth straight month in July amid strong demand for automobiles, pointing to a pickup in economic growth that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.
Monday's report from the Commerce Department came several days after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the case for raising rates had strengthened in recent months. Low inflation, however, suggests the U.S. central bank could wait until its December policy meeting before raising borrowing costs.
""This report is a mixed bag for the Fed. While the consumer sector is continuing to advance solidly, progress towards the Fed's inflation mandate has stalled,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut. ""It strengthens the case for an increase in interest rates, but does not suggest an urgency for policymakers to act in September.""
The Commerce Department said that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.3 percent last month after a 0.5 percent gain in June.
July's increase was in line with economists' expectations. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending also rose 0.3 percent in July after advancing 0.4 percent in June.
That suggests consumer spending retained much of its momentum from the second quarter, when it grew at a 4.4 percent annual rate, the fastest pace in nearly two years. The jump helped to mitigate some of the impact of a sharp inventory drop and prolonged business investment downturn.
The economy grew at a lackluster 1.1 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
July's upbeat consumer spending data lifted the dollar (DXY) against a basket of currencies. Wall Street rose, boosted by gains in financial stocks. U.S. Treasuries were trading higher. 
Yellen told a gathering of global central bankers last week that ""solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation"" had bolstered the argument for raising interest rates in recent months.
The Fed hiked interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held them steady this year amid concerns over persistently low inflation.
TAME INFLATION
Financial markets are currently pricing in a 30 percent chance of a rate increase at the Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting and a 57.2 percent probability at the December meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
Last month's consumer spending report added to data on the goods trade deficit, industrial production, durable goods orders and residential construction that have pointed to an acceleration in economic growth early in the third quarter.
The Atlanta Fed is currently estimating the economy to grow at an annual pace of 3.5 percent in the third quarter.
Consumer spending is being driven by a tightening labor market, which is steadily lifting wages. Rising home values and stock prices, which are boosting household wealth, are also supporting consumption. 
Last month, there was little sign of inflation even as consumer spending firmed. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, edged up 0.1 percent after a similar gain in June.
In the 12 months through July the core PCE increased 1.6 percent. It has risen by the same margin every month since March. The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target.
""We remain of the view that services inflation will continue to be firm, but some of its strength will likely be offset by the other components of the PCE basket, leading overall inflation to increase at a moderate pace,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington. 
Consumer spending last month was lifted by a 1.6 percent surge in purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods such as automobiles. Spending on services rose 0.4 percent, but outlays on non-durable goods slipped 0.5 percent. 
Personal income increased 0.4 percent in July after rising 0.3 percent in June. Wages and salaries advanced 0.5 percent. Savings rose to $794.7 billion from $776.2 billion in June.

""We would look at today's higher savings ... as creating room for spending to run a bit hotter than income in future months,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

The core PCE price index rose at an annualized rate of 1.6%, surprising analysts who had expected it to ease to 1.5%. The number has held steady at 1.6% since March.
The Federal Reserve uses core PCE as a tool to help determine whether to raise or lower interest rates, with the aim of keeping inflation at a rate of 2% or below.

992,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2016 07:54AM ET</span>",Greek economy grows in second quarter but strong rebound elusive,"By George Georgiopoulos
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy grew modestly in the second quarter but weak demand and scant investment mean a strong rebound after years of recession remains elusive a year after the country nearly crashed out of the euro. 
Data released on Monday showed the 176 billion euro ($196.8 billion) economy expanded by 0.2 percent in April to June, slightly less than a previous estimate of 0.3 percent due to weaker consumer spending and net exports. It was the first quarter-on-quarter expansion since late 2015 and followed a 0.2 percent contraction in Q1.
Facing a second bailout review entailing an unpopular loosening of labor laws in the autumn, Athens is keen to show a fatigued electorate that painful taxation and pension cuts that came with last year's 86 billion euro bailout deal will bear fruit and lead to economic recovery.
But kickstarting growth to bring down an unemployment rate of nearly 24 percent, the highest in the euro zone, is a challenge as a fiscal straightjacket to attain budget surpluses of 3.5 percent of economic output weighs on economic activity. 
Jaded by years of austerity, Greeks were unimpressed by Monday's figures.
""The GDP turnaround in the second quarter doesn't mean a thing for us in retail trade, there is no liquidity in the market,"" said Antonis Papadakis, 60, a clothing wholesaler who has seen his sales fall 70 percent during the debt crisis years.
The data showed Greece's economy shrank 0.9 percent on an annual basis in the second quarter, more than a flash estimate of -0.7 percent, with economists expecting a mild recession for the year as a whole. 
""We had a downward revision but it is encouraging that GDP recorded positive growth on a quarterly basis,"" said Eurobank economist Platon Monokroussos.
""Overall, a milder than initially expected contraction in the first half points to a full year GDP decline of close to 0.5 percent or slightly better.""
The European Commission and Greece's central bank project a 0.3 percent economic contraction this year while the OECD sees a milder 0.2 percent decline. Rating agencies Moody's and S&P are more pessimistic, expecting the economy to shrink 0.7 percent and 1.0 percent respectively.
The EU sees the economy rebounding by 2.7 percent in 2017.
Looking at the components of gross domestic product, the year-on-year decline in economic output was due to a further weakening of private consumption and a slightly negative contribution from net exports.
Consumption declined 0.2 percent in the second quarter from Q1 and by 1.9 percent year-on-year. Imports fell 0.4 percent and exports decreased by 1.0 percent, while gross capital formation increased 1.0 percent from the previous quarter.
""Despite the revision, the figures are in line with expectations for a recovery in the second half of the year, unless there is a further slump in private consumption,"" said National Bank economist Nikos Magginas.
For others, the small pickup in growth may be too little, too late. ""What rebound? I'm ready to kill myself,"" said Tassos Sidiropoulos, a street vendor selling dry nuts in central Athens.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's retail sales fell for the 17th straight month in July, hurt by fewer big-spending tourists, persistently weak consumer sentiment and a strong local dollar.
China's slowdown has depressed business activity in Hong Kong, well known as one of Asia's shopping paradises, and the city has posted more than a year of declining tourist arrivals as mainland visitors sought out other Asian destinations, including Japan and South Korea, which offered cheaper travel options.
Retail sales in July slid 7.7 percent from a year earlier to HK$34.6 billion ($4.46 billion) in value terms, easing from an 8.9 percent decline in June. In volume terms, July sales dropped 8.5 percent, government data showed on Monday.
""The performance in July was mainly dragged by the fall in visitor spending on some big-ticket items, and also reflected the more cautious local consumer sentiment amid an uncertain economic outlook,"" the Hong Kong government said in a statement.
""Looking ahead, the near-term outlook for retail sales will continue to depend on the performance of inbound tourism and on whether the various external uncertainties would affect local consumer sentiment.""
Hong Kong received around 200 tours a day during the first half of the year, about half of what it received in the same period a year ago, said David Luk, vice chairman of Hong Kong Inbound Travel Association. Luk, however, said he expects an improvement in the second half as the economy stabilises.
The Hong Kong Tourism Board has not yet released tourism figures for July.
Uncertainty due to Britain's vote to leave the European Union is expected to weaken the British pound and other European currencies, making Hong Kong an even more expensive destination.
The city is struggling with mounting economic challenges at a time when its currency is strong. The Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback means it is prone to strengthen when other Asian currencies weaken.
Sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts in July fell 26.2 percent in value terms, the 23rd consecutive month of decline. Department store sales slid 6.9 percent on the year.
Italian luxury goods maker Prada SpA (HK:1913) said on Friday its first-half net profit fell 24.7 percent as Chinese consumers developed a taste for cheaper brands amid slowing economic growth and a Beijing clampdown on lavish spending by officials. [nL3N1B73QJ]

Profits in July rose 11.0 percent to 523.01 billion yuan, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said, the fastest growth rate since March.
""Although the growth in industrial profits has accelerated, we still haven't seen an obvious pick up in demand in the market,"" NBS official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data.
He said challenges posed to strong industrial profit growth include rising management costs and the costs of tackling overcapacity.
Total profits for the January-July period rose 6.9 percent from the same period a year earlier, compared with a 6.2 rise in the first half of this year.
Profits in the mining sector fell 77 percent from the same period a year earlier while manufacturing profits rose 12.8 percent.
Chinese industrial firms' liabilities at the end of July were 4.5 percent higher than at the same point last year.

The data covers large enterprises with annual revenues of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.

997,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2016 12:12PM ET</span>","Declining inventories crimp U.S. second-quarter growth, consumer spending surges","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth was slightly more tepid than initially thought in the second quarter as businesses aggressively ran down inventories, offsetting a spurt in consumer spending. 
Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.1 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its second estimate of GDP. That was modestly down from the 1.2 percent rate it reported last month and also reflected more imports than previously estimated as well as weak government spending.
""The very slight downward revision to second-quarter GDP growth isn't too concerning, especially given that the more recent data point to a strong rebound in the third quarter,"" said Steve Murphy, an economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The economy has made a strong start to the third quarter with the goods trade deficit narrowing sharply and residential construction rising in July. Demand for manufactured capital goods surged in July, indicating the prolonged downtrend in business spending is abating.
While retail sales were weak in July, a buoyant labor market should continue to support consumer spending. Growth is also expected to get a boost from businesses restocking warehouses after liquidating inventories in the second quarter. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting third-quarter GDP rising at a 3.4 percent rate. The economy expanded at a 0.8 percent pace in the first quarter. It grew 1.0 percent in the first half of 2016. 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen struck an upbeat note on the economy on Friday when she addressed the annual global central bankers' gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Yellen said she believed the case for raising interest rates had been strengthened in recent months by the ""solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation.""
The U.S. central bank hiked interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held them steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation. Most economists expect another rate hike in December.
U.S. stocks were trading lower, while the dollar was up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries were little changed.
PROFITS FALLS
The government also reported that after-tax corporate profits fell at a 2.4 percent rate last quarter after increasing at an 8.1 percent pace in the first quarter. Weak profits could limit an anticipated rebound in business spending. 
With profits declining, an alternative measure of growth, gross domestic income, or GDI, increased at only a 0.2 percent rate in the second quarter, the weakest since the first quarter of 2013. GDI measures the economy's performance from the income side. It increased at a 0.8 percent pace in the first quarter.
Some economists said declining profits and business spending argued against the Fed raising interest rates.
""There is, to be clear, no recession on the horizon but the data also appear to reject the notion of growth accelerating into a need for higher interest rates from the Fed,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at M Science in New York.
""There is good reason for why interest rates are so low. It isn't just because of the Fed, there is a weaker demand for capital at play as well. As such, attempts by the Fed to raise rates will be met with slower growth.""
Investment in inventories in the second quarter dropped a steeper $12.4 billion, instead of the $8.1 billion reported last month. That was the first decline since the third quarter of 2011 and resulted in inventories slicing off 1.26 percentage points from GDP growth, the largest drag in more than two years. 
The hit from inventories was previously estimated to be 1.16 percentage points. It was the fifth straight quarter that inventories weighed on output. Economists say some of the inventory drawdown could be attributed to robust consumption.
Consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose at a brisk a 4.4 percent rate -- the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2014, instead of the previously reported 4.2 percent rate.
Though a second report on Friday showed an ebb in consumer sentiment in August as younger households worried about rising expenses, Americans were upbeat about the economy's prospects.
Some of the rise in demand in the second quarter was met with imports, which were revised to show them increasing rather than declining. Combined with a modest downward revision to exports, trade contributed one-tenth of a percentage point to GDP growth in the second quarter instead of 0.23 percentage point as reported last month.
Business investment was also weaker than initially estimated amid downward revisions to spending on equipment and nonresidential structures, which include oil and gas wells.
Business spending has declined for three straight quarters, hurt in part by lower oil prices, which have squeezed profits in the energy sector. 
""The key factor behind the weak investment numbers, the collapse in drilling, is fading, so capital spending may grow in the third quarter,"" said Patrick Newport, an economist at 

IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2016 08:43AM ET</span>",U.S. second-quarter growth trimmed to 1.1 percent; consumer spending raised,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth was a bit more sluggish than initially thought in the second quarter as businesses aggressively ran down stocks of unsold goods, offsetting a spurt in consumer spending.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.1 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its second estimate of GDP. That was slightly down from the 1.2 percent rate reported last month.
The revision also reflected more imports than previously estimated as well as weak spending by state and local governments. The economy grew at a 0.8 percent pace in the first quarter. It grew 1.0 percent in the first half of 2016.
The revision to second-quarter GDP growth was in line with economists' expectations. The economy has struggled to regain momentum since output started slowing in the last six months of 2015, which puts it in danger of stalling.
While data so far for the third quarter has been mixed, a strong labor market should continue to support consumer spending and underpin growth in the coming quarters. Output will also likely get a boost as businesses restock warehouses after liquidating inventories in the second quarter.
The government also reported that after-tax corporate profits fell at a 2.4 percent rate last quarter after increasing at an 8.1 percent pace in the first quarter. Weak profits could limit an anticipated rebound in business spending.
With profits declining, an alternative measure of growth, gross domestic income, or GDI, increased at only a 0.2 percent rate in the second quarter, the weakest since the first quarter of 2013. GDI measures the economy's performance from the income side. It increased at a 0.8 percent pace in the first quarter.
Business inventories fell $12.4 billion in the second quarter, the first drop since the third quarter of 2011, instead
of the $8.1 billion reported last month.
As a result inventories sliced off 1.26 percentage points from GDP growth, the largest drag in more than two years, and up from the 1.16 percentage points subtraction in last month's estimate.
It was the fifth straight quarter that inventories weighed on output. Economists say some of the inventory drawdown could partially be attributed to robust consumption.
Consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised up to show it increased at a 4.4 percent rate -- the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2014. Consumer spending, which was previously reported to have
advanced at a 4.2 percent rate, accounted for the bulk of the rise in output last quarter.
With consumption accelerating, imports were revised to show them growing at a 0.3 percent rate instead of declining at a 0.4 percent rate. There was also a modest downward revision to export growth. As a result, trade contributed one-tenth of a percentage point to GDP growth in the second quarter instead of 0.23 percentage point as reported last month.
Business spending on equipment fell at a 3.7 percent rate and not the 3.5 percent pace reported last month. Business spending on equipment contracted for a third consecutive quarter, the longest stretch since the 2007-2009 recession, though the pace of decline slowed.
Business spending has been hurt by cheap oil, which has squeezed profits in the energy sector, forcing companies to cut capital spending budgets. There are signs that the worst of the decline is probably over, with a report on Thursday showing demand for manufactured capital goods rising in July for a second straight month.
There were also downward revisions to investment in nonresidential structures, which include oil and gas wells.
Residential construction spending estimates were also trimmed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's consumers and businesses showed no sign of reining in their spending ahead of the country's Brexit vote in June, official data showed on Friday, adding to signs that the economy went into the referendum in strong shape.
Households increased their spending by the most since before the financial crisis in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said.
The data also showed investment by businesses unexpectedly rose between April and June - a period which mostly covered the run-up to the shock decision by voters to leave the European Union on June 23 - compared with the previous three months.
""Our survey returns, which include the period leading up to and immediately following the referendum, show no sign so far of uncertainty having significantly affected investment or GDP,"" Joe Grice, ONS chief economist, said in a statement.
Gross domestic product rose by 0.6 percent in the second quarter and was up by 2.2 percent compared with the same period last year, in line with preliminary readings and with forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
There have been signs that Britain's economy did not suffer an immediate sharp slowdown after the Brexit vote, mostly thanks to continued spending by consumers.
But the April-June growth rate is widely expected to be a peak compared with the coming quarters because Britain's economy is likely to slow sharply, or possibly even fall into recession, as a result of the Brexit vote, economists say.
The ONS data showed that during the second quarter the economy was its strongest in April before remaining flat in may and June.
HOUSEHOLD SPENDING JUMPS
Spending by households, who drove Britain's economic recovery over the past three years, rose by 0.9 in the three months to June compared with the first quarter, the strongest increase since the July-September period of 2014, the ONS said.
In annual terms, a 3.0 percent increase in household spending was the strongest rise since the end of 2007.
Business investment increased by 0.5 percent on the quarter, confounding expectations in the Reuters poll for a fall and reversing a decrease in the first three months of the year.
In year-on-year terms, business investment was down 0.8 percent, matching a similar fall in the first quarter. It was the first consecutive fall in business investment in annual terms over two quarters since late 2009 and early 2010.
The Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund said earlier this year there were signs that uncertainty about the Brexit referendum was weighing on investment.
Some major investors in Britain, such as carmaker Nissan, have said their investment plans will hinge on the country's future trading arrangements, but others have pressed ahead with expansion and takeovers.
The ONS data showed trade dragged on overall economic growth in Britain in the April-June period but there have been signs that the post-referendum slump in the value of the pound is giving exporters some help.

A survey published this week showed manufacturers' export orders rising at their fastest pace in two years in August.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2016 06:50AM ET</span>","Euro zone lending picks up, easing pressure on ECB to act","By Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lending to euro zone companies and households grew steadily in July, suggesting the region's modest economic recovery remains on track after the Brexit vote and easing pressure on the ECB to provide more stimulus.
Loans to companies rose 1.9 percent year-on-year in July, up from 1.7 percent a month earlier and the fastest rate in five years, European Central Bank data showed. Household lending grew by 1.8 percent, matching a June reading that was revised up from 1.7 percent.
The data, which follows largely encouraging economic output and survey readings since Britain voted to leave the EU on June 23, adds to the case for the ECB to refrain from further policy easing at its next rate-setting meeting on Sept. 8.
Euro zone lending has been growing since mid-2014, when the ECB started charging banks for hoarding cash and began fleshing out its bond-buying programme in a bid to kick-start inflation and economic growth.
While credit to households, and particularly mortgagees, had been driving the recovery so far, loans to companies picked up the baton in July, an encouraging sign if that money then translates to more hiring and investment.
But the post-Brexit referendum mood among the euro zone's business community is far from uniformly positive, with Germany's benchmark Ifo survey on Thursday showing an unexpectedly sharp deterioration in August.
PICTURE STILL MIXED
The ECB cut interest rates and expanded its asset-purchase programme in March to spur lending and inflation but has kept a steady course since.
Market analysts have been expecting the ECB to extend the money printing scheme again, possibly as early as next week, beyond its current end-date of March 2017. Its President Mario Draghi said the bank was ready to ease its policy again if needed.
So far, the pick-up in lending has yet to revive consumer price growth, the ECB's ultimate goal, with inflation hovering near zero for over a year, well short of the bank's target of just under 2 percent.
And while largely positive, Friday's data showed a decline in the annual growth rate of M3, a measure of money circulating in the euro zone that is often an indicator of future economic activity.
M3 growth fell to 4.8 percent from 5 percent in June. To see a chart: http://reut.rs/1T8MhEO
The slowdown was mainly due to higher ""net external assets"". This means euro zone banks and money market funds held more foreign currencies and securities than foreign institutions did euros and securities denominated in the single currency.

Growth in M3 - which includes deposits with longer maturities, holdings in money market funds and some debt securities - peaked at 5.4 percent in April 2015 and has hovered around 5 percent since.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's consumer prices fell in July by the most in more than three years as more firms delayed price hikes due to weak consumption, keeping the central bank under pressure to expand an already massive stimulus program.
The gloomy data reinforces a dominant market view that premier Shinzo Abe's stimulus program have failed to dislodge the deflationary mindset prevailing among businesses and consumers.
The nationwide core consumer price index, which excludes volatile fresh food prices but includes oil products, fell 0.5 percent in July from a year earlier, the fifth straight month of declines, data showed on Friday. It exceeded a median forecast for a 0.4 percent decline and June's 0.4 percent drop.
While falling energy costs were mainly behind the slide in consumer prices, rises in imported food prices and hotel room rates moderated in a sign that weak consumption is discouraging firms from passing on rising costs.
A strong yen also pushed down import costs, offering few justifications for retailers to raise prices of their goods.
""While economic activity is on the mend, the slump in import prices suggests that underlying inflation will continue to fall in coming months,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""The Bank of Japan will find it increasingly difficult to blame falling energy prices for the decline in overall consumer prices.""
Underscoring Japan's sticky deflationary mindset, the ratio of goods and services making up CPI that saw prices rise from a year earlier fell to 60.2 percent in July from 62.3 percent in June.
Saori Ito, a 34-year-old mother who works at a cosmetics company, said she buys a week's worth of groceries together over the weekend so she buys only what she needs.
""I try to absolutely scrap unnecessary spending. That's my stance on buying clothes too,"" she said.
NO EXIT IN SIGHT
Despite three years of heavy money printing by the BOJ, weak household spending and a strong yen pushing down import costs have kept inflation distant from the bank's 2 percent target.
A majority of economists expect the BOJ to ease further next month, when it conducts a comprehensive review of the effects of its existing stimulus program.
A separate indicator compiled by the BOJ that strips away the effect of both energy and fresh food costs showed consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in the year to July, slower than a 0.7 percent annual increase in the previous month.
Markets are focusing on how the BOJ's assessment next month of its stimulus program, which combines negative interest rates with a huge asset buying, could affect the direction of monetary policy.
""Given how prices are behaving and how the BOJ is asked to cooperate with Abe to beat deflation, it's very hard to think the BOJ will unwind stimulus any time soon,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Instead, the September analysis will probably lay the grounds for a deepening of negative interest rates.""
Japan's economic growth ground to a halt in April-June and analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as weak global growth and the yen's 20 percent rise against the dollar this year hurt exports and capital expenditure.
Analysts expect consumer prices to pick up in or around early next year as the downward pressure from energy costs wanes, though any rebound may be tempered by soft consumption and a strong yen pressing down on the cost of imports.

Starting from this release, the government changed the base year for the price indices to 2015 and changed the components making up the indices to better reflect consumer spending trends, in an overhaul it conducts once every five years.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2016 11:48AM ET</span>",Upbeat U.S. factory data suggests business spending stabilizing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. manufactured capital goods rose for a second straight month in July as demand for machinery and a range of other products picked up, offering a tentative sign that a business spending downturn was starting to ease.
The economic outlook also was boosted by another report on Thursday showing an unexpected drop in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week, indicating sustained labor market strength.
Together, the data support the view that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Fed Chair Janet Yellen could give guidance on the near-term outlook for U.S. monetary policy when she speaks on Friday at a global central bankers' conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
""This kind of data are consistent with what the Fed is looking for in terms of the labor market and economic growth. If we get more data like this, that will suggest we are likely to see an interest rate increase, most likely in December,"" said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC). 
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 1.6 percent last month, the largest gain since January. 
These so-called core capital goods orders advanced 0.5 percent in June. The rise in July marked the first back-to-back gain since January 2015. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising only 0.3 percent last month.
There were hefty increases in orders for machinery, primary metals, fabricated metal products, computers and electronic products, as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors were focusing on Yellen's upcoming speech. The dollar (DXY) was trading marginally lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks were largely unchanged. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell slightly.
The U.S. central bank raised interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held them steady so far in 2016 amid concerns over persistently low inflation. Most economists expect another rate hike in December. 
After contracting since the fourth quarter of 2015, business investment has caught the attention of Fed officials, with some viewing it as posing a downside risk to economic growth. Investment has declined in part as companies slashed capital spending budgets in response to lower oil prices.
That in turn put pressure on manufacturing, which has also been undercut by a strong dollar, weak global demand and a U.S. inventory correction. July's increase in core capital goods orders followed a rise in oil and gas drilling activity in recent months.
SOFT BUSINESS SPENDING 
Still, business investment is likely to be tepid in the third quarter amid uncertainty over the global economy after Britain's decision to leave the European Union and ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, economists say.
""The solid gains in the last two months set the stage for capital spending to become a net contributor to growth again in the second half of the year,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.
""The potential softening in the euro zone economy following the Brexit vote may, at the margin, limit the extent of the comeback of capital spending in the U.S."" 
Heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) last month lowered its 2016 forecast, citing sluggish demand in mining and other industries. Weak business spending contributed to holding down economic growth to 1.0 percent in the first half of 2016.
With demand for core capital goods orders rising briskly last month, overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - surged 4.4 percent in July. Durable goods inventories rose last month after six straight months of decline. 
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, fell 0.4 percent last month after decreasing 0.5 percent in June. 
But labor market strength should support consumer spending and cushion the blow on the economy from weak business investment. The Atlanta Fed currently forecasts the economy will grow at 3.4 percent annualized rate in the third quarter.
In a separate report on Thursday, initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 261,000 for the week ended Aug. 20. It was the third straight weekly decline in claims.
Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 265,000 in the latest week. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong labor market, for 77 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1973, when the labor market was much smaller. 

""The ongoing decline in initial claims indicates substantial underlying strength in labor markets,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""Workers are not losing their jobs in large numbers and those workers who do get laid off are likely finding employment.""

1017,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 25, 2016 09:47AM ET</span>", U.S. services PMI unexpectedly falls to 6-month low in August - Markit,"Investing.com – Activity in the U.S. services sector unexpectedly fell to a six-month low in August, according to preliminary data released on Thursday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 50.9 in August, from the prior month’s reading of 51.4.
Analysts had expected an increase to 52.0 this month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
According to the report, that was the weakest read since last February, when activity in the sector contracted.
Markit further noted that the payroll numbers expanded at the slowest pace in 20 months, although the research group said that business expectations remained stronger than the survey-record low recorded in June.
“The ongoing lacklustre economic growth signaled by the flash PMI suggests GDP growth is failing to accelerate in the third quarter from the weak 1.2% pace seen in the second quarter.” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson warned.
Williamson added that the annualized GDP growth rate would be estimated to be just under 1% for the third quarter based on the data for July and August.
Pointing to the waning job creation and subdued price pressures, he suggested that “the survey data will fuel expectations that the Fed will be in rush to tighten policy again.”
“However, as anecdotal evidence from the survey suggests that business activity is being dampened by uncertainty due to the upcoming presidential election, there’s a good chance that the economy will pick up speed again after the vote, leaving a December rate hike on the table,” Williamson concluded.

picked up, offering a tentative sign that a business spending downturn was starting to ease.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy forbusiness spending plans, increased 1.6 percent last month. That was the largest gain since January and followed an upwardly revised 0.5 percent rise in June. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have gained 0.4 percent in June. That was the first back-to-back increase since January 2015.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising only 0.3 percent last month. Business spending has contracted since the fourth quarter of 2015, in part as companies slashed capital spending budgets in response to lower oil prices. The increase in core capital goods orders comes as oil and gas drilling activity has been rising in recent months. Still, business investment is likely to be tepid in the third quarter amid uncertainty over the global economy after Britain's decision to leave the European Union and ahead of the U.S. presidential election, economists say.

A 10.5 percent jump in demand for transportation equipment lifted overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, by 4.4 percent last month. That followed a downwardly revised 4.2 percent drop in June.
Durable goods orders were previously reported to have declined 3.9 percent in June. Civilian aircraft orders surged 89.9 percent in July, but demand for automobiles was flat.
Last month, there were hefty increases in orders for machinery, primary metals, fabricated metal products, computers and electronic products, as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2016 08:00AM ET</span>",UK retailers see best sales in six months as Brexit slump fades: CBI,"By Ana Nicolaci da Costa
LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers reported their strongest sales in six months in August, industry figures showed on Thursday, adding to signs that consumers are, for now, taking the country's vote to leave the European Union in their stride.
The Confederation of British Industry said its sales volume index rose to +9, its highest since February, from an initial slump after the Brexit vote to -14 in July.
Sales in September were expected to moderate. The expected sales index was +3 for next month, up from -12 in August.
The release was in keeping with recent data showing consumers shrugging off the shock Brexit vote, with retail sales boosted by warm weather and by overseas buyers attracted by a cheaper pound.
""While the fall in sterling has boosted visitor numbers to the UK, it is likely to push up the price of imported goods over time, which will mean households will be more likely to rein back spending on non-essentials,"" Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Analysis and Surveys, said.
Price pressures in factories - which feed through into consumer prices - jumped in July as import prices rose at their fastest rate since 2011.
Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he still expected growth in overall spending to slow sharply.
""Away from the high street, there are clear signs that (consumer activity is) ...slowing down - falling new car registrations and declining mortgage approvals show households are shying away from big-ticket purchases.""
A survey on Wednesday showed the number of mortgages approved by British banks fell to its lowest in a year in July.
So far most data has shown less of a negative impact on the economy from the Brexit decision than some of the dire predictions made by supporters of remaining in the EU.
But Britain has yet to trigger the formal exit process that would start the two-year period for formal negotiations about the country's future relationship with the EU, leaving many companies uncertain about what Brexit will mean for them.
The CBI said an index of orders placed with suppliers was -7 in August, up from -34 in July and was expected to improve further next month. Investment intentions rose to +15 in August from their most recent previous reading of -13 in May.

The survey was conducted between July 27 and Aug. 12 and 131 firms took part.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale deteriorated sharply in August posting the steepest monthly drop since the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2012, a survey showed on Thursday, in a sign that Brexit has weighed more heavily on sentiment among executives.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, fell to 106.2 in August from 108.3 in July.
That was the lowest reading since February and the sharpest monthly fall since spring 2012. The headline figure came in weaker than the Reuters consensus forecast for a rise to 108.5
""Business confidence in Germany has clearly worsened,"" Ifo head Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""The German economy has fallen into a summer slump.""
A separate index measuring corporate expectations in Europe's biggest economy over a six-month horizon fell to 100.1. This was the lowest since October 2014, suggesting many firms expect economic headwinds.
""Brexit had a stronger effect now,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters, adding that business expectations deteriorated the most in sectors with relatively strong ties to the British market, such as chemicals and automobiles.
A sector breakdown showed that the weaker headline figure was driven by deteriorated sentiment in manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing.
In construction, the business climate remained at a record level, while domestic tourism boomed due to geopolitical crises abroad suggesting that the domestic economy is still doing well.
ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said the German economy's virtuous circle was still continuing. ""However, without any new structural reforms and investments, it remains a virtuous circle on steroids,"" he added.
""Not the kind of steroids that could lead to a ban from the global economy but stimulus that mainly stems from two – in Germany heatedly debated – factors: refugees and the ECB.""
A record influx of migrants has led to the strongest rise in state spending since the financial crisis in 2008. At the same time, rock-bottom interest rates continue to support private consumption and the construction sector.
The German economy grew 0.4 percent on the quarter between April and June, driven by higher exports, rising state spending and strong private consumption, after a mild winter helped it expand 0.7 percent between January and March.
The continued upswing generated a record budget surplus in the first half of this year, allowing Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble to increase state spending on roads, housing, digital infrastructure and migrants ahead of federal elections in 2017.
Berlin expects domestic demand to drive overall growth of 1.7 percent this year which would be on a par with last year.

Exports are unlikely to contribute much to overall growth as demand from major trading partners like the United States and France wanes and orders from emerging markets such as China slow.

Indec had held off on reporting key economic indicators after Macri ordered a restructuring due to suspicions it manipulated data during the government of his predecesser Cristina Fernandez.
A Reuters poll had forecast a median drop of 1.1 percent in the June EMAE economic activity index, which is a close proxy for gross domestic product. Analysts surveyed said that a downturn in construction likely drove the contraction in June. Indec did not offer a breakdown of activity by sectors.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2016 01:44PM ET</span>","U.S. existing home sales decline, prices still strong","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales fell more than expected in July after four straight months of strong gains, as a lack of inventory limited choice for buyers, but further price rises suggested the housing market remained on solid ground.
The slump in sales reported by the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday is likely to be temporary, given that a tightening labor market is steadily pushing up wages and mortgage rates are near historically low levels. 
Existing home sales declined 3.2 percent to an annual rate of 5.39 million units last month, the NAR said. It blamed the drop in sales on the dearth of properties on the market, which lifted the median house price 5.3 percent from a year ago. 
""Without a large choice, it is hard for people looking for homes to find something they want and that seems to be the problem facing the housing market,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  
Economists had forecast sales slipping 0.4 percent to a 5.51 million-unit pace in July. Home resales were down 1.6 percent from a year ago. 
A separate report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showed house prices rose 1.2 percent in the second quarter. They were up 5.6 percent from the second quarter of 2015.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with investors looking ahead to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Friday at a global central bankers' conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The broader PHLX housing index (HGX), which includes builders, building products and mortgage companies, was down 0.50 percent. 
The Fed raised interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held them steady this year amid concerns over persistently low inflation. Most economists expect another rate hike in December.
MILLENNIALS' IMPACT ON HOUSING
Economists believe that demand for housing will be driven by the so-called millennials, a demographic group that has seen an improvement in job prospects since the end of the 2007-2009 recession. Unemployment among Americans in the 25-34 age bracket has plummeted since January 2015, with the share of those holding a job at the highest level since September 2008.
First-time home buyers accounted for 32 percent of existing home transactions in July, up from 28 percent a year ago, the NAR said.
""We have been touting the upside for housing this year and the belief it will carry the economy along with consumption,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at M Science in New York. ""Our basic upside view on housing is rooted in a sufficient recovery of 25-to 34-year-olds with a job, the length of time they have been gainfully employed, and the cheap cost of a mortgage.""
The government reported on Tuesday that new home sales vaulted to a nine-year high in July.
Existing home sales fell in the Northeast, the South and the Midwest in July, but rose 2.5 percent in the West. 
Higher house prices, however, do not appear to be enticing homeowners to put their properties on the market. Economists speculate that the firming labor market has reduced the desire to move for employment reasons, reducing the number of potential sellers of homes.
The stock of homes for sale inched up 0.9 percent to 2.13 million last month, but supply was down 5.8 percent from a year ago. At July's sales pace, it would take 4.7 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, up from 4.5 months in June. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance.
Underscoring the inventory tightness, houses typically stayed on the market for 36 days in July, down from 42 days a year ago. Supply is also being squeezed as the flow of foreclosed properties dries up. 
The share of distressed property sales dropped to 5 percent in July, the smallest share since October 2008, from 6 percent in June. The NAR said rising prices were causing problems with appraisals, leading to delays in closing contracts.

""The run-up in home prices has also made it difficult for appraisers to evaluate properties,"" said Anika Khan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York. ""With many homes selling at or above asking prices, homes are often not appraising at high enough values to qualify for a mortgage, which has led to delays in closings.""

The industry data showed that home resales decreased 3.2% in July to a seasonally adjusted 5.39 million units from the 5.57 million units in June.
The consensus forecast was for a 0.4% decline to 5.51 million units.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, pointed out that existing sales fell off track in July after steadily climbing the last four months.
“Severely restrained inventory and the tightening grip it’s putting on affordability is the primary culprit for the considerable sales slump throughout much of the country last month,” he said.
Yun noted that realtors are reporting diminished buyer traffic because of the scarce number of affordable homes on the market, and the lack of supply is stifling the efforts of many prospective buyers attempting to purchase while mortgage rates hover at historical lows.
“Although home sales are still expected to finish the year at their strongest pace since the downturn, thanks to a very strong spring, the housing market is undershooting its full potential because of inadequate existing inventory combined with new home construction failing to catch up with underlying demand,” he warned.
“As a result, sales in all regions are now flat or below a year ago and price growth isn’t slowing to a healthier and sustainable pace,” Yun concluded.

Companies signed up for $7 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, the Washington-based trade group said on Monday. 
In the first seven months of 2016, total new borrowings declined 8 percent from a year earlier, said ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion U.S. equipment finance industry. 
""As the presidential campaign moves into higher gear, it appears business owners continue their wait-and-see attitude toward investment in and expansion of their business operations,"" ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement.
In July, credit approvals fell to 75.9 percent of all applications submitted from 78.1 percent in June, ELFA said.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it precedes by a few days.
The index is based on a survey of 25 lenders that include Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT), CIT Group Inc and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Deere & Co,  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and Volvo AB. 
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index rose to 54.8 in August from 52.5 in July. 

The index is an indicator of the outlook for the equipment finance market and a reading of above 50 suggests a positive outlook.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2016 01:51PM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales race to near nine-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales unexpectedly surged in July, reaching their highest level in nearly nine years amid robust demand, brightening the housing market outlook and bolstering views that economic growth will pick up in the third quarter.
Housing market strength should offset some of the drag from manufacturing, with other data on Tuesday showing production at factories remaining constrained by weak orders.
""A very rosy picture is beginning to emerge on the housing market, pointing to sustained buoyancy in the sector's recovery, which remains one of the few bright spots for the U.S. economy,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Commerce Department said new home sales jumped 12.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 654,000 units last month, the highest level since October 2007. It was the fifth straight monthly gain in new home sales.
July's increase, however, likely exaggerates housing market strength as it has not been matched by robust housing starts.
Still, sales were up 31.3 percent from a year ago. 
Economists had forecast single-family home sales, which account for about 9.6 percent of overall home sales, slipping to a rate of 580,000 units last month. July's surprise increase pushed new home sales well above their second-quarter average, pointing to sustained momentum in the market for new homes. 
The gain came mostly from homes not yet started or still under construction, suggesting a rebound in residential construction investment, which was a minor drag on economic growth in the second quarter.
Housing market strength, marked by rising home values which are boosting household wealth, is helping to buoy consumer spending, cushioning the blow to the economy from a downturn in business spending as well as an inventory correction.
Tightening labor market conditions, which are steadily lifting wages, as well as mortgage rates near historic lows are supporting housing. Reports last week showed groundbreaking on single-family housing projects rising to a five-month high in July and sentiment among homebuilders increasing in August.
Robust demand for new homes is boosting homebuilders like  Toll Brothers  (N:TOL), which on Tuesday reported a rise in revenue for the fourth straight quarter. The luxury homebuilder said it had sold more houses at higher prices.
The solid housing market is also supporting purchases of big-ticket electronics such as home theater systems, fattening profits for companies like  Best Buy  (N:BBY). The largest U.S. electronics retailer on Tuesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its earnings outlook.
RAISES NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
New home sales are likely benefiting from a chronic shortage of previously owned houses available for sale. With sales surging, the inventory of new homes on the market fell to an eight-month low in July. This means builders will need to ramp up construction activity to meet demand.
At July's sales pace it would take 4.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the fewest since June 2013, and down from 4.9 months in June. 
""This marginally raises our near-term outlook for the housing market, as tightness in the new home market suggests further impetus to new construction ahead,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
In the wake of the report, the broader PHLX housing index (HGX), which includes builders, building products and mortgage companies, rose 2.07 percent, outperforming the overall U.S. stock market. 
Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI) rallied 3.43 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) surged 3.89 percent. Toll Brothers vaulted 8.5 percent. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. 
New single-family homes sales soared 40.0 percent in the Northeast and increased 1.2 percent in the Midwest. Sales in the South, which accounts for more than half of new home sales, jumped 18.1 percent to their highest level since July 2007. Sales were flat in the West, which has seen a sharp increase in home prices amid tight inventories. 
""Momentum is finally shifting back toward the new home
market, particularly in the South, which has seen sales and new construction take off this year as job growth and in-migration have strengthened,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Separately, data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers' index slipped to a reading of 52.1 in August from July's nine-month high of 52.9. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the factory sector.
Manufacturers reported slower order growth this month, 
with some companies saying that a number of clients had adopted a wait-and-a-see approach until the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November. 
A third report from the Richmond Federal Reserve showed factory activity in the region covering Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas plummeted to its lowest level since January 2013. There were sharp contractions in new orders and order backlogs, and workers saw a reduction in hours.

""This reminds us that goods production in the economy isn't going quite as well as housing,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at M Science in New York.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2016 10:23AM ET</span>","Euro zone business growth stable in August, France surprises upwards","By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Surprisingly strong growth in France supported stable euro zone private business activity during August but factories could face a tougher September as new order growth stumbled, surveys showed on Tuesday.
Muddying the outlook for the coming months is the United Kingdom's vote in late June to leave the European Union, although so far the economic repercussions seem to have been confined to Britain, not its main trading partner.
""August's slight rise in the euro zone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index suggests that, despite shrugging off the UK's Brexit vote, economic conditions remain fairly subdued,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.
France's private sector shrugged off its neighbor's vote and accelerated to levels last seen just before the militant attacks in Paris in November, as an upturn in the service sector offset continued weakness in manufacturing.
Those attacks, and the recent one in Nice in July, hit the country's service industry - the hotel and restaurant sector in particular - and resulted in lower demand for travel to Europe. 
In France, the travel and tourism sector's contribution to GDP will grow 1.1 percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 2.9 percent, the World Travel and Tourism Council said on Monday.
Still, the brighter overall picture should alleviate fears the French economy continued to slow down this quarter after unexpectedly stagnating in the second quarter of the year.
German private sector growth slowed in August, but remained robust overall, its PMI showed, suggesting Europe's biggest economy is set to keep on expanding in the summer months after it grew more than expected in the second quarter.
Consumer confidence fell markedly again across the currency bloc in August, a sign of low morale after the British decision to leave the EU, official data showed on Tuesday.
The European Commission's flash estimate, which defied economists' forecasts of a rebound in confidence this month, showed euro zone consumer morale decreased to -8.5 in August from an unrevised -7.9 in July.
UNDER PRESSURE
Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone edged up to a seven-month high of 53.3 from July's 53.2, where any reading above 50 indicates growth. A Reuters poll of economists had predicted a slight dip to 53.1.
Markit said the PMI pointed to GDP expanding 0.3 percent this quarter, matching a Reuters poll earlier this month that showed the euro zone economic outlook stable but lacklustre, about half the speed at the start of the year.
""With underlying growth remaining muted, the ECB looks set to ease monetary policy further by year-end. After all, we do not expect inflation to increase by then either,"" economists at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) told clients. 
Pressure remains on the European Central Bank to announce more easing as it has so far been unsuccessful in getting inflation anywhere close to its 2 percent target ceiling.
It is currently at just 0.2 percent year-on-year.
But there is little confidence amongst economists about just how much firepower the ECB has left. [ECILT/EU]
Of some concern, having only trimmed their prices in July, firms returned to deeper discounting this month. The euro zone output price index fell to 49.5 from 49.8.
Discounting helped drive a PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry up to 53.1 from 52.9, also confounding expectations for a dip to 52.8. The manufacturing PMI was predicted to have held steady at July's 52.0 but fell to 51.8.
The factory output index, which feeds into the composite PMI, nudged up to an eight-month high of 54.0 from 53.9.
However, new order growth was at its weakest since early 2015, falling to 51.5 from 52.2, suggesting the headline manufacturing PMI may decline next month. 

Service firms were also less optimistic about the year ahead. The business expectations index fell to 60.2 from 60.9, its lowest reading since late 2014.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 52.1 in August from the prior month’s final reading of 52.9.
Analysts had expected a lesser decrease to 52.7 this month.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Despite the worse than expected reading, the market research group noted that production continues to rise solidly.
Although total new order growth slowed, export sales noted their fast increase in nearly two years.
On a down note for the labor market, employment expanded at its slowest pace for four months.
“The August drop in the PMI is a disappointment but less worrying when looked at in the context of July’s better than expected reading,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson commented.
“Taking the July and August readings together suggests that manufacturing is enjoying its best growth so far this year in the third quarter, and should help drive stronger GDP growth,” he added.
Nonetheless, Williamson suggested that the slowdown in overall order book growth was a warning light that domestic demand had waned this month, while the pull-back in hiring revealed manufacturers’ cautionary outlook.
“Policymakers will therefore be pleased to see signs that the economy may have picked up speed in the third quarter, but the Fed looks unlikely to tighten policy again until the upturn has stronger foundations, suggesting any interest rate rise looks unlikely before December.,” Williamson concluded.

The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.8 this month from a final reading of 52.0 in July, marking a three month low. Analysts had expected the index to remain steady at 52.0 in August.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit noted in the report that the composite reading was only slightly above the average seen throughout the year to date, suggesting that growth in the third quarter is likely to be similar to that seen in the first half of the year.
Commenting on the release, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said, ““The August flash PMI indicates that the eurozone remains on a steady growth path in the third quarter, with no signs of the recovery being derailed by ‘Brexit’ uncertainty.”
Williamson said that the data suggested that the euro zone economy was growing at a quarterly rate of 0.3% in the third quarter, or an annual rate of 1.2%.
“While the resilience of the PMI in August will add to the belief that the ECB will see no need for any immediate further stimulus, the weakness of the overall pace of expansion and disappointing trends in hiring, order books, business optimism and prices all suggest that policymakers will keep the door open for more stimulus later in the year.,” Williamson concluded.

The IHS Markit/Nikkei Japan Flash Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) edged up to 49.6 in August from a final 49.3 in July on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The headline index remained below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the sixth month, but the rate of decline was slight.
The index for output rose to a preliminary 50.6 from 49.4 in the previous month. While marginal, that would indicate the first increase since February if confirmed in revised data.
""Encouragingly, output expanded for the first time in six months, while companies also saw softer reductions in total new work and export sales,"" Annabel Fiddes, an economist at IHS Markit said.
However, new orders and export orders still declined at a significant rate, forcing Japanese manufacturers to cut prices of their goods at the sharpest pace since October 2012 to attract new business.
Japan's economic growth stalled in the second quarter as consumer spending slowed and exports contracted due to weak external demand and the impact of a stronger yen.
The cabinet this month announced an economic package with 13.5 trillion yen ($133.96 billion) in fiscal measures, hoping it would help the economy deflect external headwinds and sustain a moderate recovery.

The package focuses heavily on building new infrastructure, which could support capital expenditure and factory output next year, once various construction projects get under way, some economists say.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' mood soured in August to its lowest since 2013 when the central bank embarked on aggressive monetary easing, a Reuters poll showed, reflecting the pain caused by a rising yen and highlighting the huge task facing policymakers to generate growth.
The Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey, found the service sector's mood rose for the first time in five months, a sign of fragility rather than strength in private consumption that constitutes about 60 percent of the economy.
The monthly poll of 533 big and mid-sized firms on August 1-16, of which 275 responded, was taken just as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled new economic stimulus early this month, which appeared to have little impact on Japanese business morale.
The survey comes on the heels of data that showed the economy stalled in the second quarter as weak exports and a strong yen curbed capital expenditure.
With the yen near a seven-week high of around 100 to the dollar <JPY=>, exporters of cars and electronics complained about a profit squeeze, although a stronger currency also drives down the cost of imports.
""Domestic car sales have declined and we have suffered a foreign-exchange loss for exports due to appreciation of the yen,"" a manager at a transport equipment maker said in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
""The yen's rise helps lower the cost of imports for raw materials, but we don't feel strength in demand for our products,"" said a textiles/paper producer.
The sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 1 from 3 in July, hurt by manufacturing industries including cars, food, machinery and electronics. It was seen bouncing to 6 in November.
The sentiment indexes subtract the percentage of companies saying conditions are poor from those saying conditions are good. A positive number means optimists outnumber pessimists.
The service-sector index rose to 18 from 15 in July, reflecting gains in retailers, real estate and other services.
The index was seen rising further to 19 in November.
Abe's cabinet this month unveiled stimulus of 13.5 trillion yen ($135 billion) in fiscal measures, hoping it would help the economy counter external headwinds and sustain a recovery.

The Bank of Japan expanded monetary stimulus last month via a modest increase in purchases of risky assets and it remains under pressure to do more in September, when it conducts a comprehensive review of the effects of its stimulus program.

1085,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2016 11:44AM ET</span>",Labor market firming; factories still struggling,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, reinforcing views of labor market strength that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon.
Another report on Thursday showed a mild improvement in manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region this month amid rising shipments from factories. But weak orders and shrinking employment suggested the manufacturing malaise was far from over.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 262,000 for the week ended Aug. 13, the Labor Department said. Economists had forecast initial claims slipping to 265,000 in the latest week. 
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong labor market, for 76 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1973, when the labor market was much smaller. It is now viewed as either at or near full employment.
""The unemployment claims data point to continued low layoff rates and a solid pace of job growth,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Labor market buoyancy, marked by robust hiring in the last two months and diminishing slack, could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates despite low inflation and sluggish economic growth in the first half of the year. 
New York Fed President William Dudley, an influential policymaker at the U.S. central bank, said on Tuesday it was ""possible"" to hike rates at the Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting. 
But the minutes from the July 26-27 meeting, which were released on Wednesday, showed Fed policymakers were divided on the urgency of a rate hike amid concerns about benign inflation.
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a separate report, the Conference Board reported that a gauge of future U.S. economic activity increased in July for a second consecutive month.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) was trading lower against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. government debt edged up. U.S. stocks were trading slightly higher as oil prices rose and Wal-Mart (N:WMT) raised its profit forecast after reporting higher-than-expected quarterly earnings.
MANUFACTURING CONSTRAINED
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,500 to 265,250 last week. The claims data covered the survey week for the August nonfarm payrolls report.
The four-week moving average of claims increased 7,750 between the July and August survey periods, suggesting another month of strong job gains. The economy created 255,000 jobs in July, adding to the 292,000 positions gained in June. 
In a third report, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index gained 5 points to a reading of 2.0 in August as more companies reported an increase in shipments. August marked the third positive reading for the index this year.
But details of the survey were weak, with a measure of new orders contracting after surging in July. There were continued declines in factory employment, which fell to a seven-year low. The length of the work week declined further.
Shipments, however, rose and manufacturers were also asking higher prices for their goods while appearing to pay more for raw materials. Manufacturers were more upbeat about business prospects and capital spending in the next six months.
Manufacturing remains constrained by the delayed pass-through of the U.S. dollar's rally between June 2014 and December 2015. The sector, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has also been undermined by an inventory bloat as well as lower oil prices, which have contributed to a sharp downturn in business spending. 
There are, however, tentative signs that the energy drag on business investment could be fading. The Fed reported on Tuesday that oil and gas drilling surged in July, notching a second straight monthly gain. Oil drilling firms have increased the number of rigs in recent months. 

""We had expected improvement in the manufacturing sector following the drags from the stronger dollar and inventory correction, but regional manufacturing surveys released so far have not provided much reason for optimism on the sector,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.

While the current activity measure rose, two components tumbled, which underscored the lingering weakness in U.S. mid-Atlantic business activity.
The employment index dropped to its weakest since July 2009 to -20.0 from -1.6, while the new orders index fell to -7.2, the lowest since December, from 11.8 the prior month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shoppers in Britain shrugged off June's shock Brexit vote as retail sales jumped by much more than expected last month, adding to signs there has been little immediate hit for consumers.
Warm weather boosted clothes sales and the pound's plunge tempted overseas buyers to splash out on luxury items such as watches and jewelry, official data showed on Thursday.
These are the first official figures to shed light on how consumer demand has performed since the unexpected decision by voters to leave the European Union in the June 23 referendum.
Data released earlier this week also showed little immediate impact of the Brexit vote on the labor market but there were signs of inflation pressures building after the plunge in sterling, which could eat into the spending power of households going forward.
Sentiment surveys have shown levels of concern, but actual retail sales volumes surged 1.4 percent in July compared with June, the Office for National Statistics said, topping all forecasts in a Reuters poll that pointed to a much smaller rise of 0.2 percent.
The pound rose half a cent against the dollar and British gilt (bond) futures pared gains after the data release.
""This positive surprise is encouraging for (third quarter) growth, but with consumer confidence having plunged in the wake of Brexit and business surveys suggesting growing caution, we doubt that it is sustainable,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING.
""Inflation is starting to rise and will continue to do so due to the steep fall in sterling, meaning that real household income growth will weaken. This is likely to limit retail sales growth in coming quarters.""
BANK OF ENGLAND WATCHING
The ONS retail sales figures are volatile and Bank of England policymakers will want to see more than one month's data before drawing firm conclusions about the health of consumer spending - a key pillar of British economic recently.
""Better weather this year could be a major factor with sales of clothing and footwear doing particularly well,"" said Joe Grice, chief economic adviser at the ONS.
""There is also anecdotal evidence from respondents suggesting the weaker pound has encouraged overseas visitors to spend.""
Sales of watches and jewelry were up 16.6 percent in July compared with the same month last year - the biggest jump in nearly two years.
Major retailers including  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), Next and John Lewis say they have not been affected so far by the referendum result, while the British Retail Consortium also said spending in shops bounced in July.
But the long-running GfK survey - the main measure of consumer morale and an indicator of future household spending over the years - suffered its sharpest drop since 1990 last month.
Compared with a year earlier, July sales growth jumped to 5.9 percent, the biggest rise since September of last year and far stronger than the 4.2 percent forecast, Thursday's data showed.

The BoE more than halved its forecasts for household spending over the next two years in light of the vote to leave the EU. It now expects growth in spending of 1.0 percent and 0.75 percent in 2017 and 2018 respectively as lower growth in wages and higher inflation eat into spending power.

Euro zone prices rose 0.2 percent year-on-year, Eurostat said, confirming its initial estimate of two weeks ago. Month-on-month, prices fell 0.6 percent from June.
The annual rate remains well short of the European Central Bank's target of just below 2 percent. Until the annual figure posted a 0.1 percent rise in June, prices had not risen in the 19 countries using the euro since January.
Core inflation, which excludes the most volatile components of unprocessed food and energy, was unchanged at 0.8 percent in July. The narrower inflation indicator, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco products, rose an unchanged 0.9 percent. Both were the same as initial estimates.
Energy prices fell heavily again in July, by 6.7 percent after a 6.4 percent annual drop in June and 8.1 percent recorded in May. Month-on-month, they were 1.0 percent lower.
Prices for services, the biggest component of the euro zone economy, rose 1.2 percent year-on-year, but the biggest increase was in food, where unprocessed foodstuffs rose 2.9 percent year-on-year in July, nearly double the 1.5 percent seen in June.
Prices of fruit were 6.4 percent higher than in July last year and vegetables 5.6 percent more expensive. A 1.6 percent annual increase in prices set by restaurants and cafes was the biggest contributor to the overall euro zone inflation figure.

Nonetheless, smaller economies in the east continued to lead the dozen euro zone states which posted negative annual rates in July, notably Bulgaria and Croatia, where prices fell 1.1 percent on the year, and Slovakia, where they were down 0.9 percent. Belgium, with inflation of 2.0 percent, and Sweden, with 1.1 percent, led those economies where prices rose.

Analysts had expected retail sales to increase 0.2% last month.
The ONS noted that all sectors showed growth with the main contribution again coming from non-food stores.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports tumbled in July at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis with a resurgent yen adding to the challenge of weak external markets - leaving the economy and the government more reliant on shaky domestic demand to drive growth.
The yen edged toward a seven-week high versus the dollar, prompting bureaucrats from the Finance Ministry, the Bank of Japan and the financial regulator to hold an emergency meeting to examine the current state of the market.
Japan's top currency tsar reiterated a veiled threat to intervene in response to speculative moves, but traders say few options are available because it could be considered competitive devaluation, something the Group of Seven frowns on.
""We are constantly watching for speculative moves and will respond with the necessary steps if needed,"" Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs Masatsugu Asakawa said after the meeting.
Policymakers are in a bind.
Japan's exports have now fallen for 10 consecutive months, the longest losing streak since losses on U.S. subprime mortgages sparked a global financial crisis that crippled the U.S. financial system.
Still, intervention may be unable to stop the yen's rise as long as investors pare back expectations for U.S. interest rate hikes amid a run of spotty economic data and mixed signals from Federal Reserve officials.
In July exports fell an annual 14.0 percent, which matched the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists and was the fastest decline since October 2009.
Economists say there is a growing risk that weakness in exports will persist as global economic uncertainty shows little sign of receding, which could undermine Japanese policymakers' efforts to re-energize the economy.
""Exports do not have the strength required to lead Japan's economy,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities. ""This is a clear message that we need to support domestic demand. Government stimulus will help, but only in the short term. There could be more talk of additional monetary easing.""
Exports in July fell due to lower shipments of cars to the United States, ships to Central America and steel to Italy, the data showed.
Exports to China - Japan's largest trading partner - fell an annual 12.7 percent in July, extending the 10.0 percent decline seen in June.
U.S.-bound shipments fell 11.8 percent year-on-year, versus a 6.5 percent annual decline in the previous month.
Real exports fell 3.2 percent in July from the previous month, the fastest decline in 14 months, separate data from the Bank of Japan showed. Real imports fell 1.1 percent, the first decline in three months, the data showed.
The yen <JPY=> has risen around 20 percent versus the dollar so far this year and further gains would cut deeply into exporters' earnings and increase deflationary pressure by lowering import prices.
The volume of Japan's imports of oil and kerosene fell 8.5 percent in July, the first decline in three months, finance ministry data showed.
Recent weakness in industrial output and second-quarter data showing the economy ground to a halt suggests Japan's demand for commodities could potentially weaken further.
The BOJ said it will conduct a ""comprehensive review"" of its quantitative easing and negative interest rate policy at its meeting next month after repeatedly pushing back the timing for its 2 percent inflation target.
Some economists say the BOJ could use the review to ease monetary policy, potentially weakening the yen if bond yields decline further.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet approved fiscal measures worth 13.5 trillion yen earlier this month in an effort to revive the flagging economy and breathe new life into his economic agenda.

A robust recovery in home prices and sales gave a stronger-than-expected boost to the world's second-largest economy in the first half of the year, helping to offset stubbornly weak exports.
However, some analysts say slowing price growth and weakening property investment suggest the rebound may have peaked, as more local governments tighten restrictions on home purchases in a bid to keep fast-rising prices in check.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 7.9 percent in July from a year earlier, an official survey showed on Thursday, accelerating from a 7.3 percent increase in June.
Monthly trends, however, painted a somewhat weaker picture.
July home prices rose at the same pace as in June, which was the slowest since April, according to a Reuters calculation based on data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
And, out of the 70 cities surveyed, prices stalled or fell on a monthly basis in 19 cities in July, compared to 15 in June.
Home prices in first- and second-tier cities continued to see eye-popping annual gains, with southern boomtown Shenzhen and coastal Xiamen rising the most at 40.9 percent and 39.2 percent, respectively from a year earlier.
Worried by sharp price rises, a growing number of more affluent cities have tightened home purchasing restrictions in recent months - most recently Nanjing and Suzhou - including introducing measures to raise the down-payment ratio for second mortgages.

Cities that have seen the biggest drop in prices include Dandong and Mudanjiang, situated respectively in China's rustbelt Liaoning and Heilongjiang province.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage activity for home purchases, a leading indicator of housing sales, fell 4 percent in the week ended Aug. 12. It remained 10 percent higher than the comparable week a year earlier.
The average rate on ""conforming"" 30-year home mortgages, or loans with balances of $417,000 or less, dipped to 3.64 percent last week from 3.65 percent, the Washington-based group said.
The average 30-year rate touched 3.60 percent in the week ended July 8, which was the lowest since May 2013 and not far from the historic low of 3.47 percent struck in December 2012, according to MBA data.
Weekly mortgage activity on home purchases reached an eight-month peak in early June before a decline since even as 30-year mortgage rates hovered near their lowest in over three years.
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said housing starts rose 2.1 percent to an annualized rate of 1.211 million units in July, which was a five-month high.
Applications for loans to refinance also fell last week. 
MBA's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage activity for refinancing decreased 4 percent from the prior week. In early July, it hit its highest level since June 2013.
The share of weekly refinancing requests was 62.6 percent of total applications, compared with 62.4 percent the previous week, the Washington-based group said.

The group said its seasonally adjusted index of total mortgage activity also declined by 4 percent in the latest week. It reached a three-year high a month earlier.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2016 08:04AM ET</span>",UK labor market shows little sign of immediate Brexit hit,"By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people claiming unemployment benefit in Britain unexpectedly fell in July despite the shock decision by voters to leave the European Union, suggesting little immediate impact from Brexit on the labor market.
Benefit claimants fell by 8,600 in the month, compared with an increase of 900 in June, and there was only a small fall in the number of jobs employers were trying to fill, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected the number of claimants - a potential early warning sign of an economic downturn - to rise by 9,500 as employers responded to the uncertainty caused by the referendum.
The figures represented the first official measure of the labor market since the June 23 vote. The ONS data also showed the pace of job creation remained strong in the run-up to the referendum.
""The labor market data for July — the first 'hard' figures since referendum - suggest that the economic recovery is slowing, but do not give a resounding recession signal,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said, pointing to the fall in vacancies. 
The value of sterling rose briefly against the dollar and the euro. It later gave up those gains. [GBP/]
A survey published on Aug. 5 by a body representing the recruitment industry had suggested employers cut hiring in July as the number of permanent jobs placed by staffing firms fell at the fastest pace since 2009.
The Bank of England expects unemployment to rise sharply in the coming years as a result of the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. It cut interest rates to just 0.25 percent earlier this month and took other measures to cushion the economy.
DELAYED IMPACT?
The July claimant count figure was measured on July 14, three weeks after the referendum, meaning it might not reflect the full extent of any post-Brexit fall in hiring. British rules on how long employers must give notice to workers they intend to fire may also mean there is a delayed impact from the vote.
The ONS also said the number of vacancies in the three-month period to the end of July fell by 7,000 from the three months to the end of April to 741,000. Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said a fall of more 20,000 vacancies would suggest a recession.
There was another sign on Wednesday that the immediate economic impact of the Brexit vote would not be as bad as some had feared.
Households recovered from a loss of confidence about their finances in August, a survey showed, suggesting consumers were taking the referendum result in their stride.
Much of the ONS data covered the labor market in the run-up to the referendum.
Britain's unemployment rate held steady in the three months to June at 4.9 percent, as expected in the Reuters poll.
Wage growth in the April-June period picked up slightly, reflecting the introduction of a higher minimum wage in April.

The number of unemployed fell by 52,000 to 1.641 million while the number of people in work rose by 172,000 to 31.750 million and pushing the employment rate at 74.5 percent, a latest record high.

In a report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said their mortgage market index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased by a seasonally adjusted 4.0% in the week ending August 12 to 541.5. That follows a gain of 7.1% to 564.0 in the preceding week.
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances inched down to 3.64% from 3.65% in the preceding week.
Mortgage refinance activity slumped 4% from the previous week, while home purchase applications also dropped 4% last week.
""Refinance volume continues to tail off as markets recover post Brexit,"" said Michael Fratantoni, chief economist for the MBA.
The survey covers over 75% of U.S. retail residential mortgage applications, according to MBA.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in July but a rise in industrial output and home building suggested a pickup in economic activity that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.
Tuesday's economic reports came as influential New York Fed President William Dudley said the U.S. central bank could raise interest rates next month, citing a tightening labor market that he said was starting to spur faster wage growth.
""The strong housing starts and industrial output performance will bolster the Fed confidence that growth momentum has rebounded, potentially supporting the bias for a near-term hike,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. ""Nevertheless, with inflation continuing to miss to the downside, the case for caution remains strong.""
July's unchanged reading in the Consumer Price Index followed two straight monthly increases of 0.2 percent, while in the 12 months through July, the CPI rose 0.8 percent after increasing 1.0 percent in June.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, edged up 0.1 percent in July after rising 0.2 percent in each of the previous three months. The year-on-year core CPI increased 2.2 percent in July after advancing 2.3 percent in June.
The Fed has a 2.0 percent inflation target and tracks an alternative inflation measure which has been stuck at 1.6 percent since March.
NY FED RAISES POSSIBILITY OF SEPT RATE RISE
The New York Fed's Dudley told Fox Business television on Tuesday that ""it's possible"" for the Fed to hike rates at its Sept. 20-21 policy meeting. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart also told reporters that he was not ruling out a move next month.
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Fed officials view the labor market as either at or near full employment. Following Dudley's remarks, financial markets were placing a 58.9 percent probability of a rate increase at the Fed's December policy meeting, up from 46.7 percent late on Monday, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool. A September rate hike has been virtually priced out.
The weak inflation data, however, pushed the U.S. dollar lower against major currencies. U.S. stock prices slipped from record highs on Dudley's comments. Yields on U.S. government debt rose.
SUBDUED INFLATION SEEN TEMPORARY
With rents and healthcare costs continuing to rise, some economists do not expect July's moderation in underlying inflation to be sustained. Medical care costs climbed 0.5 percent last month, adding to June's 0.2 percent gain.
There were also increases in the costs of hospital services, doctor visits and prescription medicine. Rents increased by 0.3 percent.
But Americans got some relief from gasoline prices, which dropped 4.7 percent last month, the first decline since February.
The cost of food consumed at home fell for a third straight month, with prices for meat, eggs, dairy and cereals declining. Prices for new motor vehicles rose for the first time since February, while the cost of apparel was unchanged.
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION UP
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Fed said U.S. industrial production shot up 0.7 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in June.
Production was boosted by a 0.5 percent jump in manufacturing output, the largest gain since July 2015.
Despite benign inflation, economic growth is picking up after output averaged 1.0 percent in the first half of the year.
Warmer-than-usual weather boosted utilities production by 2.1 percent. Mining output increased 0.7 percent as oil and gas drilling surged 4.9 percent, suggesting the energy-related drag on business spending was easing.
""Overall, these factors suggest the outlook for the U.S. industrial sector has improved modestly and support our expectation of healthier economic growth in the second half of 2016,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
In a third report, the Commerce Department said housing starts increased 2.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.2 million units in July, the highest level since February.
Last month's increase in groundbreaking activity supports the view that investment in residential construction will rebound after slumping in the second quarter for the first time in more than two years.
Following the industrial production and housing starts data, the Atlanta Fed raised its third-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 3.6 percent annual rate.
The firming housing market is boosting home improvement retailers such as  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD). The company on Tuesday raised its full-year earnings forecast after reporting a 6.6 percent rise in quarterly sales.
Groundbreaking on single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, rose 0.5 percent to a 770,000-unit pace in July, also the highest level since February.
Housing starts for the volatile multi-family segment increased 5.0 percent to a 441,000-unit pace. Groundbreaking on multi-family housing projects with five units or more jumped to the highest level since September 2015.

Groundbreaking increased 2.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.2 million units, the highest level since February, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. June's starts were largely unchanged at a 1.19 million-unit rate.
Permits for future construction dipped 0.1 percent to a 1.15 million-unit rate last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts slipping to a 1.18 million-unit pace last month and building permits rising to a 1.16 million-unit rate.
Investment in residential construction contracted in the second quarter for the first time in more than two years.
That, together with an outright decline in inventory investment, a continued downturn in business spending and weak government outlays, held gross domestic product to a 1.2 percent annualized growth rate during the quarter.
Against the backdrop of a tightening labor market, which is steadily driving up wages, economists expect a rebound in residential construction spending in the third quarter. But with housing starts still running ahead of permits, the anticipated bounce-back could be modest.
A survey of homebuilders published on Monday showed confidence rising in August, with builders optimistic about sales now and over the next six months. However, their views about prospective buyer traffic softened a bit.
Groundbreaking on single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, rose 0.5 percent to a 770,000-unit pace in July, also the highest level since February. Single-family starts rose in the South and West, but tumbled 23.9 percent in the Northeast and fell 2.6 percent in the Midwest.

The multi-family segment of the market continues to be supported by strong demand for rental accommodation as some Americans shun homeownership in the aftermath of the housing market collapse.

Permits for the construction of single-family homes fell 3.7 percent last month to a 711,000-unit rate, the lowest level since September 2015, while multi-family building permits rose 6.3 percent to a 441,000-unit pace.

Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2.2% last month, which was also below forecasts for another 2.3% rise.

1141,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2016 08:32AM ET</span>",Empire State August manufacturing index contracts unexpectedly,"Investing.com - The New York Federal Reserve’s index of manufacturing conditions unexpectedly contracted in August, underlining concerns over the health of the economy, official data showed on Monday.
In a report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its general business conditions index fell to -4.2 this month from a reading of 0.55 in July. Analysts had expected the index to improve to 2.5 in August.
On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
The new orders index remained near zero, a sign that orders were little changed, while the shipments index climbed eight points to 9.0, indicating that shipments rose.
Labor market indicators pointed to little change in employment levels and hours worked.
The prices paid index edged down to 15.5, suggesting that input price increases remained moderate, and at 2.1, the prices received index reflected a minute increase in selling prices.
Forward-looking indicators suggested that firms expected conditions to improve over the next six months, although the level of optimism diminished for a second consecutive month.
The Empire State index is of interest to traders primarily because it is seen as an early forecast of the national Institute for Supply management factory survey.
EUR/USD was trading at 1.1183 from around 1.1177 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2890 from 1.2886 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 101.02 from 101.10 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 95.55, compared to 95.57 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures pointed to a modestly higher open. The Dow futures pointed to an increase of 0.25%, the S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.2%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,345.65 a troy ounce, compared to $1,344.50 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $44.69 a barrel from $44.77 earlier.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2016 03:41AM ET</span>","Japan's economy stalls in April-June, casts doubts on Abe's policies","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth ground to a halt in April-June as weak exports and shaky domestic demand prompted companies to cut spending, putting fresh pressure on premier Shinzo Abe to come up with policies that will produce more sustainable growth.
The weak reading underscores the challenges policymakers face in ending two decades of crippling deflation, as an initial boost from Abe's stimulus programs, dubbed ""Abenomics"", appears to be quickly fading.
The world's third-largest economy expanded by an annualized 0.2 percent in the second quarter, less than the 0.7 percent increase markets had expected and a sharp slowdown from a revised 2.0 percent increase in January-March, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday.
""Overall it looks like the economy is stagnating. Consumer spending is weak, and the reason is low wage gains. There is a lot of uncertainty about overseas economies, and this is holding back capital expenditure,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""The government has already announced a big stimulus package, so the next question is how the Bank of Japan will respond after its comprehensive policy review, which is sure to lead to a delay in its price target.""
HOUSING INVESTMENT BOOMS
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, gross domestic product showed no growth in April-June, compared with market expectations for a 0.2 percent rise.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, rose 0.2 percent, slowing from a 0.7 percent increase in the previous quarter.
Capital expenditure declined 0.4 percent after a 0.7 percent drop in the first quarter, suggesting that uncertainty over the global economic outlook and weak domestic markets are keeping firms from boosting spending.
Overseas demand shaved 0.3 percentage point off GDP, subtracting from growth for the first time in four quarters and underscoring the pain that stubbornly weak global demand is inflicting on the export-reliant economy.
""The breakdown of the data shows that gains in consumer spending lacked strength and exports fell a lot,"" Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters, adding the government will pursue structural reforms to address low potential growth.
In a glimmer of hope, housing investment jumped 5.0 percent, the fastest rise since 2011, due in part to the BOJ's ultra-loose monetary policy that has pushed down mortgage rates, a Cabinet Office official told reporters.
Abe's cabinet this month announced an economic package with 13.5 trillion yen ($133 billion) in fiscal measures, hoping it would help the economy deflect external headwinds and sustain a moderate recovery. But the plan will take time to pay dividends and skeptics say there is not enough new spending.
The BOJ also expanded stimulus last month via a modest increase in purchases of risky assets, and it remains under pressure to do more in September, when it conducts a thorough assessment of the effects of its stimulus program.
With prices still sliding despite three years of massive asset buying, the Bank of Japan's policy review could put up for debate its target for expanding base money, sources say, which could mark an overhaul of its existing policy framework.

But the central bank has already gobbled up a third of Japan's government bond market, and some analysts doubt whether printing money more aggressively would spur growth or accelerate inflation to its long-elusive 2 percent target.

The proportion of employers expecting to increase staffing over the next three months dropped from 40 percent before the referendum to 36 percent after it, according to the CIPD, an organization representing human resources professionals, and staffing firm  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN) Group UK & Ireland.
One in five employers expected to reduce investment in training and skills as a result of Brexit and the subsequent fall in the value of the pound which will push up the cost of imports. Seven percent planned to invest more.
""While many businesses are treating the immediate post-Brexit period as 'business as usual' and hiring intentions overall still remain positive, there are signs that some organizations, particularly in the private sector, are preparing to batten down the hatches,"" CIPD acting chief economist Ian Brinkley said.
Most employers said it was too soon to say if their migrant workers would leave Britain as a result of Brexit, but one in five thought that some were considering moving away from the country over the next 12 months.

Most economists believe Britain is heading for a recession followed by a period of slow growth because of uncertainty about the country's future trading relationship with the EU. Earlier this month, the Bank of England cut interest rates and took other measures to try to offset the Brexit shock to the economy.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2016 07:10PM ET</span>",Prices of UK homes for sale see biggest fall in nine months in August - Rightmove,"LONDON (Reuters) - The price of homes for sale in England and Wales fell in August, posting the biggest drop since November, as the summer lull added to uncertainty surrounding Britain's decision to leave the European Union, property website Rightmove said on Monday.
Asking prices fell by a monthly 1.2 percent, according to a survey by Rightmove that covers properties put on sale between July 10 and Aug. 6, after shedding 0.9 percent in July.
The biggest drop was in London and the South East, with asking prices falling by 2.6 percent and 2.0 percent respectively.
""Many prospective buyers take a summer break from home-hunting, and those who come to market at this quieter time of year tend to price more aggressively,"" Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst, said.
""This summer is also affected by both Brexit uncertainty and the aftermath of the buy-to-let rush in March to beat the stamp duty deadline.""
Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum on June 23 - a decision many economists think could tip the economy into recession and which prompted the Bank of England to cut interest rates for the first time since 2009 earlier this month.
Official data covering the period after the referendum has been scarce, but there are patchy signs that consumer spending held up, while data on the housing market following the vote has been mixed.

The monthly drop in prices reduced the annual increase to 4.1 percent in August from 4.5 percent in July, Rightmove said, adding that the survey covered 90 percent of the market.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2016 07:10PM ET</span>",Number of Britons visiting high street shops edges up in July - Springboard,"LONDON (Reuters) - The number of shoppers on Britain's high streets rose slightly in July compared with a year ago, according to another survey that suggests consumer demand has held up since Britons voted to leave the European Union.
Retail data company Springboard and the British Retail Consortium said high street footfall rose 0.3 percent compared with July 2015, following a 3.7 percent drop in June.
Overall, the figures contributed to a mixed picture for consumer spending since the June 23 referendum, with consumer confidence plunging but few major retailers reporting any slowdown in sales.
Last week a survey from the BRC showed spending in shops rose in July at the fastest pace in six months.
Better weather and big discounts tempted more Britons onto the high streets, compared with declining numbers visiting shopping centers, Springboard said. The steep fall in the pound since the referendum result also enticed overseas buyers.
""Some high streets in London and other major cities saw the changes in exchange rates produce increased spend from overseas visitors,"" said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard.
She added that the vacancy rate - or percentage of shopfronts unoccupied - rose in the three months to July to 10.1 percent compared with 9.6 percent in the three months to April.

""The next quarter's figures will be the ones to watch to get a clear picture on any continued increase in vacancy rates, which would be concerning for town centers across the UK,"" Wehrle said.

The Commerce Department said on Friday inventories increased 0.2 percent after a similar gain in May. Sales shot up 1.2 percent in June, the largest rise since February 2013, after rising 0.3 percent in May.
At June's sales pace, it would take 1.39 months for businesses to clear shelves. That was the fewest number of months since November 2015 and down from 1.40 months in May.
Economists had forecast inventories, a key component of gross domestic product, edging up 0.1 percent in June after a previously reported 0.2 percent gain in May.
Retail inventories increased 0.5 percent in June, as estimated last month in an advance report. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.2 percent in June after a 0.3 percent gain in May.

An outright drop in inventory investment cut almost 1.2 percentage points from GDP growth in the second quarter, limiting the rise in output to an anemic 1.2 percent annual rate. Inventories have been a drag on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2015.

The Labor Department said on Friday its producer price index for final demand dropped 0.4 percent last month, the first decline since March and the largest since September 2015. It increased 0.5 percent in June.
In the 12 months through July, the PPI slipped 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in the 12 months through June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and gaining 0.2 percent from a year ago.
A strong dollar and cheaper oil continue to keep price pressures muted, leaving inflation running persistently below the Fed's 2 percent target.
Last month, energy prices fell 1.0 percent after jumping 4.1 percent in June. Prices for services fell 0.3 percent, with apparel, jewelry, footwear and accessories retailing accounting for nearly 60 percent of the drop.
Services rose 0.4 percent in June. Healthcare costs increased 0.3 percent last month, with prices of doctor visits, dental and hospital outpatient care rising. Healthcare costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% last month, worse than the forecast for a 0.1% advance and after a 0.5% gain in June.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) unexpectedly decreased 0.2%, compared to expectations for a gain of 0.2% and following a rise of 0.3% in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, dropped by 0.3% in July, worse than forecasts for a gain of 0.2% and following a rise of 0.4% a month earlier.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 0.7% last month, below expectations for 1.2% advance and after rising 1.3% in the preceding month.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength in early August that could help spur faster economic growth.
Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected rise in import prices in July as a drop in petroleum prices was offset by gains in the cost of other goods. However, renewed dollar strength is expected to curb underlying inflation in the coming months.
""The data remain consistent with a still-strong trend in employment growth, which means the backdrop for consumer spending remains favorable,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 266,000 for the week ended Aug. 6, the Labor Department said. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 2,000 fewer applications received than previously reported. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong labor market, for 75 straight weeks, the longest streak since 1973 when the labor force was smaller. 
The four-week average of claims, considered to be a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,000 to 262,750 last week. 
With the labor market perceived to be either at or approaching full employment, there is probably little room for further declines in claims. A report on Wednesday showed layoffs fell to a near two-year low in June.
The upbeat claims report and better-than-expected financial results from retailers Kohl (N:KSS) and Macy's (N:M) boosted U.S. stocks. Prices for U.S. government debt fell, while the dollar (DXY) was largely changed against a basket of currencies.
TAME INFLATION 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said import prices edged up 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.6 percent in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices falling 0.3 percent in July.
In the 12 months through July, import prices fell 3.7 percent, the smallest decrease since November 2014, after declining 4.7 percent in the 12 months through June. Import prices excluding petroleum increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since April 2011, after dropping 0.3 percent in June.
Last month's increase in import prices came despite a 0.6 percent rise in the dollar against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners in July. The dollar lost some steam early in the year. Oil prices, which had started to rise toward $50 per barrel, fell in July and are now below $45 per barrel. 
The combination of dollar strength and cheap oil will likely continue to dampen imported inflation pressures and keepoverall inflation below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
Persistently low inflation suggests the U.S. central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates in the near term, even as the labor market approaches full employment.
""Although the pass-through of import prices to consumer price inflation is small, given the large share of spending on services, the weakness in import prices remains an additional hurdle for the Fed in reaching its inflation goal,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The robust labor market is boosting consumer spending and putting a floor under the economy after an inventory correction and lower oil prices restricted GDP growth to an average 1.0 percent annualized rate in the last three quarters. 

The economy added a total of 547,000 jobs in June and July. The low number of claims suggests job growth momentum was retained in early August.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2016 09:04AM ET</span>",U.S. import prices unexpectedly rise in July,"WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - U.S. import prices unexpectedly rose in July as a drop in petroleum prices was offset by gains in the cost of other goods, but renewed dollar strength will likely dampen underlying inflation in the coming months.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that import prices edged up 0.1 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent increase in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices falling 0.3 percent in July after a previously reported 0.2 percent advance in June. In the 12 months through July, import prices fell 3.7 percent, the smallest decrease since November 2014, after declining 4.7 percent in June.
Last month's gain came despite the dollar rising in July against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners after losing some steam early in the year. Oil prices which had started to rise toward $50 per barrel, fell in July. Oil prices are now below $45 per barrel.
The combination of dollar strength and cheap oil will likely continue to dampen imported inflation pressures and keep overall inflation below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
Persistently low inflation suggests the U.S. central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates in the near term, even as the labor market approaches full employment.
Last month, imported petroleum prices fell 3.6 percent after surging 10.6 percent in June. Import prices excluding petroleum increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since April 2011.
Imported consumer goods prices excluding automobiles dipped 0.1 percent. Prices for imported food prices jumped 3.3 percent last month, the biggest increase since March 2014.

The report also showed export prices increased 0.2 percent in July after rising 0.8 percent in June. Export prices were down 3.0 percent from a year ago.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending August 6 decreased by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 266,000 from the previous week’s total of 267,000, which was revised from the initial read of 269,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop by 4,000 from the initial prior reading to 265,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended July 30 increased more than expected to 2.155 million from 2.141 million in the preceding week, which was revised from the original figure of 2.138 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to rise to 2.140 million.
The four-week moving average was 262,750, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week's revised figure of 259,750 (initially 260,250).
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Immediately after the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1154 from around 1.1155 ahead of the publication; GBP/USD was at 1.2957 from 1.2962 earlier; while USD/JPY was unchanged at 101.35.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2016 12:20PM ET</span>","U.S. jobs openings increase in June, layoffs near two-year low","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings increased in June and layoffs dropped to their lowest in nearly two years as labor market conditions tightened further, according a government report on Wednesday.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report also suggested a growing skill shortage, which has been highlighted by independent surveys.
""This report continues to point to a tight labor market. It is clear that demand for labor is not the problem and there is nothing monetary policy can do to address a mismatch between the needs of employers and the skills of job seekers,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 110,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.6 million, the JOLTS report showed. That raised the jobs openings rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.8 percent.
The JOLTS report is one of the job market metrics on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. Fed officials view the labor market as being at or near full employment.
Concerns about persistently low inflation and an uncertain global economic outlook have left the U.S. central bank cautious about raising interest rates in the near term.
The economy created 547,000 jobs in June and July. The pace of job growth is, however, expected to slow as the economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 recession shows signs of aging.
Layoffs fell to 1.6 million in June, the lowest level since September 2014, from 1.7 million in May, the JOLTS report showed. The decline pushed the layoffs rate to 1.1 percent, the lowest since November 2013.
Hiring increased after three straight months of declines, suggesting employers are probably not finding qualified workers for the open positions. Hiring rose to 5.1 million from 5.0 million in May. The hiring rate climbed to 3.6 percent in June from 3.5 percent the prior month.
Job openings rose across nearly all sectors of the economy, with strong gains in manufacturing and construction, pointing to some stabilization in labor demand. 
The industrial sector has been hurt by the combination of a strong dollar and lower oil prices, which have weighed on manufacturing and mining activities. 
Other details of the JOLTS report showed Americans content to stay in their current jobs, with the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of confidence in the jobs market, holding at 2.0 percent for a third straight month in June.

""With labor market turnover stable and demand rising, further gains in employment should drive a modest improvement in wage growth and better rates of household income growth,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.

In a report, the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, increased to 5.624 million in June from 5.514 million a month earlier, which was revised from the original reading of 5.500 million.
Analysts had expected the number of job openings to rise to 5.574 million.
The report has garnered more attention, as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen often cites the survey when assessing the state of the labor market.
Hires (5.1 million) and separations (4.9 million) were also little changed in June.
The quits rate was 2.0% and the layoffs and discharges rate was 1.1%.

A Reuters poll of 22 economists had an average forecast for a rise of 0.1 percent with estimates ranging from -1.0 to +1.3 percent. <FRIP=ECI>
The decline was driven by a 12.4 percent drop in the refining sector, INSEE said, following a 21 percent decrease the previous month, as strikes at Total's refineries disrupted production. The French oil major was only able to resume production around the middle of June after the 27-day strike.
But June output was also down 2.6 percent in the equipment goods sector, and 1.7 percent in the transport material sector, with only the mining, energy and water sector expanding with a 1.9 percent rise.
Over the second quarter as a whole, industrial production was down 0.1 percent from the previous quarter, and up 0.4 percent from the same quarter a year ago.
The following are the main figures given by INSEE (percentage changes). The year-on-year figures compare the last three months with same period a year earlier and three-month figures compare the last three months with preceding three months.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances inched down to 3.65% from 3.67% in the preceding week.
The drop in interest rates also spurred a 10% increase in mortgage refinance activity from the previous week, while home purchase applications increased 2.6% last week.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese machinery orders rose more than expected in June in a sign that companies are gradually becoming more willing to increase capital expenditure.
Companies also expect core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, to rise in July-September, suggesting that business investment is starting to stabilize after a rocky performance in the previous quarter.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has compiled a stimulus package that focuses on infrastructure, which should support capital spending heading into next year, but risks remain that overseas economic turmoil could curb business investment.
""There have been some concerns about overseas economies and a strong yen hurting earnings, but capital expenditure seems to be holding up,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""Companies are certainly not becoming more cautious, but we need to keep a close eye on the trend from here on.""
Core machinery orders rose 8.3 percent, well ahead of the median estimate for a 3.1 percent increase, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
Manufacturers' orders rose 17.7 percent, while orders from the services sector rose 2.1 percent, the data showed.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast that core orders will rise 5.2 percent in July-September, which compares with a 9.2 percent decrease in April-June.
Abe's cabinet last week approved an economic stimulus package with 13.5 trillion yen in fiscal measures as a precaution in case Britain's exit from the European Union undermines global economic conditions.
Many policymakers and economists have said capital expenditure is crucial because it creates jobs and increases productivity, both of which Japan's economy needs to be more vibrant.
Forecasts for gains in machinery orders in July-September suggests the economy could pick up from what is expected to be a subdued quarterly performance in April-June.
Data due on Monday is expected to show Japan's economic growth slowed in the second quarter, weighed down by weak domestic demand and stagnant exports, according to a Reuters poll.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to expand at an annualized rate of 0.7 percent in April-June, the poll of 21 analysts showed, following 1.9 percent annualized growth in the first quarter.
This would be a quarterly expansion of 0.2 percent after a 0.5 percent rise in January-March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity fell for the third straight quarter in the spring this year, suggesting that corporate profits may continue to decline and wage growth may remain sluggish.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday that productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, dropped at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the April-June period, extending the longest decline since 1979. Productivity fell at an unrevised 0.6 percent rate in the first quarter.
In the second quarter, productivity decreased at a 0.4 percent rate compared to the same period last year, the fastest year-on-year pace of decline in three years.
Revisions to data going back to 2013 also confirmed the softening productivity trend, but strong employment gains have helped to raise output overall with U.S. payrolls growing by more than 500,000 jobs in June and July.
""The reason the economy has still been able to expand is because of labor input. Firms are hiring people at a reasonably healthy rate,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities in New York.
""However, we do not believe this can last, because strong hiring in the face of weak productivity necessarily implies a further deterioration in corporate profit margins.""
After rising rapidly in the 1990s as computers made workers more efficient, productivity has fallen as companies have been reluctant to invest in new equipment in the past 18 months given the outlook for sluggish economic growth globally.
In the long run higher incomes and rising living standards depend on rising productivity though. The U.S. economy expanded at an annual pace of only 1.0 percent during the first six months of this year, roughly half the average of the past seven years.
U.S. stock prices were little changed at Tuesday's close, near record highs set recently, as investors shrugged off the productivity data, while U.S. Treasury yields edged lower as lower productivity suggests inflation may remain subdued.
SLUGGISH CORPORATE PROFITS
Corporate profits declined 5.3 percent in 2015 partly due to the lagging impact of a strong U.S. dollar and lower oil prices, before seeing an 8.1 percent rebound in the first quarter 2016 according to government data. Corporate profits data for the second quarter will be published later this month.
The Commerce Department reported last month that gross domestic product rose at a 1.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter following a 0.8 percent rise in the first quarter.
The estimate for second-quarter GDP growth could be revised slightly up after a separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent in June. The government had previously reported wholesale inventories as being unchanged in June.
DOUBTS ABOUT DATA
Productivity has increased at an annual rate of less than 1.0 percent in each of the last five years, suggesting the economy's potential rate of growth has declined, but some economists have questioned whether it is being accurately measured.
""Innovations are everywhere, in cancer research, iPhone apps, Olympic sports training, cloud computing - they are just not showing up in the GDP accounts,"" said Patrick Newport, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
""Are we just about running in place or is the radar that measures growth malfunctioning? It's both. Productivity growth is understated. Economists are just unsure by how much.""
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 2.0 percent pace in the second quarter. Second-quarter unit labor costs rose at a 2.1 percent rate compared to the same period of 2015.
First-quarter unit labor costs were revised to show a 0.2 percent rate of decrease, instead of the previously reported 4.5 percent increase.
Hourly compensation per hour rose at a 1.5 percent rate in the second quarter after falling at a 0.8 percent pace in the prior quarter.

""Labor compensation growth that outpaces productivity growth must either be passed through into faster price increases or squeeze profit margins,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Some 4.8 percent of the outstanding debt was in some stage of delinquency, down from 5.6 percent from a year ago, according to the quarterly household debt and credit report.
Auto debt was $1.10 trillion, up $97 billion from a year earlier, while the aggregate credit card limit increased for the 14th straight quarter, reflecting Americans' easier access to credit as the 2007-2009 financial crisis fades.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent after having been initially estimated as unchanged. Inventories for May were revised up to show a 0.2 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent gain.
Economists had forecast wholesale inventories as unchanged in June in line with the government's estimate last month. That unchanged reading was incorporated in the advance second-quarter gross domestic product estimate published last month.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.3 percent in June. That would imply a mild upward revision to the second-quarter GDP growth estimate.
An outright drop in inventory investment subtracted almost 1.2 percentage points from GDP growth in the second quarter, restricting the rise in output to a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate. Inventories have weighed on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2015 as businesses sell piles of unwanted goods.
In June, wholesale stocks of farm products increased 4.0 percent after rising 6.2 percent in May. Wholesale inventories of drugs surged 4.9 percent after declining 3.8 percent in May. Auto inventories dipped 0.1 percent in June.
Sales at wholesalers jumped 1.9 percent after rising 0.7 percent in May. In June, it would have taken wholesalers 1.33 months to clear shelves, down from 1.35 months in May.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory price deflation moderated further in July, with prices falling at their slowest pace in two years, taking pressure off the central bank to cut rates as policymakers turn their focus to structural reforms and ballooning credit.
A government-led building spree has increased demand for construction materials, but higher prices are also due in part to speculation in China's commodities futures market, which has pushed up Shanghai rebar futures up by 50 percent this year.
The producer price index (PPI) fell 1.7 percent in July from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday, smaller than June's 2.6 percent decline. Analysts expect producer price inflation to turn positive this year for the first time in more than four years, but the recovery at the factory gate is unlikely to lead to a rebound in private investment, which has fallen to record low growth rates.
""The improvement of PPI should benefit the corporate sector's profitability, but is unlikely to encourage private sector investment, as the main beneficiaries are heavy industries – which are dominated by state-owned enterprises,"" said ANZ economists in a note.
Non-ferrous metals prices rose 2.8 percent month-on-month in July, while steel prices increased 0.4 percent.
Downstream prices, however, remained subdued in July with the consumer price inflation accelerating at its weakest pace in six months as food price gains slowed.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.8 percent in July from a year earlier, compared with a 1.9 percent increase in June, and matching this year's low hit in January. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 1.8 percent gain.
Consumer inflation has remained well below China's official target of around 3 percent in 2016, despite concerns that severe summer flooding, which has disrupted public infrastructure and agricultural production, would increase inflationary pressures.
Food prices continued to moderate, rising 3.3 percent in July compared with a 4.6 percent gain in June. Prices of pork rose only 16.1 percent versus a 30.1 percent increase in June as demand for the Chinese staple meat continued to cool from peaks hit earlier this year.
Non-food inflation, however, rose 1.4 percent, compared with June's 1.2 percent gain.
Healthcare costs rose 4.3 percent year-on-year in July, up from a 3.8 percent gain in June, which Merchants Securities economist Yan Ling in Shenzhen said reflects a wider improvement in demand for such products.
Similarly, rises in other price categories showed increasing demand for a wider range of consumer goods and services including horticulture, pet care and retirement services, Yan said.
Low inflation means Beijing has room to loosen monetary policy if needed, but policymakers appear to have disparate views over how much stimulus is needed to stoke economic growth, if any, and what form it should take.
However, strengthening producer prices mean there is likely less need to ease in the short-term, analysts say. China's central bank has not adjusted interest rates since October 2015.
""Policymakers are likely to focus their attention on more

pressing issues, such as addressing credit risks and structural imbalances,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2016 04:17AM ET</span>",India's Rajan calls on government to set up monetary panel soon; holds rate,"By Suvashree Choudhury and Rafael Nam
MUMBAI (Reuters) - At his last policy review as head of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan kept key interest rates unchanged on Tuesday to cool inflation running near two year highs, while also pushing for policy panel to be formed in time for a review in October.
The decision to hold the repo rate <INREPO=ECI> at 6.50 percent had been widely expected after consumer inflation <INCPIY=ECI> accelerated to 5.77 percent in June, near the top of the Reserve Bank of India's 2-6 percent range, and above its target of 5 percent by March next year.
""It is appropriate for the Reserve Bank to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at this juncture, while awaiting space for policy action,"" RBI Governor Rajan said in his statement.
The much admired former International Monetary Fund chief economist is due to step down on Sept. 4 after a three-year term to return to academia and family living in the United States.
During that time he steered India out of its worst currency crisis in two decades and, helped by tumbling oil and commodity prices, succeeded in halving inflation from double-digit levels prevailing when he took over at the bank.
""We managed to move the needle forward a little bit,"" Rajan told reporters, as he looked back warmly on his time at the RBI.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has still to pick a successor, while senior official told Reuters last week that candidates are being shortlisted for a six-member monetary policy committee.
Rajan had championed the introduction of an MPC, so that future rate decisions would no longer be left to the discretion of RBI governors.
The government last week formally adopted Rajan's consumer price inflation target of 4 percent with a plus or minus 2 percent band, having convinced the government that it will anchor policy in a country with a history of volatile prices.
""My hope is the next monetary policy statement (on Oct. 4) will be by the proposed Monetary Policy Committee,"" Rajan told reporters in prepared remarks ahead of a news briefing.
Whoever takes over from Rajan will need to follow through on efforts to clean up bad loans hobbling Indian banks, so that they can finance the investment needed if India is to hold onto its place as one of the world's fastest growing major economies.
""ACCOMODATIVE STANCE""
Rajan said the RBI's policy stance should remain ""accommodative"".
But he expected ""upside"" risks to his March inflation target, citing a hike this year in the salaries of millions of government employees and sticky core inflation.
Rajan has lowered rates by 150 bps since January last year to their lowest in more than five years, but economists doubt whether the current easing cycle has much further to run.
Most expect the next RBI governor to provide another 25 bps cut in the policy rate by the end of the year, before holding steady through 2017.
""To instigate more consumption and good credit growth, you could have RBI cutting at least once before the year end,"" said Sanjeev Bhasin, an executive vice president in markets for India Infoline.
In contrast to most economists, bond markets are betting the next RBI governor might take a more relaxed view on timelines to meet the 4 inflation target. Ten-year bond yields have slumped 33 bps since Rajan unexpectedly announced his departure.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Total sales from Mexico's major retail stores will likely surpass earlier estimates of nearly 7 percent growth this year, in large part due to abundant liquidity in the economy, the head of retailers association ANTAD said in an interview on Friday.
Earlier this year, ANTAD forecast annual growth of 6.9 percent for total retail sales, and 3.9 percent growth for sales at stores open at least a year.
Data through June already shows total sales growth of 10.1 percent and same-store sales growth of 6.8 percent, a trend that ANTAD President Vicente Yanez expects to continue through the remainder of the year.
""With more than half of the year behind us, there's no doubt we will be ahead of the forecasts that were already good to begin with,"" said Yanez.
""There's abundant liquidity in the economy in all forms of purchase,"" he said.
ANTAD includes retail chains Walmex (MX:WALMEX) and Soriana (MX:SORIANAB) as well as other department stores operating in Mexico, Latin America's second-biggest economy behind Brazil.
Yanez said that better-than-expected sales growth is also due to an expansion in consumer credit.
Consumer finance in Mexico grew 11.2 percent year-on-year in June, with personal loans jumping 20.6 percent and credit for durable goods up 12.6 percent, according to data from Mexico's central bank.
Bank data further shows that remittances sent home by Mexicans living abroad totaled $13.16 billion during January to June, up nearly 9 percent over the same period in 2015.
Yanez said lower-income sectors of the economy will benefit the most from the growth in remittances, which is also being boosted by the deprecation of the Mexican peso since last year.
""This provides a significant flow of resources in pesos which stimulates commerce in general,"" he said.
The Mexican peso has weakened 8.8 percent so far this year, following a 17 percent depreciation in 2015.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2016 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit rises to ten-month high in June,"WASHINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit rose to a 10-month high in June as rising domestic demand and higher oil prices boosted the import bill while the lagging effects of a strong dollar continued to hamper export growth.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap increased 8.7 percent to $44.5 billion in June, the biggest deficit since August 2015. May's trade deficit was revised slightly down to $41.0 billion.
June marked the third straight month of increases in the deficit. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap widening to $43.1 billion in June after a previously reported $41.1 billion shortfall. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit rose to $64.7 billion from $60.9 billion in May.
The government in its snapshot of second-quarter gross domestic product published last week said trade had contributed two-tenths of a percentage point to the 1.2 percent annualized growth pace during the period.
The dollar's sharp rally against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015 has undercut export growth.
With the dollar weakening this year on a trade-weighted basis, some of the drag on exports had started to ebb. But the dollar has been regaining strength in the wake of Britain's June 23 vote to leave the European Union, and economists say that could renew pressure on exports.
Exports of goods and services edged up 0.3 percent in June.
Exports to the European Union jumped 7.8 percent, with goods shipped to the United Kingdom soaring 18.2 percent. China bought more U.S.-made goods in June, with exports to that country rising 3.6 percent.

Imports of goods and services increased 1.9 percent to $227.7 billion in June, with oil prices accounting for part of the rise. Oil prices averaged $39.38 per barrel in June, the highest level since October of last year, from $34.19 in May.
The $5.19 increase in the average oil price in June from May was the biggest since May 2011.
June's increase in imports also reflected a pickup in domestic demand. Imports from China increased 2.8 percent. With imports outpacing exports, the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit rose 2.5 percent to $29.8 billion in June, the biggest gap since last November."

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2016 08:35AM ET</span>","U.S. payrolls gains beat expectations, wages rise","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment increased more than expected in July and wages picked up, which should bolster expectations of an acceleration in economic growth and raise the probability of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this year.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 255,000 jobs last month as hiring rose broadly after an upwardly revised 292,000 surge in June, the Labor Department said on Friday.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent as more people entered the labor market. Highlighting labor market strength, average hourly wages increased a healthy eight cents. May payrolls were revised up to 24,000 from the previously reported 11,000.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 in July and the unemployment rate dipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 percent.
Last month's strong job growth should reinforce the Fed's confidence in a labor market that officials view as at or near full employment. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth.
The second straight month of robust job gains is a boost to an economy after growth averaged a 1.0 percent annual rate in the last three quarters. After a policy meeting last month, the Fed described the labor market as having ""strengthened"" and said it appeared it was still tightening.
The U.S. central bank raised interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held them steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation. Most economists expect another rate hike in December, though financial markets have almost priced out that possibility.
The 0.3 percent increase in average hourly earnings left the year-on-year gain at 2.6 percent.
The payrolls data added to July auto sales in underscoring the economy's sound fundamentals. Economic growth is expected to accelerate to at least a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the second quarter.
But with the bulk of labor market slack largely absorbed and the economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 recession showing signs of aging, payroll gains will probably drift to average between 150,000 and 160,000 jobs per month later this year, economists say.
Manufacturing sector employment increased by 9,000 jobs in July after adding 15,000 positions in June. Construction payrolls rose 14,000 following three consecutive months of declines. While mining shed a further 7,000 jobs in July.

Other details of the employment report showed a rise in the labor force. That raised the participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, by one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.8 percent.

Additionally, the private sector created more of the new job contracts than expected in July with a total of 217,000, compared to consensus expectations for 170,000. June’s number was revised down to 259,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 265,000.

Exports in June grew 3.4 percent from a year earlier, data from the International Trade and Industry Ministry showed on Friday, a stark contrast to economists' estimates of a 4.2 percent decline. In May, exports slid 0.9 percent, hit by the effects of weak global oil prices.
Malaysia's exports to the U.S. jumped 22 percent in June, the highest on-year growth recorded this year, on higher shipments of electrical and electronic products, as well as optical and scientific equipment.
The spike in demand helped offset declining commodity exports. Malaysia, the world's second-largest producer of palm oil, saw a 20.3 percent annual drop in palm oil and palm-based exports in June.
Exports of liquefied natural gas and crude oil also remained weak, down 29.2 percent and 7.3 percent respectively.
Economists said while the trade figures were a positive surprise, sustained growth would be dependant on commodity prices.
""We are in a small downturn right now but the outlook is still for a slight recovery in oil prices towards the end of the year, as global supplies increase,"" said Julia Goh, an economist for UOB Bank in Malaysia.
Exports to the European Union grew 4.1 percent from a year earlier, but those to China fell 20.3 percent, due to lower exports of commodities and manufactured goods.
The ringgit <MYR=MY> rose 0.4 percent to 4.032 per dollar after the data. The currency was emerging Asia's worst performing last year.
Imports in June expanded 8.3 percent from a year earlier, up from the previous month's 3.1 percent rise.
June's trade surplus widened to 5.5 billion ringgit ($1.36 billion), compared to 3.3 billion ringgit in May.
In the first half of 2016, exports grew 1.2 percent while imports rose 1.4 percent from the same period last year. A trade surplus of 41.8 billion ringgit was recorded, compared with 41.7 billion ringgit in the first half of 2015.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Real wages in Japan rose the most in almost six years in June, data showed on Friday, but the gain was exaggerated by the effect of falling prices, highlighting the government's struggle to pull the economy out of deflation.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has sought to lift the economy out of two decades of stagnation through a three-pronged mix of big government spending, ultra-loose monetary policy and structural reforms.
While pay increases and higher spending are key for the success of Abenomics, wage gains inflated by low prices may not spur private consumption, which remains sluggish.
Real wages, which are adjusted for inflation, jumped 1.8 percent in June from a year earlier, the highest level since September 2010. In the previous month, they rose 0.4 percent on-year, revised data from the labor ministry showed.
""Real wages grew 1.8 percent because the core consumer price index was negative 0.5 percent in June,"" said a labor ministry official, adding that gains in nominal cash earnings also helped.
Wage earners' nominal cash earnings rose 1.3 percent in June, the biggest gain in three months. In May, they dipped 0.1 percent on-year, revised data showed.
Nominal cash earnings increased because summer bonuses pushed up special payments, the official said.
Special payments jumped 3.3 percent in June, compared with a revised 1.5 percent gain in May. Because special payments are generally small, even a slight change in the amount can cause big percentage changes.
Regular pay, which determines base salaries, increased only a scant 0.1 percent.

Overtime pay - a barometer of strength in corporate activity - fell 0.1 percent in June, down from a revised 0.5 percent gain the previous month.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that new orders for manufactured goods declined 1.5 percent after a downwardly revised 1.2 percent decrease in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders dropping 1.8 percent in June after a previously reported 1.0 percent decline in May.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft increased 0.4 percent in June instead of the 0.2 percent gain reported last month. These so-called core capital goods are seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans on equipment.
Core capital goods shipments, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 0.2 percent in June. They were previously reported to have slipped 0.4 percent in June.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been pressured by the residual effects of a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undermined exports of factory goods. Production has also been hurt by businesses placing fewer orders as they try to clear an inventory glut.
The sector has also been hurt by spending cuts by energy firms as they adjust to reduced profits from cheaper oil.
An outright drop in inventories and sustained weakness in business spending weighed on economic growth in the second quarter, with gross domestic product rising at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate after increasing at a 0.8 percent pace in the first three months of the year.
In June, orders for transportation equipment tumbled 10.5 percent, the biggest drop since August 2014. The largely reflected weak orders for aircraft. Orders for motor vehicles and parts increased 3.2 percent, the largest gain since July 2015.
Orders for machinery, which have been hurt by weak demand in the energy and agricultural sectors, rose 0.2 percent. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components gained 0.3 percent. Orders for computers and electronic products slumped 1.9 percent, the largest drop in more than a year.
Inventories of factory goods dipped 0.1 percent. Inventories have declined in 13 of the last 14 months. Shipments increased 0.7 percent. That lowered the inventories-to-shipments ratio to 1.35 from 1.36 in May.

Unfilled orders at factories decreased 0.8 percent after three straight months of increases.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 30 increased by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 269,000 from the previous week’s total of 266,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to decline by 1,000 to 265,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 260,250, up 3,750 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended July 23 declined to 2.138 million from 2.144 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to inch down to 2.130 million.
EUR/USD was trading at 1.1140 from around 1.1136 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3172 from 1.3166 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 101.20 from 101.22 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 95.65, compared to 95.69 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed open. The blue-chip Dow futures rose 24 points, or 0.13%, the S&P 500 futures added 2 points, or 0.06%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures shed 3 points, or 0.05%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,367.95 a troy ounce, compared to $1,367.15 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $40.70 a barrel from $40.73 earlier.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2016 05:10AM ET</span>",U.S. small business borrowing rose in June: PayNet,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - U.S. small business borrowing rose in June, data released on Thursday showed, but not enough to reverse three straight months of decline, pointing to sluggish economic growth ahead.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index rose to 138.9 in June, from May's upwardly revised 131.1. It was down 5 percent from a year earlier, as borrowing by companies in all major industry groups sagged.
The PayNet index typically corresponds to U.S. gross domestic product growth one or two quarters ahead. The U.S. economy grew just 1.2 percent last quarter, a government report showed last week, after registering a meager 0.8 percent in the first quarter.
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because small companies tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains. The figures released Thursday suggest ""no big contribution to GDP from private companies,"" said Bill Phelan, PayNet's president.
Meanwhile, companies appeared to be having more difficulty paying back existing loans. Loans more than 30 days past due rose in June to 1.56 percent, the highest since October 2014, separate data from PayNet showed.
PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage activity for home purchases, a leading indicator of housing sales, fell 2 percent in the week ended on July 29 to its lowest level since late February.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loans, declined last week in step with benchmark Treasury yields. (US10YT=RR)
Thirty-year loan rates hit a more than three-year low last month as longer-dated U.S. yields had fallen to historic lows on worries about global economic growth and immense overseas demand for U.S. bonds.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on refinancing applications fell 4 percent from the prior week. It reached its highest level since June 2013 in the week ended on July 8.
The group's seasonally adjusted index of total mortgage activity fell 3.5 percent from the previous week. It was down for the third straight week after hitting a three-year peak in July.
The share of weekly refinancing requests was 60.7 percent of total applications, compared with 61.1 percent the previous week, the Washington-based group said.
The average rate on ""conforming"" 30-year home mortgages, or loans with balances of $417,000 or less, fell to 3.67 percent last week from 3.69 percent, MBA said.
The average 30-year rate touched 3.60 percent in the week ended July 8, which was the lowest since May 2013 and not far from the historic low of 3.47 percent struck in December 2012, according to MBA data.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) fell to a record low of 1.321 percent on July 6. It was 1.540 percent on Wednesday, up slightly from late on Tuesday, according to Reuters data.

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2016 07:29AM ET</span>",Euro zone business growth picks up slightly but still muted,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity expanded a touch faster than expected last month as the region appeared, so far, to have largely shrugged off Britain's vote to leave the European Union, a survey found.
The latest increase, which came alongside some of the fastest hiring growth in the euro zone since before the financial crisis in 2008, was led by a surge in Germany, masking stagnation in France and a slower pace in Spain and Italy.
Euro zone business growth is now in stark contrast to Britain, where a survey suggested its economy is shrinking at the fastest rate since the financial crisis after a sharp hit to activity following the EU referendum in June. [GB/PMIS]
Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone, released on Wednesday, was 53.2 in July, above a flash estimate of 52.9 and June's 53.1. It has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013.
""The composite PMIs have held up a little better than people expected after the UK's Brexit vote but that doesn't change the fact that growth is still weak and not doing enough to pick up core inflation,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.
""Even though the composite PMIs and surveys have done a bit better than expected that doesn't change the fact that there is still pressure on the ECB to take more action.""
Last month, the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged but said more stimulus could be on the way. A July Reuters poll suggested it would soon be forced to extend and expand the scope of its asset purchase program. [ECILT/EU]
Despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy, inflation is nowhere near the central bank's 2 percent target ceiling and is not expected to get there until at least the end of 2017.
Of some relief to policymakers though, a sub-index measuring output prices jumped to a 10-month high of 49.8 from June's 49.1, an indication firms barely cut prices.
Economic growth in the euro zone halved in the second quarter to 0.3 percent and Markit said if sustained the latest PMI reading pointed to a similar pace in the current quarter. Last month's Reuters poll predicted the same.
GERMAN LEAD
According to the PMIs, growth is being led by Germany, where a stronger expansion in services boosted private sector activity last month to its highest this year, although some companies were less optimistic following Britain's vote to leave the EU. 
But France's composite PMI barely tipped over the break-even mark while the Italian and Spanish ones both fell.
Across the euro zone, activity in the dominant service industry ticked up from June. Its PMI edged up to 52.9 from 52.8, higher than the flash 52.7 reading.
In a sign service firms expect a further improvement this month, they increased headcount at the fastest rate since early 2008. The employment index rose to 53.7 from 53.1.
""The improved hiring trend suggests firms have gained sufficient confidence in the durability and sustainability of the upturn to expand capacity in increasing numbers,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.
But the euro zone has a long way to go to get unemployment down. It is at 10.1 percent, which masks great variety across member states. Unemployment is just above 6 percent in Germany but one in five people in Spain are out of work. 

Echoing the slow and steady picture painted by the PMIs, an official report from Eurostat showed retail sales - a proxy for household spending - were stable in June across the currency bloc.

In a report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said their mortgage market index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased by a seasonally adjusted 3.5% in the week ending July 29 to 526.8. That follows a drop of 11.2% to 545.8 in the preceding week.
Refinance volume, which is highly rate-sensitive, fell 4% last week, seasonally adjusted, while mortgage applications to purchase a home dropped 2% for the week.

1299,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 03, 2016 04:34AM ET</span>",U.K. services PMI contracts for first time in over 3 years,"Investing.com – Activity in the U.K. service sector registered a contraction in July for the first time in more than three years, underlining concern over the health of the British economy as the sector makes up approximately 80% of gross domestic product, industry data showed on Wednesday.
In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 47.4 last month from a reading of 52.3 in June.
The reading, its lowest since December 2012, was unchanged from the preliminary estimate .
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Markit pointed out that services output and new business both fell at the fast rate since March 2009 and that expectations were the weakest since February 2009.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson indicated that the combination of PMIs pointed to a 0.4% quarterly rate decline of gross domestic product (GDP).
Even though Williamson admitted that it was too early to say if the surveys will remain in such territory, he warned that “the unprecedented month-on-month drop in the all-sector index has undoubtedly increased the chances of the U.K. sliding into at least a mild recession.”
This economist concluded that the data would justify action to be taken by the Bank of England at its monetary policy meeting on Thursday.
“A quarter-point cut in interest rates therefore seems to be a foregone conclusion at tomorrow’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting, though the extent and nature of other non-standard stimulus measures remains a far greater source of uncertainty and the subject of intense speculation,” Williamson said.
In an immediate reaction to the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.3334 from around 1.3331 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8398 from 0.8404 earlier.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2016 03:10AM ET</span>","China July service sector growth eases, employment falls for first time in four months: Caixin PMI","BEIJING, Aug 3 (Reuters) - - Growth in China's services sector cooled in July, with weaker expansions in activity and new work prompting companies to shed staff for first time in four months as they looked to cut costs, a private survey showed on Wednesday.
The findings contrast with a more upbeat official survey on Monday, raising concerns that China is still facing hurdles to its plans to transform the economy into one more reliant on domestic consumption than heavy industry and exports.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.7 in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, from an 11-month peak of 52.7 in June.
While still above the 50 mark that demarcates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, a breakdown of the activity index showed growth momentum was slowing broadly, while employment fell, albeit at a modest rate.
""All of the index categories showed signs of deterioration, with employment falling back into contraction territory after three consecutive months of growth,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
Cost-cutting programs and the non-replacement of voluntary leavers both contributed to lower workforce numbers, IHS Markit cited survey respondents as saying.
Beijing has been counting on a growing services sector to pick up the slack as it tries to restructure the economy and cut overcapacity in industrial sectors such as steel and mining. A prolonged downturn in those areas and stubbornly weak exports have helped pull economic growth to its lowest in 25 years.
Caixin's July manufacturing survey, by comparison, was stronger than its official counterpart, raising hopes that the effect of government stimulus spending was starting to benefit smaller private firms as well as larger state-backed ones.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors rose to 51.9, its highest level since 2014, reflecting the marked improvement in its manufacturing reading.
The official services survey showed growth accelerated to 53.9 in July from 53.7 in June.
But it, too, contained several worrying trends, with construction services growth solid but cooling and the property services sector weakening, adding to worries that China's housing boom may have peaked.

""Implementation of supportive measures (by authorities) including proactive fiscal policies must continue to protect the recovery, and regulations in the services sector should be further relaxed,"" Zhong said.

The IHS Market Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 50.4 in July from 49.4 in June on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The index rose above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the first time in two months.
The index for new business rose to 49.7 from 47.3 in the previous month, which was the lowest since September 2011.
""The latest survey data pointed to a slight improvement in business activity at Japanese services firms. New orders declined at a weaker pace, contrasting with the sharpest contraction in nearly five years seen in June,"" said Amy Brownbill, an economist at Markit.
Employment in the services sector fell at a slightly faster pace in July, however, while companies were the least optimistic about the business outlook in over four years, citing weak domestic and global demand and uncertainties over the impact of Brexit and China's economy.
The composite Japan index for output in both manufacturing and services rose to 50.1 in July from 49.0 in June, showing the first expansion in five months.
Japan's government will launch a stimulus package worth more than 28 trillion yen ($273.36 billion) in an attempt to boost domestic demand with infrastructure spending and cash transfers to low-income households.

Services accounted for 70.1 percent of Japan's gross domestic product, while manufacturing had a 18.7 percent share in 2014.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2016 04:53PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending exits second quarter with strong momentum,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in June as households bought goods and services, suggesting strength that appeared to be sustained early in the third quarter with auto sales surging to an eight-month high in July.
Despite healthy consumer spending, Tuesday's report from the Commerce Department showed inflation still muted. Economists say this, together with weak business investment and the second quarter's anemic economic growth pace, could encourage a cautious Federal Reserve to keep interest rates at current low levels for a while. 
""The continued buoyancy in consumption expenditures points to a favorable handoff to the third quarter, but the soft price pressures add to the narrative of the weakening inflationary backdrop, which will argue for caution at the Fed,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.4 percent in June after a similar gain in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending advancing 0.3 percent.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3 percent after climbing 0.2 percent in May.
The June data was included in last week's second-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed that consumer spending rose at a 4.2 percent annual rate, the fastest in nearly two years. That jump accounted for almost all of the economy's 1.2 percent growth pace during the period. 
An inventory drawdown was behind the bulk of the economy's poor performance in the second quarter, with other drags coming from persistently weak business investment, as well as a decline in spending on residential construction and weak government outlays.
Separately, auto sales rose to a 17.88 million-unit annual rate last month, the highest since November 2015, from a 16.74 million-unit pace in June, according to data from Autodata. Analysts had expected sales to increase to a 17.3 million unit rate. 
""As the earliest reliable indicator of durable goods consumption, today's sales results bode well for real July consumption growth,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries slipped and stocks on Wall Street ended down.
SOLID HANDOFF
While the second quarter's robust pace of consumer spending will probably not be repeated, economists are optimistic that spending will remain solid, underpinned by steadily increasing wages as the labor market tightens, as well as rising house and stock market prices.
The rebound in auto sales came despite General Motors Co (N:GM) reporting a 2 percent drop.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) also reported a 3 percent decline in sales last month. 
""The solid handoff to the quarter suggests consumer spending will downshift only moderately in the third quarter, assisted by an expected rebound in unit auto sales in July,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
""Another decent quarter for consumers, together with renewed inventory building, should anchor a near doubling in real GDP growth in the third quarter."" 
There was little sign of inflation in June. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.1 percent in June after a 0.2 percent gain in May.
In the 12 months through June the core PCE increased 1.6 percent. It has risen by the same margin since March. The core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and is running below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. 
Consumer spending in June was lifted by a 0.7 percent rise in purchases of non-durable goods. Spending on services increased 0.5 percent, but outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods such as automobiles fell 0.3 percent. 
Spending increased despite personal income rising only 0.2 percent in June after a similar gain in May. Wages and salaries advanced 0.3 percent after rising 0.2 percent in May. With spending outpacing income, savings fell to $732 billion, the lowest level since March 2015.

""The good news is that this still leaves at least some scope for households to draw on their savings in the second half of the year,"" said Steve Murphy, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2016 05:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone producer prices rise more than expected in June,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone producer prices rose by more than expected in June for a second consecutive month, driven by soaring energy prices, figures from the European Union's statistics office Eurostat showed on Tuesday.
Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro increased 0.7 percent in monthly terms for a 3.1 percent year-on-year decline.
Both figures were above market forecasts. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected a 0.4 percent month-on-month rise and a 3.5 percent drop on a yearly basis.
Eurostat also slightly revised up the May yearly figure to -3.8 percent from the initial estimate of a fall of -3.9 percent.
The surge of producer prices in June on a monthly basis follows the 0.6 percent increase recorded the previous month and is the highest in 2016.
The headline figure is a positive sign for the European Central Bank which has been struggling for years to fight ultra-low inflation in the euro zone.
However, industry prices excluding the more volatile component of energy rose monthly only 0.2 percent, the same as in May.
Energy was the key component to drive euro zone producer prices up in June, recording a month-on-month 2.4 percent rise as oil became less cheap.
The June increase follows the sharp rise in May when energy prices went up 1.8 percent, slightly more than the 1.7 percent leap initially estimated by Eurostat.
Prices of intermediate goods grew 0.3 percent and non-durable consumer goods, such as clothing, were up 0.1 percent month-on-month, the same upswing recorded for prices of capital goods, like machinery.
Monthly prices of durable consumer goods, such as cars and fridges, were flat in June, confirming the zero growth of the previous month.

1307,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 02, 2016 04:31AM ET</span>",U.K. construction PMI slips further into contraction in July,"Investing.com - U.K. construction sector activity slipped further into contraction in July though new orders decreased at a slower pace, industry data showed on Tuesday.
In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index fell to a seasonally adjusted 45.9 from June’s reading of 46.0.
Economists had expected the index to drop to 43.8 in July.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The data showed the fastest overall drop in output since June 2009 with all three sub-categories recording lower output, led by commercial activity.
Though the report showed that new orders fell at a slower pace than in June, the survey revealed a drop in confidence to the 12-month business outlook to its lowest since April 2013.
Markit senior economist Tim Moore noted that the current survey was the first to be compiled entirely after the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union and confirmed “a clear loss of momentum since the second quarter of 2016, led by a steep and accelerated decline in commercial building.”
“U.K. construction firms frequently cited ongoing economic uncertainty as having a material negative impact on their order books,” Moore explained.
Moore signaled that there were positive points such as the fact that the decline in construction output was little-changed from June’s seven-year low and some reports showed that demand patterns had been more resilient than expected given the uncertain business outlook.
“Reflecting this, new order volumes and purchasing activity both dropped at asloightly slower pace than in the previous month,” Moore said.
Immediately following the report, cable strengthened on the better-than-expected read. GBP/USD was trading at 1.3215 from around 1.3197 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8474 from 0.8485 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading lower. London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.84%, the Euro Stoxx 50 lost 1.59%, France's CAC 40 traded down 1.61%, while Germany's DAX shed 1.37%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity eased in July amid shrinking order backlogs and declining employment, while an unexpected drop in construction spending in June suggested second-quarter economic was probably even weaker than reported last week.
The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) report on Monday also showed manufacturers ramping up production to an 18-month high even as factories continued to draw down inventories, which some economists said pointed to moderate growth in the sector. 
Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina, said it was counterintuitive for manufacturers to step up production while cutting payrolls and running down inventories, given that production is a coincident indicator for the economy. 
""Perhaps the inventory drawdown has left stockrooms too spare, resulting in production increases as orders pick up,"" Quinlan said. ""These crosscurrents are explained somewhat by the fact that we are late in the economic cycle and businesses are understandably cautious with all the various risk factors.""
ISM said its index of national factory activity slipped 0.6 percentage point to a reading of 52.6 last month. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The index has now increased for five straight months.
Manufacturers reported a moderate slowdown in new orders as well as export order growth. Order backlogs contracted as did factory employment and inventories, though the pace of destocking slowed. Manufacturers also reported that their customers continued to view inventories as too high.
An outright drop in business inventories weighed on economic growth in the second quarter, with gross domestic product rising at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate after increasing at a 0.8 percent pace in the first quarter. 
Manufacturing remains constrained by the lagging effects of the dollar's rally and an oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015, which have hurt exports and undercut business spending. With the dollar rising in recent months and oil prices slumping again, economists see little upside for manufacturing.
'HAND-TO-MOUTH' GROWTH
""Any growth in manufacturing is of the hand-to-mouth variety rather than a vibrant expansion,"" said Michael Montgomery, U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
""With the recent strength in the dollar still not fully reflected in imports and exports yet, we will need the data to be more convincing to call this anything more than almost stalled.""
U.S. financial markets largely ignored the data. The S&P 500 index (SPX) hit an intraday record high before falling into negative territory. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell, while the dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending declined 0.6 percent to its lowest level since June 2015 after dipping 0.1 percent May. June marked the third straight month of declines in outlays. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.5 percent in June after a previously reported0.8 percent drop in May. Their June estimates were largely based on the government's assumptions for private residential and nonresidential construction spending in the advance GDP report.
""The assumptions for June construction spending plugged into the advance GDP estimate were optimistic,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. 
""The government hasn't released all of their assumptions yet, but these figures look consistent with second-quarter GDP growth being revised down to 1.1 percent or 1.0 percent.""  
Weak spending on home building and nonresidential structures, including gas and oil well drilling, contributed to anemic growth in the last quarter.
In June, construction spending was held down by a 0.6percent drop in private construction. Outlays on private residential construction were unchanged as spending on both single-family and multi-family projects fell. Private residential construction spending edged up 0.1 percent in May. 
Spending on private nonresidential structures fell 1.3 percent in June, the biggest decline since December 2015, after rising 0.4 percent in May. 
Public construction spending slipped 0.6 percent in June, dropping for a fourth straight month. 

Outlays on state and local government construction projects, the largest portion of the public sector segment, fell 0.5 percent, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. Federal government construction spending dropped 2.3 percent in June.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 52.6 from 53.2 the month before. The reading was just below expectations of 53.0 from a Reuters poll of 50 economists.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector and a reading below 50 indicates contraction.
""It's a nice, well-balanced report. Comments were mixed leaning on the positive side,"" said Bradley Holcomb, chair of the ISM manufacturing business survey committee on a conference call with reporters.

New orders dropped to 56.9 from 57.0. The prices paid index fell to 55.0 from 60.5, compared to expectations of 60.0.
“With Brexit, keeping (a) close eye on how this will impact our business,” a chemical producer told the group for its latest survey. 
Of the 18 manufacturing industries ISM tracks for its monthly survey, 11 of them including petroleum and coal reported growth last month.
“Oil and gas industry sector continues to realign staff to reflect $40-$50/barrel oil. This price range is seen as the new normal for the foreseeable future,” a company official told the group. 

U.S. oil futures (CLc1) fell almost 15 percent in July for their steepest one-month loss in a year due to concerns about global oversupply. They were last down over 2 percent at $40.66 a barrel in early U.S. trading on Monday.

PRAGUE/WARSAW (Reuters) - Factory activity in the Czech Republic unexpectedly shrank in July for the first time since April 2013 and barely grew in Poland, surveys showed on Monday, suggesting a decline in output ahead.
Central Europe's growth has outpaced most of the European Union's, but it now faces a slowdown in EU development funds as a new funding period gets under way. It also must contend with the potential effects of Britain's vote in June to quit the EU.
The headline Czech manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 49.3 in July, below the 50-point mark dividing expansion from contraction. That was down from 51.8 in June and below a forecast of 52.1 points in a Reuters poll.
In Poland, manufacturing growth slowed to its lowest level since September 2014 to a reading of 50.3, down from 51.8 the month before. Only Hungary's PMI, compiled using a different methodology, rose, to 53.9 from 50.9.
""Industry is hit hard by slower investment activity, dragged down by the low inflow of EU funds,"" said Jana Steckerova, an economist with Komercni Banka in Prague.
The Czech and Polish surveys showed their first drop in new orders for several years, with the former the lowest in three years and the latter near a two-year low.
A survey last week showed manufacturers in Germany, a major trade partner for the region, grew more pessimistic about exports after the British vote. However, PMI data on Monday signaled steady growth last month.
Some Czech companies reported weaker trade with Russia and Slovakia, according to Markit.
Capital Economics analysts said Monday's PMI readings suggest growth in industrial production growth will slow to around 2 percent in central Europe in the coming months.
""That said, we'd caution against reading too much into last month's figures,"" William Jackson, senior emerging markets economist, said in a note.
He said the surveys contradicted similar data released by the European Commission. ""One possible explanation for this is that the PMIs may have captured more of the initial hit to sentiment from the UK’s referendum than the EC survey,"" he said.
Analysts have also noted any real impact from Brexit would only come later. For now, a slower flow of EU funds is having an effect.
The Czech finance ministry reported last week that EU funds collection dropped to a net 66.6 billion crowns ($2.73 billion) in the first half, down from a record 126.8 billion a year ago.
The ministry also lowered its forecast for economic growth in 2016 to 2.2 percent -- less than half the 4.6 percent expansion in 2015 -- from a previous forecast of 2.5 percent.
In Poland, where economic growth slowed in the first quarter for the first time in more than two years, the government expects fresh EU funds to start fuelling the economy again in the third or fourth quarter.

1322,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 01, 2016 04:31AM ET</span>",U.K. manufacturing PMI hits worst level since early 2013 in July,"Investing.com – The contraction in manufacturing activity in the U.K. in July was confirmed to be worse that initially estimated, hitting its worst level since early 2013, according to industry data released on Monday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI fell to a seasonally adjusted 48.2 last month from a reading of 52.1 in June.
That was its worst level since 2013 and came below the a preliminary report released on July 22 that had shown the PMI drop to 49.1 in July.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
In the report, Markit indicated that the domestic market was hit by uncertainty both before and after the U.K.’s June 23 referendum that resulted in a decision for Britain to leave the European Union (EU), known as a Brexit.
Still, the market research group noted that weaker sterling exchange rates aided new export order growth.
“The weakening order book trend and upswing in cost inflation point to further near-term pain for manufacturers,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said.
“On that score, the weak numbers provide powerful arguments for swift policy action to avert the downturn becoming more embedded and help to hopefully play a part in restoring confidence and driving a swift recovery,” Dobson added.
The Bank of England will release its rate decision, minutes of its Monetary Policy Committee meeting and its quarterly inflation report on Thursday.
A Reuters poll of economists published on July 26 predicted the British central bank would cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25% from 0.50%, but most said it would not revive its massive bond-buying program for now.
After the report, the pound weakened. GBP/USD was trading at 1.3209 from around 1.3229 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8459, compared to 0.8444 prior to the report.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading higher. London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.37%, the Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.47%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.43%, while Germany's DAX traded up 0.87%."

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index for the bloc fell to 52.0 in July from 52.8, just beating a flash estimate of 51.9. An index measuring output held comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction at June's 53.9.
""The problem is that growth is looking increasingly lop-sided, which will worry policymakers and add to calls for further stimulus from the ECB,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
""Dig deeper beyond the headline numbers and more worrying pictures appear. Expansions in output and employment are clearly being driven to a large extent by surging growth in Germany, while growth has almost stalled in both Italy and Spain, and contractions are being seen in France and Greece.""
The ECB kept interest rates unchanged last month but left the door open to more policy stimulus, highlighting ""great"" uncertainty and abundant risks to the economic outlook. It will soon be forced to extend and expand the scope of its asset purchase program, a Reuters poll found.[ECILT/EU]
The ECB will no doubt welcome a rise in the output price index to 49.9 from 49.3, its highest reading in nearly a year and an indication that factories are only barely cutting prices. Nevertheless, that still leaves the bank far short of its goal of an overall inflation rate of just below 2 percent.

Official data on Friday showed inflation was higher than expected last month, increasing to 0.2 per cent year-on-year. But the rate of economic expansion halved in the second quarter as French growth ground to a halt.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector eased unexpectedly in July as orders cooled and flooding disrupted business, an official survey showed, adding to fears the economy will slow in coming months unless the government steps up a huge spending spree.
While a similar private survey showed business picked up for the first time in 17 months, the increase was only slight and the much larger official survey on Monday suggested China's overall industrial activity remains sluggish at best.
Both surveys showed persistently weak demand at home and abroad were forcing companies to continue to shed jobs, even as Beijing vows to shut more industrial overcapacity that could lead to larger layoffs.
And other readings on Monday pointed to signs of cooling in both the construction industry and real estate, which were key drivers behind better-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 49.9 in July from the previous month's 50.0 and below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts polled by Reuters predicted a level of 50.0.
While the July reading showed only a slight loss of momentum, Nomura's chief China economist Yang Zhao said it may be a sign that the impact of stimulus measures earlier this year may already be wearing off.
That has created a dilemma for Beijing as the Communist Party seeks to deliver on official targets, even as concerns grow about the risks of prolonged, debt-fueled stimulus.
""The government has realized the downward pressure is great but they've also realized that stimulus to stimulate the economy continuously is not a good idea and they want to continue to focus on reform and deleveraging,"" Zhao said.
Heavy flooding, particularly along the Yangtze River, contributed to July's manufacturing contraction along with slowing demand and the cutting of overcapacity in some industries, the statistics bureau said.
Falling activity at smaller firms also was a key reason for July's poor figure, the statistics bureau said, but performance at larger companies improved, in a sign that the government is becoming more reliant on big state firms to generate growth.
BUMPY OUTLOOK 
""Today's data do not bode well for GDP growth in the second half,"" ANZ economists Louis Lam and David Qu wrote in a note.
Fiscal policy would be the key tool for boosting growth in coming months, while the central bank was expected to keep its policy settings accommodative, they added.
While many analysts believe the world's second-largest economy may be slowly stabilizing, conditions still look patchy.
Industrial profits rose at the fastest pace in three months in June, but gains were concentrated in just a few industries including electronics, steel and oil processing.
Spurred by rebounding prices and stronger construction demand, China's steel output and exports have been near record levels. But it one of the key sectors being targeted by officials for capacity cuts and tougher pollution controls.
Indeed, the PMI showed factory output in July still expanded solidly, though the pace cooled to 52.1 from 52.5 in June.
Total new orders hovered just inside expansionary territory at 50.4, slightly down from June, but new export orders contracted as overseas demand remains weak and the impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union hurt sentiment.
A private PMI survey by Caixin/Markit was more mixed.
Its 50.6 reading was stronger than expected and the first expansion since February 2015, sparking hopes that some of the government's stimulus was starting to trickle down to smaller private firms which have been under greater stress than larger state-backed enterprises.
But overall order growth was modest and export orders continued to fall.
The Caixin report tends to give more weight to light industry, whereas the official survey is skewed more toward heavy industries, said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, according to Caixin.
An official survey on the services sector was more upbeat, showing growth accelerated to 53.9 in July from 53.7 in June. 
But it, too, contained several worrying notes, with construction services growth solid but cooling and the property services sector weakening, adding to worries that China's housing boom may have peaked.
    Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to pick up the slack as it tries to shift the economy away from a dependence on heavy industry and manufacturing exports.

The IHS Markit/Nikkei Japan Final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 49.3 in July, versus a preliminary 49.0 and a final reading of 48.1 in June.
But the headline index remained below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the fifth month.
The sub-index for new export orders was 44.5. That compares with a preliminary reading of 44.0, but showed overseas demand fell at the fastest pace since December 2012.

Recent gains in the yen have raised concern among policymakers and business leaders, because this tends to weigh on exporters' earnings and make Japanese products less competitive overseas.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) said its business confidence index fell to -27.7 for the period June 24 to July 20, compared with -0.7 from April 27 through to the June 23 referendum.
The survey of 1,000 chartered accountants showed that the construction, property and transport sectors suffered the sharpest declines in confidence.
ICAEW said the index fell ""drastically"" after the June 23 vote but then crept up. A Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank survey of 200 companies on Friday also showed confidence recovered partially after an initial dive following the vote. 
Still, the two surveys are unlikely to shift the view among economists that the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates to a new record low this week, and possibly expand its bond purchase program. [BOE/INT]
""Businesses have reacted however as you would expect them to,"" said Stephen Ibbotson, the ICAEW's director of business.
""Time will help rebuild confidence as they adapt and understand the environment, bearing in mind that the UK will still be in Europe for at least two years.""
Averaging its business confidence index for the three months to July 20, spanning before and after the referendum, the ICAEW said the index fell to -10.2 from +0.8 in the previous three-month period.
Separately, accountancy firm EY slashed its economic growth forecast for 2017 to 0.4 percent from 2.3 percent and predicted business lending would shrink by nearly 2 percent.
""While banks are still willing to lend, there is a strong sense of 'wait and see' from business and consumers as they await details of what Brexit will look like in reality,"" Omar Ali, UK financial services managing partner at EY, said.
Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' indexes, which gauge activity, new orders and sentiment, will provide a clearer picture of the health of British business activity since the referendum.

A one-off preliminary reading published last month showed services companies were especially hard hit by the referendum result. Final figures for the manufacturing sector are due at 0830 GMT on Monday.

Monthly gross domestic product fell 0.6 percent in May, topping economists' expectations for a decline of 0.4 percent.
The wildfires that started in May around the Fort McMurray area in Alberta disrupted production in the province's oil sands and forced residents from their homes.
As a result, output from the non-conventional oil extraction industry saw a 22 percent drop for the month. Activity in the goods-producing sector overall fell 2.8 percent, including a 2.4 percent decline in manufacturing.
However, there was little evidence that the wildfires significantly affected other sectors of the economy, the government's statistical agency said. 
Excluding the decline in non-conventional oil extraction, economic growth edged down just 0.1 percent in May. The services sector held up relatively well with a 0.3 percent gain.
Still, the figures were likely to underscore expectations of a contraction for the second quarter as a whole, due to the wildfires and a snap-back from strong export activity at the beginning of the year. Policymakers anticipate growth will rebound sharply in the third quarter.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2016 09:20AM ET</span>","July U.S. auto sales up 2.4 percent, full-year sales to drop: forecasters","By Bernie Woodall
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. July auto sales likely rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier, but full-year sales will not match last year's record, forecasters J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Friday.
LMC now expects that 17.4 million new vehicles will be sold in all of 2016, down 0.1 percent from 2015. It would be the first annual decline in U.S auto sales since 2009.
On Thursday,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) became the first major automaker to declare that the long U.S. auto market recovery was at an end.
Brian Johnson, auto industry analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), earlier this month changed his outlook for the U.S. auto market from ""plateau"" to ""eroding plateau.""
Johnson told Reuters that Ford's assessment of a weakening market was important for market observers.
""Ford acknowledged for the first time many of the pressures we have been talking about for the past few weeks,"" Johnson said. ""There's a big difference between analysts and writers saying this market is poised to get softer, and hearing it from one of the largest players in that market."" 
Backing out of medium and heavy trucks to include only vehicles in the LMC forecast, the midpoint of Ford's new outlook would be about 17.3 million vehicles, weaker than LMC's prediction.
While their annual forecast is getting more bearish, J.D. Power and LMC say July will be extremely strong, with a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales of 18.1 million vehicles. 
Johnson said July was an example of a strong month amid a weakening trend.
""This is proving to be a dynamic year in terms of automotive demand volatility,"" said Jeff Schuster, LMC forecaster.
LMC was the most bullish among a group of analysts that included Barclays, RBC Capital, Edmunds.com, Kelley Blue Book, WardsAuto and TrueCar, which forecast July U.S. sales on an annualized basis in a range from 17.5 million to 17.8 million vehicles.
On average, the forecasters said the four biggest automakers will see little change in their sales from a year ago: General Motors Co (N:GM), down 1.3 percent; Ford down 1 percent; Toyota down 2.7 percent; and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) up 1 percent, using the updated year-ago sales figures for FCA.
FCA restated its monthly auto sales dating to the start of 2011 earlier this week. 
J.D. Power said incentive spending by automakers rose in July to an average of $30,601 per vehicle, the highest for any month this year.

Major automakers will report U.S. July sales on Tuesday.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6 percent after a similar gain in the first quarter, the Labor Department said on Friday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI rising 0.6 percent in the last quarter. 
In the 12 months through June, labor costs rose 2.3 percent, well below the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target. 
Labor costs increased 1.9 percent in the year to March.
The Fed on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged, nodding to persistently low inflation. The Fed hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
Wage growth has been frustratingly slow, but there is cautious optimism it could start picking as the labor market tightens. 
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation. 
Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.6 percent in the second quarter. 
They increased 0.7 percent in the first quarter. Wages and salaries were up 2.5 percent in the 12 months through June.

They rose 2.0 percent in the year to March. Benefits for all workers increased 0.5 percent in the April-June quarter after rising by the same margin in the first quarter.

The EU's statistics agency Eurostat said gross domestic product (GDP) in the 19-country single currency bloc rose 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period, slowing from the 0.6 percent growth in the first quarter of the year.
On a yearly basis, euro zone GDP was up 1.6 percent, slightly less than the upwardly revised 1.7 percent recorded in the first quarter.
The quarterly reading was in line with the forecasts of economists polled by Reuters, while the year-on-year figure compared with 1.5 percent growth expected by the market. 
Eurostat does not publish GDP data on individual euro zone countries with its preliminary estimates, but the French statistics office did release figures earlier on Friday.
They showed growth of the euro zone's second largest came in at a worse-than-expected zero due to weak consumer spending, according to data released earlier on Friday.

In a separate release Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was stable in June at 10.1 percent after a slight fall in May, meaning that 16.3 million people were unemployed in June. Youth unemployment dipped to 20.8 percent from 20.9 percent in May.

A Reuters poll of 34 analysts had on average forecast growth of 0.2 percent, down from a revised 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year. The lowest estimate in the poll was for 0.1 percent.
Traditionally the main driver of French growth, consumer spending showed no growth at all in the quarter, which was marred by floods, strikes and violent street protests over a contested labor law.
Meanwhile, business investment fell 0.2 percent from the previous quarter, when many companies had rushed to take advantage of a tax write-off on some investments before its expiration. It was later extended for a year.
While domestic demand was flat, foreign trade added 0.3 percentage points to growth as imports fell more than exports, INSEE said. 
French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said in a statement that the figures were ""disappointing"", and reflected the exceptionally strong growth in the previous quarter and exceptional factors like strikes in refineries.
He said the government was nonetheless sticking with its 2016 growth forecast of 1.5 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy likely regained speed in the second quarter as robust consumer spending offset a sharp moderation in inventory investment and weak exports, pointing to underlying growth momentum that could be maintained for the rest of the year.
Gross domestic product probably increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate, which would be the fastest in a year, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The economy grew at a 1.1 percent pace in the first quarter.
""The economy clearly bounced back in the second quarter because consumers put the economy on their backs. Things are falling in place, the economy will continue to move forward,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The Commerce Department will publish its advance second-quarter GDP growth estimate on Friday at 08:30 a.m. (1230 GMT).
There are, however, downside risks to the forecast after data this week showed weak orders for manufactured capital goods in June, as well as a widening in the goods trade deficit and moderate inventory accumulation.
With the Federal Reserve watching the labor market and persistently low inflation, a pick-up in growth in the second quarter, which officials at the central bank are also anticipating, is not expected to have an impact on the outlook for interest rates in the short term.
The Fed, which on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged, said near-term risks to the economic outlook had ""diminished."" The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
""The worry for the Fed is that you have a two-sided economy with strong consumer spending but weak investment. They will continue to put a rate hike on the table but they will end up procrastinating,"" said Thomas Costerg, a senior U.S. economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in New York.
CONSUMERS SHINE
With the second-quarter GDP snapshot, the government will also publish revisions to data going back to 2013 through the first quarter of 2016. The revisions are expected to partially address measurement issues, which have tended to lower first-quarter GDP estimates.
Consumer spending was likely responsible for almost all of the rebound in GDP growth last quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is expected to have increased at its fastest pace since 2006.
That rate of growth is probably unsustainable, but economists say a tightening labor market, rising house prices and higher savings should underpin spending for the rest of 2016. 
""There are good reasons to expect strong consumption,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. ""As long as you see the strength in consumption continuing, that gives a very reliable marker of the underlying momentum in the economy.""
Economists expect a marginal impact on growth from Britain's departure from the European Union. They estimate that the so-called Brexit could subtract about two-tenths of a percentage point from GDP growth over the next year.
Businesses likely pulled back sharply on their pace of inventory accumulation, which could result in inventory investment subtracting as much as one percentage point from GDP growth. That would be the fourth straight quarter that inventories have weighed on output. 
But a smaller inventory build is a good signal for growth in the coming quarters. 
The lingering effects of the dollar's rally and weak global demand probably continued to hobble exports in the second quarter, while imports poured in to meet robust domestic demand. Trade is expected to have been a drag on GDP growth after making a modest contribution in the first quarter.
Business spending is expected to have contracted for a third consecutive quarter, the longest stretch since the 2007-2009 recession, though the pace of decline likely slowed.
Business spending has been hurt by lower oil prices, which have squeezed profits in the energy sector, forcing companies to cut capital spending budgets. Economists say uncertainty over global demand and the upcoming U.S. presidential election are also making companies cautious about spending.

Investment in residential construction and spending by the government likely fell in the second quarter. Economists say the decline will be payback after strong gains in the first quarter.

Market research firm GfK said its gauge of consumer confidence fell to -12 from -1 in June, the biggest drop since March 1990 - when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and Britons were reeling from interest rates rising to 15 percent.
By contrast, the Bank of England will probably cut rates to a new record low of 0.25 percent next week, according to economists who say plunging business and consumer morale since the June 23 vote will spur policymakers into action.
The GfK survey was worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll that suggested consumer confidence would tick up from a reading of -9 in a one-off ""Brexit special"" version of the survey published three weeks ago.
The actual reading of -12 was the lowest since end of 2013, and only a little worse than the long-run average of -9.
But pessimism about the economy's prospects in the next 12 months rose to the highest level since April 2012, when Britain last flirted with recession.
""We've seen a very significant drop in confidence, as is clear from the fall in each of our key measures,"" Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said.
""Its future trajectory depends on whether we enter a new period of damaging economic uncertainty or restore confidence by embracing a positive stance on negotiating a new deal for the UK.""
A separate YouGov/CEBR consumer confidence indicator on Thursday also showed a sharp fall, hitting its lowest level in three years.
Hard data about the impact of last month's Brexit vote on the economy has been thin so far but surveys last week showed corporate activity shrinking in July at the fastest pace since early 2009, around the nadir of the global financial crisis.
Official figures this week showed Britain's economy expanded 0.6 percent in the three months up to its vote to leave the European Union, although most of this reflected a surge in output during April.
Economists polled by Reuters this month said it was more likely than not that Britain will fall into recession in the coming year.

The average 30-year mortgage rate was 3.48 percent in the week ended July 28, compared with 3.45 percent in the previous week. The latest figure matched the one in the week ended June 30, Freddie Mac said in its latest mortgage rate survey.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer price inflation grew more than forecast in July but remained weak, preliminary data showed on Thursday, highlighting the limited effect of the European Central Bank's ultra-loose monetary policy.
The euro zone has seen little or no inflation for the past year, mainly because oil prices have plunged. The ECB expects inflation across the bloc to remain below its target of just under 2 percent for some years.
German annual inflation data, published by the Federal Statistics Office on Thursday, showed consumer prices -- harmonized to compare with other European countries (HICP) -- rose by 0.4 percent after a 0.2 percent increase in June.
The reading was stronger than the mean forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 0.3 percent.
A breakdown of non-harmonised inflation data showed that energy remained the main drag. Prices for food rose faster than they did the month before.
The German data is a further sign that the ECB may take more action in September, Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said.
""While German inflation may reach the ECB's 2 percent price stability ceiling in the coming months, it is unlikely to stay there for long,"" McKeown said.
""And with price pressures far weaker elsewhere in the region, the bank has reason to increase its policy support,"" she said. ""We see it cutting its deposit rate further into negative territory and raising the pace of its asset purchases in September.""
The central bank kept interest rates unchanged last week but left the door open to more policy stimulus, citing uncertainty and risks to the economic outlook and signaling readiness to act.
ECB President Mario Draghi argued that Britain's decision to leave the European Union and weak emerging market growth both dampen the euro zone's own outlook. 
For the euro zone, economists polled by Reuters expect the inflation rate, due to be published on Friday, to show a 0.1 annual percent rise for July - the same rate as the previous month.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2016 08:42AM ET</span>",Euro zone economy resilient to Brexit: so far,"By Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The euro zone economy has remained surprising resilient to the shock of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, fresh data showed on Thursday, a big contrast to the UK where signs of widespread economic pain are already apparent.
Euro zone economic sentiment improved this month, defying expectations for a decline, and German unemployment fell more than anticipated, supporting views that the bloc has so far shrugged off the impact of Brexit.
Still, Europe is unlikely to escape unscathed, economists argue. Export, investment and sentiment are likely to take at least a moderate hit in coming months as firms come to grip with the reality that Brexit in one form or another is irreversible.
""The stability/resilience in the euro area was broad-based across sectors in July and there is also nothing in the detail to suggest increased concern about the future,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Greg Fuzesi said. ""It is too early to draw strong implications for our growth forecast, but the initial news is certainly better than expected.""
Euro zone sentiment improved in industry, services, retail and the construction sector while the business climate index, pointing to the phase of the business cycle, also increased sharply.
Forward-looking indicators were also solid, particularly for employment and services, even as manufacturing expectations dipped, reversing some of the previous month's big gain.
Rebounding after a second weak quarter, Germany is again expected to be the engine of euro zone growth, preserving momentum at least for now. 
""Employment growth is robust and is set to stay high according to the latest sentiment indicators,"" HSBC economist Rainer Sartoris said.
""This view is supported by the number of unfilled positions, which keep on rising. The high demand for labour should continue to support wage growth, which will continue to support private consumption,"" he added.
Such an upbeat outlook is in contrast with data out of Britain, where sentiment plunged this month, with consumer confidence taking the biggest hit and losses recorded across all sectors.
The figures come on top of already grim reading in recent days, which suggest Britain may struggle to stave off a recession. 
British retailers suffered their sharpest fall in sales in four years after last month's EU referendum while the purchasing managers index, the broadest survey of business confidence, fell by the most in its 20-year history.
The weak figures, which negate the impact of a sanguine second quarter GDP reading, all but assure that the Bank of England will cut rates next week for the first time since 2009.
But any brush with recession is bound to spread at least in part to the continent, weighing on growth and holding back the euro zone's slow but steady recovery. 
Indeed, a broad survey by the European Central Bank last week indicated that Brexit would reduce euro zone growth by 0.26 percentage point next year, a significant chunk for a bloc that is growing at only around 1.5 percent. 
""Combined with the significant fall in UK confidence indicators, we continue to believe the eurozone growth will not be immune to the UK decision to leave the EU,"" Clemente De Lucia, an economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said.

""The analysis of sub-components suggests the impact is likely to take more time to be reflected in the data. We estimate the total impact of Brexit on the bloc at about 0.5 percent of GDP over the next year and a half.""

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 23 increased by 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 266,000 from the previous week’s total of 252,000, which was revised from the initial read of 253,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 7,000 to 260,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended July 16 increased more than expected to 2.139 million from 2.132 million in the preceding week, which was revised from the original figure of 2.128 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to rise to 2.130 million.
The four-week moving average was 256,500, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week's revised figure of 257,500 (initially 257,750).
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

ANKARA (Reuters) - The number of foreigners visiting Turkey plummeted more than 40 percent in June, official data showed on Thursday, marking the biggest drop in at least 22 years as tensions with Russia and a series of deadly bombings kept tourists away.
The decline is the latest in a string of bad news for the economy as political and security concerns erode foreign investor confidence. 
An attempted military coup this month has further bruised the outlook for Turkey's economy, once seen as a stand-out among emerging markets. 
Some economists have forecast that tourism revenue - a pillar of the economy - could drop by a quarter this year, costing around $8 billion, or the equivalent of 1 percent of gross domestic product. 
The drop-off is also likely to continue. 
In late June, 45 people were killed in bomb and gun attacks at Istanbul's main airport, an attack authorities have blamed on Islamic State militants. This month, a faction of the military attempted to overthrow the government in an abortive putsch that left at least 246 people dead excluding the plotters.
On Thursday, British travel company Thomas Cook (L:TCG) cut its full-year profit target, after the failed coup forced its customers to change holiday plans. Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean resorts and beaches are traditionally popular with European holidaymakers.
Tourist arrivals fell 40.86 percent year-on-year in June, with 2.44 million people arriving during the month, data from the Tourism Ministry showed. It was the biggest drop on record, according to the data, which goes back to 1994.
The previous record was set in May, when tourist arrivals fell 34.7 percent. Tourism has been hit hard by tensions with Moscow after Turkey shot down a Russian jet over Syria last year. 

While Ankara and Moscow have recently started to rebuild ties, tourist arrivals from Russia dropped 87 percent in the first six months of the year, the data showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. manufactured capital goods rose less than expected in June amid weak demand for machinery, suggesting an ongoing downturn in business spending.
Business investment remains soft despite data ranging from retail sales to housing suggesting that U.S. economic growth has regained speed after growth almost stalled early in the year. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.2 percent last month after decreasing 0.5 percent in May.
""Up is nice, but there doesn't seem to be a major drive on the part of the companies to invest heavily,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Weak business spending was acknowledged by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, as the U.S. central bank kept interest rates unchanged because concerns over inflation, even though it described the near-term risks to the economic outlook as having ""diminished.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.3 percent last month.
Prices for U.S. government bonds rose on the data and the Fed's interest rate decision, while the U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were trading marginally lower later afternoon. 
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, tumbled 4.0 percent last month, the biggest drop since August 2014, after declining 2.8 percent in May.
SUBDUED BUSINESS INVESTMENT 
Business spending has weakened since late 2015, in part as lower oil prices squeezed profits in the energy sector, forcing companies to cut capital spending budgets. 
Uncertainty over global demand and the upcoming U.S. presidential election are also making companies cautious about spending, economists said. 
Prospects for a pick-up in business spending are less encouraging against the backdrop of lackluster corporate profits.
""The bad news is not over. Everything conspiring against the durables sector in 2015 will remain working against it for at least the balance of 2016,"" said Michael Montgomery, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
""The hope for 2017 is that the adjustment processes start to wind down and produce less drag and token recovery, but that feels like a vampire drinking your blood slower.""
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, fell 0.4 percent last month after sliding 0.5 percent in May, suggesting business spending probably fell again in the second quarter.
Should spending on equipment drop in the second quarter U.S. GDP data due on Friday, that would be the first time since the 2007-2009 recession that outlays would have contracted for three straight quarters.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government will likely report on Friday that GDP increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter after rising at a 1.1 percent pace in the January-March period.
In June, orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components increased 0.8 percent, but orders for machinery dipped 0.1 percent and primary metals dropped 1.3 percent. Computers and electronic products orders declined 2.2 percent, the biggest fall since April 2015. 
Orders for transportation equipment slumped 10.5 percent, the largest drop since August 2014, as bookings for aircraft plunged 58.8 percent. Orders for automobiles rose 2.6 percent.
Pointing to sustained weakness in business spending, unfilled core capital goods orders fell 0.2 percent in June after slipping 0.4 percent in May. 

A separate report from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to purchase previously owned homes rose 0.2 percent in June after declining 3.7 percent in May.

Pending home sales for May were unrevised. The housing market has continued to strengthen amid historically low mortgage rates and almost six years of monthly job gains.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2016 07:40AM ET</span>",UK retailers report biggest fall in sales in 4 years after Brexit vote,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers suffered their sharpest fall in sales in four years after last month's vote to leave the European Union, raising doubts about the ability of consumers to stave off a Brexit recession.
Official figures earlier on Wednesday showed the economy as a whole grew fairly robustly in the run-up to the vote. But most economists are expecting a sharp slowdown as businesses and consumers retrench after the referendum shock.
The Confederation of British Industry said sales fell sharply between June 28 and July 14 and retailers cut orders with suppliers by the most since the 2008-09 financial crisis. 
""It's a bad start,"" HSBC economist Elizabeth Martins said. ""If you are looking for a relatively resilient consumer as we are then it's not particularly encouraging.""
The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates next week for the first time since 2009 and finance minister Philip Hammond reiterated on Wednesday that the government was ready to support the economy as it went through a ""period of adjustment"".
Sterling extended losses slightly to hit a day's low against the U.S. dollar after the CBI data, though the industry lobby warned against drawing too strong conclusions from the numbers.
""While conditions in the retail sector have weakened, we should be careful about reading too much too soon, as consumers were likely to err on the side of caution in the immediate period following a vote to leave the EU,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
The CBI data represents an early gauge of how the retail sector has fared since the unexpected result of June 23's vote. Surveys of manufacturers and services firms last week suggested the economy was shrinking at the fastest pace since 2009.
The numbers cover the period after the June 23 vote when the government was thrown into chaos by the ""Leave"" vote and the announcement by David Cameron that he would resign as prime minister.
The CBI said its retail sales volume index for July fell to -14 from +4 in June, its lowest since January 2012. Expected sales for August were also the lowest since then.
Orders placed with suppliers fell at the sharpest rate since March 2009 and were expected to decline rapidly in August too.
Low inflation and high employment levels might help sales bounce back in the short run, but in the medium term the big fall in sterling would push up prices, the CBI said.

""What businesses and consumers need now is calm and decisive leadership, a clear timetable and a plan for negotiating the UK's future outside the EU,"" Newton-Smith said.

1396,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2016 05:35AM ET</span>",British economy picked up speed in second quarter ahead of Brexit vote,"By Andy Bruce and Ana Nicolaci da Costa
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy picked up speed in the three months up to its vote to leave the European Union, data showed on Wednesday, helped by the biggest upturn in industrial production since 1999.
Sterling was little moved on the data and few in the financial markets expect the pace of growth will last into the second half of the year, with most economists saying the economy is at a high risk of recession after the country voted to leave the European Union.
Second-quarter gross domestic product beat expectations to grow by 0.6 percent, up from 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year, the Office for National Statistics said. 
Output in the three months to June was 2.2 percent higher than a year earlier, the strongest annual growth in a year and exceeding a forecast for it to hold steady at 2.0 percent. 
Much has been changed by the Brexit vote, however.
""The collapse in all surveys of activity and confidence undertaken since the referendum suggest GDP is on course to contract in Q3,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics' chief UK economist Samuel Tombs said.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said again after the data that the government had the tools to support the economy as it entered a ""period of adjustment"" as it prepared to leave the EU.
""Along with the Bank of England, this government will take whatever action is necessary,"" he said.
The improvement in economic growth in the second quarter reflected strong industrial output, services and construction in April, which largely dissipated in May and June.
That chimed with the view of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research that growth slowed markedly toward the end of the quarter. 
A closely-watched business survey last week showed corporate activity contracted this month at the fastest pace since 2009, around the nadir of the global financial crisis.
A Reuters poll of economists last week suggested it was more likely than not that Britain will slide into recession in the coming year.
The Bank of England, which estimated second quarter growth would come in at around 0.5 percent, looks likely to cut interest rates for the first time since 2009 next week, although economists are divided about whether it will ramp up its quantitative easing program. 
The BoE wrong-footed investors earlier this month by keeping rates on hold, although it held out the prospect of a stimulus package.

The ONS said the pick-up in growth was driven jointly by services and industrial production, the latter of which expanded 2.1 percent on the quarter - its best performance since 1999.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to be 50.0 in July, the same as in June, according to the medium forecast of 23 analysts polled by Reuters.
The neutral 50.0 mark separates expansion in activity from contraction on a monthly basis.
After expanding for three consecutive months from March to May, growth in China's factory sector stalled in June, suggesting a bounce in activity is fizzling out.
Second-quarter economic data was slightly stronger than expected, thanks to a housing boom and government infrastructure spending spree that are boosting demand for materials from cement to steel, but private investment growth has shrunk to record lows, suggested renewed weakness ahead.
Profits earned by China's industrial firms grew at the fastest pace in three months in June, data showed on Wednesday,
suggesting government spending is helping to ease financial strains for some companies. But profit gains were spread unevenly across industries and were concentrated in just a few sectors including electronics, steel and oil processing.
The data also showed debt levels continued to grow, and the statistics bureau said some firms are facing difficulty getting capital.
Sheng Songcheng, director of the Survey and Statistics Department at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), said recently that China has already fallen into a ""liquidity trap"" where increased money supply is being absorbed by firms that are not in turn investing the cash.
China's top leaders pledged on Tuesday to keep economic growth steady in the second half of the year, while creating favorable conditions for supply-side reforms, state media reported.
Authorities will continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy, Xinhua said.
The official manufacturing PMI data will be released on Aug. 1, along with the official services PMI.
Services companies reported a strong pick-up in new business in May, particularly for construction firms, but it was not enough to offset the downdraft from the ailing industrial sector.
The Markit/Caixin PMI, a private gauge of manufacturing activity, also is due on Aug. Analysts expect it to rise to 48.8, up from 48.6 in June, but still pointing to the 17th straight month of contraction.

1404,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2016 12:45AM ET</span>",China June industrial profits rise but investment challenges grow,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits earned by China's industrial firms grew at their fastest pace in three months in June, indicating government spending is supporting the corporate sector though uneven growth and soft investment pose headwinds.
Profits in June rose 5.1 percent to 616.31 billion yuan ($92.40 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday, the fastest growth since March.
""The bottom line is that the worst has gone in terms of industrial profits,"" said Raymond Yeung, an economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.
He said the improvement in China's upstream prices, as seen in the recent moderation in producer price index declines, points to a pickup in profits in the second half of the year.
Total profits for the first half stood at 3.0 trillion yuan, up 6.2 percent from the same period a year ago and compared with a 6.4 percent gain in the January to May period. 
""June profits accelerated from May but unfavorable conditions for companies continue to exist,"" NBS official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data.
He added increased profits were spread unevenly across industries, with profit gains focused on just a few industries including electronics, steel and oil processing.
Profits in the mining sector fell 83.6 percent in the first half from a year earlier.
Firms faced further difficulties accessing capital in June, he added.
The data, which covers large enterprises with annual revenues of at least 20 million yuan, come as investment cools and growth in home prices eased.
China's economy expanded 6.7 percent in the second quarter, but the slightly better than estimated growth rate comes amid a dangerous rise in both debt costs and inefficient loans to state firms. Private investment remains weak, with high funding costs becoming a major obstacle for private enterprises, according to the state planner.
Across several industrial sectors, lukewarm demand and a campaign aimed at reducing surplus has taken a toll on some of the largest state-owned firms.
Sinopec [600028.SS][0386.HK], the country's largest refiner, last week said crude oil production fell 11.4 percent on year. Meanwhile,  China National Building Material  co. (3323.HK) said it expects a substantial drop in profits in the first half due to a fall in cement prices.
Liabilities at China's industrial firms rose 4.6 percent in June from the same point last year, easing from 4.9 percent growth at the end of May. 
On Monday, a senior official from the state planner said China should increase government investment and not compete with private investment.
Profits at China's state firms fell 8.5 percent in the first half, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2016 01:03PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence steady; new home sales near eight-and-a-half-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence held steady in July and new single-family home sales hit their highest level in nearly 8-1/2 years in June, suggesting sustained momentum in the economy that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.
Other data on Tuesday showed moderate gains in house prices in May, which should support consumer spending and keep home purchasing affordable, especially for first-time buyers who have started venturing into the housing market.
The reports joined a slew of data, ranging from retail sales to manufacturing and services sector surveys, in painting a bright picture of the economy, and came as the Fed started a two-day policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is not expected to increase rates on Wednesday.
""The upbeat tone of these reports will offer further encouragement to the Fed,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. ""And while we do not expect any change from the Fed's current wait-and-see mode, the resiliency in household sentiment will underpin their confidence in eventually putting rate hikes back on the table.""
The Conference Board said its consumer index was 97.3 this month after a reading of 97.4 in June. Economists had expected the index to drop to 95.9 in July.
The largely unchanged reading followed Britain's stunning vote last month to leave the European Union, which rattled global financial markets and led to a dip in other consumer sentiment measures. 
The survey's so-called labor market differential, which closely correlates to the jobless rate in the employment report, improved this month after slipping in June.
""This report should be viewed as a lens through which to see the labor market and, along with the July readings on initial jobless claims, it continues to signal solid improvement in the employment situation,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
HOUSING BOOSTA recent rally on Wall Street, strengthening U.S. labor market and lower gasoline prices are supporting consumer confidence, helping to underpin economic activity. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government is expected to report on Friday that the economy grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, accelerating from the 1.1 percent pace logged in the January-March period.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by Tuesday's data, with stocks on Wall Street falling as weak earnings reports from several companies, including McDonald's (N:MCD), hurt investor sentiment. Prices for U.S. Treasuries dipped and the dollar (DXY) was slightly weaker against a basket of currencies.
In a separate report the Commerce Department said new home sales increased 3.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since February 2008. Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.6 percent of the housing market, rising to a rate of 560,000 units last month. 
Sales were up 25.4 percent from a year ago. Last month's increase left new home sales in the second quarter well above their average for the first three months of the year. 
The housing market is gaining speed with a report last week showing home resales vaulted to near a 9-1/2-year high in June. At the same time, single-family housing starts increased solidly in June. New home sales are likely benefiting from a persistent shortage of previously owned houses available for sale. 
New single-family homes sales jumped 10.4 percent in the Midwest and soared 10.9 percent in the West, which has seen a sharp increase in home prices amid tight inventories. But sales fell 5.6 percent in the Northeast and slipped 0.3 percent in the populous South.
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.2 percent in May on a year-over-year basis. Prices rose 5.4 percent in April.

""With the fundamentals remaining supportive, we anticipate moderate price appreciation to increase homeowner equity and encourage inventory expansion, contributing to continued balanced improvement in the housing market,"" said Kristin Reynolds a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's total exports in June fell for the 14th straight month, dampened by a slowdown in China, with the city's factories bracing for more pain in coming months from the impact of Brexit.
Open and trade-dependent economies in Asia such as Hong Kong are expected to be among the most vulnerable to a slowdown in global trade from Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union as the effects filter through factory supply chains, analysts say. 
Hong Kong's total exports in June fell 1 percent from a year earlier to HK$296.5 billion ($38.2 billion), government data showed on Tuesday. Total imports fell 0.9 percent, in its 17th straight month of decline, to HK$342.1 billion. 
In May, annual exports slipped 0.1 percent while imports dropped 4.3 percent.
For the first half of 2016, total exports value dropped 3.9 percent, while imports fell 5.6 percent. The city recorded a visible trade deficit of HK$199.6 billion for the first half period, equivalent to 10.8 percent of the value of imports.
""Looking ahead, the external trading environment remains challenging given the uncertainties associated with the outcome of the UK referendum in favor of leaving the EU, slow recovery in the advanced markets, monetary policy divergence among major central banks and heightened geopolitical tensions in various regions,"" the government said, adding it will monitor the situation closely.
Domestic exports to the United Kingdom, which accounted for 2.2 percent of the total, plunged 48.2 percent in June.
Analysts have said Hong Kong, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore look the most vulnerable to a slowdown in Europe.
""We think the main channel through which Brexit could impact Asia will be via trade, with the UK likely to fall into a recession and euro zone economy slowing down,"" Credit-Suisse wrote in a research note in June.
""Should the Brexit event result in a meaningful global growth slowdown, the economies which are most vulnerable will be the most export-oriented ones with limited policy space to respond to shocks. By these metrics, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Vietnam look most exposed, while China, India, and Indonesia should be more resilient,"" Credit-Suisse said. 
Hang Seng Bank (HK:0011) has revised Hong Kong's economic growth lower to 1.3 percent for 2016, from 1.5 percent previously, amid increased uncertainty from Brexit.
Hong Kong's imports from China in June rose 0.2 percent, while the value of total exports to China climbed 1.8 percent. 
There have been concerns of massive fake trade invoicing from China to Hong Kong, following a big discrepancy in China's reported exports to Hong Kong in December, and the value of goods recorded by the financial hub for the same period.

Companies signed up for $10 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up 3 percent from the same month a year earlier, said ELFA, a Washington-based trade group that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector.
From January to June, cumulative new business volume decreased 7 percent from the same period a year earlier, ELFA said.
June's loan originations were the largest since 2015-end but volume for January-June has fallen from the same period last year, ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement on Monday.
The uneven performance reflects continued slow economic growth and volatile equity markets in the United States, and ""troubling international events"" that are leading businesses to be cautious about capital investment decisions, Petta said.
Credit approvals totaled 78.1 percent in June, up from 76.5 percent in May, ELFA said.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it precedes by a few days.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT), CIT Group Inc and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Deere & Co,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and Volvo AB.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale fell only slightly in July, a benchmark survey showed, suggesting Europe's largest economy has weathered the immediate storm from Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
But fallout from Brexit, as well as strains to the social fabric caused by four high-profile acts of violence on German soil in the past week, could take their toll on sentiment in coming months, economists said.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Monday its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, fell to 108.3 in July from 108.7 in June.
The headline figure beat the Reuters consensus forecast of 107.5 and was the second highest reading this year. But it also marked the first fall in three months.
""This was due to far less optimistic business expectations on the part of companies. Assessments of the current business situation, by contrast, improved slightly,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said, adding: ""The German economy proves resilient.""
Sentiment in manufacturing, trade and industry and wholesaling fell, while retailing and construction improved.
Some German companies are holding off making investments in Britain until they know more about the relationship the country will forge with the rest of Europe following the Brexit vote.
MIXED PICTURE
A similarly mixed picture emerged from soundings on what the Ifo numbers said about the impact of the June 23 referendum.
VP Bank Group economist Thomas Gitzel said German firms were reacting relatively calmly. ""It could have been far worse. The Ifo index proves the theory that the Brexit vote will not leave deep dampening effects on the German economy,"" he said.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said Brexit was likely to cost the German economy 0.1 percentage points of GDP growth in 2016.
The institute now expects a 1.7 percent expansion this year and stuck to its forecast of 1.6 percent in 2017.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said fallout from Britain's 'Leave' vote was likely to dampen the Ifo index in the coming months.
""It would not be the first time that the Ifo reacts with a delay of one or two months to global events. Therefore, it is in our view too early to regard the Brexit vote as a non-event for economic sentiment in Germany,"" Brzeski said.
He also cited the ""alarming"" reality of four violent attacks in southern Germany in the past week that could significantly change the political mood a year before a federal election.
Wohlrabe said the attacks -- in the latest of which on Sunday evening a Syrian man denied asylum blew himself up and wounded 12 others -- could also dent economic sentiment in the near term.

""(But) a feeling of uncertainty caused by Brexit and other things can only be seen in some sectors,"" he added.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2016 01:53AM ET</span>","Japan June exports fall less than expected, offer some hope of recovery","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell less than expected in June in a tentative sign that overseas demand could be recovering from persistent weakness that set in last year.
Slowing decline in exports could ease concerns for Japan's policymakers as they try to revive growth via stimulus spending on infrastructure after their structural reform plans failed to deliver hoped-for results.
""Exports are showing signs that they have stopped deteriorating,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""The U.S. economy is a bright spot and should help Japan's exports recover. The (Japanese) government's stimulus plan is designed to help domestic demand, but without broader reforms they are just buying time.""
In its monthly economic report, the government said business sentiment has worsened, suggesting a much-awaited rebound in domestic demand is not guaranteed as companies may delay investment due to worries about overseas economies.
The 7.4 percent annual decline in exports in June was less than the median estimate for a 11.6 percent annual decline seen in a Reuters poll of economists, although it was the ninth consecutive monthly fall.
In volume terms, exports rose 2.9 percent in June from the same period a year earlier, the first increase in four months.
The trade balance hit a surplus of 692.8 billion yen versus a 494.8 billion yen surplus seen in the poll. 
Exports fell in June on declines in shipments of cars and steel, the data showed. On a positive note, Japan's exports of food, medicines and finished metal products rose in June from a year ago.
Exports to China - Japan's largest trading partner - fell an annual 10.0 percent in June due to falling shipments of chemicals and metal processing equipment. That was less than a 14.9 percent annual decline in the previous month as an increase in shipments of cars to China helped offset a decline in other exports.
U.S.-bound shipments fell 6.5 percent year-on-year, considerably less than the 10.7 percent annual decline of the previous month due to a pick-up in food exports.
Japanese shipments to the European Union fell 0.4 percent year-on-year in June, less than a 4.0 percent annual decline in May. 
Exports to Britain rose 3.7 percent annually in June, versus a 0.7 percent annual decline in the previous month, although there are worries that Brexit could yet disrupt international trade. 
Japan's imports were down 18.8 percent year-on-year versus a forecast for a 19.7 percent annual decline.
The yen  has risen around 13 percent versus the dollar so far this year, and some Japanese policymakers are worried about further gains that would severely erode exporters' earnings and increase deflationary pressure by lowering import prices.
The government kept its assessment of the economy unchanged in its monthly economic report released earlier on Monday but said business sentiment had worsened. The Bank of Japan's tankan survey found the corporate mood stagnated in April-June due to a strengthening yen.
The government is crafting a 20 trillion yen ($187.93 billion) spending package to stimulate the economy, three government sources told Reuters last week.

The BOJ is expected to ease monetary policy at a meeting ending on July 29, a Reuters poll of economists found, to boost anemic inflation.

On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The report further indicated that new business volumes expanded at the fastest pace since October 2015, while showing the strongest increase in manufacturing payroll numbers for 12 months.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson commented, “July saw manufacturers battle against a strong dollar, the ongoing energy sector downturn and political uncertainty ahead of the presidential election, yet still achieved the best growth seen since last year.”
Williamson was cautious about calling this the beginning of a stronger upturn, but still felt that data was encouraging after the second quarter showed the sector’s worst performance in over six years.
“In particular, an upturn in hiring which resulted in the strongest job growth for a year suggest companies are feeling brighter about the outlook and starting to expand capacity again,” Williamson concluded.

Inflation in the 12 months through mid-July rose to 2.72 percent , the national statistics institute said on Friday. That was above a forecast of 2.66 percent in a Reuters poll and the 2.55 percent rate in early June.
Mexico's central bank targets a rate of 3 percent. Despite relatively tame inflation and weak growth, a steep slump in the peso  pushed policymakers to raise interest rates by more than expected in late June.
The annual reading of the core price index , which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, ticked up to 2.99 percent in early July. Policymakers are concerned that the prolonged slump in the peso could hit inflation.
On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.28 percent in the first half of July , above expectations of 0.22 percent, with higher gasoline prices having the biggest effect. 

The core price index climbed 0.11 percent in early July, lower than forecasts for a 0.15 percent increase, helped by a drop in mobile phone costs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth was at its slowest since the start of 2015 this month as stronger performances in the two big economies of Germany and France offset weakness in smaller countries, a survey showed on Friday.
While the survey result was not as weak as predicted in a Reuters poll, the slight loss of momentum may be of concern to policymakers at the European Central Bank who have been trying to stimulate faster growth.
Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good growth indicator, dipped to 52.9 from June's 53.1, the lowest reading since January 2015. However, a Reuters poll had predicted a steeper fall to 52.5.
A reading above 50 indicates growth.
""Headline PMIs picked up for Germany and France but the overall (euro zone) one fell and the rest of the region combined saw the weakest rise in activity since December 2012,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
""There is a strong indication that Italy and Spain saw a deterioration in growth rates.""
German private sector growth hit its highest level so far this year while French business activity held up better than expected despite last week's Bastille Day truck attack in Nice.
The attack on holiday crowds killed 84 people and hurt hundreds, the third deadly assault in France in 18 months for which Islamist militants have claimed responsibility. 
Further muddying the waters, Britons voted on June 23 to leave the European Union, a surprise outcome that sent shockwaves through global financial markets and means the British economy may slide back into recession in the coming year. [ECILT/GB]
""It's a pretty pleasant surprise that the fall (in the euro zone PMI) was so muted. It suggests that Brexit is unlikely to trigger the substantial slowdown that many people are predicting,"" said Ben May at Oxford Economics.
Shockwaves from the vote did not pass Britain by, however, with a corresponding survey there registering the biggest drop in its 20-year history to suggest the economy is shrinking at its fastest rate since the financial crisis.
After the ECB kept policy unchanged on Thursday, its President Mario Draghi said the central bank was prepared to take more action to lift inflation and economic growth if necessary.
Inflation was just 0.1 percent in June, nowhere near the ECB's target ceiling, but the composite output price PMI rose to 49.6 from 49.1, its highest reading in nine months.
A PMI covering the euro zone's dominant service industry beat expectations for a fall to 52.3 from 52.8 by only nudging down to 52.7, still an 18-month low.
The factory PMI suffered a sharper fall, coming in at 51.9 versus June's 52.8, close to expectations for 52.0. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, fell to 53.6 from 53.9.
Giving a mixed outlook for next month, services firms increased headcount at the fastest rate since early 2008 but new order growth for manufactured goods slowed dramatically. 

Still, if maintained at this level, the composite PMI points to third-quarter economic growth of 0.3 percent, Markit said, in-line with a Reuters poll published on Wednesday but a sharp slowdown from the 0.6 percent growth seen at the start of the year. [ECILT/EU]

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash U.K. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index PMI fell to a seasonally adjusted 49.1 in July from a reading of 52.1 in June.
Economists had forecast the index to fall to 47.8 in July.
Meanwhile, the services PMI dropped to 47.4 in July from a reading of 52.3 in June.
Analysts had expected the index to decline to 48.9 in July.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit noted that the data showed that the third quarter had begun on weak footing as output and new orders both fell for the first time since the end of 2012 and service providers’ optimism over the coming 12 months slumped to a seven-and-a-half year low.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said, ““July saw a dramatic deterioration in the economy, with business activity slumping at the fastest rate since the height of the global financial crisis in early-2009.”
Williamson indicated that the only positive factor was the improvement in manufacturing export growth to its best in two years as the weak pound drove overseas sales.
According to his analysis, the data signaled a 0.4% contraction for the British economy in the third quarter, though he noted that it would depend on whether there was further deterioration in August or if July was simply a knee-jerk reaction.
“With policymakers waiting to see hard data on the state of the economy before considering more stimulus, the slump in the PMI will provide a powerful argument for swift action,” Williamson concluded.
After the report, the pound extended losses GBP/USD was trading at 1.3193 from around 1.3274 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8363, compared to 0.8308 prior to the report.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading lower. London’s FTSE 100 lost 0.19%, the  Euro Stoxx 50 gave up 0.29%, France's CAC 40 fell 0.25%, while Germany's DAX traded down 0.30%."
1440,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 22, 2016 04:03AM ET</span>",Euro zone composite PMI falls to 18-month low in July,"Investing.com - Economic activity in the euro zone fell less than expected in July, but still hit a one-and-a-half-year low, preliminary data showed on Friday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its Flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors dipped from 53.1 in June to 52.9 in July, above forecasts for 52.5.
The flash services purchasing managers’ index slipped to 52.7 this month, from June’s reading of 52.8 and better than expectations for a reading of 52.3.
The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.9 this month from a final reading of 52.8 in June. Analysts had expected the index to fall to 52.9 in July.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Despite the drop, Markit noted that the overall pace of growth remained only slightly lower than the average seen so far this year and employment rose at the fastest rate for almost five-and-a-half years as companies boosted capacity in line with the overall upturn in the economy.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said, “The eurozone economy showed surprising resilience in the face of the U.K.’s vote to leave the EU and another terrorist attack in France.”
Williamson added that the data suggested that the euro zone economy was growing at an annual rate of around 1.5%.
“Policymakers will be reassured by the resilience of the PMI in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the fragility of the recovery leaves plenty of room for speculation about further stimulus later in the year,” Williamson concluded.
EUR/USD was at 1.1031 from around 1.1023 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8311 from 0.8324 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were lower. The Euro stoxx 50 fell 0.40%, Germany's DAX dropped 0.36%, France’s CAC 40 slumped 0.40%, while London’s FTSE 100 dipped 0.22%."

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services activity that accounts for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to 55.3 from 54.4 in June.
This was the highest reading since December 2015 and beat a Reuters consensus forecast for 53.7. The headline figure has now been comfortably above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction for 39 months in a row.
The survey showed that growth in the services sector picked up again having slowed in June, while manufacturing lost some steam after a strong showing in the previous month.
""Strong tailwinds from a healthy labor market and rising demand are propelling the economy forward, while businesses so far seem to be unaffected by uncertainties around the UK’s decision to leave the EU,"" said Markit Economist Oliver Kolodseike.
The uptick in activity contrasts with a plunge in German investor morale in July to its lowest level since 2012, as investors fretted Britain's farewell to the EU could leave its mark on the German economy.
The PMI sub-index for manufacturing inched down to 53.7 as companies saw weaker growth in new business and added staff at a slower rate.
The sub-index for services rose to 54.6 helped by an increase in business activity. However, business expectations in the sector hit a nine-month low, signaling some companies were worried that an economic slowdown could hurt activity.
Despite this, Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said the outlook for the German economy was encouraging and it appeared that the Brexit vote was having very little impact.
He added that the PMI pointed to economic growth of 0.5 percent in the third quarter if the index remains at these levels.

The preliminary purchasing managers index for the manufacturing and service sectors rose to 50.0 from 49.6 in June, data compiler Markit said, confounding a Reuters poll forecast for a slight drop to 49.2. Fifty is the mark dividing contractions in activity from expansions, meaning activity has held steady in the month after shrinking a little in June.
""In the face of the terrorist attack and the Brexit vote, to have the index coming up to 50.0 in a stable economy is perhaps a good result,"" Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
The resilience came largely from the service sector, where the index rose to a better-than-expected 50.3 from 49.9 in June as the flow of new business improved and firms increased headcount.
The index for manufacturing remained in contraction territory, although it improved to a four-month high of 48.6 from 48.3 in June instead of the deterioration expected by economists polled by Reuters.
New orders from abroad grew for the first time in seven months, which Williamson said might reflect a weaker euro or that French firms might be picking up some business from British competitors after the Brexit referendum in June.
The resilience seen in the PMI survey chimed with a broader business confidence poll published on Wednesday by France's INSEE statistics agency showing morale rebounding unexpectedly in July.

The yen  has risen around 13 percent versus the dollar so far this year, and some Japanese policymakers are worried that further gains will erode exporters' earnings and increase deflationary pressure by lowering import prices.
The Bank of Japan is expected to ease monetary policy at a meeting ending on July 29, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters, to boost anemic inflation.
The government is also crafting a massive spending package worth about 20 trillion yen ($188.09 billion), three government sources told Reuters on Thursday.
However, economists worry that the benefits could be muted as spending will be spread over several years and rely much on private sector investment.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2016 12:01PM ET</span>","Strong U.S. home sales, low layoffs highlight economy's strength","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales hit their highest level in nearly 9-1/2 years in June as low interest rates lured first-time buyers into the market and the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, underscoring the economy's strength.
Although another report on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracted this month, a surge in new orders and shipments suggested the setback was likely temporary. 
""The economy is doing well and is weathering the global turbulence. With housing and consumers powering ahead, some of the clouds are dissipating and summer looks good from a data point of view,"" said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in New York.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 1.1 percent to an annual rate of 5.57 million units last month, the highest level since February 2007. 
It was the fourth straight month of increases and left sales 3 percent higher than a year ago. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales slipping to a 5.48 million-unit pace in June.
Sales were boosted by first-time buyers, whose share of transactions rose to 33 percent in June, the highest since July 2012. That compared to 30 percent in May and a year ago. 
The increase in first-time buyers, whose participation is considered crucial for a strong housing market, came as U.S. mortgage rates hit their lowest levels since 2013 on bets the Federal Reserve would be cautious about raising interest rates.
Britain's vote on June 23 to leave the European Union has also put downward pressure on borrowing costs for home buyers as investors pile into safe-haven U.S. government debt.
The housing market is being supported by a strengthening labor market, but sales remain constrained by a persistent shortage of properties available for sale, which is keeping home prices elevated. There were 2.12 million previously owned homes on the market last month, down 0.9 percent from June. 
The median price for a previously owned house rose 4.8 percent from a year ago to a record $247,700 in June.
""We expect this buoyant performance to continue during the second half of this year, underpinned by strong employment growth, low mortgage rates and continued confidence in the economic recovery,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The broader PHLX housing index (HGX), including builders, building products and mortgage companies, was down 0.14 percent, tracking a slightly weak U.S. stocks market.
BUOYANT LABOR MARKET 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, after the European Central Bank gave no hint that it was set on easing policy further in September to support growth. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 253,000 for the week ended July 16, the lowest reading since April. Claims are near the 43-year low of 248,000 touched in mid-April. 
Economists had forecast initial claims rising to 265,000 in the latest week. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 72 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,250 to 257,750 last week.
The claims data covered the survey week for July's nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 9,000 between the June and July periods, suggesting another month of strong job gains. The economy added a whopping 287,000 jobs in June, the largest this year.
""The claims data continue to signal very low layoffs and that the employment report for July will be solid,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""These data point to a further tightening of the labor market in terms of readily employable underutilized labor.""
Labor market strength is boosting consumer spending and the housing market, which in turn are providing a lift to economic growth. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government is expected to report next week that the economy grew at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, an acceleration from the 1.1 percent pace logged in the first three months of the year.
In a third report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business index fell to a reading of -2.9 this month from 4.7 in June. But the new orders component rose to 11.8 from -3.0 in June and shipments rebounded to 6.3 from -2.1 in June.

Manufacturing has been hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand, which have undercut U.S. exports, as well as efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang. Lower oil prices have also weighed on manufacturing as energy firms cut back on capital spending in response to reduced profits.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday existing home sales increased 1.1 percent to an annual rate of 5.57 million units last month, the highest level since February 2007. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 5.48 million-unit pace in June. Sales were up 3 percent from a year ago.
May's sales pace was revised slightly lower to 5.51 million units from the previously reported 5.53 million units.
U.S. mortgage rates fell in June to their lowest levels since 2013 on bets the Federal Reserve would be cautious about raising short-term rates. Mortgage rates have declined further since Britain voted on June 23 to leave the European Union.
""Maybe that has induced some first-time buyers to come back into the market,"" NAR economist Lawrence Yun said.
First-time buyers made up 33 percent of sales in June, the biggest share in nearly four years, the NAR said.
Home sales have become a bright spot for the U.S. economy and add to recent retail sales data in suggesting economic activity remains on solid footing despite a growth slowdown earlier in the year and concerns over the impact of Britain's EU vote on global financial conditions.
Existing home sales jumped 3.8 percent in the Midwest and rose 1.7 percent in the West. Sales were flat in the South and fell 1.3 percent in the Northeast.
The number of unsold homes on the market in June dropped 0.9 percent to 2.12 million units. With inventory relatively tight, the median house price rose 4.8 percent from a year ago to a record $247,700 last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at Japanese manufacturers held steady in July but was expected to worsen to zero in the next three months, a Reuters poll found, as Britain's vote to exit the European Union further clouded the outlook for Japan's export-reliant economy.
The Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey, also found the service sector's mood fell in July to levels last seen in April 2013 when the BOJ embarked on massive monetary stimulus to reflate the economy.
The monthly poll of 534 big and mid-sized firms taken July 1-15, of which 266 responded, offered an early glimpse of Japanese business sentiment in the wake of the Brexit vote, which briefly prompted a sharp yen gain to below 100 yen versus the dollar .
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers was unchanged at 3 in July and was seen worsening to zero in October, dragged down by exporters of cars, electronics, steel and chemicals.
The sentiment indexes subtract the percentage of companies saying conditions are poor from those saying conditions are good. A positive number means optimists outnumber pessimists.
The service-sector index fell to 15 from 17 in June, and was seen unchanged in October, reflecting weak domestic demand.
Bleak business sentiment should add to calls for policymakers to do more to revive a flagging economy, with the government eyeing a stimulus package of 10 trillion yen ($94.62 billion) or more and the Bank of Japan under pressure to ease policy further.
""We cannot see the future, given the effects of a rapid yen gain due to Britain's vote to leave EU,"" a manager at a chemicals firm said in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
""Capital expenditures are being put off because of uncertainty over Europe caused by Britain's exit from the EU, as well as a slowdown in China's economy, and currency situations,"" a machinery maker said.
While the safe-haven yen has fallen to around 105 since last week as global risk aversion abated, manufacturers reported concerns over another possible spike in the yen because of uncertainty over the global economic outlook. 
Last week Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered compilation of an economic stimulus package by the end of this month to respond to weak private consumption and investment, and external risks. Speculation also lingers that the BOJ may ease again at its July 28-29 policy review.

The Commission's flash estimate showed euro zone consumer morale decreased by 0.7 points to -7.9 in July from an upwardly revised -7.2 in June. The June figure was previously estimated at -7.3.
Economists polled by Reuters had estimated a slightly higher drop, forecasting a consumer confidence fall to -8.0 in July.
The marked drop in July follows a slight fall in June and two consecutive rises in April and May.
The figures for the European Union as a whole showed a much worse drop of 1.8 points to -7.6, a level not seen in two years. The indicator for the bloc as a whole is now below the euro zone indicator for the first time in years.
The estimates released by the Commission confirm the post-Brexit vote downward confidence trend already seen in Germany on Tuesday when the Mannheim-based ZEW institute said its economic sentiment index sank to -6.8 points in July from 19.2 in June.

Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loans, climbed with a jump in benchmark Treasury yields in the wake of encouraging domestic economic data and Wall Street hitting record highs.
Thirty-year mortgage rates approached their record lows two weeks ago as the 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) reached historic lows on fears about the repercussion on global economic growth from Britain's vote to leave the European Union and bets on more stimulus from overseas central banks to cushion their economies from Brexit.
The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of total mortgage activity fell 1.3 percent in the week ended July 15 from the previous week.
The group's gauge on refinancing applications fell 1 percent from the prior week when it reached its highest level since June 2013. 
The group's seasonally adjusted gauge on loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, declined 2 percent last week.
The share of weekly refinancing requests was 64.2 percent of total applications, compared with 64.0 percent the previous week, the Washington-based group said. 
The average rate on ""conforming"" 30-year home mortgages, or loans with balances of $417,000 or less, rose to 3.65 percent, MBA said.
The prior week's 3.60 percent was the lowest 30-year average rate since May 2013 and not far from the historic low of 3.47 percent struck in December 2012, according to MBA data.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) touched a record low of 1.321 percent on July 6. It was 1.571 percent on Wednesday, up 1 basis point from late on Tuesday, according to Reuters data.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2016 04:50AM ET</span>",UK unemployment rate hit lowest since 2005 in run-up to EU vote,"LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - Britain's jobless rate fell in May to its lowest level since 2005 as the labor market strengthened in the run-up to last month's vote to leave the European Union, official data showed on Wednesday.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent in the three months to May, the lowest level since the three months to October 2005 and down from 5.0 percent in April, the Office for National Statistics said. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to remain at 5.0 percent. 
Bank of England policymakers will be watching closely how Britain's labor market reacts to the vote to leave the European Union, having warned slower growth and higher inflation are likely to result.
Wages continued to increase ahead of the referendum as expected, with pay including bonuses rising 2.3 percent in the three months to May - the biggest increase since October 2015. 
The recent increase in wages in part reflects the introduction in April of a new, compulsory National Living Wage of 7.20 pounds an hour for workers aged 25 and above, a 50 pence rise on the existing minimum wage.
Before the June 23 referendum, the International Monetary Fund and Britain's National Institute of Social Economic Research said wages, rather than jobs, were likely to take the strain of the adjustment from a vote to leave the EU.
The claimant count rose by 400 people in June following a rise of 12,200 in May, a sharp upward revision. June marked the fourth consecutive rise in the claimant count, the first such run since the months leading up to September 2011.
The number of unemployed fell in the three months to May to 1.646 million, while the number of people in work rose by 176,000 to 31.705 million - taking the employment rate to 74.4 percent. 
A survey from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation showed the number of permanent staff hired via 
recruitment firms fell for the first time since December 2012 - around the last time Britain's economy flirted with recession. 
Another survey of chief financial officers from Deloitte, conducted after the referendum, showed fewer than 1 percent planned to increase hiring in the next year.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders fell less than expected in June, a relief for the island's many factories struggling with a slowdown in China and worried about the impact of Brexit on global trade.
Export orders contracted for the 15th straight month, but declines narrowed from China and Japan and rose from the United States and Europe compared with May.
June orders fell 2.4 percent from a year earlier, less than a 4.75 percent drop projected in a Reuters poll and improving from a 5.8 percent slide in May.
Taiwan's orders offer an indication of exports two to three months ahead and is a gauge of global technology demand.
Orders from the United States rose 1.2 percent, data from the ministry of economic affairs showed on Wednesday. Europe, which some analysts said accounts for about one-fifth of total orders, rose 3.2 percent. 
""Brexit creates uncertainties in the financial environment and foreign exchange markets. Currently, we can't see an impact on our industry,"" Lora Ho, chief financial officer for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330), told reporters after the company's quarterly investor conference last week.
""It is likely to drag on for a very long time so we must continue to monitor it,"" Ho added.
TSMC is the world's top contract chip maker and an Apple Inc (O:AAPL) supplier.
Orders from China slipped 2.4 percent and from Japan, sank 16.4 percent. 

Leading indicators, however, pointed to output expanding for the first time in three months as new export orders grew for the first time in six months. The Nikkei/Markit Taiwan Purchasing Managers' Index for June rose to 50.5 versus 48.5 in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts rose more than expected in June as construction activity increased broadly, but downward revisions to the prior months' data pointed to a sector treading water in the second quarter.
Groundbreaking surged 4.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.19 million units, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Starts for April and May were revised lower, taking some shine off the report. Building permits increased 1.5 percent to a 1.15 million-unit rate last month. 
""Builders are building. But we have seemingly hit a lull and permit requests and construction activity are no longer accelerating sharply,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  
Economists had forecast housing starts rising to a 1.17 million-unit pace in June. Groundbreaking in the second quarter was a touch higher than the average for the first three months of the year, suggesting residential construction was probably a mild boost to gross domestic product in the second quarter. 
Still, the report added to data on employment, industrial production and retail sales in suggesting the economy gained speed in the second quarter after growth sputtered early in the year. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve left its second-quarter GDP growth forecast at a 2.4 percent annualized rate after the housing starts report. The economy grew at a 1.1 percent pace in the January-March period. 
The S&P 500 homebuilding index <.SPLRCHOME> dropped 0.31 percent in line with a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. Shares in D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the nation's largest homebuilder, fell 0.44 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) slipped 0.22 percent. 
The dollar (DXY) rose to a four-month high against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasuries were trading higher.
LABOR, LAND SHORTAGES 
The housing market is being supported by a strengthening labor market and demand for rental accommodation, but homebuilding is being constrained by labor and land shortages. 
A survey of homebuilders published on Monday showed scattered softness in some markets, with builders citing regulatory challenges as well as shortages of lots and labor. 
Groundbreaking on single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, surged 4.4 percent to a 778,000-unit pace in June. Single-family starts rose in all four regions, jumping by 31.6 percent in the Northeast and 7.3 percent in the Midwest. 
But with permits for the construction of single-family homes increasing 1.0 percent last month to a 738,000-unit rate, single-family homebuilding could slow in the near term.
""Demand for new homes remains well-supported by record-low mortgage rates. The approval process might need to speed up to prevent construction delays,"" said Sal Guatieri a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Housing starts for the volatile multi-family segment rose 5.4 percent to a 411,000-unit pace. The multi-family segment of the market continues to be supported by strong demand for rental accommodation as some Americans remain wary of homeownership in the aftermath of the housing market collapse.
But economists see limited scope for further increases, saying that much of the demand was being fulfilled. Rent increases for apartments have started to moderate in some cities and vacancy rates are edging up. 
""There is still a lot of supply under construction, as industry reports are showing rental vacancy rates coming off the lows and rent gains slowing. More of the surge in multi-family starts last year is coming on line now,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. 

Permits for the construction of multi-family building permits advanced 2.5 percent last month to a 415,000-unit pace.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Unease about Britain's EU farewell sent the mood among German investors plunging in July to its lowest since November 2012, according to the first major sentiment snapshot of the post-Brexit era in Europe's largest economy.
The Mannheim-based ZEW institute said on Tuesday its economic sentiment index sank to -6.8 points in July from 19.2 in June. That reading compared with a Reuters consensus of 9.0 and was lower than any of the economists polled had predicted.
""Uncertainty about the vote's consequences for the German economy is largely responsible for the substantial decline in economic sentiment,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said.
The plunge in morale to a level not seen since the euro zone was in the throes of economic crisis prompted some concerns that German growth could weaken at a time when the traditionally export-oriented economy is already having to increasingly rely on domestic demand.
Worries about the stability of the banking and financial system following the 'Leave' vote in the June 23 referendum in Europe's main financial center could also take their toll on Germany, Wambach said.
The ZEW index was based on a survey of 220 analysts and investors conducted from July 4 to 18, giving participants time to make an initial assessment of the impact Brexit could have.
Britain is Germany's fifth-biggest trading partner for goods and the German chamber of commerce has cut its forecasts for exports there, while the VDMA engineering association expects Brexit uncertainty to reduce demand for German goods.
The ZEW separate gauge of current conditions fell to 49.8 points from 54.5 in June - also below the Reuters consensus forecast for a reading of 51.8.
OVERDONE?
A broader take on fallout from Brexit will emerge on Wednesday, when euro zone consumer confidence data is due. Economists polled by Reuters have forecast a decline. 
Florian Hense, economist at Berenberg in London, said while post-Brexit market movements had been ""relatively orderly"" so far, the weak ZEW survey would worry policymakers at the European Central Bank.
President Mario Draghi would probably ""take a dovish tone"" at the bank's news conference after its rate-setting meeting on Thursday, Hense said.
But he also cautioned that sentiment data could ""overreact to uncertainty more than hard economic data"", and the euro zone economy should emerge relatively unscathed ""as long as the contagion risk is contained"".
Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank, agreed Tuesday's headline ZEW reading might be disproportionate.
It was yet to be seen whether the German economy would be hit hard by Brexit this year and the indicator could rise again next month. ""It's conceivable that the German economy will get off lightly."" he said.
The Economy Ministry in Berlin has expressed concern about increasing economic risks for Germany in view of Brexit but has declared Europe's economic powerhouse is still in good shape while the Bundesbank has said for now it only sees a limited near-term impact.

A survey by Frankfurt-based Sentix had already shown sentiment and expectations in Germany falling in July.

Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board
Financial Markets Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that financial markets had been volatile around the time of the UK referendum on EU membership. Despite large intraday movements in prices and much greater than normal volumes, market functioning had been resilient. Members noted that this event had provided a significant stress test of market structure in the wake of the regulatory reforms introduced after the financial crisis.
The most noteworthy developments that had persisted beyond the volatility immediately surrounding the UK referendum were the depreciation of the pound, the appreciation of the yen and the decline in bond yields to historic lows in a number of major markets as well as in Australia. Sovereign yields in the United Kingdom had declined considerably, notwithstanding the UK's credit rating being downgraded. Members noted that a sizeable share of the global sovereign bond market was trading at negative rates. Swiss government bond yields were negative up to a tenor of nearly 50 years. In Australia, the 10-year bond yield reached a record low of 1.95 per cent, with the decline in the yield on Friday, 24 June having been the largest daily fall since September 2001. Some bond spreads for financial institutions in the United Kingdom and Europe had widened a little, but most other financial market movements in response to the referendum had subsequently been unwound.
Expectations for the path of monetary policy in the United States had already eased prior to the UK referendum, with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) keeping monetary policy unchanged at its 15 June meeting owing to concerns about a slowing in the US labour market as well as uncertainties surrounding the UK referendum. Following the referendum, market expectations had declined further so that the FOMC was not expected to raise its policy rate again before 2018. Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) were expected to ease monetary policy further in the near future. The ECB had commenced its corporate bond purchase program in June, as had been announced in March.
Following the UK referendum, the pound fell sharply to its lowest level against the US dollar in over three decades. On 24 June, the pound depreciated against the US dollar by as much as 12 per cent and recorded the largest single-day movement since the pound was floated in 1971. Throughout the day, there were large volumes traded in both directions. Members noted that, as at the time of the meeting, the pound had depreciated by 9 per cent in trade-weighted terms since the referendum but remained above the levels it had reached in 2008.
Over the past month as a whole, the US dollar and euro were little changed in trade-weighted terms, while the Chinese renminbi had depreciated in both trade-weighted terms and against the US dollar. A decline in the value of the People's Bank of China's foreign currency reserves in May appeared to have reflected valuation effects, but overall the value of reserves had been broadly stable over the past few months.The Australian dollar had appreciated against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms over the past month, having been affected by changing expectations about the future path of monetary policy in Australia and the United States, as well as the UK referendum result.
Global share prices fell sharply following the UK referendum, but, with the exception of Japan and Europe, had subsequently largely recovered. Banking share prices were generally lower, particularly those of European and domestically focused UK banks. Members noted that ongoing problems in the Italian banking system had again come to the fore. In Australia, share prices had declined by around 4 per cent over the course of the 2015/16 financial year, with divergent outcomes across sectors reflecting the continued rebalancing of the economy following the mining investment boom.
Spreads on Australian bank debt had moved marginally higher following the UK referendum, but yields had remained at low levels. Members observed that Australian banks had issued a large amount of debt earlier in the year, limiting the need for further issuance in the near term if conditions in debt markets were unsettled. Average outstanding housing lending rates were expected to continue to edge lower as loans were refinanced following the cash rate reduction in May, although members noted that banks' serviceability requirements for borrowers had not changed.
Members noted that market pricing had assigned only a small chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting.
International Economic Conditions
Members noted that, while the UK referendum decision was likely to have an adverse effect on the UK economy, it was too early to gauge the size of that effect. Also, any adverse effects on growth arising from a reduction in access to EU markets and heightened political uncertainty were likely to be offset to some extent in the near term by the depreciation of the pound. In 2015, around one-half of the United Kingdom's exports (12 per cent of GDP) went to EU countries. Around one-half of these exports were services, of which around one-third were financial services. Estimates from the International Monetary Fund had suggested that in a relatively pessimistic scenario, in which output in the United Kingdom was around 5 per cent lower than otherwise over three years, global growth could average a little more than 0.1 percentage points lower over the next few years. Members noted that the direct effect on the Australian economy was likely to be quite small, given that only around 3 per cent of Australia's exports went to the United Kingdom and around 4½ per cent went to the rest of the European Union.
Meanwhile, growth in Australia's major trading partners looked to have remained a little below average over recent months. Growth in global industrial production had remained weak in year-ended terms, while growth in merchandise trade had picked up slightly. Inflation had generally remained below most central banks' targets, although core inflation in the major advanced economies had picked up since the previous year as labour market conditions had tightened further. Overall, commodity prices had risen over the month to be well above the low levels reached around the turn of the year.
GDP growth in the United States appeared to have picked up in the June quarter, after moderating in the March quarter, and the gradual recovery in the euro area looked to have continued. In both economies, activity in the March quarter had been driven by relatively strong growth in household consumption. Members noted that business investment had contributed to growth in the euro area and in the United States (excluding the energy sector). Growth in business investment in the United Kingdom had been moderating, which may have been partly related to the effect of uncertainty leading up to the UK referendum.Although US employment growth had moderated in May, the unemployment rate had declined to be below estimates of its long-run equilibrium. Inflation remained below the Federal Reserve's inflation goal, although it was higher than it had been a year earlier. The unemployment rate had also declined further in the euro area, although considerable spare capacity remained. Inflation had continued to be well below the ECB's target of 2 per cent or a little below. In the United Kingdom, the unemployment rate had fallen to around long-run equilibrium levels and core inflation had been picking up.
Recent data suggested that economic growth in China had continued to ease. Subdued conditions in the mining and manufacturing sectors had contributed to weakness in private investment. The output of some key industrial products, including steel, had been little changed over the past year, although iron ore imports from Australia had increased further. Members noted that the general weakness in industrial activity had been partly offset by an increase in public sector spending, which had been particularly apparent in the strong growth of public infrastructure investment over the past year or so. Dwelling investment had also picked up since late 2015, following measures by the Chinese authorities to support demand for real estate. Buoyant property market conditions, particularly in some larger cities, had more recently prompted authorities in some regions to introduce measures to constrain housing demand. Total social financing flows had moderated in recent months and overall inflationary pressures remained subdued.
In Japan, conditions in the labour market remained tight and base wages were rising at an above-average pace. However, inflation was still below the Bank of Japan's target of 2 per cent. In the rest of east Asia, recent data pointed to a continuation of below-average growth. Economic conditions had been relatively subdued in the higher-income economies in the region, in part reflecting their greater exposure to trade.
Domestic Economic Conditions
Members observed that there had been relatively little new data on the Australian economy since the previous meeting, most of which had related to labour and housing markets. Overall, the available data for the June quarter were consistent with a moderation in GDP growth following the stronger-than-expected outcome in the March quarter, mainly because there appeared to have been a smaller contribution to growth from net exports in the June quarter. Trade data suggested that iron ore export volumes had declined from very high levels in April and May, while coal export volumes had increased marginally.
Consumption had grown at around its decade-average rate in the March quarter. More recent indicators had been mixed. The value of retail sales had increased only slightly in April and May but liaison indicated that growth in retail sales had picked up in June, partly because cold weather had boosted clothing and apparel sales. However, liaison had also pointed to ongoing pressure to discount prices in response to increased competition in some retail markets. Meanwhile, survey measures of households' perceptions of their own finances had increased in May and June, to be clearly above average.
Survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained noticeably above their long-run averages in May. Members noted that these indicators were consistent with data and evidence from liaison suggesting that non-mining business investment had been growing in some parts of the economy that were less exposed to the effects of the decline in commodity prices and the fall in mining investment. Business credit growth was higher than a year earlier, despite easing a little recently. Liaison had suggested that the outlook for investment was relatively favourable in some commercial property sectors including retail, hotels, student accommodation and aged care. However, non-residential building approvals had remained at relatively low levels over the past year.
The unemployment rate had remained steady at around 5¾ per cent for some months, having fallen by around ½ percentage point over 2015, and the participation rate had been little changed of late. Following strong outcomes in late 2015, employment growth had moderated to be around its long-run average in year-ended terms. Over the course of 2016, employment growth had been driven by part-time jobs, while full-time employment had retraced some of its earlier strong gains. Members noted that, over the past year or so, the underemployment rate (which captures those who are employed but wanting and available to work more hours) had not fallen to the same extent as the unemployment rate. Employment growth had been relatively strong in the household services sector since the beginning of 2016 and construction employment had been rising. The forward-looking indicators of employment had been slightly weaker over recent months following gains over the preceding year, but were still consistent with employment growth in the months ahead.
Housing prices in June had risen moderately in Sydney but had declined in some other capital cities. This followed unusually large increases recorded in April and May, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Other indicators of housing market activity had been mixed over recent months. Auction clearance rates and sales volumes had been lower than a year earlier, although both remained a little above average. Housing credit growth had eased further, consistent with a relatively low level of turnover in the housing market and the earlier tightening in lending standards.
Recent indicators suggested that dwelling investment had continued to grow strongly, particularly for higher-density dwellings. Looking through the volatility of the data, building approvals were a little lower than a year earlier but remained elevated and implied a considerable amount of work yet to be done. At the same time, a number of measures were being implemented that could dampen foreign investors' demand for new dwellings. Several state governments had increased or were preparing to increase taxes on foreign investors in housing, while the major banks had increased restrictions on housing loan approvals for applicants relying on foreign income. Nationally, growth in rents had declined over the past year to low levels and the vacancy rate had increased to around its long-term average.
Measures of inflation expectations – from consumers, market economists, union officials and financial markets – had remained below average.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners looked to have remained slightly below average over recent months, in line with earlier forecasts. GDP growth in China appeared to have eased further, which was continuing to affect economic conditions throughout the Asian region. Monetary policy remained very accommodative across the major economies and was expected to remain so given that inflation was below most central banks' targets, despite improvements in labour markets leading to full employment in several large advanced economies.
The United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union had led to considerable financial market volatility, which had since settled. Financial markets had functioned effectively throughout the episode and borrowing costs for high-quality borrowers remained low. Any effects of the referendum outcome on UK and global economic activity remained to be seen. In any event, the referendum result implied a period of uncertainty about the outlook for the United Kingdom and the European Union. In the absence of significant financial dislocation, the staff's central case was that this uncertainty was expected to have only a modest adverse effect on global economic activity.
Commodity prices had generally increased since the previous meeting. At the time of the present meeting, the Australian dollar (in trade-weighted terms) was around the levels assumed in the forecasts at the time of the May Statement on Monetary Policy.
In the domestic economy, the transition of economic activity to the non-resources sector was now well advanced and recent data suggested that growth had continued at a moderate pace in the June quarter. Low interest rates were continuing to support household spending and the lower exchange rate since 2013 had continued to assist the traded sector of the economy. Members noted that an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the necessary economic adjustments.
Recent data showed that conditions in the labour market had been more mixed of late. The unemployment rate had remained around 5¾ per cent for most of 2016, having fallen noticeably over 2015. Inflation was still expected to remain quite low for some time given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world.
Indicators of conditions in housing markets had been somewhat mixed over recent months. Housing prices were recorded as having risen in Sydney and Melbourne in April and May, but were little changed in June. Building approvals remained elevated at levels that would add to the considerable amount of dwelling construction work already in the pipeline. Considerable supply of apartments was scheduled to come on stream over the next few years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. At the same time, however, housing credit growth had eased, in line with a lower turnover of housing and the earlier tightening in banks' lending standards following the announcement of supervisory measures. Various state government measures and changes to bank lending requirements were likely to temper foreign investor demand for housing.
Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding monetary policy steady would be the most prudent course of action at this meeting. The Board noted that further information on inflationary pressures, the labour market and housing market activity would be available over the following month and that the staff would provide an update of their forecasts ahead of the August Statement on Monetary Policy. This information would allow the Board to refine its assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation and to make any adjustment to the stance of policy that may be appropriate.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Overall sales plunged by about half and home prices fell sharply in the second quarter in the toniest enclaves of the Hamptons, New York's weekend haunt for the wealthy, as stock market jitters earlier in the year damped the appetite to buy.
Total sales volume in East Hampton fell 53 percent from a year ago to $44.7 million as the median sale price fell 54 percent to $2.38 million, according to realtor Town & Country Real Estate.
In Southampton, total sales fell 48 percent from the second quarter of 2015 to $45.3 million, with the median sale price falling 21 percent to $1.65 million, data showed. 
Only 12 homes were sold in East Hampton and 17 in larger Southampton, due to a lack of inventory and because sales typically lag when the stock market underperforms, said Judi Desiderio, chief executive at Town & Country.
""This is just a shift of the needle that I expected because 2014 was a high cycle for the high end,"" said Desiderio, who says luxury home sales in the Hamptons run in seven-year cycles. 
The stock market surged 30 percent in 2013, with record sales in excess of $100 million set the following year.
In the 12 submarkets that make up the Hamptons, sales volume slipped 18 percent from a year ago, with the median price falling to $999,000 from $1.1 million, Town & Country data showed.
Sales in the Hampton submarkets of Shelter Island and Sag Harbor surged after several years of poor performance. The median sale price in Sag Harbor jumped 37 percent to $1.43 million, and 27 percent to $950,000 in Shelter Island.
Third-quarter sales should pick up, in part because Wall Street touched record highs the past week and because the summer months are usually better, Desiderio said.

The property market is a key driver of the world's second-largest economy and a robust recovery in home prices and sales gave a stronger-than-expected boost to activity in the first half of the year.
But slowing price growth in smaller cities and cooling property investment show the bounce may already be fading, raising the risk of weaker economic growth in coming months.
Home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 7.3 percent in June from a year earlier, an official survey showed on Monday, accelerating from a 6.9 percent rise in May.
To be sure, some of the biggest cities showed eye-popping gains on a yearly basis, with prices in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen up 46.7 percent and Shanghai up 27.7 percent.
Gains on a monthly basis continued to slow, however, as cities tightened policies amid fears of a housing price bubble.
The monthly rise slowed slightly to 0.8 percent in June, easing from 0.9 percent in May, according to a Reuters calculation based on data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
""We continue to expect the property rebound to subside and property investment growth to fall in the second half of the year,"" economists at Nomura said in a note, predicting sales would stabilize and a large glut of unsold homes would keep pressure on prices in some areas.
""As such, our long-term view of a gradual (economic) slowdown remains unchanged."" 
Prices stalled or fell on a monthly basis in 15 cities in June, compared to 10 cities in May, with all of the weakness is smaller cities. 
Industrial cities Tangshan, Jinzhou and Baotou went from gains to declines month-on-month in June. 
First-tier cities maintained recent rapid price rises, with Shenzhen and Shanghai rising 2.0 percent and 2.6, respectively, on a monthly basis, faster than in May. That could raise the risk of further property cooling measures in some areas.
CRACKS IN THE FOUNDATION
The recovery in China's property market and a government infrastructure building spree in recent months have helped shore up growth in economy, which has been weighed down by weak demand at home and abroad, cooling investment and excess industrial capacity.
But there are increasing signs of fatigue in the nine-month-old property rally, raising concerns about both the economic outlook and banks' heavy exposure to mortgage lending.
Growth in investment in China's real estate sector slowed in first half to 6.1 percent, down from 7 percent in Jan-May, presenting a challenge for policymakers who need the critical sector to maintain growth without creating a price bubble. 
For June alone, property investment was up only 3.5 percent from a year ago, according to Reuters calculations, compared with 6.6 percent in May.
Policymakers are facing a tough balancing act. The concern is that tighter mortgage rules in the largest cities have not cooled prices enough, while fragile markets in secondary cities that are beset by oversupply likely need more stimulus to keep prices from sliding again. 
After the investment data on Friday, economists at ANZ said that China's property-led recovery was over, which could pose further risks to the economy in the second half of the year.

Twelve economists surveyed forecast export orders would contract for the 15th month in a row, but at a slightly slower pace than in May. 
The Ministry of Economic Affairs had said orders would remain negative in June even though it estimated that the value of orders should exceed May's levels.
Leading indicators, however, pointed to output expanding for the first time in three months as new export orders grow for the first time in six months. The Nikkei/Markit Taiwan Purchasing Managers' Index for June rose to 50.5 versus 48.5 in May.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia's exports and for hi-tech gadgets, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2016 07:50PM ET</span>",Asking prices for UK houses slip slightly after Brexit vote: Rightmove,"LONDON (Reuters) - Asking prices for British residential property slipped slightly more than usual after last month's vote to leave the European Union, though the overall impact remains hard to judge, figures from property website Rightmove showed on Monday.
Average prices for property advertised in the four weeks to July 9 were 0.9 percent lower than in June, a slightly bigger fall than the 0.4 percent drop typically recorded that month as demand softens in the run-up to summer holidays, Rightmove said.
""Perhaps unsurprisingly this July's fall is marginally larger, as political turbulence has a track record of unsettling sentiment,"" said Rightmove director Miles Shipside.
Compared with a year earlier, prices were up 4.5 percent, slowing from a 5.5 percent rise in June, Rightmove said. The website is used by most British estate agents, and Rightmove says it includes 90 percent of homes for sale.
Rightmove said buyer demand in the two weeks after the referendum was consistent with 2014 levels, but showed a 16 percent fall from 2015. Sales in June 2015 were boosted by a boom after the Conservative Party won an unexpected outright election victory in May 2015.
Other recent data has painted a much more somber picture. On Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said uncertainty fueled by the Brexit vote had prompted a ""marked drop"" in housing market activity, causing buyer interest and expectations of future sales to wither at the fastest pace in years.
Britain's decision to exit the European Union has sent jitters through global financial markets, triggered political chaos in Britain and sent sterling to a 31-year low.

The Bank of England said on Thursday it had revised down its forecasts for British house prices, and most policymakers expected to loosen policy next month, raising the possibility of even lower mortgage rates.

rose more than expected in June on large gains in automotive
manufacturing and utility output, the Federal Reserve said on
Friday, a sign that the economy was regaining momentum at the
end of the second quarter.
Industrial output increased 0.6 percent last month, the
strongest gain since July 2015, after an upwardly revised 0.3
percent decline in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial
production rising 0.2 percent last month.
The industrial sector measured by the U.S. central bank
comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
It has shown halting signs of improvement after a downturn
over the past 18 months caused by weak global demand, a strong
dollar and the fall in oil prices.
In June, however, manufacturing output rose 0.4 percent
after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent fall in May, while
production of consumer goods rose 1.1 percent.
Output of automotive products jumped 5.9 percent, while
machinery output was up 1.1 percent, the Fed said. Output of
computers, electronics and appliances increased 1.5 percent.
Business equipment production in June rose 0.7 percent after
a 0.3 percent fall in May. The Fed has become increasingly
worried about soft business investment.
The index for utilities rose 2.4 percent after a 0.9 percent
drop in May, while mining output rose 0.2 percent, a slight
softening from its May increase of 0.3 percent.
With overall output up, the percentage of industrial
capacity in use rose to 75.4 percent in June from an unrevised
74.9 percent in May.
The Fed sees capacity use as a leading indicator in deciding
how much further the economy can grow before sparking higher

In a report, the Federal Reserve said that industrial production increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% last month, better than expectations for a gain of 0.2%.
Industrial production dropped by 0.3% in May, whose figure was revised from a previously reported decrease of 0.4%.
Meanwhile, manufacturing production rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% last month, compared to forecasts for a 0.2% gain and following a decline of 0.3% in May, revised from an initial decline of 0.4%.
The report also showed that the capacity utilization rate, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose to 75.4% in June from 74.9% a month earlier.
Analysts had expected a smaller increase to 75.0%.
After the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1096 from around 1.1112 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3323 from 1.3336 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 105.97 from 106.01 earlier.

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2016 09:00AM ET</span>",Strong June retail sales point to solid domestic demand,"WASHINGTON, July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose more
than expected in June as Americans bought motor vehicles and a
variety of other goods, reinforcing views that economic growth
picked up in the second quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Friday retail sales
increased 0.6 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.2
percent gain in May. It was the third straight month of gains
and lifted sales 2.7 percent from a year ago. May sales were
previously reported to have increased 0.5 percent.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food
services, retail sales shot up 0.5 percent last month after
an upwardly revised 0.5 percent increase in May.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely
with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
They were previously reported to have risen 0.4 percent in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast overall
retail sales edging up 0.1 percent and core sales gaining 0.3
percent last month.
Coming on the heels of a surge in job growth in June and an
acceleration in manufacturing and services sectors activity, the
solid retail sales report suggested the economy had regained
speed after a first-quarter lull.
Retail sales will likely remain supported in the wake of a
rally on the U.S. stock market, rising wages and higher savings.
The steady stream of upbeat data and Wall Street's surge could
raise the probability of an interest rate increase from the
Federal Reserve later this year.
The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting second-quarter GDP
growth at a 2.3 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a
1.1 percent pace in the first three months of the year.
Retail sales in June were buoyed by purchases of building
materials and garden equipment, which jumped 3.9 percent, the
largest increase since April 2010.
Online retail sales rose 1.1 percent, while receipts at
sporting goods and hobby stores shot up 0.8 percent. There was
also a boost from furniture sales, which rose 0.5 percent. Auto
sales edged up 0.1 percent after declining 0.5 percent in May.
Americans also spent more on grooming.
Sales at electronics and appliance outlets were unchanged,
while receipts at service stations increased 1.2 percent,
reflecting recent increases in gasoline prices.
But restaurants and bars sales fell 0.3 percent and apparel
sales dropped 1.0 percent.

increased for a fourth straight month in June as Americans paid
more for housing, gasoline and healthcare, pointing to steadily
rising inflation pressures.
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price
Index rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in May.
In the 12 months through June, the CPI advanced 1.0 percent,
matching May's increase.
The year-on-year increase is below the 1.7 percent average
annual increase over the last 10 years.
Economists had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3 percent last
month and advancing 1.1 percent from a year ago.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy
costs, also rose 0.2 percent in June, rising by the same margin
for three consecutive months. That lifted the year-on-year core
CPI gain to 2.3 percent from 2.2 percent in May.
This increase is higher than the average annual rate of 1.9
percent over the past 10 years.
The Federal Reserve has a 2 percent inflation target and
tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.6 percent.
Concerns about persistently low inflation contributed to the
U.S. central bank keeping interest rates unchanged last month.
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in
December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Last month, gasoline prices increased 3.3 percent after
rising 2.3 percent in May. Food prices fell 0.1 percent, with
the cost of food consumed at home declining 0.3 percent.
Within the core CPI basket, housing and medical costs
continued to march higher.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3
percent after increasing by the same margin in May. Medical care
costs increased 0.4 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in May.
The cost of hospital services ticked up 0.1 percent and
doctor visits costs increased 0.3 percent. Prices for
prescription medicine jumped 1.3 percent.
But there was some relief for households. Apparel prices
fell 0.4 percent. The cost of used cars and trucks tumbled 1.1
percent. Prices for new motor vehicles slipped 0.2 percent.

In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices rose 0.2% in June from a month earlier, compared to expectations for a 0.3% gain and an increase of 0.2% in May.
Year-over-year, consumer prices were 1.0% higher from the same month a year earlier, below expectations for a gain of 1.1% and after having risen 1.0% in May.
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, in line with forecasts. Core CPI also rose 0.2% in May.
Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2.3% last month, which was also in line with forecasts but higher than May’s gain of 2.2%.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

Euro zone prices rose 0.1 percent year-on-year, Eurostat said, confirming its initial estimate of two weeks ago. Month-on-month, the increase was 0.2 percent.
The ECB's Governing Council meets next Thursday to determine whether its monthly purchase of 80 billion euros ($89 billion)of assets, along with zero interest rates and free loans offered to banks, are sufficient to prevent a deflationary spiral.
The annual rate was at least positive in June, but is well short of the ECB's target of just below 2 percent. Prices had not risen in the 19 countries using the euro since January, with deflation in three of the subsequent four months and a zero reading for March.
The ECB has promised to take any action needed to preserve financial stability after Britain voted on June 23 to leave the European Union. The Bank of England shocked markets on Thursday by not cutting interest rates as it awaits data showing the impact of the referendum vote.
Core inflation, which excludes the most volatile components of unprocessed food and energy, was unchanged at 0.8 percent in June. The narrower inflation indicator, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco products, rose to 0.9 percent from 0.8 percent in May. Both were the same as initial estimates.
Energy prices fell in June, but the decline slowed to 6.4 percent from a 8.1 drop recorded in May. Month-on-month, they were 1.7 percent higher.
Prices for services, the biggest component of the euro zone economy, rose 1.1 percent year-on-year, the strongest increase among the main components of the inflation index. They rose 1.0 percent in May.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2016 04:50AM ET</span>",UK construction output fell sharply in May in run-up to referendum: ONS,"LONDON (Reuters) - British construction output fell sharply in May during the run-up to the vote on European Union membership, suggesting the sector may drag on economic growth in the second quarter.
The Office for National Statistics said construction output, which makes up 6 percent of the economy, fell 2.1 percent in May compared with April, when it increased 2.8 percent increase. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.0 percent decrease in May in the often volatile figures.
Overall the figures added to signs that construction struggled as the June 23 referendum neared. 
The vote to leave the EU sparked fears of recession and raised deep uncertainties about Britain's future trading relationships, sending the pound to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since the mid-1980s.
The ONS said construction output would need to expand 1.9 percent in June to avoid dragging on economic growth in the second quarter - something that looks unlikely, according to private sector surveys.
""The fall in May 2016, taken together with the strength of April's figures, continues a longer trend of broadly flat output growth since the start of 2015,"" the ONS said.
Construction output fell 1.9 percent compared with May 2015. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 3.5 percent annual decline.
Britain's economic growth slowed to 0.4 percent in the first quarter, compared with the previous three months, according to recent estimates that showed the much larger services sector and household spending were the main drivers of growth. 
Financial firm Markit said the construction industry suffered its worst contraction in seven years in June as concern grew about the EU referendum.
Housing construction output fell 3.2 percent in May after edging down 0.1 percent in April, the biggest drop since February 2014.
Housing output has now fallen in every month this year apart from February, and things could slow further after last month's Brexit vote.
The result had an immediate impact on Britain's housing market, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. It said buyer interest and expectations of future sales withered at the fastest pace in years.
Separate ONS figures showed the volume of goods exported fell 11.0 percent in May, the biggest month-on-month fall since July 2006, while import volumes declined at the fastest pace since August 2014.

The trade volume figures had been due to be published alongside the standard cash value figures on July 7, but were delayed to complete quality assurance checks.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2016 03:20AM ET</span>",German residential building permits up 31 percent January-May,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - The number of German residential building permits jumped by 31 percent to over 148,000 in the first five months of 2016, data showed on Friday, suggesting construction will continue to support economic growth this year.
With borrowing costs at record lows, Germans are increasingly flocking to property. Higher state spending on social housing, also to accommodate a record-influx of migrants, is giving the construction sector an additional push.
The booming construction sector is currently one of the main growth drivers in Europe's largest economy. In the first three months of 2016, construction investment was one of the biggest growth contributors while net foreign trade was a drag.
But recent data show that building activity slowed in April and May. The lower construction output is mainly due the mild winter, meaning construction work was pulled forward and with it the usual spring recovery, analysts say.
The latest data from the Federal Statistics Office indicated, however, that construction will continue to support growth. Authorities issued permits for 127,140 new residential units and approved work at 21,251 existing buildings.
Approvals for the 'hostel residences' sub-category of homes, which also includes shelters for refugees and asylum seekers, more than tripled to 10,287 compared to the first five months in the previous year.
The total of 148,391 marked an increase of 31 percent on the year. This was the highest number of approvals granted in the first five months since 2000, showing that last year's positive trend in the construction sector is set to continue in 2016.
BLOCKED PLAN
In 2015, the number of residential building approvals rose by more than eight percent to nearly 310,000, the highest in 15 years. The number of completed residential units edged up 1 percent to some 248,000 last year.
Property experts say that at least 350,000 new homes are needed every year until 2020 to tackle a drastic shortage of affordable housing, caused by a growing urban population and aggravated by a record influx of refugees.
Even before the refugee numbers started to increase last year, there was an estimated lack of 800,000 affordable flats in urban areas. With demand outstripping supply, property prices and rents have soared in cities like Berlin, Hamburg and Munich.
In order to reach the goal of at least 350,000 completed flats, the government agreed to grant special tax incentives for investors who build flats in urban areas.
But parliament stopped the plan. Lawmakers said the tax incentive scheme was designed too broadly and would therefore also support the building of luxury apartments.

The federal government is now thinking about raising its funds for social housing again.

Car registrations in Britain, Europe's second-biggest car market behind Germany, fell 0.8 percent in June, the second drop in more than four years, weighed by a 20 percent decline in VW sales and an uncertain economic outlook.
VW, Europe's largest carmaker, is grappling with the biggest business crisis in its 78-year history after admitting in September it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests for toxic nitrogen oxide and in November that it also understated carbon dioxide emissions.
Overall, European car sales jumped as most volume and premium brands saw double-digit growth rates, data provided the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) showed on Friday.
Registrations of June monthly new car sales in the European Union and the European Free Trade Association increased 6.5 percent on the year, to 1,507,303 vehicles, ACEA said.
Passenger car registrations in the European Union rose for the 34th consecutive month, with June registrations reaching 1,459,508 new cars.
Two of Europe's five biggest markets recorded double-digitsales gains, led by Italy and Spain where registrations rose 11.9 percent and 11.2 percent respectively, while French sales increased 0.8 percent and the region's No.1 market Germany posted 8.3 percent growth. 
Last month's expansion was driven by mass market manufacturers Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles'(FCA) Fiat brand, jumping and 21.2 percent and 13.9 percent respectively, ACEA said. 
Germany's luxury carmakers also boosted sales, with the core Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) brand sales jumping 16.1 percent and 14.6 percent respectively, while Volkswagen-owned luxury brand Audi (DE:NSUG) saw flat sales. 

In early June, the European auto industry association ACEA hiked its 2016 EU sales forecast to 14 million passenger cars or 5 percent growth year-on-year, compared with an earlier forecast of 2 percent sales growth, predicted in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly held steady near a 43-year low last week, pointing to further momentum in the labor market after job growth surged in June.
Another report on Thursday showed producer prices recorded their biggest gain in a year in June on rising costs for energy products and services. The signs of sustained strength in the economy, together with a U.S. stock market rally, could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this year.
""The days of falling prices are pretty much over and the labor market is strengthening, which raises the question: Is anyone at the Fed paying attention?"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
""Fed members, who fear anything that is not normal and hide from it, may want to peak out from under their rocks."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 254,000 for the week ended July 9, the Labor Department said. Claims are near the 43-year low of 248,000 touched in mid-April.
Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 265,000 in the latest week. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 71 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,750 to 259,000 last week.
The labor market is on a strong footing, with nonfarm payrolls having increased by a robust 287,000 jobs in June, which should underpin economic growth for the rest of the year.
Data later this month is expected to show a rebound in economic activity in the second quarter after growth slowed to a 1.1 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. 
The Fed kept rates unchanged at its policy meeting in June, citing persistently low inflation and worries about the labor market after job growth weakened sharply in May. Policymakers were also cautious ahead of Britain's June 23 referendum on whether to remain in the European Union.
INFLATION CREEPING UP 
While uncertainty over the so-called Brexit lingers, economists expect it to have limited impact on the U.S. economy. The recent rally on Wall Street has signaled that investors feel the same way.
""The economy is strong enough for the Fed to raise rates in September and we wouldn't be surprised if they signal September is possible when they meet next in two weeks,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The U.S. central bank holds its next policy meeting on July 26-27. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher on Thursday, extending their record-setting rally for a fourth day, even as the Bank of England surprised investors by leaving interest rates unchanged.
Prices for U.S. government debt fell, while the dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies.
In a second report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0.5 percent last month, the largest gain since May 2015, after advancing 0.4 percent in May. 
In the 12 months through June, the PPI increased 0.3 percent, rising for the first time since December 2014, after slipping 0.1 percent in May. Overall inflation remains below the Fed's 2 percent target.
Producer inflation is being boosted by the fading drag from a strong dollar and lower oil prices. The dollar's rally appears to be over after vaulting 20 percent between June 2014 and December 2015. It has slipped on a trade-weighted basis this year while oil prices have rebounded from multi-year lows.
The core PPI, which excludes food, energy and trade services, rose 0.3 percent in June after slipping 0.1 percent in May. It was up 0.9 percent in the 12 months through June. The core PPI increased 0.8 percent in May.

""Stronger wage growth and stabilizations in energy prices and the U.S. dollar should eventually lead to an acceleration in inflation,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services in Pittsburg.

The average 30-year mortgage rate was 3.42 percent in the week ended July 14, compared with 3.41 percent the previous week and its record low of 3.31 percent set in November 2012, Freddie Mac said in its latest mortgage rate survey.
Mortgage rates have moved little on the week while benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) have risen about 20 basis points since striking a record low of 1.321 percent on July 6, according to Reuters data.
""This week, the 30-year fixed rate barely budged, rising just one basis point to 3.42 percent. This pattern suggests that mortgage rates are likely to remain low throughout the summer,"" Freddie Mac chief economist Sean Becketti said in a statement.
Longer-dated Treasury yields had tumbled on intense global bond demand following Britain's vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. The June 23 referendum stirred worries about economic slowdown in Britain and Europe.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 9 was unchanged at 254,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to increase by 11,000 to 265,000 last week.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended July 2 rose to 2.149 million from 2.117 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to inch up to 2.128 million.
The four-week moving average was 259,000, down 5,750 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% last month, above the forecast for a 0.3% advance and after a 0.4% gain in May. That was its first increase since December 2014.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) unexpectedly increased 0.3%, compared to expectations for a decline of 0.1% and following a drop of 0.1% in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, rose by 0.4% in June, above forecasts for a gain of 0.1% and following a rise of 0.3% a month earlier.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 1.3% last month, above expectations for 1.0% advance and after rising 1.2% in the preceding month.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.
Immediately after the report, that was released simultaneously with initial jobless claims, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1146 from around 1.1152 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.3354 from 1.3378 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 105.73 from 105.67 earlier.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday FDI surged 68 percent to $420.7 billion, the highest since the government started tracking the series in 1982.
Foreigners spent $408.1 billion to acquire existing business and $11.2 billion to set up new enterprises. The remaining $1.4 billion in FDI last year was for the expansion of existing foreign-owned businesses in the United States.
Planned total expenditures, which include both actual and planned future expenditures, totaled $439.2 billion in 2015.
Manufacturing accounted for more than half of the FDI inflows last year, with investment totaling $281.4 billion. Much of the investment was in pharmaceuticals and medicines industries.
Ireland was the largest source country, accounting for $176.5 billion, probably because of corporate inversions - where a domestic corporation that is currently the owner of its worldwide operations becomes a subsidiary of a foreign corporation for tax purposes.
""A U.S. corporation can initiate an inversion either by creating a foreign corporation to be its new parent or by merging with an existing foreign corporation and ceding control,"" according to the Commerce Department.
The department said its direct investment surveys do not collect information on whether a U.S. corporation became foreign owned as a result of a corporate inversion.
It said, however, that using publicly available information, such as commercial databases and press reports, it estimated that newly inverted U.S. corporations accounted for approximately 20 percent of first-year acquisitions in 2015.
Before the Obama administration took action in April to curb tax-avoiding inversions, Ireland was a major beneficiary, as companies sought to take advantage of its low tax rates.

Last year, the United States also saw large acquisitions in finance and insurance, in real estate and rental and leasing, and in professional, scientific, and technical services.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices rose less than expected in June as rising costs for petroleum products were offset by declining consumer and capital goods prices, suggesting inflation could remain benign for a while.
The marginal increase reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday likely reflects the lingering effects of the dollar's surge between June 2014 and December 2015, despite the greenback weakening this year against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners.
""The moderation in import prices is a concern. Although we caution against over-interpreting import price data, this weakness is worth monitoring carefully, as it likely reflects soft demand, either domestically or internationally,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington.
Import prices increased 0.2 percent last month after jumping 1.4 percent in May. Import prices excluding petroleum dropped 0.3 percent after gaining 0.4 percent the prior month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.5 percent in June. 
In the 12 months through June, import prices fell 4.8 percent, the smallest drop since November 2014. 
The dollar surged 20 percent on a trade-weighted basis between June 2014 and December 2015, putting downward pressure on import prices and keeping inflation below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
Though the dollar has weakened this year, it has recouped the bulk of its losses in the wake of last month's stunning vote in Britain to leave the European Union. It is now down only 0.94 percent on a trade-weighted basis. 
""Lackluster global growth and a further rise in the dollar should keep import prices tame, but the more modest rate of dollar appreciation relative to 2015 suggests a less severe trend,"" said Sam Bullard, an senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data. 
Last month, imported petroleum prices rose 6.4 percent, while food prices stumbled 1.3 percent. Prices for imported capital goods slipped 0.3 percent and consumer goods, excluding automobiles fell 0.2 percent. Imported industrial supplies and materials prices excluding fuels fell 0.3 percent. 
The report also showed export prices increased 0.8 percent in June, after rising 1.2 percent in May. Export prices fell 3.5 percent from a year ago. 
Prices for agricultural exports increased 2.4 percent, boosted by higher soybean and corn prices. Prices for nonagricultural exports rose 0.5 percent last month. 

The increase was led by gains in prices for industrial supplies and material, as well as capital goods. But prices for consumer goods exports fell.

Mortgage rates have fallen with U.S. Treasury yields in the wake of Britain's surprise vote to exit the European Union on June 23. This fed anxiety about global economic growth and wagers on more stimuli from overseas central banks, sending U.S., European and Japanese government bond yields to historic lows. 
The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications climbed 11.2 percent in the week ended July 8 to the highest level since June 2013. This followed a 20.8 percent jump the prior week.
However, the group's seasonally adjusted gauge on loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, was unchanged on the week.
The share of weekly refinancing requests increased to 64.0 percent of total applications from 61.6 percent the previous week, the Washington-based group said. 
The surge in refinancing activity propelled total weekly applications 7.2 percent up on a seasonally adjusted basis to its highest level since June 2013, according to MBA data.
The average rate on ""conforming"" 30-year home mortgages, or loans with balances of $417,000 or less, declined to 3.60 percent, the lowest since May 2013, from 3.66 percent the previous week, MBA said.
The figure is close to the historic low of 3.47 percent set in December 2012.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) touched a record low of 1.321 percent last week. It was 1.471 percent on Wednesday, down 4 basis points from late on Tuesday, according to Reuters data.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports fell more than expected in June as global demand remained stubbornly weak and as Britain's decision to leave the European Union clouds the outlook for one of Beijing's biggest markets.
Imports also shrank more than forecast, suggesting the impact of a flurry of measures to stimulate growth in the world's second-largest economy may be fading, after encouraging readings in May.
""The uncertainty of Brexit is likely to weigh on demand for China's exports to the EU, similar to the situation when the European debt crisis in 2011-12 intensified,"" ANZ economists Raymond Yeung and Louis Lam wrote in a note. 
""Clearly, China's external outlook will still face tremendous challenges."" 
Exports fell 4.8 percent in June from a year earlier and were down 7.7 percent in the first half of 2016, the General Administration of Customs said on Wednesday, adding that China's economy faces increasing downward pressure and the trade situation will be severe this year.
Imports dropped 8.4 percent from a year earlier. 
That resulted in a trade surplus of $48.11 billion in June, versus forecasts of $46.64 billion and May's $49.98 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected June exports to fall 4.1 percent, matching May's decline, and expected imports to fall 5 percent, following May's 0.4 percent dip.
The import decline in May was the smallest since late 2014, raising hopes that China's domestic demand was picking up.
However, China's imports of iron ore, crude oil, copper and soybeans all eased in June from the preceding month.
""The world economy still faces many uncertainties. For example, Brexit, expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, volatile international financial markets, the geopolitical situation, the threat of terrorism ... these will affect the confidence of consumers and investors globally and curb international trade,"" customs spokesman Huang Songping told a news conference.
""We believe China's trade situation remains grim and complex this year. The downward pressure is still relatively big.""
June industrial output, investment and retail sales will be released on Friday, along with second-quarter gross domestic product, which is expected to show a slight loss of momentum from earlier in the year.
OUTLOOK DARK
Exports to the United States – China's top export market – fell 10.4 percent in June on-year, while shipments to the European Union – its second biggest market - fell 3.6 percent. 
Still, China's steel exports were the second-highest on record, pointing to sluggish demand at home but also likely to signal even greater tensions with its major trading partners.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told his Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Wednesday that overcapacity in the steel sector is a very serious problem.
Fresh weakness in the yuan currency appears to have done little so far to help China's struggling exporters.
The yuan <CNY=CFXS> fell about 3 percent versus the dollar and nearly 6 percent against a broader basket in the second quarter, though Chinese officials have said repeatedly they will not purposely devalue the currency to boost exports. 
Analysts at ANZ said currency depreciation impacted the headline growth numbers. Exports in yuan terms rose 1.3 percent.
The data also showed first-half imports from Hong Kong surged 130 percent. Analysts say large jumps in such imports in the past have been a channel for capital outflows through fake invoicing as companies worry about the yuan weakening.
But spokesman Huang said that the increase in imports from Hong Kong was mainly driven by gold, noting that imports actually fell 2 percent after stripping out gold imports. 
""Although gold imports are rising fast, the imported value is not very big. We cannot reach a conclusion on large-scale capital outflows due to surging imports from Hong Kong,"" said Huang.

Eurostat said industrial production in the 19-member single currency bloc in May dropped 1.2 percent on a monthly basis, and rose 0.5 percent year-on-year.
Both figures are below the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists who predicted a 0.8 percent fall month on month and a 1.4 percent rise of output on a yearly basis.
The fall in May nearly erased the increase in output recorded in April when production increased 1.4 percent monthly and 2.2 percent year-on-year.
Both April figures were revised upward from previous estimates of a monthly rise of 1.1 percent and a yearly increase of 2.0 percent.
Euro zone May monthly output decreased in all sectors, and recorded its sharpest fall for energy which was 4.3 percent down, the steepest drop this year, after two consecutive months of rising energy output.
Output of capital goods, such as machinery, dropped 2.3 percent, and of durable consumer goods, such as fridges and cars, decreased 1.4 percent.
Production of intermediate goods was 0.4 percent lower in May than in April, while non-durable consumer goods, such as clothes or food, were the least affected by the overall fall, recording a slight drop of 0.1 percent month-on-month.
The drop in euro zone production was expected after the plunge of Germany's production in May. The largest euro zone economy recorded a 1.3 percent drop of its industrial output month-on-month, the worst in 2016. 
In France monthly production went down 0.5 percent, and dropped 0.6 percent in Italy.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that wholesale inventories edged up 0.1 percent after increasing 0.7 percent in April. Economists had forecast wholesale inventories rising 0.2 percent in May. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic productchanges. The component of wholesale inventories that goes intothe calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.4 percent in May.
Higher prices for commodities, including petroleum, largely accounted for the gain in ex-autos wholesale inventories in May. As such, this will probably not provide a boost to second-quarter GDP growth, when adjusted for inflation.
Following the data, the Atlanta Federal Reserve trimmed its second-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.3 percent annualized rate.
""What has been reported suggests there was a sharp slowing in the pace of inventory accumulation between the first quarter and second quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
According to Silver, data so far suggested that the inflation-adjusted change in inventories in the second quarter was between a $20 billion and $25 billion rate. That implied inventories subtracted about one percentage point from GDP growth in the second quarter, he said.
A report last week showed factory inventories slipped in May. Retail inventory data for May will be published on Friday. Inventory investment cut just over two-tenths of a percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter, helping to hold back the rise in output to a 1.1 percent annualized rate.
Businesses accumulated record inventory in thefirst half of 2015, which outstripped demand. Inventories have weighed on GDP growth since the third quarter of that year as businesses tried to unload the piles of unwanted merchandise.
Still, inventories remained high in the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
""If our second-quarter estimate of the inventory data is correct, the inventory correction should be over by the start of the third quarter, making inventories much more favorable for growth beginning in the third quarter,"" said Silver.
In May, auto inventories fell 1.9 percent, the biggest decline since September 2013. Wholesale stocks of petroleum increased 3.2 percent and farm products inventories soared 5.9 percent.
Sales at wholesalers increased 0.5 percent in May, adding to the prior month's 0.8 percent gain. With sales rising for a third straight month, it would take wholesalers 1.35 months to clear shelves, down from 1.36 months in April.

In a report, the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, decreased to 5.500 million in May from 5.845 million a month earlier, which was revised from the original reading of 5.788 million.
Analysts had expected the number of job openings to decline to 5.700 million.

There were also fresh signs of pessimism among the country's manufacturers in the run-up to the referendum, but a leading credit card firm said spending rose immediately after the vote.
The British Retail Consortium said spending rose by 0.2 percent last month compared with June of last year, slowing sharply from growth of 1.4 percent in May.
Clothing and footwear were hit as rain dominated the weather. On a 12-month basis, clothing recorded its slowest growth since December 2009 and footwear saw its slowest growth since records began in 2009.
""While the ramifications from the Brexit vote may well affect consumer confidence, retailers will be hoping the long-promised heatwave and potential stay-at-home holidays will be enough to drive shoppers back to the high-streets,"" David McCorquodale, head of retail at accountancy firm KPMG, which sponsors the survey, said.
On a like-for-like basis, stripping out changes in the amount of retail space open to shoppers over the past 12 months, the BRC said sales fell by 0.5 percent in June versus a year ago, compared with a 0.5 percent increase in May.
Britain's decision to leave the EU is expected to hurt the economy and there have been signs of a sharp hit to confidence among consumers and businesses.
A survey published by the British Chambers of Commerce on Tuesday gave another downbeat picture of the outlook.
The balance of manufacturers who expect turnover to improve fell to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2012 while a similar measure for the services sector remained unchanged at a historically low level, according to the survey which was conducted between May 23 and June 13.
But it wasn't all gloom and doom for retailers.

Consumer spending grew by 3.6 percent in May and June - its strongest growth since January, according to Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of Britain's credit and debt card transactions.
In the week after the referendum, spending grew by 2.1 percent although discretionary spending in pubs and restaurants fell, Barclaycard said.
""While it’s too soon to draw long-term conclusions on how spending and sentiment have been affected by the outcome of the referendum, the early indication is that the majority of consumers avoided a knee-jerk reaction,"" Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard said."

The Washington-based group's mortgage credit available index fell 1.3 percent to 119.8 last month.
A rise in the index suggests lending standards are tightening, while a decline signals lending standards are loosening.
""Credit availability decreased over the month driven primarily by a decrease in availability of conventional conforming loan offerings,” said Lynn Fisher, MBA's vice president of research and economics in a statement.

A number of investors in particular discontinued their conventional high balance seven-year adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) programs but left their five-year and 10-year ARM programs unchanged, Fisher said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer spending fell last month, the business outlook darkened by the most in four years and economic activity in London slowed sharply, according to three reports which showed the vote to leave the European Union starting to take a toll.
Figures for June from card company Visa, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank and financial data provider Markit pointed to nervousness among businesses and households in the run-up to the June 23 Brexit referendum and in the days immediately after.
Visa said consumer spending dropped for the second month in a row in June, down by 0.5 percent to leave overall purchases up just 1.4 percent on the year in the three months to June, the weakest inflation-adjusted growth since early 2014.
Markit said businesses had the least positive economic outlook in four years, based on responses collected between June 13 and June 29, with many firms blaming the referendum.
""The survey saw widespread concerns that a 'Brexit' vote will lead to prolonged uncertainty -- both politically and economically -- the loss of business to key European markets, and a potential recession in the UK,"" Markit said.
Most of the responses came before the outcome of the vote was known, suggesting a further deterioration is possible.
The Bank of England, which meets to set interest rates this week, expects the economy to suffer a material slowdown because of the uncertainty caused by the vote to leave the EU.
On Friday, a survey of consumer morale by market research company GfK showed one of its biggest falls in more than 20 years.
Visa said consumers were cutting back on discretionary spending, such as hotels, restaurants and bars, as well as new cars and foreign travel.
""With the (referendum) result coming late in the month, this report doesn't give the full picture, but there's a clear trend over recent months showing a slowdown in overall growth,"" Visa's UK managing director Kevin Jenkins said.
Visa did not break out separate figures for the last week of the month but said consumer spending looked set to be ""muted at best"" for the rest of the year.
London, where a majority of voters favored staying in the EU, looks set to take a big hit.
Lloyds Bank's monthly survey of regional economic activity showed the capital last month suffered its biggest contraction since the depths of the financial crisis in April 2009, dragging down average growth for England and Wales as a whole.

""The increased uncertainty in the period leading up to the EU referendum naturally led businesses to be cautious. Following the outcome of the referendum it is still too early to understand the full impact,"" said Tim Hinton, Lloyds' managing director for small and medium-sized business lending.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2016 04:51AM ET</span>",China autos rebound takes hold with strong first-half sales,"By Jake Spring and Meng Meng
BEIJING (Reuters) - Vehicle sales in China rose 8.1 percent in the first half of the year, the automakers association said, well ahead of full-year predictions with the industry cautiously optimistic that positive sales momentum will continue.
Vehicle sales growth in the world's largest auto market stalled last year as the economy slowed before rebounding strongly in October supported by a tax cut on small engine cars.
Many industry watchers questioned whether the rebound could be sustained, but analysts say sales so far this year have met or exceeded expectations.
""People are cautiously optimistic,"" said Godfrey Tsang, a consultant and former vice president for Lexus China.
Sales grew 14.6 percent in June, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers told reporters on Monday, the highest monthly growth since December 2015.
Reflecting the strong start to the year, LMC Automotive last month raised its prediction for annual growth by 0.4 percentage points to 8 percent in passenger vehicle sales for 2016.
But other indicators show pressure remains high on dealers. An index produced by the China Automotive Dealers Association to measure inventories sits at the highest level since November.
With fierce competition among dealers, average discounts have been up to 3 percentage points higher in the first six months compared with the same period in 2015, according to Chinese consultancy WAYS.
TAX CUT EXPIRY 
Analysts said the main uncertainty hanging over the market was whether the tax cut on cars with engines under 1.6 liters would expire or be extended.
If it expires as expected on Dec. 31, consumers may rush to buy cars this year to cash in on the incentive, at the expense of next year's sales, while extending the cut would push down fourth-quarter sales.
The association said last month it favored making the tax cut permanent to promote fuel-efficient cars.
Association spokesman Chen Shihua said the tax cut would likely be extended if sales do not meet targets in the second half.
""Car sales would be volatile without the tax cut. Looking at H1, small engine cars have been the main driver of sales. If the government suspends this incentive, sales might drop a lot,"" Chen said.
The association reaffirmed its forecast that overall vehicle sales will grow 6 percent this year. 
But with China's real estate market rebounding, the government will be less likely to turn to car sales incentives to push up GDP growth, said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief for IHS Automotive. 

Presuming the tax cut expires, IHS predicts sales growth will fall to 1.4 percent next year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders fell unexpectedly in May as a strong yen and weak demand eroded corporate profits and spending plans, a sign the economy is struggling to attract the investment it needs to sustain growth.
Cabinet office data published on Monday showed a 1.4 percent fall in core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, and fell well short of economists' forecast of a 2.6 percent gain in Reuters poll.
In a statement accompanying the data, the Cabinet Office said machinery orders are ""stalling"", a downgrade from April's assessment that said orders were showing signs of ""pickup"".
Weak capital expenditure adds pressure to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to do more to rev up growth. He is expected to compile an economic stimulus package later this year after his ruling bloc won a landslide victory in Sunday's upper house election.
Core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity, stood at 785 billion yen ($7.79 billion), the lowest level since June 2014.
Abe has been counting on capital expenditure to help generate a virtuous growth cycle of higher wages and increased household income and consumption to drive growth.
Britain's shock vote last month to exit the European union has clouded Japan's economic outlook, pushing up the safe-haven yen and chilling sentiment among Japanese exporters.
""Machinery orders are likely to weaken ahead rather than recover. The ill-effects of a rising yen in the wake of Brexit are expected to emerge from now on,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""There are few factors that would make us optimistic about the outlook for machinery orders and capital spending.""
Orders from overseas, which are not included in core orders, dropped 14.8 percent in May from the previous month, down for a second straight month and reflecting falling orders for industrial machinery, trucks and other vehicles, officials said.
Policymakers are in a bind, with companies hesitant to boost investment as they struggle with a weak economy and a strong currency, while the Bank of Japan's adoption of negative rates failed to convince companies to invest more.
Compared to the previous month, orders from manufacturers fell 6.4 percent weighed on by industries such as information and communications and production equipment machinery, while those from the services sector dropped 0.3 percent, the data showed.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Soft Chinese inflation and G20 concerns that the global recovery remains grim are hardening views among some economists that more government stimulus will be needed to support China, the world's second-biggest economy.
Consumer inflation last month remained under the official target of around 3 percent for this year, data released on Sunday showed, indicating persistently weak domestic demand.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent in June from a year earlier, compared with a 2.0 percent increase in May, China's National Bureau of Statistics said. Analysts had expected a 1.8 percent gain, a Reuters poll showed.
Against that backdrop of slack price growth, international trade remains weak and the country is plagued by massive overcapacity, particularly in coal and steel, and debt-ridden zombie companies. Externally, China faces a global recovery that its trade minister on Saturday described as ""complicated and grim"".
""In our view, while China reiterates the importance of supply-side reform due to debt and overcapacity concerns, the authorities still need to stimulate demand in order to achieve its growth target,"" Zhou Hao, senior Asia emerging market economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore, said in a note.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) last cut interest rates on Oct. 23, the seventh time since late 2014.
China's leaders have set an economic growth target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for 2016. The economy expanded 6.9 percent last year, its slowest pace in a quarter of a century.
""Of course, further policy easing is still on the cards, and we hold our view that the PBOC will cut both interest rates and reserve rate requirement this month,"" Zhou said.
Other economists say authorities should use fiscal policy to boost growth, adding that question marks remain over the effectiveness of further monetary easing.
FOOD & FLOODS
In China, food prices rose 4.6 percent in June, compared with a 5.9 percent gain in the previous month.
Recent flooding in China ""is likely to push vegetable and fruit prices higher in the coming months,"" ANZ economists Raymond Yeung and Louis Lam wrote in a research note.
Non-food prices inched up 1.2 percent versus May's 1.1 percent gain.
A top government-backed think tank forecast in late June that consumer prices will likely rise 2 percent for the year, while the long decline in producer prices will ease.
The producer price index (PPI) dropped 2.6 percent in June from a year earlier. Analysts had expected PPI to fall 2.5 percent.
The decline extended a falling streak to 51 consecutive months, though it continued to moderate, suggesting strains on companies' profits may be easing. The PPI eased 2.8 percent in May.
Producer prices for mining fell 8.2 percent in June from a year earlier, while raw materials dropped 6.1 percent.
GLOBAL ECONOMY
China is due to release its second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data on July 15, along with figures for June's industrial output, investment and retail sales.
Most analysts say GDP growth likely edged lower in the second quarter from 6.7 percent in the first on a year-on-year basis.
To make matters worse, the global economic situation is grim, China's trade minister Gao Hucheng said on Saturday at the Group of 20 trade ministers meeting in Shanghai, adding that major economies must lead the way in tackling problems including sluggish growth and weak trade.
G20 trade ministers agreed on Sunday to cut trade costs, increase policy coordination and enhance financing.
""The global recovery continues, but it remains uneven and falls short of our ambition for strong, sustainable and balanced growth,"" the ministers said in a joint statement.

""Downside risks and vulnerabilities persist.""

According to the report, consumer credit on the month climbed by $18.6 billion, eclipsing analysts' expectations of $16.0 billion. It came one month after Fed reports showed that credit rose substantially by $13.4 billion in April.
During the month of May, non-revolving credit comprised of debt payments on items such as student loans and car loans increased by $16.2 billion. Non-revolving credit slowed somewhat in April after spiking by 8.7% in March. Over the first quarter, non-revolving credit payments increased by 6.9%, down considerably from 7.7% a year earlier.
At the same time, revolving credit inched up by $2.3 billion in May following an increase of $1.4 billion a month earlier. Revolving credit is a specific line of credit that is automatically renewed as debts are paid off. During the first three months of the year, revolving credit rose moderately following a spike of 13.2% in March.
Economists sounded alarm bells in March when consumer credit surged by $29.7 billion, almost doubling analysts' estimates of $16 billion, coming in as the largest on record since the Fed began tracking the data. The spending spree was driven by an $11 billion binge in credit card debt on the month.
Last year, credit card debt in the U.S. soared by $71 billion annually to $917.7 billion, according to a report from CardHub.com, fueled by a $52 billion increase in the final quarter. In April, however, analysts from S&P/Experian suggested that U.S. consumers were doing a better job of taking care of mortgage and car payments, as mortgage default rates fell slightly and auto loan default rates remained relatively low."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in June as manufacturers and other employers boosted hiring, confirming the economy has regained speed after a first-quarter lull, but tepid wages suggested the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates soon.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 287,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since last October, the Labor Department said on Friday. May payrolls were revised sharply down to show them rising 11,000 rather than the previously reported 38,000.
The sign of strength in the economy, however, precedes Britain's stunning vote last month to leave the European Union. The so-called Brexit referendum on June 23 roiled financial markets, raising fears that sustained volatility might hit companies' hiring and investment decisions.
""For the Fed, this report is likely to offer some encouragement on the underlying labor market backdrop, though it is unlikely to change the current 'wait and see' policy stance as they assess the fallout from the Brexit vote,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. Financial markets expect no further increase this year, but economists believe a December hike is possible if the economy continues to grow and add jobs at a steady clip.
Last month's payrolls tally beat economists' expectations for an increase of 175,000 jobs. While the unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 4.9 percent, that was because more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in the jobs market.
With the jobless rate rising, average hourly earnings increased only two cents or 0.1 percent in June, suggesting some slack still remains in the labor market. That took the year-on-year gain in earnings to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent in May.
Economists say wage growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target. A top Fed official said this week the central bank would like to see inflation accompanied by wage gains.
""Wage growth remains subdued, which could reflect the fact that there is still slack in the labor market,"" said Michelle Meyer, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York. ""Or perhaps it is a function of low inflation expectations and low productivity, which restricts the ability or desire of businesses to raise wages.""
U.S. stocks rallied on the employment data, with the main indexes rising more than 1 percent. Prices for longer-dated U.S. government debt rose, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.
BROAD-BASED IMPROVEMENT
The strong rebound in June payrolls added to data on consumer spending and housing in suggesting that economic growth accelerated from the first-quarter's anemic 1.1 percent annualized rate. The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting the economy growing at a 2.4 percent pace in the second quarter.
Manufacturing employment increased 14,000 last month after shedding 16,000 jobs in May. Although manufacturing only accounts for 12 percent of the economy, it is considered a leading growth indicator.
The retail sector added 29,900 jobs, more than reversing the prior months' weakness. The leisure and hospitality sector gained 59,000 jobs, the most in nearly 1-1/2 years. Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger for future hiring, rebounded 15,200.
Healthcare and social assistance payrolls jumped 58,400. The return of 35,100 Verizon workers, who were excluded from May's payroll count while on a month-long strike, boosted information sector employment last month.
Government added 22,000 jobs, but construction payrolls were unchanged after two months of declines and mining lost another 5,000 positions.
Despite job gains in June being the best for the year, forward momentum in the labor market has slowed. Job gains averaged 282,000 per month in the fourth quarter, but employment has increased by an average of only 171,500 jobs per month in the first half of this year.
Economists say the deceleration is normal given the relatively advanced age of the economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession, with the labor market now near full employment.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of percentage point to 62.7 percent.

A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell 0.1 percentage point 9.6 percent, the lowest since April 2008.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2016 01:10PM ET</span>",Cooling wages for U.S. healthcare workers dim inflation outlook,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rising wages for U.S. healthcare workers had helped to drive a modest acceleration of inflation over the past year, but these gains in earnings have slowed, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to achieve its inflation target.
Rising prices for healthcare has been one bright spot in an economy where wage and price gains have been tepid. The Fed views an inflation rate of 2 percent as healthy, but has undershot this target the last four years.
But data on Friday appeared to confirm a trend of slowing wage gains in the sector, dimming the outlook for the faster price gains that would make the Fed more comfortable raising interest rates from very low levels.
""We'd like to see a little more inflation,"" New York Fed President William Dudley said on Tuesday.
Wage gains for hospital workers tend to affect prices paid months down the road, and in recent years the connection between compensation and prices has appeared tighter in the sector than in the rest of the economy, possibly because hospitals spend a relatively large share of revenues on wages.
Healthcare wages began rising sharply in 2014 as President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law fueled a surge of hiring at hospitals to treat an influx of newly insured patients.
Wages for healthcare workers were up 2.1 percent in the year through May, according to the most recent figures available for the sector released by the Labor Department on Friday.
That's about twice the rate of increase logged in mid-2014, just before wages in the sector began to pick up. The wage acceleration that began that year was followed by a rise in healthcare service inflation, from 0.7 percent in the year through September 2015 to a 12-month gain of 1.3 percent in May of this year. 
The increase in healthcare costs had pushed overall inflation higher.
But job growth in the sector has cooled, as has the acceleration in wage gains, which peaked at a 2.7 percent rate in December, well above the rate in May.
Slower growth in the sector ""may mean less pressure on wages, and ultimately on healthcare prices,"" said Larry Levitt, a healthcare economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park, California.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2016 05:00AM ET</span>",UK goods trade deficit narrower than forecast in May,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's goods trade deficit was much smaller than expected in May after heavy downward revisions to the previous month's deficit, suggesting some improvement in Britain's trade position was underway before last month's vote to leave the European Union.
Since the referendum, sterling has fallen more than 10 percent on a trade-weighted basis <=GBP> and it hit its lowest against the U.S. dollar  since 1985 on Wednesday.
This is likely to lead to the trade deficit widening over the next few months, as the cost of imports surges, but may help it to narrow in the longer term if a cheaper domestic cost base allows British firms to find new markets abroad.
The Office for National Statistics said Britain's deficit in goods alone stood at 9.879 billion pounds versus economists' forecasts of 10.65 billion pounds.
This represented a slight widening from April's reading of a deficit of 9.414 billion pounds, which was 1.1 billion pounds smaller than previously reported.
There was a similar pattern for the overall deficit in goods and services, which stood at 2.263 billion in May, up from a sharply downwardly revised reading of 1.950 billion pounds for April.
British economic growth slowed to a quarterly rate of 0.4 percent in the first three months of 2016, down from 0.7 percent in the last three months of 2015, with Britain's trade deficit accounting for an increased drag.
The ONS did not release figures on trade growth in volume terms, after announcing on Thursday that it needed another week to do further quality checks.
Britain's large current account deficit hit a record 7.2 percent of the economy in late 2015, which the Bank of England has said poses a risk to Britain's financial stability after the vote to leave the European Union in June 23's referendum.
However much of the deficit is due to the weak performance of British overseas investments, rather than its trade deficit.
The ONS also released productivity and unit labor cost data for the first three months of 2016.
This showed quarterly growth in output per hour picked up to 0.5 percent, its fastest since the second quarter of 2015. 
But annual growth in unit labor costs - the amount it costs employers to produce a given amount of output - picked up to 1.9 percent from 1.5 percent in late 2015.

Before the referendum some BoE policymakers were concerned weak productivity could cause inflation to accelerate if wage growth picked up. After the 'Out' vote, Governor Mark Carney has expressed fears that any disruption to trade and investment might damage the economy's underlying productive potential.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2016 04:36AM ET</span>",German exports plunge: 'Performance not champion-like',"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports fell unexpectedly in May, posting their steepest monthly decline in nine months, and imports rose less than expected, data showed on Friday, in a further sign that weak global demand is curbing growth in Europe's largest economy.
The disappointing trade figures fleshed out a picture of economic weakness in Germany after data released earlier this week showed industrial output posted its biggest monthly drop in nearly two years and orders also came in weaker than expected.
""Another indicator signaling that Germany's performance is currently not champion-like,"" ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said, adding that the only region to which German companies had exported significantly more than last year was the euro zone.
He pointed out that the German trade surplus with the single currency bloc was widening again, suggesting that buoyant domestic demand in Germany was not necessarily benefiting the rest of the euro zone.
Overall, seasonally adjusted exports dropped 1.8 percent on the month, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. This was the biggest monthly fall since August 2015 and below the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a 0.25 percent rise.
Seasonally adjusted imports inched up 0.1 percent on the month, the data showed, short of market expectations for an increase of 0.4 percent.
The plunge in exports narrowed the seasonally adjusted trade surplus to 22.2 billion euros ($24.6 billion) from a revised 24.1 billion euros in April which was the highest monthly value so far.
SLUGGISH
""German export development is sluggish so far this year,"" DIHK foreign trade director Volker Treier said. Trade with European Union countries was the only reason unadjusted exports rose 1.6 percent on the year in May, he said.
""Outside the EU, there is hardly any growth potential due to global crisises and low oil prices.""
The data pointed to a sharp slowdown of German industry, and the loss of economic momentum had infected almost all global regions, Brzeski said.
The overall weak global demand is hampering one of German exporters' strengths, namely diversification in products and export markets, he said.
Germany's economy grew by 0.7 percent in the first quarter, its strongest quarterly rate in two years. Soaring private consumption, higher construction investment and state spending on refugees more than offset a dip in trade.
For the second quarter, analysts expect economic growth to slow drastically. Some economists say it could come to a near-halt and expand by just 0.1 percent.
Dekabank analyst Andreas Scheuerle said even if June data across the economy came in unchanged compared with the weak May figures, Germany might see an economic contraction in the second quarter.

1610,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 08, 2016 04:34AM ET</span>",U.K. goods trade deficit widened to £9.9 billion in May,"Investing.com - The U.K.’s goods trade deficit widened in May after the prior month’s reading was revised lower, and as both exports and imports decreased, official data showed on Friday.
In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the country's goods trade deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted £9.88 billion from a deficit of £9.41 billion in April.
The prior month’s data was revised from an initial reading of £10.53 billion.
Economists had expected the goods trade deficit to come in at £10.65 billion in May.
Meanwhile, the trade deficit with regard to countries that do not form part of the European Union also widened to £2.57 billion in May, from the prior month’s deficit of £2.52 billion, revised from the initial reading of £2.60 billion.
Analysts had forecast the deficit to settle at £2.90 billion.
U.K. trade data shows the extent of import and export activity, a key contributor to the overall economic growth of the U.K.
Worth noting, May’s deficit data came prior to the U.K. vote to leave the European Union and posterior slide in the pound to 31-year lows. Some experts commented that the weaker pound was likely to increase exports and decrease imports, but the depreciation in sterling will not be reflected until the third quarter data is released. 
After the release, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2935 from around 1.2941 ahead of the announcement, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8559 from 0.8556 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were mixed. London’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.10%, the Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.25%, France's CAC 40 rose 0.20%, while Germany's DAX traded up 0.47%."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sentiment in Japan's service sector hit a new low in June due to a stronger yen and weaker stock prices following Britain's surprise vote to leave the European Union, adding to headaches for policymakers already worried about sputtering economic growth.
The survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - dubbed ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence fell 1.8 points from the previous month to 41.2 in June.
It was the lowest reading since October 2014, data released on Friday by the Cabinet Office showed.
Japanese policymakers and markets have been on high alert about the Brexit-induced market turmoil, prompting the country's top currency diplomat, Masatsugu Asakawa, to warn earlier on Friday that the government was ready to respond to any speculative moves in the foreign exchange market.
Sentiment in the service sector and the retail industry was especially low on fears that a stronger yen and lower stock prices triggered by the Brexit would dampen already weak consumer spending.
""There are more uncertainties in economic outlook following the Brexit, and the wealthy are refraining from spending. There are few factors to stimulate spending among the middle class as well. Even though the sales tax hike was delayed again, it's difficult to think that the situation would improve in the future,"" said a respondent from the retail industry.
The outlook index, which indicates the level of confidence in future conditions, tumbled 5.8 points to 41.5 in June, the worst level since March 2014, as worries about a post-Brexit market turmoil and the global economy cast a shadow over sentiment in the service sector.
Poor service-sector sentiment in June comes after data released earlier in the day showed gains in price-adjusted real wages slowed further in May.
Weak service-sector sentiment and sluggish wage growth are bad news for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has struggled to beat two decades of deflation and boost spending through his reflationary Abenomics policy.
""Wages aren't changing and bonuses aren't increasing. Consumers' desire to spend is lowering. They don't feel they want to buy anything, so the economy doesn't improve,"" said another respondent from the retail industry.

The lackluster data also ramps up pressure on Abe's government before elections to the upper house this Sunday and the announcement of an economic stimulus package this autumn.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2016 03:01AM ET</span>",U.S. payrolls seen rebounding in June in boost to economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth likely rebounded in June as striking Verizon (N:VZ) employees returned to work and wages probably rose steadily, more evidence the economy has regained speed after a first-quarter lull.
The U.S. Labor Department's jobs tally due on Friday is likely to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000 jobs last month after a meager 38,000 gain in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast rising to 4.8 percent from an 8-1/2-year low of 4.7 percent a month earlier as some job seekers returned to the labor market.
The signs of economic strength would be welcomed by the Federal Reserve. Nonetheless, economists say the report will likely have little impact on the near-term interest rate outlook given the U.S. central bank's desire to wait on more data to assess the economic impact of Britain's stunning vote last month to leave the European Union.
""Will a strong job number and solid GDP growth matter to the Fed? Probably not. The (Fed) members are like pinballs, bouncing from one temporary crisis to the next,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The so-called Brexit referendum on June 23 roiled financial markets, raising fears that sustained volatility might negatively impact companies' hiring and investment decisions. Economists have also warned that slower growth in Europe and a stronger dollar could weigh on the U.S. economy. 
Minutes of the Fed's June 14-15 meeting published on Wednesday showed that officials ""agreed that ... it was prudent to wait for additional data on the consequences of the UK vote.""
The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade, but markets now expect no further increase this year.
May's payroll gain - the smallest since September 2010 - in part reflected the loss of 35,100 Verizon (N:VZ) workers, who were excluded from the count while on a month-long strike. With their return, information industry employment likely snapped back.
Job gains are also expected in the construction, retail, and leisure and hospitality sectors. Economists say unseasonably warm weather at the start of the year had pulled forward hiring in these areas, leading to payback in the last two months.
Construction is also forecast to have added jobs after two months of declines, but manufacturing employment was likely unchanged and mining probably maintained its downward trend.
SLOWING MOMENTUM
Even with June's anticipated jobs bounce back, forward momentum in the labor market has slowed. Job gains averaged 282,000 per month in the fourth quarter, but employment has increased by an average of only 150,000 jobs per month over first five months of this year. 
Economists say the deceleration is normal given the relatively advanced age of the economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession, with the labor market now near full employment. 
""The labor market is slowing because the business cycle is slowing. There is less slack to absorb,"" said Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in New York.
Stronger payroll gains in June would add to data on consumer spending and housing in suggesting that economic growth accelerated from the first-quarter's anemic 1.1 percent annualized rate. The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank is currently forecasting the economy growing at a 2.4 percent pace in the second quarter.
Tightening labor market conditions are expected to start putting upward pressure on wages. Average hourly earnings are forecast increasing 0.2 percent in June after a similar gain in May. The year-on-year gain in earnings could rise as high as 2.7 percent after advancing 2.5 percent in May. 
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, is expected to rise after falling 0.2 percentage point to 62.6 percent in May. That drop unwound about two-thirds of the increase seen between last September and March this year.

""Looking through the volatility ... participation is stabilizing after several years of declines, and employment growth remains strong enough to gradually reduce remaining spare capacity in the labor market,"" said Zach Pandl an economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer morale suffered its biggest drop in more than five years after last month's decision by voters to leave the European Union, and surveys of recruitment firms and retailers also signaled a slowdown ahead.
In a special post-referendum survey, market research company GfK said consumer confidence fell to -9 in the aftermath of the June 23 vote from -1 in its previous regular monthly survey, marking the steepest decline since January 2011.
The last time the decline was steeper was in December 1994. The index is now at its lowest level since December 2013.
The GfK survey is one of the first clear signs that British households - a key driver of the economy - have been unsettled by the June 23 vote to quit the EU, which sparked political chaos and sent sterling to a 31-year low against the dollar.
Bolstering a growing view that the economy is likely to slow markedly in the second half of this year, accountants BDO said retail sales spiraled lower through the month as the referendum campaign reached its climax.
BDO's High Street Sales Tracker showed like-for-like retail sales fell 3.6 percent year-on-year last month, the worst June in more than a decade. Although the month started well, BDO said sales fell at progressively faster pace through the month.
And a survey from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation showed the number of permanent staff hired via recruitment firms fell for the first time since December 2012 - around the last time Britain's economy flirted with recession.
Permanent salary growth slowed to its lowest level since September 2013, according to the REC survey, conducted by data company Markit in the week before the referendum result. 
""The best thing for business right now is clear and calm leadership and as much clarity as possible on what the post-EU future will look like,"" said REC chief executive Kevin Green.
The surveys will be read with interest by policymakers at the Bank of England, who will hold their first meeting to set interest rates over the coming days. 
BoE Governor Mark Carney has said the economy faces a material slowdown after the referendum result, and the BoE took steps on Tuesday to encourage bank lending
The BoE may decide to cut interest rates to a new low next week, although most economists polled by Reuters expect it to hold off until it releases new economic forecasts in August.
GfK reported that people who wanted to stay in the EU - 48 percent of voters - were much more pessimistic than the 52 percent who voted to leave.

""Our analysis suggests that in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, sectors like travel, fashion and lifestyle, home, living, DIY and grocery are particularly vulnerable to consumers cutting back their discretionary spending,"" said Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders were expected to rebound only modestly in May, a Reuters poll found, as a strong yen and weak overseas demand clouded the outlook for capital investment. 
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, were seen likely to grow 2.6 percent in May after falling 11.0 percent in April, the poll of 19 economists found.
Core orders, which exclude those of ships and electrical equipment, were expected to have fallen 8.7 percent in May from a year ago, after a 8.2 percent decline in April.
""Firms' capital spending is expected to stay solid over the medium term due to the need to upgrade ageing facilities, special demand from the Tokyo Olympics, and inbound investment,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But there are worrying factors such as growing risks to the economy in Japan and overseas, and concerns about corporate earnings due to a strong yen,"" he said.
Minami added that fears about harmful consequences from Britain's vote to leave the European Union could make Japanese firms more cautious about investing.
The Cabinet Office will publish the data at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (Sunday 2350 GMT). 
On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan will announce the June corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services.
The CGPI was expected to fall 4.2 percent in the year to June, a 15th straight monthly fall reflecting weak domestic demand and the strong yen pushing down import prices.
There is growing speculation that the BOJ will adopt fresh stimulus at its policy meeting later this month as weak consumption, the strong yen and external headwinds hold back growth and stifle inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in June as small businesses ramped up hiring, and fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, suggesting a rebound in job growth after May's paltry gains.
Thursday's reports underscored the economy's strength and supported views that the United States would weather the impact of last month's British referendum to leave the European Union.
""The labor market does not seem to be faltering. The apparent willingness of small business owners to bring on new workers is a clear sign that the economy is moving forward solidly,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 172,000 workers in June, beating market expectations for a 159,000 gain. Private payrolls rose 168,000 in May. Last month, small businesses hired 95,000 workers, up from 84,000 in May.  
The services sector added 208,000 jobs last month, but manufacturing and construction lost a combined 26,000 positions.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for June due on Friday. 
Though the ADP report is not considered a reliable predictor of non-farm payrolls because of differences in methodology, economists say it, on the margin, suggested a pickup in overall employment growth. 
The ADP report is not affected by strikes and therefore did not account for the return of 35,100 Verizon workers who were excluded from the non-farm payrolls count in May while on a month-long strike. Those workers are expected to boost employment in June.
""Adjusting for the strike, the ADP report suggests that the employment report's private payroll count should be up 207,000,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
""That said, the ADP and the government's employment data do not always align very well."" 
REBOUND IN PAYROLLS EXPECTED
According to a Reuters survey, payrolls likely increased 175,000 last month. Employment increased by only 38,000 jobs in May, the smallest gain since September 2010. 
The unemployment rate is forecast rising to 4.8 percent in June from an 8-1/2-year low of 4.7 percent in May.
May's weak job gains and the pending Brexit referendum prompted the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged last month. Even if payrolls rebound in June, economists say the stunning Brexit vote made it unlikely that the U.S. central bank would hike rates before the end of the year. 
Minutes of the Fed's June 14-15 meeting published on Wednesday showed U.S. central bank officials ""agreed that ... it was prudent to wait for additional data on the consequences of the UK vote."" The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
The upbeat labor market data helped to lift U.S. stocks. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 254,000 for the week ended July 2. 
The drop left claims close to a 43-year low of 248,000 touched in mid-April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast initial claims rising to 270,000 in the latest week. 
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 70 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,500 to 264,750 last week. Claims were low through June, backing views that May's weak payroll gains were not a true reflection of the labor market.
While a third report from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed planned job cuts by U.S.-based employers rose to 38,536 last month from 30,157 in May, layoffs remained well below their 12-month average.

""The pace of job cutting has slowed significantly since the beginning of the year. We may continue to see low job cut totals throughout the remainder of 2016, as employers take a wait-and-see stance on workforce levels,"" said John Challenger, chief executive officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2016 07:00AM ET</span>",China June forex reserves unexpectedly rise but outflow fears persist,"By Elias Glenn and John Ruwitch
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China reported a surprise increase in June foreign exchange reserves on Thursday, but analysts said they could fall again in coming months if the weakening yuan triggers more capital outflows.
Even as the yuan slides to 5-1/2 year lows against the dollar and the economy struggles, official data suggest speculative capital flight is under control for now, thanks to the country's capital controls. 
But analysts and financial markets widely expect the yuan to weaken further in coming months, risking a surge in outflows like those seen in 2015 and early this year.
China's foreign exchange reserves rose $20 billion in June to $3.21 trillion, recovering from a five-year low in May, central bank data showed on Thursday. June's increase was the biggest in 14 months. 
Economists polled by Reuters had predicted reserves would fall $20 billion to $3.17 trillion, reckoning on sharp drops in the value of China's sterling and euro holdings following Britain's shock vote last month to leave the European Union.
But the turmoil which followed also boosted safe-haven currencies such as the dollar and the yen. 
""The increase was not entirely surprising. The change in foreign exchange reserves reflect valuation effects with the strong Japanese yen...,"" said Raymond Yeung, senior economist at ANZ in Hong Kong. 
Though the yuan ended the second quarter with its biggest quarterly fall on record, Yeung said outflows of foreign currency largely dried up in June due to capital controls.
However, economists are divided over how much money is still flowing out of the country, with opaque policymaking and some inconsistency in the data raising suspicions that the fall in the yuan may be masking capital outflow pressure.
""Capital outflows have been continuing at pace and they are a lot larger than what the authorities would have us believe through the official data,"" said Sue Trinh, Hong Kong-based head of Asia FX strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada. 
Over-invoicing of China's imports from Hong Kong, seen as a proxy for speculative outflows, is at record highs, she said. 
Data from Chinese banks also does not appear in the official foreign exchange reserve data. 
""The reserves are only what the central bank does, and China can direct intervention (in currency markets) via state banks...which is why forex reserves are not a great proxy for intervention activity even though people want to draw a very hard line between the two,"" said Trinh. 
The yuan has fallen roughly 3 percent against the U.S. dollar since March, adding to uncertainties for investors already rattled by Brexit and slowing global economic growth.
Chinese sources recently told Reuters the People's Bank of China (PBOC) was willing to let the yuan fall to 6.8 to the dollar by the end of the year to support the economy. That would mark a depreciation of 4.5 percent in 2016, matching last year's record decline.
After that report, the PBOC said China had no intention to promote trade competitiveness through depreciation of the yuan, a comment also made repeatedly by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.
Bets on further declines in the yuan hit a five-month high in the last two weeks on expectations that the central bank will allow it to weaken further, a Reuters poll showed. 
Capital Economics said evidence exists the PBOC continues to defend the currency, but that pressures have clearly eased since the start of the year. 
""There is little doubt that the flows remain much more manageable than in late-2015 and early-2016, when China was witnessing outflows of over $120 billion per month,"" analysts Julian Evans-Pritchard and Mark Williams said in a note.

""Nonetheless, if the PBOC continue to let the renminbi (yuan) slide against the dollar, there is a risk that more serious concerns over the trajectory of the currency could re-emerge, leading to another surge in capital outflows.""

Asking and effective rents growth for shopping centers decreased compared with the previous quarter, Reis said in a report on Wednesday.
Retail mall vacancies rose to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent, their first quarterly increase since the fourth quarter of 2014, the company said.
""High-end, dominant malls"" continue to have very high rents and very low vacancy rates, while traditional malls still struggle with high vacancy and low rent growth, Ryan Severino, senior economist at Reis, said.
Asking rent for shopping centers grew by 0.4 percent while effective rents rose by 0.5 percent in the second quarter. Asking rent had risen 0.5 percent in the first quarter, while effective rents rose 0.6 percent.
The national vacancy rate for neighborhood and community shopping centers fell to 9.9 percent, a decline of 10 basis points from the first quarter.
Construction activity remained tepid with only 1,403,000 square feet of new shopping center space completed during the second quarter, the lowest level of quarterly completions since the second quarter of 2013. Net absorption totaled 3,291,000 square feet.
""The heyday of department stores is clearly in the past while apparel retailers (for example) compete fiercely with e-commerce,"" Severino said.

Severino said that although retail recovery should get a bit stronger, at least for neighborhood and community centers, ""it should not be much stronger.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. orders for heavy duty trucks in June were down 34 percent from the same month last year to a four-year low as trucking firms were holding off on buying new 18-wheelers amid a weak freight environment, according to preliminary data released by a freight transportation forecaster on Wednesday.
""The Class 8 market is stuck in a holding pattern, at the bottom end of this cycle,"" Don Ake, vice president for commercial vehicles at FTR said in a statement.
""Fleets are cautious as freight demand has cooled off this year,"" he said.
Preliminary data showed 13,000 units ordered in June, the lowest monthly total since July 2012 and the worst June since 2009.
FTR said that all truck manufacturers were equally affected by the month's weak order numbers.
Just last month, U.S. truck maker  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV) lowered its sales forecast for the second half of 2016, blaming a weak market for heavy duty trucks.
FTR's Ake said that this low level of truck order activity could be expected for at least a few more months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity hit a seven-month high in June as new orders surged and companies hired more workers, suggesting the economy regained speed in the second quarter. 
Though other data on Wednesday showed the trade deficit widened in May as rising oil prices helped to push up the import bill, trade remained on course to contribute to gross domestic product in the April-June period.
The signs of underlying strength in the economy suggested it could withstand the financial markets turbulence, sparked by uncertainty following last month's stunning vote in Britain to leave the European Union, economists said.
""The economy continues to move forward at a good clip and is in a strong position to weather the uncertainty and market volatility after the Brexit vote. We still don't think Brexit means that much for this economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing index increased 3.6 percentage points to 56.5 last month, the highest reading since November. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Services industries reported a jump in new orders and employment, as well as demand for exports. 
The new orders sub-index rose 5.7 percentage points to 59.9, while a measure of services sector employment rebounded 3.0 percentage points after contracting in May. A sub-index for export orders increased 4.0 percentage points, swinging back into expansion territory.
The ISM service sector report came on the heels of last week's bullish manufacturing survey, and added to data on housing and consumer spending that have suggested an acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by Wednesday's data as investors' attention shifted back to the unknown implications of the so-called Brexit referendum. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, while yields on the 10-year and 30-year U.S. government bonds fell to record lows. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
Economists estimate that Brexit could cut two-tenths of a percentage point from GDP growth over the next six quarters.
WIDER TRADE GAP
In a second report, the Commerce Department said the trade gap increased 10.1 percent to $41.1 billion in May. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit rose to $61.1 billion from $57.5 billion in April.
Despite the increase, the inflation-adjusted trade deficit in April and May remained slightly below the average for the first quarter, suggesting trade was on track to make a modest contribution to gross domestic product in the April-June period.
""The inflation-adjusted goods deficit still points to an addition of around 0.3 percentage points to second-quarter real GDP growth,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting second-quarter GDP rising at a 2.4 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.1 percent pace in the first quarter.
The dollar's sharp rally against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015 has undercut export growth. With the dollar weakening this year on a trade-weighted basis, some of the drag on exports had started to fade.
But the dollar has been regaining strength following the Brexit vote. Economists say this, together with an anticipated slowdown in economic growth in Europe, could renew pressure on exports.
In May, exports of goods slipped 0.2 percent to $119.8billion. Exports of capital goods, automobiles and consumer goods fell. But industrial supplies and food exports rose. 
Exports to the European Union fell 4.2 percent, with exports to the United Kingdom plummeting 15.6 percent. Goods shipped to Canada and Mexico, the United States' biggest trading partners, also declined in May. China also bought fewer U.S.-made goods in May, with exports to that country falling 1.7 percent.    
Imports of goods increased 1.9 percent to $182.1 billion in May, with higher oil prices accounting for part of the rise. Oil prices averaged $34.19 per barrel in May, the highest since December, up from $29.48 in April. 
The $4.71 increase in the average oil price in May from April was the biggest in five years. Despite the oil price increase, the petroleum trade deficit was the smallest since February 1999 as the country depends less on foreign oil.
May's increase in imports also suggested a pick-up in domestic demand. Imports of industrial supplies, automobiles and consumer goods increased in May. Food imports also rose. 

Imports from China surged 13.8 percent as cellphone imports rose. With exports falling, the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit jumped 19.4 percent to $29.0 billion in May.

The drop in mortgage rates and bond yields followed Britain's surprise vote to exit the European Union on June 22. This stoked fears about global growth and bets on more stimulus from overseas central banks, sending U.S., U.K., European and Japanese yields to historic lows.
The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications soared 20.8 percent in the week ended July 1 to its highest level since January 2015.
The share of weekly refinancing requests rose to 61.6 percent of total applications, up from 58.1 percent the prior week and its biggest share since February, the Washington-based group said.
The average rate on 30-year home mortgages fell to 3.66 percent, the lowest since May 2013, from 3.75 percent the previous week, MBA said.
The number is less than a quarter-percentage point above the historic low of 3.47 percent recorded in December 2012.
""Interest rates continued to drop last week as markets assessed the impact of Brexit, downgrading the likelihood of additional rate hikes"" by the Federal Reserve, said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's chief economist in a statement.
Mortgage rates are poised to fall further. On Wednesday, benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) touched a record low of 1.321 percent, according to Reuters data.
The surge in refinancing activity propelled total weekly applications by 14.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis to its highest level since June 2013, according to MBA data.

Bookings for 'Made in Germany' goods were unchanged in May from April, data from the Economy Ministry showed on Wednesday. The zero reading was below a Reuters consensus forecast for a rise of 1.0 percent.
""The stagnation in orders is a clear disappointment,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said, adding industrial orders were likely to shrink in the second quarter compared to the first three months of the year.
""Of course, this has nothing to do with the Brexit aftermath,"" Krueger said in reference to Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Economists have warned that Britain's decision to leave the European Union is likely to hit German exports and reduce growth by as much as half a percentage point next year.
But record-high employment and rising real wages are helping German consumers' loosen their purse strings, making private consumption the most important growth driver of the economy.
The main problem for German industry was still the sluggish growth of the world economy, Krueger said.
In May, it was mainly German firms that scaled back bookings for industrial goods. Domestic demand fell by 1.9 percent compared to April, while foreign orders rose 1.4 percent with demand from euro zone countries surging 4.0 percent.
The data for April was slightly revised: Industry orders fell 1.9 percent compared to the previous month, from a previously reported decline of 2.0 percent.
""The orders in the industrial sector so far have been broadly stable this year apart from monthly fluctuations,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement.
""Business sentiment in the industrial sector recently improved again and is pointing to a further solid development.""
Retail sales in May enjoyed their strongest monthly increase since July 2015, while consumer morale hit its highest level in nearly a year heading into July, as record-low borrowing costs give Germans' purchasing power an additional push.
The German economy grew 0.7 percent in the first quarter, more than doubling its growth rate. Soaring private consumption, higher construction investment and state spending of refugees more than offset a dip in foreign trade.

For the second quarter, analysts expect German economic growth to slow to around 0.3 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shipping confidence is at an all-time low as fears of a global recession and Britain's vote to leave the EU pile pressure on parts of the industry already suffering from its worst downturn, a leading transport survey showed on Wednesday.
The global container sector, which transports everything from bananas to iPhones, as well as the dry bulk shipping market hauling commodities including iron ore and coal, are struggling with a glut of ships, a faltering global economy and weaker consumer demand. 
In an annual survey by international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, just 15 percent of respondents saw current market conditions as positive, the lowest level since the poll began in 2009, with shipping the gloomiest transport sector canvassed.
Separately, 68 percent of respondents said a global recession posed the greatest threat to shipping in coming years. That compared with 38 percent who saw this risk in aviation and 20 percent in rail. 
""The (shipping) industry is currently in the grip of the worst recession in living memory and while most of our respondents envisage an upturn in freight volumes in the next five years, any major economic shock would further exacerbate an already fragile industry,"" Norton Rose Fulbright's global head of transport Harry Theochari said.
""The UK’s vote in favor of a Brexit has meant that shipowners are likely to be assessing how it impacts upon their various regulatory obligations and their access to finance in a key shipping finance market,"" he said, referring to the role of the City of London. 
Shipping faces a global funding black hole, estimated at $30 billion, caused in part by banks cutting lending to the sector.
""Bank debt is expected to remain the industry’s principle source of funding, although for many shipowners funding remains thin on the ground and few respondents believe access to finance is set to become easier,"" Theochari said. 
The survey - which polled 200 respondents across the transport industry including companies, financiers and government entities - said rail and aviation prospects were better partly due to lower oil prices and more funding.
""Sentiment is high in the aviation and rail industries, buoyed by the expectation of increased passenger numbers,"" Theochari said. 

""However, shipping continues to feel the effects of overcapacity in many markets, and an increase in enforcement actions is widely predicted.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods fell in May on weak demand for transportation and defense capital goods, but growing order backlogs and lean inventories suggested the worst of the manufacturing downturn was probably over.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new orders for manufactured goods declined 1.0 percent after two straight months of increases. May's drop was in line with economists' expectations and followed a 1.8 percent increase in April.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft fell 0.4 percent in May instead of the 0.7 percent drop reported last month. These so-called core capital goods are seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans on equipment. 
Core capital goods shipments, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, dropped 0.5 percent in May as reported last month.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the report.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been squeezed by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undercut exports of factory goods, as well as efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory bloat. 
The sector has also been hurt by spending cuts by energy firms as they adjust to reduced profits from cheaper oil.
There are, however, signs the sector could be close to turning the corner. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey last Friday showed a gauge of national activity surged in June, with factories reporting strong increases in new orders, including exports, order backlogs and inventories.
But a stunning vote last month in Britain to leave the European Unions poses a risk to both manufacturing and the services sectors. 
A survey by the ISM last week found that, while most procurement executives do not foresee major disruptions, many were cautiously watching the situation closely and believed the so-called Brexit would hamper growth.
In May, orders for transportation equipment fell 5.7
percent, despite a 0.8 percent increase in demand for motor vehicles and parts. Defense capital goods orders tumbled 28.1 percent.
Orders for machinery, which have been hurt by weak demand in the energy and agricultural sectors, gained 0.3 percent. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components slipped 0.6 percent. Orders for computers and electronic products were unchanged.
Inventories of factory goods dipped 0.1 percent, suggesting factories were making progress in reducing the inventory bloat.
That could support future production at factories. Inventories have declined in 12 of the last 13 months.
The inventories-to-shipments ratio was at 1.36 in May, unchanged from April. Unfilled orders at factories increased

0.2 percent after rising 0.6 percent in April. They have increased in four of the last five months.

The Markit/CIPS UK services PMI eased to 52.3 in June from 53.5 in May, matching April's level which was the lowest since April 2013. That was below a median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a 52.7 figure.
The vast majority of responses from services companies - 89 percent - were received before it became clear on June 24 that Britons had voted to leave the EU.
The result sparked pandemonium in Britain's two main political parties and sent sterling to a 31-year low against the dollar.
The PMI survey, along with similar ones for manufacturing and construction, pointed to economic growth of 0.2 percent in the second quarter down from 0.4 percent in the first three months of 2016. But that was unchanged from its outlook in May.
""A further slowing, and possible contraction, looks highly likely in coming months as a result of the uncertainty created by the EU referendum,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at
Markit, which compiles the survey. ""More policy action is therefore likely in the coming weeks."" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Thursday said the economic outlook had deteriorated and it would likely need
further stimulus over the summer.
Growth in services activity over the second quarter as a whole was the weakest since the first quarter of 2013, Markit said.
A measure of business expectations fell to 66.4 in June from 70.8, it was its lowest level since December 2012. Markit said firms reported that uncertainty linked to the EU referendum had weighed on their activity outlook for the coming twelve months.
Employment growth also eased to its weakest since mid-2013.
Markit's composite index, including activity in the manufacturing, services and construction sector, fell to 51.8 in June from 52.9 in May, its lowest since March 2013.

Retail sales, a proxy for household spending, were up 0.4 percent in May month-on-month and 1.6 percent on a yearly basis in the 19-country currency bloc, Eurostat said, in line with market expectations.
The rise recorded in May is the highest of the year on a monthly basis, confirming a generally positive trend for sales in 2016 when they grew every month, except in March when consumers' purchases fell 0.6 percent.
Eurostat also revised up the monthly figure for April which now shows a 0.2 percent rise of retail sales, instead of the previous estimate of flat sales.
The higher sales were driven by consumers' increased purchases of so-called non-food products, a category including textiles, medical goods and electronic appliances, which recorded an 0.7 percent rise month-on-month.
Sales of fuel and food, drinks and tobacco products were flat in May. 
Among the largest euro zone economies, retail sales on a monthly basis rose 0.9 percent in Germany after two consecutive falls, while remained flat in France.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2016 05:05AM ET</span>",Brexit shakes faith in neighboring Irish services sector,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Business expectations in Ireland's services sector tumbled in June, a survey showed on Tuesday, as some firms expressed concern that Britain's vote to leave the European Union would lead to a slowdown in activity.
Sentiment slipped across sectors from tourism to telecommunications.
Ireland, Europe's fastest-growing economy, is considered to have more to lose than any fellow European Union member by its nearest neighbor and biggest trade partner's decision to quit the bloc both countries joined together 43 years ago. 
The Investec Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in services fell only slightly to 61.2 in June, from 61.7 in May, although most of the responses were given before the market turmoil that greeted Britain's referendum result.
However the sub-index measuring business expectations fell sharply to 68.4 from 77.0, the lowest mark since August 2013 when Ireland was coming towards the end of a three-year international bailout program. 
""Some panelists expressed concerns that Brexit would have a negative impact on activity, which is a view that we share,"" Philip O'Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, said of the survey which covers businesses from banks to hotels.
""We are unsurprised to see the unadjusted data suggest that, although still well in positive territory, confidence has fallen to a two year low in travel and leisure, and to three year lows in business services and technology, media and telecommunications.""
Almost one in five Irish services firms sell into the United Kingdom and O'Sullivan said he expected a further moderation in the rate of growth over the coming months at least. 
The main index has been above the 50 mark denoting growth for almost four years and June's reading remained both close to the 10-year high of 64.0 at the start of the year and comfortably above the euro zone average of 53.1.
""The survey confirms the rapid growth of the Irish economy in the period immediately prior to last month's Brexit vote,"" said Dermot O'Leary, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers.
""That said, given Ireland's close economic links with the UK, we can expect a further slowdown in the services sector over the coming months as the Brexit effects feed through to activity.""
Ireland's economy is forecast to grow faster than any other in Europe for the third straight year in 2016 at 4.9 percent, but the government has already cut its forecast for 2017 to around 3.4 percent from 3.9 percent and warned of worse ahead if Britain strikes an unfavorable post-Brexit deal with the EU.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS Services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 52.3 last month from a reading of 53.5 in May.
Analysts had expected the index to rise to 52.5 in June.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Worth noting, Markit noted that 89% of the surveys were submitted before the U.K. voted to leave the European Union (EU), known as a Brexit.
“The PMI surveys indicate that the pace of U.K. economic growth slowed to just 0.2% in the second quarter, with a further loss of momentum in June as Brexit anxiety intensified,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
This expert warned that a further slowing, or even contraction, was “highly likely in the coming months as a result of the uncertainty created by the EU referendum”.
Williamson added that the PMIs were already in territory general associated with the Bank of England cutting interest rates.
“It’s unlikely that policymakers will wait for more data before unleashing additional monetary stimulus,” he said, concluding that more policy action was “likely in the coming weeks”.
In an immediate reaction to the report, the pound moved back towards a 31-year low against the dollar. GBP/USD was trading at 1.3143 from around 1.3170 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8485 from 0.8469 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets traded lower, with London’s FTSE 100 falling 0.62%. The Euro Stoxx 50 lost 1.67%, France's CAC 40 traded down 1.56%, while Germany's  DAX shed 1.57%."

(Reuters) - Euro zone business growth held steady in June, underpinned by new business and employment, but the modest
pace suggested growth in the second quarter was half the rate of January-March.
Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 53.1 in June, beating a flash estimate of 52.8, but unchanged from May. It has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013.
The majority of the survey was completed before Britain voted to leave the EU on June 23, meaning the after-shocks of the referendum have yet to be reflected in the data.
""The survey is signaling GDP (gross domestic product) growth of just 0.3 percent, similar to the sluggish trend recorded over the past year,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.
Euro zone GDP expanded 0.6 percent in the first quarter.
While a late rise in new business, the sub-index for which climbed to 52.8 from a flash reading of 52.5, helped boost overall activity, the pace was still modest and several index points lower than levels seen towards the end of last year.
""The lack of any sign that the upturn is picking up speed will worry policymakers, especially as 'Brexit' uncertainty looks likely to subdue growth in coming months,"" Williamson said.
The survey showed companies once again cut prices in June in an effort to drum up new business. The output prices index fell to 49.1 from 49.3 in May.
That is likely to disappoint the European Central Bank, which after years of ultra-loose monetary policy, has failed to boost inflation anywhere close to its 2 percent target ceiling.
The euro zone just escaped deflation in June for the first time in five months, with prices up 0.1 percent on a year ago.
The price discounting, however, failed to improve the bloc's dominant service industry. The services PMI fell to 52.8 in June, its lowest since January 2015, from 53.3.
One silver lining in the survey was employment in services firms, which picked up pace in May, pushing that index up to 53.1 from 52.3. Barring a similar reading in December last year, it was the highest since November 2010.
""Although unspectacular, the steady growth of business activity in recent months has given increasing numbers of firms confidence to take on more staff, especially in Germany, Spain and Italy,"" said Williamson.

Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), tracking activity in manufacturing and services that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 54.4 from 54.5 in May.
The reading was higher than a preliminary estimate of 54.1 and comfortably above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
""Today's PMI numbers signal a note of caution for German service providers, with activity and new orders both rising at the weakest rates in roughly a year,"" said Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike.
He added that the transport and storage services sub-sector acted as a major drag on stronger growth.
The German economy grew 0.7 percent in the first quarter, more than doubling its growth rate and cementing its role as the euro zone's growth engine. Soaring private consumption and a construction boom more than offset a dip in foreign trade.
The government expects GDP to expand by 1.7 percent this year, on a par with last year.
""Confidence also remained at a historically high level, adding to hopes that economic growth will continue into the second half of the year,"" added Kolodseike.
The PMI sub-index for services fell to a 13-month low of 53.7 in June from 55.2 in May. Services providers continued to hire staff, making the rate of job creation the strongest so far this year.
The sub-index for manufacturing, which was published on Friday, showed rising domestic and foreign demand lifted German factory activity to a 28-month high in June.

Data compiler Markit said its purchasing managers index for services fell last month to 49.9 from 51.6 in May, dipping marginally below the 50-point threshold between an expansion and a contraction in activity.
The decline, which was unchanged from a preliminary reading, marked a retreat from the seven-month high seen the previous month.

Markit's composite PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 49.6 in June from 50.9 in May, marginally better than the 49.4 originally reported.
Markit said some service providers reported that waves of strikes last month over a contested labor reform had weighed on output, adding to their troubles coping with weak client demand.

Meanwhile, service companies continued to cut prices while their input prices rose, mainly on higher wages, squeezing their margins.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept interest rates at an all-time low of 1.75 percent on Tuesday, a widely expected decision given political uncertainty at home and abroad and a lack of timely data on domestic inflation.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its July policy meeting with no guidance on whether it might ease any further, disappointing some who had looked for an explicit easing bias.
""Further information should allow the Board to refine its assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation and to make any adjustment to the stance of policy that may be appropriate,"" was the dry conclusion of RBA Governor Glenn Stevens.
Political uncertainty at home and abroad had argued for keeping the policy powder dry for now.
Vote counting continues after elections in Australia, leaving the country without a government, while scars from Britain's decision to leave the European Union are still fresh.
Yet a Reuters poll of 37 economists [AU/INT] found the majority still looked for the central bank to cut in August, while markets put the probability at 50-50 <0#YIB:>.
With further easing seen likely in Europe and Japan and greatly diminished prospects of a tightening in the United States, the RBA will be under pressure to cut if only to limit any appreciation in the local dollar.
ALL EYES ON INFLATION
Official figures for second-quarter inflation are also due on July 26 and another weak reading would greatly bolster the case for another rate cut. Inflation has been running at just 1.5 percent, uncomfortably below the RBA's 2 to 3 percent target band.
The impact of poor pricing power was clear in the retail sector as data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed sales up a slim 0.2 percent in May, not much better than April.
That was disappointing given the retail industry has sales of A$290 billion a year and is the second biggest employer with 1.25 million workers. 
Fierce competition from new entrants from offshore has depressed prices for everything from food to clothes. That eats into dollar revenues even as more goods are sold. 
""I anticipate we'll be dropping prices over the course of the next 5 years,"" John Durkan, managing director of the giant Coles (AX:WES) supermarket chain said recently. ""I don't see prices increasing during that period.""
It is this disinflationary sea change that prompted the RBA to cut rates in May. 
Weak prices have also been a feature of Australia commodity exports in the last couple of years, with ample supplies hurting iron ore and coal in particular.
Yet the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on expanding mines means the country is shipping more of the stuff than ever, providing a crucial boost to real economic growth. Exports alone accounted for almost half the 3.1 percent growth enjoyed in the year to March.

Trade data for May out on Tuesday showed exports rose 1 percent as shipments of iron ore and coking coal both gained in the month. Exports to China were up almost 10 percent on May last year despite worries about sluggish growth there.

1678,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 05, 2016 12:33AM ET</span>","RBA holds steady at 1.75% as expected, notes financial volatility","Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia held the cash rate at a record low 1.75% as expected on Tuesday, citing volatile financial markets.
For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent.
The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Several advanced economies have recorded improved conditions over the past year, but conditions have become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. China's growth rate has moderated further, though recent actions by Chinese policymakers are supporting the near-term outlook.
Commodity prices are above recent lows, but this follows very substantial declines over the past couple of years. Australia's terms of trade remain much lower than they had been in recent years.
Financial markets have been volatile recently as investors have re-priced assets after the UK referendum. But most markets have continued to function effectively. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative. Any effects of the referendum outcome on global economic activity remain to be seen and, outside the effects on the UK economy itself, may be hard to discern.
In Australia, recent data suggest overall growth is continuing, despite a very large decline in business investment. Other areas of domestic demand, as well as exports, have been expanding at a pace at or above trend. Labour market indicators have been more mixed of late, but are consistent with a modest pace of expansion in employment in the near term.
Inflation has been quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some time.
Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 is helping the traded sector. Financial institutions are in a position to lend and credit growth has been moderate. These factors are all assisting the economy to make the necessary economic adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.
Indications are that the effects of supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards in the housing market. Separately, a number of lenders are also taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. Dwelling prices have risen again in many parts of the country over recent months. But considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities.
Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding monetary policy steady would be prudent at this meeting. Over the period ahead, further information should allow the Board to refine its assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation and to make any adjustment to the stance of policy that may be appropriate.

Overall net absorption increased by 5.4 million square feet of office space in the second quarter, a significant decline from an increase of about 11.6 million square feet in the preceding quarter, Reis said.
New construction of office space declined to about 6.9 million square feet in the second quarter, from about 7.7 million square feet in the first.

New York and Washington D.C. remained the tightest market, with both boasting a vacancy rate of 9.1 percent. The vacancy rate remained unchanged from the first quarter.
Both asking and effective rents increased by 0.6 percent in the latest quarter.

""If both the economy and the labor market stay the course, which is our general expectation, they should create an environment that pushes vacancy down toward 15.7 percent in 2016, while rent growth continues to accelerate toward 3.5 percent on an annual basis,"" Severino said.

The index fell below the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the first time in two months.
The index for new business fell to 47.3 from 50.4 in the previous month to reach the lowest since September 2011.
""A number of panelists blamed the appreciation of the yen against the dollar as a factor hampering sales, while some commented on the earthquakes that occurred back in April as still having a detrimental effect on demand,” said Amy Brownbill, an economist at Markit, adding that uncertainty about China's economy was also hurting business sentiment.
The composite index for output in both manufacturing and services fell to 49.0 in June from 49.2 in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, showing the fourth consecutive month of contraction.
Business confidence was subdued in the second quarter and consumer prices fell in May at the fastest pace in three years, data showed last week, heightening pressure on the Bank of Japan to expand quantitative easing.
The government is also seen increasing fiscal spending as weak overseas demand hurts exports, though critics warn that throwing more money into the economy won't fix chronic problems such as low productivity and a rapidly shrinking labor force.

Services accounted for 70.1 percent of Japan's gross domestic product, while manufacturing had a 18.7 percent share in 2014.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2016 10:10PM ET</span>",China service sector activity jumps to 11-month high: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, July 5 (Reuters) - Activity in China's services sector rose to an 11-month high in June, a private survey showed on Tuesday, diverging from struggling manufacturing in a trend that if sustainable would indicate Beijing is making progress in rebalancing the economy. 
However, a composite measure of activity fell to a four- month low, highlighting that a growing services sector may not be able to make up for a prolonged decline in the industrial economy that has pushed China's growth to 25-year lows. 
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) for June rose to 52.7 from 51.2 in May on a seasonally adjusted basis. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion on a monthly basis, while readings below signal contraction.
New business expanded at the fastest rate since July 2015, prompting services firms to hire more workers for the third month in a row, though the rate of job creation was moderate.
Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to pick up the slack as it shifts the economy towards stronger consumption and away from a dependence on heavy industry and manufacturing exports.
""Service sector growth is now supporting the overall economy, and the expansion for services is coming at a time when the manufacturing index is contracting, suggesting the nation’s economic structure is becoming more balanced,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group. 
""The government must continue to relax service sector controls to encourage its development and push forward the nation’s economic transformation.""
Despite strength in the services sector, however, the Caixin/Markit composite PMI covering both manufacturing and service activity fell to 50.3 in June, down from 50.5 in May and just above the neutral mark. 
The findings support concerns that strength in services will not be enough to backstop growth if manufacturing continues to decline, and analysts are raising expectations of more government spending and policy easing by the central bank.
A composite employment indicator showed companies shed jobs for the 13th straight month in June, though official data has shown no meaningful increase in unemployment. 
A stronger reading from China's official services PMI released on Friday appeared to be driven mostly by big gains in the construction industry, which may not be sustainable. 
Beijing has fast-tracked planned infrastructure spending this year to boost growth, and a strong run-up in housing prices as buying restrictions were loosened helped turn around a slowdown in property development. 
Factory surveys for June showed continued pressure on manufacturers, with uncertainty from Britain's vote to exit the European Union adding to the risks for China's struggling exporters.

The number of businesses pessimistic about the economy over the next twelve months jumped to 49 percent in the week following the referendum from 25 percent before the vote outcome, according to a survey conducted by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr).
Britain's vote to withdraw from the 28-nation club has prompted political chaos, a sharp drop in sterling and clouded the economic outlook. 
Against this backdrop, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said it would likely need to provide more stimulus to the economy over the summer.
""These figures .... suggest a significant shock reaction (to Brexit),"" Scott Corfe, director at Cebr said.
""Not only are businesses feeling much more pessimistic in general about the state of the economy, but their own expectations for domestic sales, exports and investments over the next 12 months have gone off a cliff."" 
The survey of 1,000 British-based companies also showed 26 percent of respondents were pessimistic about their own business outlook, up from 16 percent before the referendum.

Businesses are increasingly downbeat about their operations in the year ahead, with expectations for domestic sales, exports and capital investment all dropping sharply, it showed.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2016 03:20PM ET</span>",Canadian manufacturing growth slows in June,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The pace of growth in Canada's manufacturing sector stepped back in June as measures of output, new business and employment all fell, data showed on Monday, the latest sign Canada's economy is struggling to gain momentum.
The RBC Canadian Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, dipped to a seasonally adjusted 51.8 last month from 52.1 in May.
It was the fourth month in a row the index has been above the 50 threshold that indicates growth in the sector, but the latest reading signaled only a modest upturn and was the weakest pace of improvement since March.
Slower output growth was one of the major drags on the headline PMI. The output index fell to 51.5 from May's 11-month high of 52.8, as manufacturers reported softer client demand and efforts to reduce finished goods inventories at their plants.
New orders fell to 50.8 from 51.9, taking a further step back from a 16-month peak of 52.4 in April, and employment dipped to 52.0 from 52.2 as heightened uncertainty about the business outlook and a lack of pressure on operating capacity weighed.
A marginal upturn in overall new business volumes was indicated by manufacturers, but driven by domestic sales as new export work was broadly unchanged over the month.
""Currency weakness and stronger U.S. demand should drive further exports, however growing economic uncertainty means that the roller coaster we've experienced recently in the Canadian export market will likely continue,"" said Craig Wright, chief economist at RBC. 

The Canadian economy continues to struggle with the impact of cheaper oil, a major export for the country. Data released last week showed only modest growth in the economy in April after two months of declines, paving the way for a sickly second quarter on the back of the devastation caused by major wildfires in Alberta.

In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index fell to a seasonally adjusted 46.0 from May’s reading of 51.2.
Economists had expected the index to drop to 50.5 in June.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The reading was the first time since April 2013 that construction activity was in contraction and it was at its weakest level in exactly seven years.
Markit did point out however that the rate of contraction was much slower than that seen in 2008-2009 downturn.
Nevertheless, the report showed a sharp reversal in residential and commercial activity, while incoming new work declined at the steepest pace since December 2012.
Immediately following the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.3261 from around 1.3288 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8372 from 0.8361 earlier.

Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew 1.5 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter, down from a revised growth rate of 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. It was the slowest growth since 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2013.
The oil sector expanded 5.1 percent in the first quarter of this year as the world's biggest oil exporter increased its production of crude and exported more refined products.
But the non-oil sector shrank 0.7 percent, its worst performance in at least five years. This may be a source of concern to Saudi policy makers because an ambitious reform plan to help the economy cope with an era of cheap oil, announced last month, assumes rapid growth in non-oil businesses.
Last December, to curb an annual budget deficit of nearly $100 billion caused by slumping oil revenues, the government announced major cuts in spending and energy subsidies. More austerity measures are expected in the next few years.
Within the non-oil part of the economy, the private sector grew 0.2 percent in the first quarter while the government sector shrank 2.6 percent, the official data showed.
The weakness of the non-oil sector was partly due to the fact that the first quarter of 2015 was unusually strong; in January that year, King Salman awarded public employees two months' extra salary to mark his accession to the throne.

But the fourth-quarter 2015 growth rate of 1.8 percent was revised down sharply from an original estimate of 3.6 percent. Some analysts believe a similar revision is possible for the first-quarter figures.

(Reuters) - The pace of U.S. auto sales slowed in June compared to a year ago, as slumping sales of sedans offset strong demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles.
The seasonally adjusted annual sales pace for June was 16.66 million, according to Autodata Corp, down from 17 million vehicles a year earlier. Sales fell for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
GM, the biggest U.S. automaker, said its sales fell 1.6 percent to 255,210 vehicles in June due to lower sales of Buick and GMC vehicles as the company continued to cut lower-margin sales to U.S. rental car fleets. 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Nissan Motor Corp reported improved sales, mainly driven by demand for light trucks.
The latest results come as some industry forecasters are cautioning that U.S. vehicle demand is settling on to a plateau, albeit at levels that are strong by historical standards. However, industry executives remain upbeat.
GM Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem said historically low interest rates, stable fuel prices, rising wages and near-full employment would drive strong auto sales in the second half. 
 Ford Motor Co  said sales rose 6.4 percent as it sold more trucks, while higher demand for the Jeep brand pushed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sales up 7 percent.
""Consumer demand for Ford SUVs also continues to surge to all-time highs,"" Ford Vice President Mark LaNeve said.
Although the June results were below some forecasters' estimates, GM's shares rose 2 percent to $28.89 a share in trading Friday. Ford's shares rose 1.2 percent to $12.72, and Fiat Chrysler's were up nearly 2 percent at $6.24. Toyota Motor's U.S. Listed shares rose 1 percent.
Toyota reported a 5.6 percent fall in its June sales, primarily due to weaker sales of luxury sedans. German luxury automaker BMW AG suffered a nearly 12 percent sales decline.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity expanded at a healthy pace in June as new orders, output and exports rose, new industry data showed on Friday, providing another sign that U.S. economic growth was regaining its footing after weakness early this year.
Automakers reported higher June sales amid strong demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, but on an annualized basis, the June industry selling rate came in at 16.66 million units, well below May's sales pace of 17.45 million.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler reported June sales gains of 6.4 percent and 6.5 percent, but General Motors (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) all sold fewer vehicles.
Some analysts say that industry sales may have peaked in 2015 at 17.45 million units, but GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem still held out hope for another record year.
""Positive economic indicators like historically low interest rates, stable fuel prices, rising wages and near-full employment provide the environment for strong auto sales to continue in the second half of the year,"" Mohatarem said in a statement.
But the positive for manufacturing and autos was dampened by a second straight monthly drop in construction spending in May.
The weaker construction data could prompt some economists to trim back their second-quarter growth estimates and could help reinforce the Federal Reserve's view that there is currently too much uncertainty over global and U.S. growth to raise interest rates in the near term.
""Net-net it is a certainly a bit of a mixed picture, a mixed bag, but I think in terms of direction, what is evidenced here, is that growth momentum has rebounded,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
He added that a major ""asterisk"" to the improvement is that the data surveys predate Britain's vote last week to leave the European Union, which has injected a big source of uncertainty to the global growth outlook. 
The Institute for Supply Management said its national factory index rose to 53.2 in June, the highest since February last year, from 51.3 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The ISM new factory orders index in June showed a reading of 57.0 compared with 55.7 in May, while export orders showed 53.5 versus 52.5. The order backlog index rose to 52.5 from 47.0, while production rose to 54.7 from 52.6.
The employment index rose to 50.4 in June from 49.2 in May, for its first reading over 50 since November.
U.S. stocks rose after the ISM data, and major indexes all closed higher for the fourth day in a row, to recover nearly all of their sharp losses in the wake of the ""Brexit"" vote. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields fell, with the 30-year bond yield at its lowest since the 1950s.
While the International Monetary Fund anticipates that uncertainty over Britain's departure from the EU will dampen near-term global growth, it remains unclear how much Brexit might affect U.S. demand.
In addition to its factory index, ISM on Friday released a survey that showed 61 percent of businesses saw a negligible impact from Britain's EU vote for the remainder of this year. It showed only six percent forecasting a negative impact, and there was little difference between manufacturing and non-manufacturing firms. 
Manufacturing remains constrained by the lingering effects of the dollar's surge and the oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015. The sector has also been hurt by business efforts to reduce an inventory glut, which has curtailed orders.
CONSTRUCTION SLOWDOWN
The Commerce Department said on Friday that May construction spending fell 0.8 percent after a downwardly revised 2.0 percent drop in April. The revised April drop was the largest since January 2011.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.6 percent after a previously reported April drop of 1.8 percent. May construction outlays were up 2.8 percent from a year earlier.
May construction spending was held down by a 2.3 percent drop in public construction spending. Outlays on state and local construction projects, the largest of the public sector segment, tumbled 3.0 percent, while federal construction spending rose 7.5 percent.

Private construction spending fell by 0.3 percent after a downwardly revised 1.9 percent fall in April. Outlays on private residential construction were flat, while spending on private nonresidential construction was down 0.7 percent.
