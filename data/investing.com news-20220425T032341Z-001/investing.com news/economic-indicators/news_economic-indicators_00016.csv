2,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 28, 2014 01:30AM ET</span>",India’s Central Bank Raises Key Rate,"By Arjun Kashyap - India’s central bank, with an express aim to curtail runaway inflation, raised the key repo rate to 8 percent from 7.75 percent on Tuesday while choosing to keep the cash reserve ratio, or CRR, unchanged at 4 percent.
The Reserve Bank of India, or RBI, is attempting a monetary policy tightrope of using key interest rates to bring down near double-digit inflation while attempting to revive anemic growth in Asia's third-largest economy. The repo rate is the one at which the RBI lends to the country's commercial banks while the CRR is the percentage of cash reserves, in relation to total deposits, that banks need to maintain with the central bank.
“The slowdown in the economy is getting increasingly worrisome,” RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said in a statement, adding: “Our current assessment is that growth is likely to lose momentum in Q3 of 2013-14, with industrial activity in contractionary mode, mainly on account of manufacturing.”
The latest move was a surprise as most estimates expected the bank to keep rates on hold. The bank’s policy statement also noted that consumer demand remained weak even as weak capital goods production pointed to stalled investment demand while retail inflation remained close to double-digit levels.
However, Rajan picked out some positive signs such as a “significant narrowing of the trade deficit” backed by export growth and a robust performance by the agriculture sector. He added that further rate increases could be ruled out only if retail inflation would stay on track to fall below 8 percent by January 2015.
Rajan, a former consultant to the World Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board who, in 2005, famously predicted the global financial crisis, took over as head of the RBI in September 2013, at a time when India’s economic growth had fallen to its lowest rate in a decade.

Flash PMI Falls To 49.6 ,"By Jeff Perlah - For the first time in six months, China's factory sector activity contracted in January as new orders declined, an initial private survey pointed out on Thursday, Reuters reports. The contraction reveals that the slight deceleration at the end of 2013 continued into this year.
The flash Markit/HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) decreased to 49.6 in January from December's final reading of 50.5, Reuters notes. It was a drop below the 50 line separating expansion of activity from contraction.
It's the first indication of sentiment in the 56.9 trillion yuan ($9.4 trillion) economy for 2014, according to Reuters.
""The marginal contraction of January's headline HSBC flash China manufacturing PMI was mainly dragged by cooling domestic demand conditions,"" Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC, said.
""This implies softening growth momentum for manufacturing sectors, which has already weighed on employment growth,"" he continued. ""As inflation is not a concern, the policy focus should tilt towards supporting growth to avoid repeating growth deceleration seen in 1H 2013.""
The flash PMI showed a speedier rate of decrease in new export orders and employment in January. The new orders index came in at 49.8, the first contraction in six months.
Figures on Monday showed annual economic growth in the world's second-largest economy cooled to a six-month low of 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.
With the Chinese government interested in restructuring the economy and as exports stuttered, momentum has eased.

While the economy just barely missed expectations for full-year growth to fall to a 14-year low last year, some economists consider an addition slowdown to be a given as officials tackle tough reforms. Instead, China wants to embrace sustainable and higher-end development.
According to Reuters, that means cutting government intervention to let markets have more of a say in allocating resources, as well as promoting domestic consumption.
Full-year growth in China last year was 7.7 percent, consistent with 2012 and a little above market expectations for a 7.6 percent expansion -- which would have been the slowest since 1999.
PMI surveys at the end of 2013 had confirmed a slowing of momentum, with the HSBC/Markit one revealing a three-month low and the government's official PMI at a four-month low. Both pointed to weak new export orders as a primary reasons for the drop.
The HSBC/Markit PMI is more weighted toward smaller and private businesses than the official one, which contains more large and state-owned firms.
Asian stocks outside Japan fell prior to the release of data on manufacturing from China, according to Bloomberg. Japan’s Topix (TPX) index climbed for a third day as the yen extended losses, boosting the outlook for the country’s exporters.
The final HSBC/markit manufacturing PMI for January is due Jan. 30 and the official manufacturing PMI is schedule to be released Feb. 1.

Following a two-day meeting in Tokyo, Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda’s board maintained to its decision to broaden the monetary base by an annual 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen ($671 billion), Bloomberg News reported.
Considering a BOJ preferred inflation gauge that's more than half of its 2 percent pace target, analysts from firms such as HSBC Holdings Plc. and Daiwa Securities Co. have moved back forecasts for when the central bank could add to easing.
Before deciding on extra stimulus, policy makers may take the time to examine the sales-tax rise in April and trends in wages. 
Prior to Wednesday's decision, Naoki Murakami, chief economist at Monex Inc. in Tokyo and a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist, noted: “The BOJ doesn’t need to act now. Inflation is coming along in line with their forecast.”
Consumer prices excluding fresh food climbed 1.2 percent in November from the previous year, the speediest since 2008 and near the 2 percent target established a year ago.
For the final quarter of 2013, analysts estimate that inflation was 1.1 percent,  -- almost three times the 0.4 percent forecast by economists in an April survey in 2013, a separate poll showed.

Thanks to bad weather, a slow dollar and sweeping job cuts from large companies such as BlackBerry Ltd., (NASDAQ: BBRY) the Canadian unemployment rate is higher than the United States for the first time since the financial crisis. “If you think the U.S. jobs report was cold, Canada’s was a deep freeze,” wrote David A Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, a Canadian wealth management firm. The American economy added a disappointing 74,000 jobs in December. But Canada lost 45,900 – their worst rate in nine months. The Canadian jobless rate jumped to 7.2 percent, surpassing the American rate of 6.7 for the first time since September 2008. In response to the news, the Canadian dollar fell to just $1.0922 per U.S. dollar this morning, the lowest rate since 2009. “What is sure to catch the Bank of Canada’s eye is the employment to population rate,” Rosenberg said. It fell to just 61.6 percent from 61.8 percent, hitting its lowest since February 2012 . It is even lower than America’s 62.8 percent, which matches October as the lowest in the country since 1978. Ontario, the most populous province, saw most of the employment decline. The province’s jobless rate also jumped to 7.9 percent from 7.2 percent.  Alberta – home of the profitable oil sands – also lost a large amount. The public sector gained 18,200 jobs while private-sector firms cut 26,300 positions. But some analysts think this could be temporary. “December’s shocking decline in employment and hours worked probably had more to do with severe winter storms rather than the broader state of the economy,” wrote David Madani, economist at Capital Economics in Toronto, in a note Friday morning. This shows in certain sectors such as construction – which lost 14,000 jobs last month. “We suspect that this large negative shock will be reversed early this year,” he added. But factors besides the chilling temperatures also influenced the numbers. Retailer Sears Canada Inc.,(TSE:SCC) tech giant BlackBerry Ltd., (TSE: BB) and Potash Corp., (TSE:POT) the country’s largest fertilizer producer all announced year-end job cuts in December. Plus, major manufacturers around the country announced plans to close plants in the near future. "

135,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 10, 2014 10:30AM ET</span>",Just How Bad Was The December Jobs Report?,"By Moran Zhang - December’s much-weaker-than-expected job growth should be taken with a grain of salt, economists say, and one month worth of data should not stop the Federal Reserve from making another reduction of its asset purchases at the January policy meeting. The U.S. economy added 74,000 jobs in December, the smallest increase since January 2011, the Labor Department said Friday. That’s a far cry from the 196,000 jobs Wall Street expected. “It’s certainly disappointing, but I don’t think it’s indicative of what’s going on in the economy,” said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group. “I would expect when we get the revisions next month, and in particular when we get the annual benchmark revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job growth in December will look significantly higher.” November was revised to 241,000 from 203,000, while October's gain was unchanged at 200,000. December’s figures are a big disappointment, but the long-term trend remains steady. For all of 2013, the average pace of monthly gains was 182,000, down slightly from 183,000 in 2012, but higher than the 175,000 jobs added in 2011. The unemployment rate in December fell to 6.7 percent, the lowest since October 2008, as more people dropped out of the labor force. Economists were looking for the jobless rate to hold steady at 7 percent. The labor force participation rate, which gauges the proportion of the working-age population in the labor force, slipped to 62.8 percent, down 0.8 percent from a year ago, and the low since February 1978. Of the 74,000 jobs created in December, 55,000 were in retail, above its average of 32,000 in 2013. Healthcare was down 6,000, a huge drop from its 2013 average of adding 17,000 jobs. Manufacturing added 9,000 and construction was down 16,000. The unseasonably severe winter weather last month probably played a part in the disappointing December jobs number. BLS said 273,000 people didn’t work in December because of the weather, the most since 1977, and well above the 166,000 long-term averages for the final month of each year. “The 16,000 decline in construction payrolls and the dip in average weekly hours worked are … indications that bad weather played a role,” Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. Average hourly wages rose 2 cents to $24.17 while the average workweek dipped 0.1 hour to 34.4 hours. Six-Year Anniversary Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, released a new paper on Thursday detailing how the labor market fared since the Great Recession officially began in December 2007. December’s jobs report marks the six-year anniversary of the Great Recession’s beginning and the four-and-a-half-year anniversary of its end. According to Shierholz, the total “jobs gap”-- the number of jobs needed to return the U.S. economy to pre-recession health -- is 7.9 million jobs. The total “jobs gap”-- the number of jobs needed to return the U.S. economy to pre-recession health -- is 7.9 million jobs. Economic Policy Institute/ Heidi Shierholz  “At 200,000 jobs per month, pre-recession labor market conditions would not be regained for another five years,” Shierholz wrote. “To regain pre-recession labor market conditions in two years, we would need to add 400,000 jobs per month.” She also emphasized that most of the improvement in the unemployment rate since its peak of 10.0 percent in the fall of 2009 has not been driven by increased employment, but rather by potential workers dropping out of, or never entering, the labor force because job opportunities are very weak. Based on Shierholz’s calculation, if all of these missing workers were actively seeking work, the unemployment rate would be 10.3 percent instead of 7.0 percent (at the end of November 2013).  A key driver of this broad-based weakness is austerity in the public sector, Shierholz said.  A key driver of this broad-based weakness is austerity in the public sector. Economic Policy Institute / Heidi Shierholz Fed Tapering “I think the Fed made the correct decision [to start tapering at its December meeting]. Even including December, job growth over the past year or so has been pretty strong,” Faucher said. “I think the labor market is strong enough to withstand slightly higher long-term rates, particularly because the Fed is going to keep short-term rates low for another couple of years. And once we get the revision, it’ll look better.” The minutes from the Dec. 17-18 meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee, after which the central bank announced its plan to reduce monthly asset purchases by $10 billion to $75 billion, showed that many members wanted to “proceed cautiously” in the first cut to QE and that further reductions should be undertaken in “measured steps.” Faucher thinks the Fed will not respond to just one month of data. “When they decided not to reduce purchases in September, they’ve had a couple of good months but they decided to wait. So they did and they moved in December,” he said. “They are not going to freak out by one month’s data and they will continue to gradually reduce their purchases over the course of this year.” “At the end of the month we will have the first read on the four-quarter GDP, which I think will be a strong number. Given that, I would expect even with the weak December jobs report number, the Fed would reduce asset purchases again at its policy meeting later this month by another $10 billion,” Faucher said. The U.S. Senate on Monday voted 56 to 26 to approve Janet Yellen as the next Fed chair, after Ben Bernanke finishes his second term at the end of this month. Yellen, 67, has been the Fed's second-in-command since 2010. She is the first woman to lead the Fed in its 100-year history. As Bernanke’s successor, Yellen will face challenges including managing the process of ending quantitative easing, as well as deciding when and how to ease off short-term interest rates. Her first meeting as chair is scheduled for March 18-19. "

In the UK, the IP index remained unchanged in November from that of October, and rose by 2.5 percent in November compared to a 3.2 percent growth rate in the same period last year, data released by the Office for National Statistics, or ONS, showed. Analysts had expected IP to grow by 0.4 percent on a month-on-month basis and by 3.1 percent on an annual basis.    “The increase reflects rises of 2.8% in manufacturing, 5.6% in the water supply, sewerage & waste management sector and 2.4% in mining & quarrying. Offsetting these rises was a fall of 2.8% in the electricity, gas, steam & air conditioning sector,” ONS said.

164,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 10, 2014 12:00AM ET</span>",China's December Exports Slowed - Rosier 2014 Predicted ,"By Jeff Perlah. China's export growth slowed down more than was expected last month because of a higher comparison base a year earlier and a clampdown on speculative activities dressed up as export deals, thus failing to meet the official target on foreign trade, Reuters reported. However, as global demand increases, the 2014 outlook is predicted to be better. ""Exports weakened dramatically, but were close to the consensus. The data is positive for China and Asia sentiment as it alleviates concerns that China is slowing too sharply,"" Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist and strategist for Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong, said. Exports climbed 4.3 percent in December from the preceding year, noted the Customs Administration, easing from 12.7 percent in November and compared to market expectations of 4.9 percent, according to Reuters. Imports ascended 8.3 percent, speeding up from 5.3 percent in November and overshooting the same rate expected by the market, and that inspired the belief that domestic demand may very well hold steady even amid indications that the world's second-largest economy is losing momentum. The December trade surplus fell 24.3 percent from a year earlier to $25.6 billion, missing the forecast of $31.2 billion, the news service noted. For 2013, exports climbed 7.9 percent and imports rose 7.3 percent, making for a trade surplus of $259.8 billion -- up 12.4 percent from 2012. Uncertain global demand, a stronger yuan currency and rising labor costs have affected Chinese exporters, Reuters reported. However, analysts think sales can pick up to some extent this year because of increasing demand from the U.S. and Europe. China's combined exports and imports jumped 7.6 percent in 2013, missing the official target of 8 percent. In 2012, China missed a 10 percent annual growth target. The Chinese government doesn't set a target on exports. ""China's exporters are facing pressures from rising costs, including increasing labor costs and yuan currency appreciation,"" customs spokesman Zheng Yuesheng told a news conference. He said trade this year is entering a ""stabilization and development stage."" China's Commerce Ministry has expressed its commitment to sustaining consistent trade growth in 2014 and balancing the trade structure by increasing imports of raw materials and energy products, according to reports. ""The biggest surprise is December imports. This suggests China's domestic demand is continuing to improve,"" Sun Junwei, China economist at HSBC in Beijing, explained. ""We expect exports to show further recovery in 2014, but the magnitude would be small and at around 10 percent. Imports could be supported by steady domestic demand and are likely to grow around 8 percent this year."" "
